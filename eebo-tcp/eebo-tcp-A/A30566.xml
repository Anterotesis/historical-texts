         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </note> Reconciliation with God in Chriſt, and of the willingneſs of God and Chriſt to be Reconciled to Sinners; ſending his Meſſengers to invite, intreate, and beſeech in his Name; though there was ſomething elſe followed in the Chapter that I could
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44661:14"/>
willingly have handled: yet becauſe I would preſs on what hath been delivered about our Reconciliation with God in Chriſt, and urge it further with a ſuitable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I have pitched upon this text, wherein we have ſet forth the willingneſs of Chriſt to be Reconciled to Sinners: and a moſt gracious invitation of Jeſus Chriſt to poor Sinners to come in unto him, that they might have Reſt for their Souls. A Text that breatheth forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but mercy and goodneſs to Sinners, a Heart melting invitation. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.12. we have a propheſie, that Sinners ſhal come and flow together to the goodneſs; <hi>Or to the bountifullneſs,</hi> of the Lord, (as ſome of your books have it) ſurely if there be any Scripture, that holds forth the goodneſs, and bountifulneſs of the Lord to Sinners, ſo as to melt their hearts that they may flow unto it, it is this in the Text. This invitation of Chriſt, <hi>Come unto me, ye that are Weary and heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt,</hi> is that which hath been the Comfort of many a wounded Conſcience, of many a troubled Sinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having faſtned upon it, their Souls have been staied, and they have been kept from ſinking into the bottomleſs Gulf of diſpaire thereby. A Text that hath been of as great uſe unto afflicted Conſciences, as any in al the Book of God; If ever there were a Heart breaking Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, certainly here it is; <hi>Come unto me, ye that are weary and heavy Laden, &amp;c.</hi> It is in it ſelf an intire ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence if we take the 28. verſe, and no more; it is ful of abundance of ſweetneſs, and filled up to the top with the Grace and goodneſs of the Lord. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow, if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the dependence of theſe words on the former, (the words that go before) then you wil ſee, that there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a ſoul ſatisfying fulneſs of Mercy, and goodneſs in the Lord, held forth from this text: and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you (I queſtion not) have heard this Text often quoted; <hi>Come unto me, ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I wil give you Reſt</hi>; yet (perhaps) few of you have obſerved how theſe words come in, and have a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44661:14"/>
ſweet dependance upon the former. If you compare theſe words, with thoſe that go before, you ſhal ſee, that they are very heart breaking expreſſions. What did Chriſt ſay in the very verſe before? (I'll go no further.) <hi>Al things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are delivered unto me of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and no man knoweth the Son but the Father; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth any man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son wil reveal him</hi>; (and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) <hi>Come to me, all ye that are weary and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I wil give you Reſt.</hi> The Text ſeems to be ſo ful of ſweetneſs alone, that it is ſeldom obſerved how this comes in after it. But now, we ſhould look upon them thus, and conſider, that they are the words of Chriſt, Who after he had ſaid, Al things are delivered to me of my Fathet, and no man knoweth the Son but the Father, &amp;c. Immediately ſaies, Oh! <hi>Come to me, all ye that are weary and heavy Laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may obſerve in this dependance of the words on the former, theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt ſaith, That al things are delivered to him of the Father, and therefore come to me; this depends upon the beginning of the 27. verſe. <hi>All things are delivered to me of my Father</hi>; as if Chriſt ſhould ſay; Be it known unto you, poor troubled afflicted Sinners, that mourne under the weight and burden of your Sins, I have all things delivered by the Father to me, that is, al the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, al the Riches of Grace, all the treaſures; al the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Grace that is in the Father is given to me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to you, and al power is given to me of the Father to do good to poor troubled Sinners. And therefore come to me, Oh! come to me ye poor troubled and afflicted Sinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>No man knows the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father, ſave the Son, and he to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44661:15"/>
whom the Son will reveal him</hi>; that's the ſecond thing obſervable in the dependance, of theſe words on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: ſaith Chriſt, there is a moſt infinite communion between me and my Father, and I know fully whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in the mind of God the Father, what his Heart is towards ſinners; I know what his thoughts have been from al eternity about doing good unto poor Sinners: there is a moſt neer conjunction between me and my Father, and I alone can reveal the Father to poor ſinners that are in darkneſs, they can have God the Father made known to them by no means, but by me, there is no way for them to know, what is in the Heart of God the Father towards them but by me, and therefore, Oh! Sinners come to me. Here is the dependance of the words upon the former. Likewiſe conſider what follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. If the poor ſhould ſay, Oh! bleſſed Saviour, we are vild unworthy creatures, we lie under the weight and burden of the guilt of our Sins: and ſhal ſuch as we come to thee? Yea, ſaith Chriſt, notwithſtanding that, yet come to me. The word in the Greek here hath an emphaſis beyond that which you have in your Books; it is not <hi>Venice,</hi> that is uſually tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted come, but <hi>adeſte</hi>; it is a word exhortation, not a meer word commanding, but a word of Exhortation, as one friend calls to another in a familiar ſweet way, and ſaies, come hither: I come to thee, Oh! bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, (ſaith the poor Sinner) thou art the Holy one of the Father; thou art God bleſſed for ever, and how ſhould I be able to come to thee? now ſaith Chriſt, I am meek, and I am lowly, come to me, and I wil lay no further burden upon you, no other yoke upon you, I am meek and lowly, and I wil ſhew my ſelf to be meek and gentle, and loving to you; I wil not upbraid you; if you come, I wil not ſay to you, as <hi>Jeptha</hi> ſaid to the Elders of <hi>Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad,</hi> you did hate me and caſt me out, and why are you come to me in your diſtreſs? but if you come to me, you ſhal find reſt to your Soules, and be ſure that whatſoever yoke ſhal be layed upon you, it ſhal be but an eaſie yoke,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44661:15"/>
and whatſoever burden ſhal be layed upon you, it ſhal be but a light burden. And thus you have the dependance of the words, and the ſcope of them.</p>
               <p>Now further for the meaning of them; come to me, ye that Labor. The word tranſlated here [<hi>Labor</hi>] is (I think) in ſome of your books [<hi>Weary</hi>] al ye that are weary. And it ſignifies a cutting Labor, it comes from a word that ſignifies to cut; any kind of trouble or vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is upon ones ſpirit that is cutting; a cutting trouble; ſomtimes it is uſed for any kind of trouble in the world; as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, for they reſt from their Labors</hi>; from al their trouble and affliction; Al you that Labor and are heavy Laden; the word comes from a word that ſignifies the Lading of a Ship, ſuch a loade that would load a Ship: heavy laden, this is the meaning of the words. You that are under ſuch afflictions of ſpirit, as you are even cut again; you that Labor under the trouble, anguiſh, and ſorrow of your hearts. And then you that are under ſuch a burden, that even would lade a Ship; that is ready to ſink your ſouls down into the bottom of diſpaire; you that are in ſuch a condition, come to me; you that can find no reſt any where elſe, come to me, and I wil give you reſt. So that here in verſ. 28. You have theſe three things for the diviſion of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The diſcription of thoſe whom Chriſt would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to himſelf</hi>; what kind of people they are; or the condition of ſuch as are invited and required to come to Chriſt; the ſubject, <hi>Such as Labor, and are heavy Laden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſweet and gracious invitation of Chriſt to ſuch [Come to me]</hi> come to me you that do thus Labor, and are thus heavy Laden. And,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44661:16"/>3. <hi>A Gracious promiſe unto ſuch as come unto Chriſt; that Chriſt wil give reſt unto their Souls.</hi> Theſe are the three things in verſ. 20.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; I ſhall only ſpeak of that at this time; though the other two are the Chief that I do intend. And I ſpeake of the firſt only, as making way unto the other two that follow. For the reaſon why I choſe this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was to draw the Soul unto Chriſt, and to open the riches of this promiſe of rest; to ſhew what reſt the Soul ſhal have in <hi>Chriſt that doth come</hi> unto him.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Such as Labor and are Heavy Laden, under the burden of the righteouſneſs of the Law.</hi> So <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> carries the text. Thoſe that heretofore have ſought

righteouſneſs by the Law, and find it very burdenſom to them; they that are toyling, and laboring, to get peace and reſt unto their ſouls by the works of the Law, but find themſelves tyred, find that peace and reſt doth not come that way, are even toyled and tyred and do (as it were) ſtick in the mire but yet find no peace nor reſt that way. Now ſaith Chriſt unto them, come unto me; as if he ſhould ſay; This is not the right way to get true peace and reſt to your ſouls, to think to bring it about by the works of the Law; you may toyl, labor, performe duties, and not dare to do any thing againſt your conſciences; be very ſtrict in your lives, be ſtriving to do more and more; And yet this wil not bring true reſt and peace unto your ſouls; you wil never have peace and reſt through the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law; you muſt have it by me. There are many whoſe conſciences God hath begun to enlighten, to ſee that there is an evil in Sin, that ſin wil bring death, that it doth endanger their ſouls of damnation eternally, they are convinced of this; and that they might have peace with God, is the thing their ſouls doth much deſire. O! that they might have the pardon of ſin, and peace with God. O! that they might have their conſciences quieted; God doth awaken the conſciences of many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who yet have no ſaving grace; and they ſpend a great deal of time in laboring, and taking much pains to get their Conſciences quiet; there is many that have been divers years laboring, and taking paines to get their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to be quiet, and cannot, but their conſciences ever and anon wil be flying in their faces, &amp; troubling of them, and yet they are ſuch people, as dare not commit any known ſin; dare not neglect any known duty, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in prayer in ſecret, attend upon the word. And whenſoever they heare of a duty that they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, they labor to ſet upon it withal their might: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! they feel little ſweetneſs and comfort in their duty; only conſcience hales them to it, and tells them, that they muſt do it, and if they do neglect it conſcience
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44661:17"/>
flyes in their Faces, and tells them they muſt periſh eternally, and they ſeek therefore to pacify their Conſciences only by the performance of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and by their obedience to the Law, and ſo ſeek it by the righteouſneſs of the Law; that's the only way that they do take to pacifie their Conſciences, and get reſt and peace unto their ſouls.

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>Is this the Law of God? is God ſo hard to his Creature as to command that which he gives no ability to perform?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt know, that God did once give ſtrength to perform Duties: but certainly now the Law of God commands Duties, but gives no ſtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them: there is no ſtrength enabling us to perform duties, until the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt doth come into the Soul; we may perform the outward part of them, but not perform duties in ſuch a ſpiritual manner, that they ſhould be ſuitable to our hearts, ſo as to bring eaſe and quiet unto our ſouls; and though the ſoul do ſeek to get reſt, and eaſe to it ſelf, yet it wil not come that way.</p>

                  <p>Secondly: <hi>The Law requires perfect obedience in every thing,</hi> and denounceth a Curſe againſt him that doth not continue in every thing that is written in the Law to do it. Now when men and women are ſeeking to get reſt to their ſouls by the works of the Law, they cannot perform duties as they ought; and therefore they have no reſt, but they ſee the Law to condemn them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not perform duties in a perfect manner; and yet they think they muſt go on, and do as wel as they can: I, but ſtill Conſcience hath matter to accuſe them of; you have not done enough, you ſtill come ſhort, and though you do ſome duties, you neglect other duties: ſo that Conſcience hath them at advantage every day, and they are continually under the bondage of an accuſing and condemning Conſcience, that they can have no reſt to their ſouls; they perform duties, but queſtion with themſelves, how can I know that the infinite, holy God wil accept of what I do? and although they may get quiet for a little while, yet Conſcience comes upon them again, and diſquiets them, and caſts fears and doubts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And beſides, Whiles the ſoul goes on to ſeek quiet and reſt by the works of the Law, <hi>there is an unſuitableneſs between the duties that are performed, and the heart of ſuch a man or woman</hi>; ſo that the very works that they do, and duties they perform, are grievous and tedious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

them. I, but now ſaith Chriſt, O! Come to me, ſuch as theſe are; Is there any of you that have had your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences troubled, and have deſired, O! that there might be peace between God and my ſoul, that I might have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods Love? what courſe have you taken to get it? have you not ſought to bring it about by the works of the Law, and have thought to get reſt and peace to your ſouls that way? Indeed, it is better to go on that way, than in the waies of ſin; but to think to have reſt and peace that way, hath a great deal more evil in it than you are aware of; if men ſhal think to quiet themſelves that way, and thereby put off the Righteouſneſs that comes by Faith, they may come to be hardened before they be aware. But is there any of you that are ſeeking reſt and peace unto your ſouls in ſuch a way by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law? ſaith Chriſt, know, That this is not the way for you to have reſt to your ſouls; it's true, you muſt abſtain from ſin, and perform duties; O! but if you would have reſt to your ſouls, you muſt come to me, it is by the ſouls rowling of it ſelf upon the perfect righteouſneſs that there is in Jeſus Chriſt, that only can bring true reſt unto the ſoul. Many a poor ſinner that hath been ſeeking reſt many years, hath not got it; but when the Lord hath been pleaſed to come in with one promiſe of the Goſpel, ſetting it home upon their ſouls, they have got more reſt and quiet to their ſouls in one day, yea, in one hour, than they did before in many years; there is a great deal of art and skil to get reſt and quiet to the ſoul that is troubled. The Goſpel is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in this thing; and when God acquaints the ſoul with the myſtery of the Goſpel in this thing, then reſt comes on in a ſweet and gracious manner. It's true, it is the hardeſt thing in the world for to cloſe with Chriſt, and to get true eaſe and reſt to the ſoul, it is hard in it ſelf til God make known the myſtery of Faith to the ſoul, but when that is done, then the ſoul finds abundance of eaſe and reſt, and that in a little while. As it is with a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44661:18"/>
man that thinks by main ſtrength to do ſome work that indeed can only be done by Skil and Art; he may be toyling, laboring, and tiring himſelf; but yet cannot do it; whereas another man that underſtands the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, he comes in, and in a little time by his skil and art can do that with eaſe, that the other man was toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and laboring about, a long while and yet could not do it. As you know in al Trades that have a miſtery in them. You that are Navigators that underſtand the miſtery of that Art; if any unskilful man ſhould come, and think to do ſome of your work by his main ſtrength; he may labor and toyl even his Heart out, and not do that work that you can do eaſily in a little time. So many poor Souls are laboring, and toyling that theſe troubled Souls of theirs might be but quiet; they are laboring, and they wil perform duties, and faſt, and pray ſo many times in a day, and ſo go on in a tireſome way, whereas after the Soul comes to be acquainted with the miſtery of the Goſpel, that it hears the voice behind him as it were ſaying come to me. And the Soul being inabled to anſwer to the cal, and to come to Chriſt; it doth now perform duties as much as it did before, and makes conſcience of them as much as it did before, but now they come to do them in another manner than they did before, and they come to be eaſie to them over that they were before, and they come to have reſt to their Souls notwithſtanding their imperfections in duties. When you went to prayer; indeed ſomtimes when your Hearts were much inlarged in Prayer, and your thoughts were taken up wholly with the duties that you were performing; then you thought you had ſome comfort, but when you had any wandring thoughts and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Prayer, then you roſe up with a mighty troubled Spirit, and could have no reſt al the day long. Now when you come to be acquainted with the miſtery of God in Chriſt, though there be many imperfections in your duties, yet then you ſhal find reſt unto your Souls,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44661:19"/>
notwithſtanding all your imperfections. But that wil come to be more clearly opened when we come to that [and I wil give you reſt] Thoſe that have labored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the righteouſneſs of the Law, and find it toylſome and exceeding burdenſom to them; Chriſt calls them to come to him that they may have reſt.</p>

Oh! if I had but good friends, I ſhould be happy; or if I had but an Eſtate I ſhould be wel. But if thy poverty did work upon thy heart kindly, it would drive thee to Chiſt, and make thee to ſay, true I am poor in this world; but there is enough in Chriſt to make me Rich; there is mercy enough in Chriſt to make my life comfortable, to make me who am for the preſent in a miſerable Condition, happy for ever.

But now thoſe that are burdened with ſin in ſuch a manner as the Lord doth uſe to prepare the heart for his Sonn by; they feel the weight indeed of it, but ſo feel the weight as they labor, that is, their hearts are yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſtirring and working, attending ſtil upon any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that God hath to give them out of his word, their hearts do keep active and crying to God and waighting to know what the mind of God is towards them, and are willing to do any thing that God ſhal require of them, they do not lie Sullen and dead as it were under the burden of their Sinns. Now if there be any Soule in this condition expreſſed in the nine particulars before mentioned, if there be any ſuch as theſe, Know, that theſe are they that Chriſt doth in a more eſpecial manner cal unto, and Saith; <hi>Come to me yee that are thus weary and heavy Laden and I wil give you reſt.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Two Cautions touching the Burden of ſin, <hi>1.</hi> That 'tis no condition of the Covenant of Grace. <hi>2</hi> That it doth not intereſt the ſoul in Chriſt, nor give it reſt in him. Whereunto certain Conſequences are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW I muſt lay down two Cautions before I come to give the Reaſons of the Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>What do you ſpeak of theſe burdens, of the neceſſity of the ſouls being burdened with the weight of ſin, that it may come to Chriſt for eaſe and reſt? ſurely there is no ſuch thing required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, That al this burden of the ſoul for ſin, is not any Condition of the Covenant of Grace, that muſt be granted; there is no other Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but beleeving in Chriſt; it is not looked upon as a Condition.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, you muſt know, That all this burden of the ſoul for ſin, it doth not intereſt the ſoul in Chriſt, nor give it reſt in Chriſt. I may be thus bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened for ſin, yet except I do beleeve indeed, that there be an act of faith beyond this, I ſhall not obtain reſt. Then hence, we muſt not ground our faith upon being burdened for ſin, to think, becauſe we are burdened, therefore we ſhal be pardoned and ſaved; we muſt not lay the ſtreſs and weight of our faith, upon the feeling the weight of our ſin, that which we muſt pitch our faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not our trouble, the trouble of our ſouls for our ſins; but thoſe troubles that the ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44661:24"/>
ſuffered for ſin. It is a note of great uſe, and I beſeech you obſerve it; you muſt know this, That when your hearts are troubled for ſin, you muſt not think that this is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace; nor you muſt not make this the object of your faith, as to think thus, becauſe I am thus troubled, therefore I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that my ſin is pardoned, no, I muſt not pitch my faith upon my own trouble, but upon the trouble of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; thoſe troubles that the ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt did endure by way of ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Firſt: Then hence will follow, That it is not any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of trouble for ſin, how much ſoever one hath been troubled for ſin, or how little ſoever that gives them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or not intereſt in Chriſt. I ſay, it is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it; for certainly if we could come to Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any burden or ſence of our ſin; if it were poſſible that we could come to Chriſt (I ſay) without any ſuch being burdened for ſin, we might; but becauſe that Jeſus Chriſt doth work upon the heart in a rational way, as a rational Creature, although he doth work above Reaſon, and conveys ſupernatural Grace that is beyond Reaſon; yet ſtill he doth work upon the heart as a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature. Now therefore the work of Reaſon muſt be made ſubſervient to the work of Gods Grace, uſually, when the Lord works upon a ſoul, he makes uſe of the work of Reaſon, to make that ſubſervient to the Work of his Grace. Now becauſe no man can come to a Savior, but he muſt know what need he hath of a Savior; therefore if I come to Chriſt as a Savior to ſave my ſoul from ſin, I muſt apprehend what ſin is, that I may be ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly: If God doth work upon the ſoul as a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creature, then he makes uſe of this to be a means to ſtop the ſoul in the courſe of ſin; for before the ſinner is made ſenſible of the evil of his ſin, he goes on in a full carear as it were, and nothing wil ſtop him in his courſe. But now when the ſoul comes to be thus burdened, the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44661:24"/>
ſoul it ſtopped, and doth not run in that full ſtream of wickedneſs as it did before, and that is one good means to help the ſoul towards Chriſt, the very ſtopping of it in the courſe of ſin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: This is the means in a Rational way to make the ſoul attend to any call of Chriſt, for before Chriſt may call to ſinners out of his Word, Come to me, and beleeve in me, but they do not feel the burden of their ſin, and therefore they do not come; if a man be under a heavy burden in a dark night, if he hears the leaſt noiſe of the feet of any man, then he cries out for help. So the ſoul under the heavy burden of ſin, doth rejoyce to hear of any direction out of the Word to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: The ſoul comes to prize mercy, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will take a deep impreſſion upon the heart that is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened; when the heart is burdened with ſin; Oh, how dear, and ſweet, and precious, are mercies then.</p>
               <p>Fiftly: And further, When the ſoul is burdened with ſin, it is in a Rational way prepared to take the yoak of Chriſt. Before it did caſt it off, but now feeling ſin to be a heavier burden than any other whatſoever, it is more prepared to take upon it the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt; now when the ſoul is under this burden, then Chriſt calls in love to eaſe and give reſt to thoſe ſouls that are under ſuch a burden.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Reaſons of the former Doctrine. <hi>1.</hi> Chriſt hath all mercy in him. <hi>2.</hi> The end why he came into the world, was to give reſt to burdened ſouls. <hi>3.</hi> Chriſt himſelf was once under ſome kind of this burden. <hi>4.</hi> He is to have the glory of all the eaſe which is given to ſinners.</p>

               <div n="1" type="reason">
                  <head>REASON I.</head>
                  <p>Firſt: Becauſe that all is given to Chriſt; Chriſt hath all the mercy of the Father in him; for the fulneſs of the Godhead dwels in him, and therefore he muſt needs pitty ſuch a ſoul. There is a Law in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> That if a Beaſt be under a burden, and ready to periſh, God requires that you ſhould not withdraw your ſelf from the Beaſt, though it be the Beaſt of your Enemy, but to help it. Now if God would have us to be ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful (who have but drops of mercy in us) when we ſee a beaſt, and that of our Enemies, under a Burden, Then ſurely the Lord Chriſt that hath the fulneſs of the mercy of the infinite God in him; when he ſhall ſee an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul under ſuch a burden, and ready to periſh, and it cries to him for Help, certainly Chriſt will eaſe and help that ſoul.</p>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:44661:25"/>
                  <head>REASON II.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, We know that Chriſt came into the world on purpoſe, Chriſt was anointed and ſent for that end to bind up the broken hearted and give them eaſe; Chriſt is deſigned by God the Father for this very work, and therefore he wil do it; he is appointed by God the Father for to eaſe burdened Souls, it is his work; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt ſees any poor ſoul burdened under ſin, ſaith Chriſt, here is work for me; <hi>He came not to cal the Righteous, but ſinners to Repentance,</hi> Here is that that I came from Heaven for, it is the very buſineſs that I was ſent from my Father to do; it is the work my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent me into the world for.</p>

               <div n="3" type="reason">
                  <head>REASON III.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt himſelf once felt ſome burden of this kind, and he knows what it is to be burdened with Sin, <hi>He was made ſin for us,</hi> So the Scripture ſaith in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. He was made Sin; Chriſt had the weight of al the Sins of the Elect upon him, and did feel what the weight of ſin was. Chriſt hath experience what it is to be burdened with ſin, and with the wrath of God the Father for ſin. Certainly when Chriſt lay groveling with his Face upon the ground and ſweated drops of blood then he was under a great burden. Chriſt had the great burden of mans ſin upon him, and of the wrath of God that was due to mans ſin, and he had it upon him til he ſweat under it; Now Chriſt himſelf having been under it; certainly he cannot but pitty poor burdened Sinners.</p>

               <div n="4" type="reason">
                  <head>REASON IV.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is Chriſt that is to have the Glory of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44661:26"/>
eaſe of ſin, and thoſe ſouls that are burdened for ſin, if ever they have eaſe; they wil give the Lord Jeſus al the Glory. Now firſt Chriſt having al the Mercy of God the Father, and being ſent into the world to bind up al broken hearts, and having experience of the burden of ſin. And fourthly knowing that he ſhal have al the Glory, in delivering and eaſing of Souls; certainly Chriſt doth account it worth al his ſufferings, that he might have the Glory in eaſing of troubled Souls, as many Chyrurgions account it to be their Glory, to have the Honor of curing deſperate cures; the Lord Jeſus wil Glory in this to al eternity. When al the poor burdened Souls that ever he did eaſe ſhal be brought before him, and ſhal be acknowledged before God and his Angels. Oh! here are thoſe, many thouſand Souls that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their burdens, and were ready to periſh and I have eaſed them, and here they ſhal reſt from al their labors for ever; Chriſt cals Sinners upon theſe gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <div type="part">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>NOw for a word of Application: doth Chriſt cal for burdened Souls; to come to him that they may have reſt? Then thoſe that are burden'd ſhould harken to what Chriſt ſaith in this Congregation this morning; Is there any poor ſoul that is ready to periſh under the weight of ſin, that goes under the Load of it; Chriſt cals to that Soul to come to him. It were a grievous thing for Chriſt to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44661:26"/>
come and cal into ſuch a Congregation, and there ſhould be none there. Nay, I cannot but think, there may be many in this Congregation that ſhal hear the cal of Chriſt. Chriſt many times cals where there are none to anſwer: we may ſay in this caſe as our Saviour Chriſt ſaid in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the harveſt is great, but the Laborers are but few; So we may ſay, the harveſt of ſin is great, but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers under the burden of Sin, are but very few: many there are that would caſt the burden of ſin upon Chriſt, but they do as the Phariſees did, caſt heavy burdens upon others, but they themſelves wil not touch them with one of their fingers. So many would caſt the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſin upon Chriſt, but they will not feel it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. O! let me ſpeak to you, What Chamber, or Cloſet can witneſs that you have been ſending ſtrong cries unto God, as being under that grievous burden. A beaſt if it lies under a burden, it wil roar and cry out for help. So certainly if your ſouls were preſt with the burden of ſin, there would be mighty cries to God to eaſe you of that burden: But to moſt people in the world, ſin is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light: Well, know, That as Chriſt himſelf felt ſin to be a heavy burden, ſo one way or other they muſt feel it, either here, or hereafter; but bleſſed is that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that feels the weight of ſin while he may be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it, that he be not hereafter preſt under the weight of it. We read of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> when the people of Iſrael came for eaſe, he bids them go to their burdens; that, that he did unjuſtly, Chriſt might do to many righteouſly hereafter, when you upon your ſick beds, or death beds hereafter, ſhal cry for mercy, Chriſt may ſay to you, go to your burdens; when any thing of the Word came to preſs ſin upon your ſouls, you caſt it off. O! 'tis a dangerous Condition, when men and women cannot only ſin enough: but now when any truth of God ſhould lay ſin upon their hearts, they caſt it out, and they think hardly of thoſe Truths of God that would come and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ind their ſins to their Conſciences, and ſo burden
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44661:27"/>
them with their ſins; but it ſhould be otherwiſe with us. If thoſe that be thus laden with their ſins, be thoſe that Chriſt doth call to him, we ſhould not think ſo hardly of thoſe Truths of God that doth reveal the evil of ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, but rather let us joyn with thoſe Truths of God, and labor to burden our own hearts; for you ſee that thoſe that are burdened, Chriſt cals them to him that they might have reſt; there is no other burdens that we are to bring upon our ſelves, but rather ſeek to avoid them; but as for the burden of ſin, we are to burden our hearts with that, and to labor to lay our ſins to our hearts, and to preſs them there, and to charge them upon our own Spirits with all the aggravations we can, and to joyn with the work of Gods Spirit, when the Spirit of God comes to lay ſin upon the ſoul, to joyn with it, and to ſay, Lord, I begin to be more ſenſible of my ſins, than I was before, Lord, humble me through it, let me be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy hand as long as thou pleaſeſt, only work thy good work upon me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you wil ſay; <hi>We may ſink under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Sin.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> O no; thoſe that caſt off the burden of ſin they are moſt like to ſink under it; now can you think that the Lord wil Suffer ſuch a ſoul to ſink under the burden, that doth burden it ſelf, that God might have glory: But thoſe that are unwilling, and are forced to be burdened, that never are ſenſible of the burden of ſin, til al the props and Comforts of the creature are taken away. Upon their ſick beds, and death beds, then men are burdened with Sin, and why? becauſe the props are taken away; before they had comforts, and eſtates, and ſuch things which are as ſo many props; but now God comes and takes the props, and down they f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44661:27"/>
the Lord hath cut aſunder the props, and now it lies hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon their hearts. Now Chriſt cals; come to me you that are weary and heavy laden; come to me ſaith Chriſt, Know that you are in a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> better condition, than you were, when you went on with delight in ſin; you are now in the way that God doth uſe to bring them in, that he hath a purpoſe to do good unto: I remember in the Goſpel where the poor blind man cryed to Chriſt, <hi>O Son of David have mercy upon me,</hi> and ſtil cryed; at length Chriſt heard the cry of the blind man and asked what it was? Now thoſe that were by him, they go to the poor blind man and ſay to him, be of good comfort, he calls; he might ſay; I, but my eyes be not opened; I, but be of good comfort he calls. So I ſay to al burdened Sinners; be of good comfort troubled ſoul, Chriſt calls thee; he ſaith come to me al ye that are weary, and heavy laden; he doth not ſay, thou that art ſo much laden; Chriſt cals thee to him.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>I but</hi> (thou wilt ſay) <hi>I have no eaſe, if I were ſure that my ſins were pardoned, &amp;</hi> I <hi>ſhould be ſaved, then I ſhould have eaſe and comfort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I but poor ſoul be of good comfort, thou art called; he doth not ſay, thou art a wretched wicked crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and depart from me thou curſed, as he wil ſay to ſinners hereafter; that might have been thy condition; but thou didſt not heare the voice from Chriſt this day, depart from me: but thou doeſt heare this voice this day from Chriſt, <hi>Come to me al you that are weary and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy laden</hi>: Chriſt is neer to you; the Lord is neer to the broken heart; he is neere to the contrite ſpirit. And know this, the longer thou art under the burden of thy ſin, there wil come the more comfort hereafter. Now there is a burden of ſin upon thee, and there wil be a weight of glory, hereafter; So the Scripture ſpeakes of a weight of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44661:28"/>
glory, as wel as of a weight of Sin, be willing to beare the weight of ſin quietly; ſay with the Prophet, I wil be willing to beare the indignation of the lord becauſe I have ſinned againſt him. So ſay thou: 'tis fit my ſoul ſhould beare a burden, be content to wait now, do you the ſame thing that Chriſt did when he was under his burden: mark what he did in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.

               <p>Now for the burden of the Law; That the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a burden wil appeare by that expreſſion which you have in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>For ſin ſhal not have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over you, for you are not under, the law, but under grace</hi>; He Speakes to thoſe that were delivered, and faith, they were not now under the Law, there was a time indeed that they were under the law; the Law lay upon them as a heavy burden; but they came afterwards under grace, &amp; they had a yoke there alſo (even grace it ſelf brings ſome kind of yoake) but not ſuch a yoake as the Law doth. Chriſt himſelf ſaith, take my yoak preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but the yoke is very eaſie in compariſon of the yoke of the Law.</p>
               <p>Now that I might open what the burden under the Law is; which if a ſinner comes to underſtand, any ſoul once comes to underſtand; it is impoſſible but it muſt be laden and burdened; it wil be a load upon them, a heavy load to thoſe that underſtand it; even the burden of the law. Therefore for the underſtanding of it which I look upon as exceeding neceſſary, or elſe you cannot underſtand Chriſt aright; for it is not enough for us barely to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Chriſt; but we muſt underſtand Chriſt as one that is the great Saviour, to deliver us from the Law; one that comes to give reſt and eaſe to us from the Law; Now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we underſtand the yoke, and burden of the Law, we cannot underſtand the worth of Chriſt in comming to give us eaſe and reſt from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then I ſhal endeavour to ſhew what the yoke and burden of the Law is. And then what is the burdenſom Condition of the Soul that ſeeks after Righteouſneſs by Legal performances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:44661:29"/>In the firſt place, the Law requires of us ſuch things <hi>that we are not able poſſibly to performe</hi>; it requires things of us that we cannot do; you wil ſay that is a greivous burden indeed, to be put upon that that we cannot do: now the Law doth ſo onely at the firſt, that you may not think it hard it doth not put you upon any thing that God did never inable you to do, for that you would ſay were hard, and how could God juſtly do it; but it puts you upon that which now you cannot do; but you have brought this [<hi>cannot</hi>] upon your ſelves; it would not have been any burden, to <hi>Adam,</hi> as God made man firſt in innocency, there the Law could have bin no burden: but now as we are fallen Conſider what our Condition is now, and it is a greivous burden, for it puts us upon that which we cannot do, al the ſtrength that we have ſhould it be put forth to the performance of the Law, yet we could not do it; but we muſt not think that becauſe we have loſt our power, therefore Gods Law ſhould not goe on; the law hath its courſe whether we have power, or no power, becauſe God gave it us, and we have loſt it, this I take to be the meaning of that Scripture in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>Now therefore why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples which neither our fathers, nor we were able to beare</hi>; The law is ſuch a yoke which neither we, nor our fathers were able to beare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I: But it may be ſaid, <hi>this is meant of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, Certainely, if the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law were a yoke, then take al together Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and moral and it was greater; take meerly the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of outward Ceremonies, and it was not ſuch an intolerable yoke; but we muſt take the whole Law in the latitude of it, &amp; that wil appear to be the meaning; for the queſtion was here, not only about the ceremonial law; but about <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in general, and about juſtification by it: this was the Queſtion that the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſent to the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be informed about, for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44661:30"/>
this was al the Sinod that was here in <hi>Acts,</hi> 15. there were Certain men came from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> and there taught, that they muſt ſtil of neceſſity keep <hi>Moſes</hi> Law for juſtification. Now the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> being troubled that ſome ſhould come from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and teach this doctrine amongſt them; they Sent certain Brethren to the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med further about this queſtion, and you may ſee at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. verſe, <hi>There aroſe certain of the ſect of the Phariſees which beleived, ſaying that it was needful to Circumciſe them and to command them to keep the law of Moſes</hi> as to the matter of juſtification. Now in the aſſembly of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem Peter</hi> riſeth up and tels the reſt, that they ſhould take heed what they do, and not put ſuch a yoke upon the diſciples, eſpecially that of the law, which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare; and that it is not only meant Ceremonial but moral; it appeares at the 11. verſe <hi>We beleeve that through the grace of our lord Jeſus Chriſt we ſhal be ſaved even as they.</hi> Now the grace of our lord Jeſus chriſt is not only oppoſite to the ceremonal law, but to the moral Law, when it is taught in way of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to life. So that this law that is ſuch a yoke is that that is oppoſite to the grace of Chriſt that brings ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is that law that reveales Sin; it is that law which is the miniſter of death, by which the mouths of al come to be ſtopped, ſo that it is a heavy yoke, thoſe that are under this Law: that is, ſuch as are under the firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Covenant of works, that seek for Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by that, they are under a greivous burden, they are the children of the bond woman, for the law requires that that is impoſſible for them to do. Now when a ſoul comes to ſee and underſtand it ſelf to bee under the law ſuch a Law as requires things impoſſible to be done; this burdens the ſoul, &amp; ſo by this means it comes to ſee the need it hath of Chriſt, and Chriſt cals to ſuch to come to him: as if he ſhould Say: So long as you continue unbeleivers in your natural condition, you are under Such a covenant for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44661:30"/>
life, as requires that of you which you cannot poſſibly do and therefore there is no reſting in that condition: Come therefore to me, take my yoke, my eaſie yoke, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a heavy yoke: But I wil ſhew you a way for eaſe and reſt to your ſoules. That is the firſt.</p>
               <p>But though the law may require hard things, &amp; impoſſible things yet it may remit in ſome other things. Wherefore.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place: this is the yoke and bondage of the Law: that in every thing that it doth command, it doth require abſolute perfection; accepts of nothing but abſolute perfection in every thing that it doth Comand; it doth not onely comand hard things; but whatſoever the law requires, it doth require an abſolute perfection in it, or otherwiſe caſts the Soul if there be but a failing on any particular in any degree of that which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, the Law caſts the Soul by it. It requires not only that the thing ſhould be done, but that it ſhould be done, in a right manner; that it ſhould be done out of a right principle, that it ſhould be done in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of degrees, to the uttermoſt that is required: that there ſhould not onely be a direction of our lives accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule, but that we come up fully to the Rule, this the law requires: Now what a miſerable yoke and burden is this, for a poor ſoul to look upon the Law as requiring, firſt things that I cannot do. And ſecondly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection admitting of no imperfection at al: this is a heavy yoke: this neither we nor our fathers could beare: and thoſe that come to be ſenſible of this, muſt needs be under a greivous burden, and ſo ſe a need of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt cals thoſe that do underſtand this. It is true if it were thus, and people were left without any help, and remedy, it were a ſad condition; truly if chriſt had not come into the world to put himſelf under the law, we had been left thus; and al thoſe that do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Goſpel, that have not had Chriſt preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them they are al thus, they are al in this Condition; they are under a law that they cannot performe, that law which doth require abſolute and perfect obedience in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing or elſe caſts them.</p>

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:44661:32"/>Thirdly, The Burden of the Law is this; you may ſay; though it doth require perfect obedience; but wil it accept of no endeavours at al? ſuppoſe we do endeauor to obey to the uttermoſt that we can? There are many men wil require things that are hard, and beyond ſtrength, I but when there are endeavours to do that that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that wil be accepted: wherefore we are to know this; that the Law accepts of no endeavours; though a man, or woman ſhould ſtrive their hearts out to obey, to come to the height of the perfection of the Law, the Law doth not accept of thoſe endeavors: It is true, when the Soul comes unto Chriſt in the Goſpel; when the Soul comes under the covenant of Grace; endeavors are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; therefore do not ſay that God wil not accept of our endeavors, and why ſhould we endeavor? Yes, if you come unto Chriſt your endeavors wil be accepted, as we ſhal ſhew you when we come to diſcourſe the reſt that the Soul hath in Chriſt; But now here is an argument to drive poor ſouls to Chriſt; to conſider that while you are out of Chriſt, your endeavors are not accepted, you are not in away of life; for life, and Salvation, it is not to be had in the condition you are now in: for the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires obedience, it muſt have the work done; you can be but either under the covenant of works, or the covenant of grace; ſo long as you are under the covenant of works, there the work is called for, and not meerly endeavors, that wil not do; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith in the <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the righteouſneſs of the Law; that he which doth thoſe things ſhal live by them</hi>: You muſt either be Righteous by the Righteouſneſs of the Law, or by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; now if you would be Righteous by the Righteouſneſs of the Law; hear what it is; he that doth theſe things ſhal live by them; <hi>If you do them, Moſes</hi> doth not ſay, he that endeavors to do theſe things; he that ſtrives to do theſe things; No, but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith <hi>he that doth them</hi>; he that doth theſe things ſhal live by them; it muſt be doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44661:32"/>
that the Law accepteth, and that is the third thing wherein the bondage of the Law conſiſts. Saith Chriſt come to me and you ſhal have reſt; it is by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt that you muſt have reſt. There can be no reſt but a grievous burden upon the ſoul til it doth come to Chriſt; if it doth underſtand things; and if it doth not underſtand theſe things, it is in ſo much the worſe condition; though perhaps it be not ſenſible of ſuch a burden through ignorance, as moſt people ſpend off al their daies and through ignorance do not come to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it; but when the Soul comes to underſtand what tearms there are between God and it, and how it muſt ſtand before God, that it muſt either ſtand by vertue of a Covenant of Works, or a Covenant of Grace, and that al naturally are under a Covenant of Works; and ſo long as I am in my natural Condition, I am under ſuch a Law that accepts of no endeavors, this muſt needs be a great burden unto the Soul and make it to ſee an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of going to Chriſt for eaſe and Reſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the burden of the law is exceeding great in this reſpect. That upon any one breach of the law, the ſoul comes to be broken ſo as to loſe ability to be able to keep any part of the Law for ever; I ſaid there is this in the Law more then in the Goſpel; that upon any one breach of the Law in the Covenant of works, the ſoul comes to be ſo broken, as to looſe all the abilities of ever keeping any part of the Law again; as thus, I ſhewed you in <hi>Adam. Adam</hi> was the Head of the firſt Covenant of works, of the Law; now <hi>Adam</hi> he breaks it in one particular, failed in one Particular of what God required of him, and in breaking of it in that one thing, he, and al his poſterity was ſo broken that they loſt all their abilities of keeping of the Law for ever, except God come and create any abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they have loſt what ability was given at firſt in their Creation; ſo then this is a very great miſtery, that one by doing a thing that is evil ſhould weaken the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary habit; that by doing a <hi>thing that is evil we ſhould
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44661:33"/>
quite looſe the Habit,</hi> that is quite looſe the habit by one act; and not only looſe the habit that is contrary to the particular evil that we do, but looſe al habits of al good whatſoever, and that by one act; now this is a thing above Nature; this is only by vertue of the covenant of works. God makes ſuch a covenant; it runs upon ſuch tearms, as if <hi>Adam</hi> did but ſin in one thing, he muſt die; that is, his Soul as wel as his body muſt die a ſpiritual death, and ſo looſe al habits of al Grace. And this is the Reaſon, why we are by Nature dead in ſin.</p>
               <p>Further, ſuch is the condition of the Law, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God ſhould reſtore us al to be as perfect as ever <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was in the ſtate of innocency, void of al ſin, and having the Image of God perfect, and then God ſhould come and put us upon the covenant of works again; I ſay if we then ſhould but fail in any one thing, it would break us ſo, as we ſhould looſe al our abilities to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any duty ever after: this is the condition of the law; But it is not ſo with the Goſpel; though we ſin againſt the Goſpel; we do not preſently looſe al our habits of Grace; But the Reaſon of the difference; That though <hi>Adam</hi> when he ſinned againſt the Law, he loſt al his habits to do any good after, and that though we ſin againſt the Goſpel; yet we do not looſe thoſe habits. That I ſhal ſhew afterwards, when I ſhal come to ſhew, that the yoke of the Goſpel is eaſier then that of the Law. And that is the fourth thing in the burden of the Law.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The firſt thing is this. That the Law upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very breach it doth take advantage againſt the ſoul pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; I ſay takes advantage againſt the ſoul preſently and binds it over to death, to eternal death, preſently binds it over; Yea, and doth actually put it under a curſe upon every breach, inſtantly it doth it; its true, the law it may be is not preſently executed, as ſoon as a ſinner hath broken it, but this is certain that though God doth not come upon you as ſoon as you have broken the Law, yet know that there are theſe three things come
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44661:33"/>
upon every one that is out of Chirſt, as ſoon as any one ſin is committed, there are theſe three things come upon him preſently.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is bound over by Gods Juſtice, by ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond as hath more ſtrength in it then al the power of Heaven and Earth is able to break; as a man that hath done that that is evil, it may be the Law hath not preſent execution upon him, I but he is bound over pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
               <p>And not only ſo, but in the Second place, the Law paſſeth ſentence, the binding over that is the guilt, but the Law paſſes ſentence upon the ſinner, and condemns it; the Soul is preſently under the ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Law puts the ſinner under a curſe, for ſo it is in the latter end of the 27. of <hi>Deu. Curſed is every one that abides not in every thing that is written in the Book of the Law to do it.</hi> Mark, [<hi>every one</hi>] that abides not [<hi>in every thing</hi>] he is pronounced accurſed, and that is a fift perticular.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, And in the Sixt place. This Law requires conſtant Obedience alſo: and ſuch is the rigour of it; that if you ſhould obey it never ſo much for a great part of your lives; If you ſhould conceive you could obey it perfectly for a great while; yet if at laſt you ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in any one particular you are caſt for al; and al that you have done before is utterly rejected; it wil take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt you for any one particular. If it were poſſible that all your life time you ſhould keep it and at the laſt houre of your life break it in any one particular; certainly you would be condemned by it; this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Law; for ſo it is in thoſe words that are named; though you do it, if you do not abide to do (every thing) If there be but any one thing whereby it can take advantage, it will certainly condemn you for it. This is the condition of al that are under the covenant of works; and is not this a load? Would not this burden
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44661:34"/>
the Soul? If ſo be the ſoul comes to underſtand it; and whether it underſtands it or not, yet certainly it is the truth of God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, A ſeventh Burden of the Law is this, that when once the ſinner hath broke it, the Law cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with any obedience which may make amends af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, by any thing that the ſinner can do; ſuppoſe a man ſhould be never ſo angry and offended, he that hath offended him may make amends, again a Servant thinks, though I have offended my Maſter and done ſo many faults; Yet, I wil make amends for al. So many people think though we have broken the Law of God; and lived a great while in ſin, and done that which is evil; yet we wil make amends again; and we wil give almes; and come to Church and the like. Theſe are the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of many poor Ignorant hearts, that do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand upon what tearms they ſtand with God; al the Children of men ſtand before God either under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; or under the Covenant of Grace, one of the two: now thoſe kind of men that Reaſon after this manner, ſurely they are not acquainted with the Covenant of Grace; they are under the Covenant of Works; and now let them know that the covenant of Works admits of no ſuch amends as they ſpeak of; but when once you have broken the Law all that ever you can do; If you could live a thouſand years never ſo ſtrictly; or be willing to ſuffer never ſo much for God; yet all this will not ſatisfie for what is paſt; many when they have ſinned and their Conſciences are a little awakned for it, then they think to live better and to do otherwiſe afterwards; as if they would make amends for what is done before; but you muſt know that this is a meer deceit and wil not ſatisfie, you muſt come to me ſaith Chriſt; you muſt come to Chriſt and beleeve in him, or otherwiſe all that you can do wil never make amends; you wil ſay, If we cannot make amends what ſhal become of us; it is true, if there were not a Savior, a Chriſt: our condition were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44661:34"/>
ſad Certainly amends muſt be made, but it is impoſſible that ever you can make amends: and this you muſt think of: you muſt not only think of what you are bound to do, for the time that is to come: but how the breach of the law ſhal be made up for that which is paſt; &amp; when the ſinner comes to think of theſe two together, I have thus ſinned, Lord what ſhal I do for time to come; I &amp; what ſhal I do to make up the breach of the law for that which is paſt; this wil burden the ſoul; and the ſoul wil feel upon this ſuch a burden that nothing in the world can give it reſt tel it come to Chriſt; If we did apprehend this we would ſee that our Condition out of Chriſt were a reſtleſs conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this invitation of Chriſt would be very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Now becauſe I was loth to tel you of reſt before I had opened a little this burden, for otherwiſe you might ſay as thoſe Jewes did to Chriſt in an other caſe when Chriſt told them If the Son made them free, they ſhould be free indeed; why, Say they, are we bound to any man, it is in <hi>John.</hi> 8.32. why do you talk of freedom to us. If I ſhould have gone on in the invitation [<hi>Come to me and I wil give you reſt</hi>] come to Chriſt. Why what reſtleſs Condition are we in, you might have ſaid? But now when you ſee your reſtleſs condition, then I ſuppoſe you wil be willing to harken to the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [<hi>Come to me and I wil give you reſt</hi>] thoſe things wil make you to know what it is to beleeve, and to come to Chriſt, when you come to underſtand what you are in being out of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. An eighth particular is this; That the Law accepts of no repentance, as it wil not be made amends for; ſo it wil not accept of repentance. Let the Sinner be never ſo ſorrowful for what he hath done, and lament his ſin ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much; if he could bewail his ſin with teares of blood, the Law would not accept of this. You wil ſay this is a ſtrange doctrine, that our repentance ſhould not be accepted of. I do not ſay abſolutely, that God wil accept of no Repentance; but I ſay that the Law wil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44661:35"/>
of no Repentance. Repentance is the doctrine of the Goſpel; the Law preacheth no ſuch doctrine as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of Repentance; it is an evangelical doctrine: but now repentance, that is merely trouble of Conſcience, that I ſee my ſelf in ſuch danger of the Law, this may be a natural repentance, and not evangelical; that is, I ſee I have undone my ſelf by reaſon of my ſin, and now am troubled, and ſo go no further; I ſay this is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral repentance, and not evangelical. When you do think of repenting of your ſins, this is a ſaving meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for you to think of your Repentance, thus: I am now ſorry and Repent, and am humbled for my ſin; I but this is through a ſecond Covenant, through a covenant of grace, that this can be accepted, it is infinit mercy in God and that in Chriſt, it is purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, that any Sorrow for any ſin ſhal ever be accepted of God, you muſt thank Chriſt for that; and therefore when you come to the work of mourning for ſin, you ſhould come to it as a work of the Goſpel, as an evangelical work, and ſo come freely to it; for that which is a work of the Goſpel, is a fruit of the blood of Chriſt, and it is a great mercy of God unto you that you may be admitted to come before him to ſorrow for your ſins in ſuch a way as you may be ſaved: al your tears, and trouble for ſin except it be through the grace of the goſpel, it is not accepted, and yet how many thouſands of poor ſouls never think of this in the work of their repentance; perhaps when they lie upon their ſick or death beds, their conſciences tels them that there is a hel and miſery for ſinners, and there they lie roaring and Crying out, but the truth is they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtand the way of God in the Covenant of grace: and how the Lord hath looked upon the Children of men under the Covenant of works, and now hath entred into a ſecond Covenant through his Son, and there hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a way for their ſalvation which could not be in the other covenant: we are to know that the law doth accept of no repentance; now O! what a bondage is this that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44661:35"/>
when I am ſorrowful for my ſins, and think that God wil pardon me, then I am curſt by ſuch a Law, that wil accept of no repentance: but when we come to Chriſt, there Godly ſorrow is accepted of: and it is ſaid to be Sorrow unto life, but that is the priviledg of thoſe that are under the covenant of grace in Chriſt: therefore conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of this point, that you may make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a covenant of works, and a covenant of grace. I know nothing in al divinity that is greater for you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand then theſe two things: and thoſe people that are not acquainted with theſe two covenants, they underſtand but little in thoſe miſteries of religion that may bring Salvation; I ſay little or nothing of true divinity is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by people, that do not underſtand the difference between the firſt and the ſecond covenant, between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace; and the right underſtanding of the difference between theſe two, would let in abundance of knowledg. I dare undertake that after people come to have the underſtanding of theſe two, and to know the difference of them, in one quarter of a year, they wil come to have let into their hearts more knowledg in the main principles of religion then they had in many years before, and for want of knowing this one thing, people do moſt groſly miſtake in abundance of points of Religion, and never come to underſtand, and to know chriſt at al in that way that is propounded in the Goſpel. And that is the eighth thing.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, In the Ninth place: the burden of the Law appears in this: that it only opens to man his miſery, and there leaves him; as if a Chyrurgeon ſhould open a wound, and there leave it, (as it were) in the open aire. The Law tels not man of any way of Redemption, of any way of deliverance, but meerely ſhews unto us our miſery and ſo leaves us. I do not mean the law that is in the book of the old teſtament, for there is Goſpel mingled. I do not ſay that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not tel us of any way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; but I mean the Law of the Covenant of works
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44661:36"/>

               <p>Tenthly, A tenth particular wherein the greivous bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under the law appeares, is this. That it is ſuch a Law as there can be no appeal from it, no, nor no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing of it, though it be thus ſtrict, and thus ſevere, yet I ſay there is no appeale from it, nor no repealing of it: there are many Laws that we may appeal from one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, or if that Law be hard it may be called in again: we cannot appeale from the Authority of this law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can it, be repealed. You wil ſay, this excluds us from al help, though there be many hard Laws made by men and as long as they ſtand in force people are in a very ſad Condition; yet there may be meanes to repeal them: but as for this Law there can it ſeems be no appeale from it, nor repealing of it. May we not appeale from Gods juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to Gods mercy ſeat? I have indeed ſpoken of ſuch an expreſſion, but that expeſſion muſt be warily underſtood, for the truth is there is no proper appealing from the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of God to his mercy; when the ſinner comes to Chriſt it hath the pardon ſealed in the Court of juſtice, as wel as in the Court of mercy; there is no ſoule that is ſaved, but Gods juſtice is as wel ſatiſfied as his mercy is glorified, nor no repeale of this law. What muſt the law ſtand in force then? yes, the law ſhal ſtand in force, and yet there ſhal be thouſands of ſoules ſaved. How is that you wil ſay? This is the miſtery of the Goſpel that the law ſhal ſtand in force, and yet men ſhalbe ſaved, there ſhal be a way to ſave men for al this, Certainly if the Law went on in its courſe, one would think that it would carry on al mankind to eternal deſtruction; yea, and ſo it would have done but onely for this great Saviour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer Jeſus Chriſt that cals Sinners to him, that they might have reſt. He comes and puts himſelf under the Law and what the Law requires, he doth, and he Suffers;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44661:36"/>
ſo that here is al the alteration, the Law goes on, and hath its courſe, onely whereas it might have required to have had the courſe of it upon our ſelves in perſon; now God is content that it ſhould have its courſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſecurity. When a man oweth a debt, the Law requires performance, its one thing to have the law repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and an other to have the debter delivered: if a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> wil come and undertake the debt, he is delivered though he hath not paid it, &amp; yet the law hath its courſe; for the ſurety diſchargeth what the debter ſhould have done: ſo the way of ſalvation for any ſoul, it is not either by appealing from the law, or by the repealing of the law: but we muſt look upon the Law to have its courſe, only to have its courſe upon Chriſt our ſurety, who hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied the law, and Chriſt looked thus upon, is the true object of our faith, and except we apprehend Chriſt thus, as one made under the Law as the Scripture ſaith, and one that did indure the law to have its courſe upon him, and ſo to ſatisfie the law: except we look upon Chriſt thus, we look not upon him as the right object of our faith; and Chriſt he thus cals upon you that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heavy laden to come to him: as if he ſhould ſay poor Sinners that are under ſuch a Covenant as this is, you know that though it be not repealed I have come and put my ſelf under this law, it hath had its courſe upon me; come to me, and the law ſhal be ſattisfied, it ſhal have nothing to ſay againſt you, but you ſhal have through reſt in me: come therefore to me.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly: The Eleventh thing in the Law is, That it is ſo far from inabling us to perform that obedience which it requires, that (in regard of our own wretched condition that we are now in) the more it comes to be revealed, the more are our Corruptions ſtirred up; it doth through our fault, not from any fault in the Law, ſtir up our Corruptions ſo much the more. <hi>Luther</hi> compares it to Water caſt upon Lime, the Law coming into the heart being in its Natural Condition till God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overcomes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44661:37"/>
it by the Grace of the Goſpell, is ſtirred up ſo much the more. You have a notable expreſſion for this in the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> who felt it thus in himſelf, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>For when we were in the Fleſh, the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin which were by the Law, did work in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to bring forth fruit unto death</hi>; and again in ver. 8. <hi>For ſin taking occaſion by the Commandment wrought in me all manner of Concupiſcence.</hi> It took occaſion by the Commandment; there are many people that are the worſe by hearing the Law revealed unto them, until God pleaſeth to overcome their hearts by the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Now put all theſe together, and the ſoul that comes to be enlightened to underſtand theſe, do you not think that ſuch a ſoul wil be burdened? Is it not a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be in this Condition? Is it poſſible that the ſoul can have any reſt in this Condition? You will ſay, theſe things are hard in themſelves. But firſt if you did but underſtand the infinite holineſs there is in God, and the infinite Juſtice of God with whom you have to deal. And if you did but underſtand the perfect Condition that God did make man in at the firſt; preſent before your ſouls the infinite Holineſs and Juſtice of the great God with whom you have to do; and then preſent before your ſouls that perfect ſtate that God did make man in Innocency, and then theſe things wil be clear unto you. And if theſe things were only preached to you, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, they would ſeem to be hard; but it is all in order to this Invitation of Chriſt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Three Concluſions ariſing from the former doctrine concerning the Burden under the Law; Namely, <hi>1.</hi> That man by Nature is in an evil caſe. <hi>2.</hi> That it is a mighty work to ſave a Soul. <hi>3.</hi> That thoſe vain thoughts whereby men think to pacifie their Conſciences, will ſtand them in no ſtead.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw upon the hearing of theſe things, we may truly draw ſuch Concluſions as theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That certainly man is in an ill caſe, by Nature.</hi> It is obſerved of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when <hi>Pharoah</hi> did increaſe their bondage, the Scripture tels us that the people ſaw that they were in an ill caſe; ſo when we underſtand what a condition we are in under this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, we may conclude that verily man is in an ill caſe by nature. Secondly, And a ſecond Concluſion may be drawn hence. <hi>That it is a mighty work to ſave a Soul</hi>; it is not a ſlight thing for a Soul to come to be ſaved; there muſt be great things done by God to ſave a ſoul. Many people, they confeſs it is true they are ſinners, but they cry to God to have mercy on them, and ſo they think it is preſently done; but did you conſider of the condition that you are in naturally, and of the Righteouſneſs of God, you would then conclude it is a mighty work of God to ſave any ſoul, and that you had need fal upon the ſeeking of your Salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
               <p>And then Thirdly, Hence wil follow this Concluſion alſo, <hi>That thoſe vain thoughts of men that they have had for pacifying their Conſciences, and the quieting of their hearts, wil ſtand them in no ſtead.</hi> As thus: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they reaſon thus: I am not ſo bad as others. What
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44661:38"/>
if you be not; if you be under the Law, you are caſt a thouſand thouſand times over, You wil ſay that you do ſome good thing, and ſomtimes come to Church, and pray to God; but what is this to the keeping of the Law; if thou beeſt in thy natural eſtate, thy reaſoning after this manner does argue that thou doſt look after Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by what thou haſt done, and for men to ſay; I do what I can, and I am ſorry with all my heart that I can do no better, theſe are not reaſonings that wil inable thee to ſtand with comfort before the infinite Righteous God; thou muſt know in what ſtate thou art in under the Law, and how thou art caſt by the Law; theſe are not arguings that can bring reſt to thy ſoul; if it could, Chriſt would never have called in this manner; But you muſt know that ſuch is your condition, that all the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and men in the world cannot give reſt to your ſouls; and if you did underſtand this; you would thereby go away convinced of this truth; wel I ſee that there is a burden upon me, howſoever I have not been ſenſible of it; and it is ſuch a burden as wil preſs me down to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery, and I ſee now by this that I have need of a Chriſt. Certainly if congregations were ſenſible of this burden of the Law; Oh! How would their ſouls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this, and praiſe the Lord that their eares are bleſſed to hear ſuch a ſound of the Goſpel as this, <hi>Come to me and I wil give you Reſt.</hi> I appeal to you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the opening of the Law be not of uſe to make you come to Chriſt; there are a great many wanton ſpirits, that cal thoſe Miniſters of God that ſeek out of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to do good to Souls, and to draw them out of their natural eſtates; Legal men, Legal preachers and the like; I appeal to your conſciences, upon the knowledg of theſe things whether you wil not come to know, the way of coming to Chriſt better then you did before; if I ſhould have named the name of Chriſt five hundred times over and over again, would you have come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the miſtery of God in Chriſt, ſo much as by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44661:38"/>
hearing what the difference is between the firſt covenant of works, and being under the Law; and to tel you that Chriſt came into the world to deliver us from this firſt covenant; he comes, and takes our Nature upon him, and puts himſelf under the Law, that he might free us from ſuch a heavy yoak, and bondage; and in this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Scripture, he calls all ſouls that do feel this yoak and burden to come to him that ſo they might have reſt. And thus much for this firſt Particular, what the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is that the ſoul is under, that is under the Law; are you ſenſible of this? Chriſt cals you; perhaps ſome of you may ſay, we have not been ſenſible of this; do you begin to underſtand it? Doth God begin to let in ſome light to you? Do you begin to feel it ſomthing weighty upon your Hearts? Bleſſed be God for it, you are ſo much the fitter to hear of the covenant of Grace. Now when you come home, let the Husband ſay to the wife; we hear of two covenants as you have it in the 4. of the <hi>Galla.</hi> 22. Here are two covenants, and theſe two are ſet out in this Allegory of the bond-woman and the free-Woman, now til we come to underſtand what the other covenant is, we are under the former covenant, the covenant of works; this is that you ſhould labor to underſtand; the Husband and wife to aske one another of the difference between the two covenants; ask but what the covenant of works is, and upon what tearms that runs, and the covenant of Grace; and upon what tearms that runs; and ſo you will come eſpecially to underſtand that that follows in this text with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage to your Souls.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Burden of Legal Performances, What it is; With the burdenſomneſs thereof laid open in twelve Particulars. <hi>1.</hi> There is no inward principle of doing. <hi>2.</hi> In men that are only under the Law, there's a principle contrary to the performance thereof. <hi>3.</hi> Such are wearied with doing, getting no ſupply of ſtrength to perform duty. <hi>4.</hi> By their performances, they ſtil contract more Guilt upon their Souls. <hi>5.</hi> What they do in Obedience unto the Law is only out of fear. <hi>6.</hi> And with much ſtraitneſs of Spirit. <hi>7.</hi> Nothing comes of ſuch Performances. <hi>8.</hi> They that perform Duty in a meer Legal way, never attain their end, which is, peace with God. <hi>9.</hi> They know not whether God accepts of them, or rejects them. <hi>10.</hi> They are forced unto Duties inſtantly, preſently, and upon the ſudden, though to the hinderance of other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of greater concernment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God requireth of them, at the ſame time. <hi>11.</hi> Though they go on ioyling, yet know they not whether they ſhal bold out unto the end. <hi>12.</hi> Their Humiliation and trouble for not doing what they ought to do, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from doing what God requires.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw there is one thing more that is as an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix unto the Burden of the Law, flowes indeed from, and is tyed unto the burden of the Law, and that is, the burden of Legal performances, not only the burden of the Law in regard of what the Law requires, the perfect obedience that the Law requires, that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den comes from the Law it ſelf, but now there is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44661:39"/>
that many are under, a very heavy and grievous burden, and that is, the burden of Legal performances, and this is that that is to be the ſubject of this Chapter. I intend to go no further then to ſpeak of that burden to open it a little to you, and that as I told you at the firſt opening of the text is the interpretation of <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> upon this text, <hi>You that are weary and heavy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> that is you that are laden with the burden of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king righteouſneſs under the Law. <hi>Come unto me and I wil give you Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>I wil ſhew unto you what I mean by the burden of Legal Performances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>What a great burden this is and how much evil there is in it, and ſo apply my ſelf to thoſe that are under this burden to ſhew to them how Chriſt cals them here in this text to come to him, that they might have Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that which I mean by the burden of Legal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances is this, the performing of duties that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Law meerly out of conſcience, becauſe conſcience puts men and Women upon thoſe duties, and doing them in the ſtrength that they have of their own, and looking upon what they do as the Righteouſneſs which they muſt tender up to God, as Righteouſneſs for life, now this is a Legal performance; to perform du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in a Legal way is this, to do what the Law requires meerly out of conſcience, becauſe conſcience tels me I muſt do it, and to work in mine own ſtrength though it be that that God gives, yet but a natural ſtrength, and to make account of this to be as my Righteouſneſs, and to tender it up unto God for Righteouſneſs unto life, here is a Legal performance, and this is to performe duties in a meer Legal way, and thoſe that do thus wil find that this will be a very great burden to their ſpirits, it is a burden unto the Spirits of thoſe that do thus, unto the ſpirits of ſuch as are conſcientious indeed, for we look not now upon men and Women as performing Duties
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44661:40"/>
out of Hypocriſie to be ſeen of men to make a ſhow of what they have not in their Hearts, we do not ſpeak of ſuch, but we ſpeak of thoſe that have got into a higher form beyond ſuch kind of Hypocrites, ſuch as perform duties out of conſcience, and yet riſe no higher then looking at the Law, that binds them to thoſe duties and ſo tender them up to God as their Righteouſneſs, and do them for life, making account that this is the thing that muſt bring them to life, ſuch as do this and are not acquainted any further with the myſtery of the Goſpel, they do go under a moſt grievous burden all the daies of their lives, I do not ſay that it is a burden to perform Duties that conſcience requires, when we do them to the Honor of God, in the ſtrength of Chriſt, as a work of the ſanctification of this ſpirit, and as a fruit of our thankfulneſs for the Grace and mercy of God in Chriſt to us, that is not a burden, that is no burden at al, but to do them meerly as being forced to them by conſcience, and as our Righteouſneſs for life this is the burden, and though there be no other principles that men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have but this, yet they may be very conſcientious ſo as not to dare to commit any known ſin in ſecret, they may make conſcience of ſecret duties, yea they may be aboundant in duties, that is, do perform many duties. In the 6. of <hi>Micah,</hi> and the 7. what ſhal we do ſay they, <hi>Shal we give Rivers of Oyl and thouſands of Rams, and the fruit of our bodies for the ſin of our ſouls,</hi> there you have the expreſſions of thoſe that are Legal, they would know what they ſhould do, profeſſing that they would be willing to do any thing for to ſave their ſouls, offer thouſands of rams and Rivers of Oyl for a ſacrifice, ſo one that is meerly Legal may perform many Duties yea he may be conſcientious of every Duty that he knoweth, there may be a kind of univerſal obedience in him, to obey in al, ſo far as he knows, for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action, he may make conſcience of every thing that he knows to be the mind of God, and yet do al this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44661:40"/>
in a legal way, and his performance may be rather a burden then that which ſhal do him good in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and bring him to life: and except he doth come to know furher then yet he doth, to know the evangelical performance of duties, he cannot have true reſt in his ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now this (as the other) is a poynt of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to many, it may be divers that read this book may not ſo cleerely underſtand what this is, they may not feel any ſuch thing in their one experience; but I ſuppoſe I ſhal ſpeake to ſome even to their hearts, and open their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, whereby they ſhal ſay that they have not taken a right courſe to procure reſt to their ſouls, and to this end I ſpeake that they may hearken to the bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the goſpel to come unto Chriſt that they might have reſt; as thus you perceive a little what I meane by legal performances, now then we are to come to ſhew the burden of legal performances, that they are very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome to thoſe that are acquainted with nothing but to performe duties meerly from the law.</p>

                  <head>The firſt Burden of Legal Performances.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe now they are put upon duties that they have no principle to do, to be put upon a work where there is no inward principle; to do the work that muſt needs be burdenſome; conſcience puts me upon the duty and that is right, but I have no principle to do it, yet I must do it, conſcience ſaith ſo, whether I have a principle or no, and though it is true I have no principle to do it ſo as the Law requires, yet I may doe ſome outward performances, now for me to goe about ſuch a work, to endeavour and ſtrive to do al the work that the Law requires; not onely the outward part but the wole worke, and to be put upon to ſtrugle and ſtrive to do that which I have no inward principle to do, that muſt needs be burdenſome. Al motions of nature that are from an external principle are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44661:41"/>
violent and ſo tedious, heavy and troubleſome, ſo this motion to duty that comes not from an inward principle of heart but is meerly legal, conſcience ſtands to put the ſoul upon duty; but doth not put any principle into the ſoul to do it, this is a violent motion, and thoſe that have the experience of this find it tedious, heavy, and troubleſome.</p>
                  <p>Now here lieth the burden, for it is not according to thoſe vain conceits of men that the duty ought not to be done, becauſe they have no inward principle to do it, but here is the burden that conſcience binds you to do it, you muſt do it though you have no principle in you to do it.</p>

Legal performances have a great burden in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is in al men that are but under the law before they come to be true beleevers ſanctified by the ſpirit of Chriſt, a contrary principle, a principle quite againſt thoſe duties, oppoſite unto them, there is a contrary ſtreame in them, they go againſt wind and tide, you know what a burdenſome thing it is for the boatman to go againſt wind and tyde, he muſt put to a great deale of ſtrength, ſo it is heere til the ſoul come to beleeve in Chriſt and to have the ſpirit of Chriſt, having onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of conſcience and being put upon duties, there are ſuch corruptions in the heart, and ſuch evil principles in al men naturally, that are as wind and tide againſt thoſe duties; and yet ſaith concience you muſt do them though you find your inclinations to be never ſo ſtrong another way, yet conſcience tels you you muſt do them, and when God is pleaſed to put ſtrength into conſcience it wil make a man or a woman to go on in duty though it be never ſo croſs to their own nature; you wil ſay if it be croſs to their owne natures why do they not leave it off? No they dare not, notwithſtanding; ſo, it is true, we ſhal ſhow you afterwards, that even
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44661:41"/>
godly men and beleivers are burdened with corruptions, they have contrary principles to the duty too, I but they are not ſo prevailing as with unbeleevers that are only legal, It is a tedious thing you know to caſt a ſtone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not onely to cauſe a ſtone to move any way, that is ſome trouble, becauſe you keep it from its center, but to put it upon a motion that is quite contrary to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that is burdenſome, becauſe al heavy things have principles in them that work downwards, therfore to put them upon thoſe things that are quite contrary to their natural principles, it is a motion that wil cauſe burden, and that becauſe you keep them from their owne center: ſo conſcience may keep a man and woman from their own center, from thoſe wicked courſes that their natures are inclined unto, and al the while they are kept from the courſe that their natures do ſo ſtrongly incline them unto, it muſt needs be burdenſome to them, until God come and ſanctifie their hearts, they may be a great while without any ſanctification, many whoſe conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are convinced may goe on in duties, without ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in them.</p>

Now this muſt needs be burdenſome. As ſuppoſe a man be put upon a work, and if he have no mind to it, that is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but if it be againſt the haire, quite oppoſite to his diſpoſition, that is more tedious; yet he muſt go on, and he toyls and wearies himſelf, and yet the more he works the more grievous it is unto him, for he finds no ſtrength comming, but ſtrength wearying rather, his ſtrength

wears a way, and no ſtrength comes in to aſſiſt him, and yet his work is as ſtrong as it was, that work muſt needs be burdenſome; ſo thoſe that are meerly legal, they go on ſtil in duty, and the work is ſtil as ſtrong, but they are weaker, many a man when he firſt ſets upon a work is cold and benummed, bur when he continues in the work he gets warmth, and then it is not ſo burdenſom unto him, but if he continues in the work, and is colder and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, this is very tedious, to thoſe that performe duties in a meer legal way, conſcience puts them upon it at firſt, and they go to duty with ſome vigour, but the truth is, they grow more weary, and the work is more tedious, and yet conſcience puts them upon asmuch work as at firſt when a man hath been at work and growes weary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires eaſe and a cruel task-maſter ſhal come and tel him there muſt be no decreaſe of your work, nor no increaſe of your ſtrength, this muſt needs be tedious; thus thoſe that performe duties in a legal way, conſcience puts upon them as much worke when they are weary and tired as at firſt; here is the difference between the works of ſanctification &amp; legal performances, though they ſeem to be hard at firſt, yet while the ſoul ſets upon them there comes in ſtrength, and the more work the more ſtrength, they do not ſpend their ſtrength and throw it away, and grow more weary afterwards then at firſt; but the more they have experience of the ways, the more ſtrength they have, they grow warm at their work, and being warm they get further and further ſtrength, and it grows eaſie unto them, but it is not ſo with one that performes duties in a meere legal way, ſome have been ſeven yeares in a profeſion of religion and made conſcience of their duties, yet after ſeven yeares ſpent their hearts no more mortified then at firſt, and they have got no more ſtrength then, at firſt, their luſts are leſs mortified, and their ſtrength is leſs then at firſt, and therefore their work muſt needs be grievous unto them.</p>

in and reveal Chriſt unto them; one of theſe two is the Concluſion, either they caſt off the Duties that before they made conſcience of, and ſo grow to be looſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; or otherwiſe if conſcience purſues them more and more they grow to diſpaire, and ſomtimes upon their ſick bed and death bed, come into a raving and raging diſtemper; as by experience we find that many after they have been a long time under a troubled conſcience, and gone on in a Legal way they have grown very prophane; there was a time that they durſt not neglect Duty in their family and cloſet, but they come afterward to think that this was but Legal, and now they caſt them off, and give themſelves to looſneſs, and then they have nothing to plead for themſelves but this, that they were under Legal performances, and they leave them off, and thus they go this way to Reſt, but Oh! woful this is to go to the Devil for Reſt, if you had come to Chriſt you might have had Reſt, but theſe give up their Souls to the Devils Reſt, and grow to looſneſs and are notoriouſly ſcandalous in in their lives, I ſuppoſe if you wil obſerve it, you need not go far to find examples in this kind: but others that cannot get the Maſtery of their conſciences, they grow to diſpair, when they come upon their ſick beds their hearts are overwhelmed with diſpair and ſo they die; Now Oh! what pity it is to looſe ſuch Souls as have gone thus far in the way of Religion. As thus: Firſt, they do the ſame things that Gods people do for the outward act, they do the ſame things the Saints do. Secondly, They are very Conſcientious of what they do, make conſcience of their very thoughts, and of their ſecret waies. Nay, Thirdly, they know they have to do with God in every thing, they have their hearts ſo wrought upon, that they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the preſence of God alwaies.

               <p>That the Corruption that yet remaines in the Hearts of the Saints is a Burden, I ſuppoſe every one of you can witneſs, that are godly, there is no godly man or woman in the world but knows what the meaning of this Point is, perhaps the other Point of Legal performances was ſuch a Point that many of you ſcarce underſtood what it was, but becauſe I knew it was of exceeding uſe to others, though it might not be underſtood of many, they muſt not looſe their portion; but there is none that hath any ſpark of godlyneſs but do and wil underſtand what I mean, and what I ſhal ſay in this Point of the burden of Corruption that doth ſtil remain in the godly, in the beſt that live upon the Earth, and that every one acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is in every mans mouth almoſt, we are al ſinners, but now here is the Difference between the wicked and the godly, the wicked have ſin enough in them, but it is no burden to them, but the godly have their ſins to be their burden, the remainder of ſin though it be never ſo litle, it is a moſt grievous Burden unto them, and to theſe I am to ſpeak out of this text, yea Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks to them, Come unto me, ye that are Laden with the Burden of Corruption, the burden of ſin that ſtil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in you, Come to me, and I wil give you Reſt in regard of that Burden.</p>
               <p>Now to prove that there is a remainder of corruption in the godly that is a burden to them, I wil give you but one ſcripture that ſhal ſerve inſtead of the reſt, and that is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O! wretched man that I am</hi> ſaith Paul <hi>who ſhal deliver me from this body of death, I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> here we have indeed a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentary upon this text, who ſhal deliver me ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> O!

&amp; then he runnes to Chriſt, I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>So then I my ſelf with my mind ſerve the law of God, but with my fleſh the Law of ſin,</hi> I have got eaſe and reſt by Chriſt by running to him, but marke the ſcripture, O; wretched man that I am, <hi>Paul</hi> though a godly man and one eminent in grace, yet had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him a body of death, his ſin that was in him, he calls a body of death, it was as a deadly thing unto his heart, and it was as a body becauſe it was made up of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members as a body is, there were many ſins remaining in him, and al the faculties of his ſoul and members of his body were defiled with ſin, and therefore he cals it a body of death. Now the Apoſtle is ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this, that he gives a grievous ſhreek as it were, O! wretched man that I am, he counts it his miſery, in that it appeares to be a burden, and then he ſhreikes out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his burden, O! wretched man that I am, As a man or woman that hath a burden laid upon their ſhoulders and being not able to beare it, they give a greivous ſhreik at the burden falling upon them, ſo doth the Apoſtle here.

truth is thoſe that are godly they fear more what their owne evil hearts ſhould bring upon them, then what al the divels in hel and al the creatures in the world can bring upon them, and that is a good fear, but yet it makes them walk heavily: others feare, ſometimes they fear men, fear thoſe that wil come and take away their eſtates and undo them, feare their enemies or feare the divel, but one that is godly he feares more his own heart, the evil that may come to his ſoul by that, then al the hurt that al the divels in hel can do to him, for they cannot afflict more then the body, I but this brings an evil upon the ſoul, it breakes their communion between them and God, and therefore they are afraid of ſin before it comes, they have experience of their hearts what evil it hath done to them, and ſo are afraid of miſcarrying, and afraid of the evil conſequences of their ſin, they do not know what miſchief their ſin might poſſibly bring upon them, and ſo they goe under this burden of fear along time together, even thoſe that are truly godly.</p>

It is true, if it was only a burden of our eſtates that it was only in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things it was ſomthing, but when it comes to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon our conſciences, we muſt learn to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the burden upon our ſhoulders, and between the

as thus, I would compare al other burdens to this, as water in a tankerd when your tankerd-bearers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry water, it is a burden to them, but they have arts to make their tankerds light as can be, but now if they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their water in tankards of Lead, though the water were no heavier, yet this would make it more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; ſo ſickneſs, poverty, loſs of eſtate, they are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome to al that beare them, but yet the corruption of ſin when the heart is corrupted with ſin, that is as lead that makes it the greater burden, and therefore ſin in the heart is ſuch a thing as makes al other things burdenſome that are burdenſome.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44661:56"/>
and the more Corruption that remaines in our Hearts, the more burdenſome we are to all that we converſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; ſome there are though truly godly, yet they have ſo much Corruption in them, that they are burdenſome to all that they converſe withal, as in a family, take thoſe that are paſſionate, though they have godlineſs lies at the bottome, yet how burdenſome are they to thoſe that converſe with them, others they have extream ſtout and ſtubborn Spirits, others have ſullen Hearts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſullen ſpirits, others have ſlight and vain ſpirits, others proud and envious ſpirits, and others Covetous, now there is reaſon they ſhould feel the burden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for others feel the Burden when it breaks forth from them, and therefore it much more aggravates their Burden, thoſe that are truly godly that are overcome with paſſion when they think thus, Oh! what a Wretched Heart have I, that I ſhould break forth into paſſion, in ſuch and ſuch company, Oh! what a Wretch am I, that I ſhould not only be burdenſome to my ſelf but to thoſe that I converſe withal, I make no Queſtion, but I ſpeak to many that have lamented their condition in this kind alone, in that they have been ſo burdenſome to others, it is true, I have been a Burden to ſuch and ſuch, but the Lord knows it is much more a burden to mine own heart, and to my ſelf, therefore the remaining part of Corruption is ſuch a Burden to the godly, becauſe it is a burden to others, whenas all the people of God ſhould be uſeful in the places where they live, they ſhould live ſo as that all that live by them and with them ſhould bleſs God for them, this they ſhould endeavor to do, to live in ſuch a manner as all that come neer them ſhould bleſs God that ever they came neer, or had converſe with them.</p>

                  <head>The Seventh Property of the Burden of Corruption.</head>
                  <p>Seventhly, This Burden is ſuch a Burden, as makes thoſe that are godly to be burdenſome to themſelves, yea even to be weary of their lives many times, Why? For their Corruption in them is a great deal more grievous then Death would be to them. We uſe to expreſs a thing that is very grievous to us, and ſay it is death to us, thoſe that are godly can ſay ſo of their ſin, and that is one Reaſon that <hi>Paul</hi> gave that Name to his ſin, a Body of Death, Oh! <hi>Wretched Man that I am who ſhal deliver me from this Body of Death,</hi> Why? becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Corruption that then was in his Heart was as Death to him, ſo it is with the Saints, the Corruption that remaines in their hearts it is Death to them, and they can appeal unto God, and ſpeak thus in his preſence. The bitterneſs of death would not be ſo much to me a thouſand parts as this Corruption that is in my heart, Oh! this Corruption that is in my heart, that overcomes me after ſo many reſolutions, ſo many Prayers, ſo many Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo many ingagements, it is that which makes me weary of my life, as <hi>Rebeccah</hi> ſaid, if <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Wife of the Daughters of <hi>Heth,</hi> it would make her weary of her Life; ſo ſaith the godly, this remaining Corruption in my Heart, makes me weary of my Life, what ſhal I do that carry ſuch a Body of Death about me ſo as I do. There are many Men and Women that in a diſcontented mood, ſay, they are weary of their lives, but this is in a diſcontented mood; but when could you ſay ſo in reſpect of your Hearts, when did you ſay, I lookt into my Heart, and I ſaw a great deal of ſin, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, worldlineſs, Pride, Paſſion, and the like, and this is that which makes me weary of my Life. The truth is, the great thing that makes the people of God to be willing to die is this, becauſe they know when they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44661:57"/>
die they ſhal be delivered from this Burden, and therefore when Death comes they entertaine it willingly, becauſe they know they ſhal ſin againſt God no more. There is many of you, when you have lived a long time in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and poverty, and are in great ſtraites many waies, you think if Death ſhould come to me I could be willing to die, becauſe then I ſhould ſuffer no ſuch things as now I do, I but that is no argument of Grace, but this is an argument of Grace, that becauſe of the great burden of Corruption that thou carryeſt about in thy Soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou would'ſt be willing to die.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, For the corrupt Nature that is in them, beſides the act of ſin, this muſt needs be a burden to the godly, to think I have a Nature contrary to God, to think now and then that they ſin againſt God, this is not the burden, but here's the burden, <hi>Oh! Wretched man and Woman that I am,</hi> I have a Nature in me that is oppoſite to the very Nature of God, to the infinite holineſs of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though God hath made me partaker of the divine Nature, yet ſtil I continue to be oppoſit to the Nature of God it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, This is that which is as a heavy weight that preſſeth them down in every holy Duty, ſo in that 12. of the <hi>Hebrews, Wherefore ſeeing we alſo are compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with patience the Race that is ſet before us.</hi>

He ſpeaks here of original ſin, the ſin of our Nature eſpecially, it is a weight that lies upon our hearts in the performance of holy Duties, when we are ſtriving to get our hearts up to God. This corruption of Nature keeps them down. I remember the ſtory of that good man, that going abroad ſaw a Bird fluttering up, and when it had got up, it fel down again, and then it would flutter up, and then come down again, and he looking wiſhtly upon it, ſaw a ſtone tied to the Birds Leg, and upon that the good man begins to weep, juſt ſo, ſaith he, it is with me, I would fain get up to God, fain would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and ſomtimes I am getting up to God, but ſtraightway there is a weight that puls me down. Do not you find it thus? You that are converſant with God; you that get ſomtimes alone in Duty to God, and you would fain have your hearts raiſed to God, but how are your Hearts brought down again, and not only in theſe private Duties, but after publick Duties, a day of faſting and Humiliation ſomtimes, Oh at night your Hearts are up, and now you reſolve you wil Live above the World. And above al theſe things here below, and you wil live more to Gods Glory, but how are your Hearts brought down again by this corrupt Nature that is in you.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Corrupt Nature is a burden, becauſe it affords matter for any temptation in the World, there is no temptation to any kind of ſin, but our Nature affords matter for al kind of temptation, what a burden is this, if a ſhip be on fire in the midſt of other ſhips, and we know that there is a great deal of Gun-pouder in the ſhip that is on fire in the midſt of the Reſt, would not he that oweth the ſhip be afraid, and wil he not toyle and uſe al means he can that the fire may not take hold of the Gun-pouder, I compare all the temptations to ſin about us unto the fire, now we are compaſſed about with the

fire and what are our Hearts in them, there is matter for the temptation to take upon; as the Gun-pouder is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the fire to take hold of, ſo our ſinful Hearts are as ready to take upon every temptation as that is; now is not this a great Burden? That I ſhould carry about me in my Heart matter enough to entertain al ſin, any ſin in the World, yea the ſin of Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, if I had not the mighty power of God to reſtrain me, thus it is with the ſinful Nature of man.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, The ſinfulneſs of our Nature is a burden in this reſpect, to have not only matter to entertain temptation, but it hath in it a Root from whence, (if God doth not come in with his Grace) all kind of ſin may ſpring up from it, though there ſhould be no kind of temptation, many of us do cry out of the Devil and temptation when we are overcome by ſin, but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what I ſay, there is not only that evil in your hearts that you are ready to entertain all temptations, but there is that evil in your hearts that would breed al kind of evils whatſoever, though there ſhould be no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though there were no Devil in Hel; as thus now, you know there are the ſeeds of weeds in the ground, though it is true, they do not come up to flowriſh til the rain and the Sun draws them forth, yet ſtil there are the ſeeds of thoſe weeds, ſo as they would come up in time though not ſo ſoon, that except they be rooted up, they wil come up in time; ſo it is here, there is not only injections of the Devil in us, but our corrupt heart riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to it, it is one thing to have ſome filthy thing caſt upon us, and another thing to have the Body ſo rotten that a ſtinking ſteam ſhould come from the Body it ſelf, one may have ſome unſavory thing caſt upon him and ſo be unſavory, but when the Body is rotten and that caſt upon one, that would be more unſavory, ſo it is here, may be the Devil may bring ſome temptation

                  <p>Laſtly, The ſinfulneſs of our Nature is a Burden in this reſpect, that it wil damp all the activity of our Graces, the livelyneſs of our Graces, now the Saints of God make it to be the joy of their Souls to be active and ſtirring for God, but now this Corruption that we carry about with us damps al: as now a candle, if it were in a Coal-pit a Mine, there would come a damp that would make the Candle burn dim, ſo the Graces of Gods Spirit, in the beſt of us all, are but as a Candle in a Coal-pit, thy heart is like a Coal-pit, and God hath ſet up a Candle, ſome Grace in thy heart that ſhines there, but now though Chriſt takes care that all the damps of thy Corruption ſhal not put out thy Candle, yet God ſomtimes dimmes this Candle that it doth not ſhine ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, takes away the beauty, livelineſs, and activity of thy Graces, that though thou haſt ſome life and burnings, yet thou burneſt but dimly before others with whom thou doſt converſe. I do not now ſpeak of the ſtirring of ſin, the working of ſin, that is the next thing that I ſhal open, how that is a Burden to the Hearts of the Saints; as for inſtance, you know that the Scripture tels us that the fleſh fights againſt the Spirit, and the ſpirit fights againſt the fleſh, there is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fighting by this Corruption againſt al that is good, now that there ſhould be Corruption in the Heart that continually fights againſt God, that is a more fearful thing, ſo it is in thy Heart. Now to be alwaies in a fight or a combate it is a fearful thing, we count it a great burden that there ſhould be Wars and Rumors of Wars within our gates, I but, there is a greater war in thy Heart. It is a thing that was not thought poſſible

ever to be in <hi>England,</hi> that there ſhould be found ſuch a Generation that ſhould indanger their lives to make them and their poſterity ſlaves, and yet for this they fight, who doth not ſee but the victory wil be this in the Concluſion. But I wil ſhew you a worſe thing then this in every of your Hearts, there are ſuch Corruptions in your Hearts, as put your Souls to fight to miſcheif your ſelves; to bring your ſelves to be ſlaves to the Devil, this is in your Hearts, though indeed ſome are not ſenſible of this; and what is the reaſon that if corruption be a Burden that ſome people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eel it not? One Reaſon is this, becauſe they are dead in ſins, if this whole building ſhould fal upon a dead man, he would not feel it, and take this as an infallible argument, that thou art dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, if thou doſt not feel the Burden of thy corruption, that man and woman that is not ſenſible of the ſin that is in their Souls, I dare in the Name of God, pronounce that Man or Woman dead. As it is in Nature, though we may looſe the ſenſe of ſeeing, or of ſmelling, or of hearing, yet we may live, yet the ſenſe of feeling or touching that cannot be loſt, if we be living if we looſe the ſenſe of feeling, certainly that man or Woman is dead, no ſenſe inwardly or outwardly, there is ſome ſenſe of feeling, ſo long as there is life. So here, though there may be many weakneſſes in men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet when they do not feel the Burden of their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions at al, certainly they are dead men and Women. Now you that are weary and heavy Laden, come to me, (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>And I will give you Reſt,</hi> know, that Chriſt ſpeaks to you, not only out of pity, as to thoſe that Labor under the Burden of Legal performances, but out of love, and know, that by this you come to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Chriſt and it is that that is as delightful to the heart of Chriſt to give eaſe and Reſt to his poor Servants that Labor under the Burden of Corruption as to do any thing in the world; it was a ſpecial end why Chriſt came into the world, to diſſolve the works of the Devil, our

Corruptions are from the Devil, and are tied cloſe to us, and they eaſily beſet us, (as the expreſſion is) now I ſay it was the end why Jeſus Chriſt came into the world, to diſſolve the works of the Devil, that is, when he ſees his poor Servants under this burden and to cry out under it, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, who ſhal deliver me, then Chriſt comes to cut this bond and ſo to diſſolve the works of the Devil and give eaſe and Reſt to their Spirits. You do wel when you ſtruggle and ſtrive againſt your Corruptions with all the ſtrength you have, but the great work you have to do that you may be delivered from your Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is, to renew your act of Faith in Chriſt, to make uſe of thoſe Scriptures wherein Chriſt is ſaid to be our Sanctification, as wel as our Redemption, and to act our Faith upon thoſe Scriptures, and that is the way to eaſe our Souls of theſe Burdens.</p>

               <p>NOw beſides the Corruption of our Nature, the ſtirring of Corruption is very burdenſome unto the Soul; I ſuppoſe if a Man or Woman did know what corrupt Nature is in them, and though this corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not ſtir, yet it would be very burdenſome, but we are to know that this corrupt Nature doth not lie ſtil,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44661:60"/>
but is alwayes working, ſtirring, acting and putting it ſelf forth unto that that is evil, now the motions of ſin are burdenſome.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Firſt, they are continually fighting againſt the Spirit of God, and the ſpirit of grace in the heart, the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, now to have a continual fighting and Combating in the ſoul, is it not very burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; as a family where there is a continual falling out, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a day that you come to ſome families but there is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out, and fighting, is it not burdenſome to live in ſuch a family? now in the hearts of men and women there is a continual fighting. If one ſhould be in a family where the husband and wife is continually fighting one with an other, and the children and ſervants flying in the face one of an other that would be burdenſome, now in the heart of man there is the fleſh and ſpirit continually fighting one againſt another, is not war in a kingdome a burden? and eſpecially, when men ſhal fight to make themſelves ſlaves, as I ſaid before would any man ever have thought it poſſible that there ſhould be ſuch folly in the hearts of any in <hi>England,</hi> to fight to make themſelves and their poſterity ſlaves, that the very victory that they ſhould get was to bring them to be ſlaves, now the fight with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption it is for this end.</p>
               <p n="2">2, And then the ſtirring of corruption is ſudden, many times a man or woman that is gracious and godly, that finds their heart in ſome good temper and working for God, ſuddenly their corruptions wil be ſtirring in them unexpectedly, which is extream greife and damp to their ſpirits, and cauſeth many times exceeding much trouble to them ſuddenly, that no body can underſtand the cauſe of it but themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And then the ſtirring of Corruption is violent, the ſtirring of Corruption in the hearts of the Saints are many times extream violent and outragious, the divel ſtirs up their Corruption, and indeed the corruptions themſelves are as it were divels in them, that do as the divel that was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44661:61"/>
ready to be caſt out of him that was poſſeſſed, he cauſeth him to foam at the mouth, ſo there is extreame violence of corruption in the hearts of the Saints. It was a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable conditition of the poor Child that was poſſeſſed in the Goſpel, when the father came to Chriſt for help, becauſe when the evil ſpirit came it caſt him into the fire and into the water. So corruption is ſo violent in the hearts of the godly, that it is ready to caſt them into the fire and into the water, to do thoſe things that are againſt their own inclination, againſt their prayers, againſt their reſolutions, againſt their vowes, againſt their covenants, though they ſee ſuch a thing to be evil, are convinced of it, though they find a ſtrong inclination againſt the evil, though they have been at prayer to God to help them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, though they reſolve with the ſtrongeſt reſolutions againſt it, yea though they vow and Covenant yea they come to the ſacrament and ſet to their ſeale, ſo violent is their corruption that it carries and hurries them on in wayes of evil notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again the motions and ſtirring of Corruption are very burdenſome unto the Saints, in regard of the confuſed diſorder that there is in the motions of their corruptions, there is much diſorder and confuſion in the heart when corruption doth ſtir, which cauſeth much diſturbance; what cauſeth more diſturbance in a State, in a Family, in a Town then confuſion and diſorder? nothing is more diſorderly and confuſed then the corruption in our hearts, and therefore burdenſome, it cauſes much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity in the hearts of the Saints, becauſe they find their corruptions working and ſtirring in ſuch a confuſed way, they find ſometimes when they are in duty ſuch ſtrange confuſed working of their hearts, that it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream burden upon them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Further the corruption of the heart works very maliciouſly and therefore the more burdenſome, that is, it watcheth eſpecially thoſe times wherein it may do us moſt miſchief, then it wil be moſt ſtirring as a malicious

enemy, wil not only be troubleſome to one that he is an enemy unto at ſometimes, but he watcheth if there be any time wherein he may do him more miſchief then another; I wil take that time, ſaith an enemy; ſo the corruptions of the hearts of men, they watch when they may do the ſoul the greateſt miſcheif, now many a chriſtian may think, though I find much corruption ſtirring many times yet if I could but be free when I get alone to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, O! that it would let me alone at that time; and ſo though I find it ſtirring at other times, yet if it would let me alone at the hearing of the word; but it comes at that time eſpecially, you wil have evil thoughts at prayer more then ever you had, and at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word light workings of ſpirit more then at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, and not only at the word but if there be but one truth that doth more neerly concerne the good of your ſoules then another, you ſhal find your corruptions to hinder you then, more then at another time, and ſo at the ſacrament, and faſting, there it wil be more working then at another time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. yea and further, if there be any time, that through Gods mercy in a day of prayer, faſting, and the like, if you can get your hearts to any comfortable frame, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs of heart, renewed reſolutions to walk in the waies of God more ſtrictly then before; as many times it is in dayes of faſting and prayer, above al times wil your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions be ſtirring after that, more then any time, thus maliciouſly when it may do you the greateſt michief, then it wil be moſt working. Now what a burden is this to the ſoule! as it is ſaid of Chriſt, in <hi>Matth.</hi> the latter end, There you have the ſtory of Chriſts baptiſme, and when he was baptiſed, then came the holy Ghoſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in the likeneſs of a dove, and this manfeſtation of God from heaven, <hi>This is my beloved ſonn in whom I am wel pleaſed</hi>; wel, preſently ſaith the text, he was led into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the divel, God was in the worke, but the devil was malicious againſt him
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44661:62"/>
preſently after a glorious manifeſtation of God the father to him, As it was with Chriſt your ſavior, ſo you muſt expect it wil be with you, Chriſt when he had ſuch a glorious manifeſtation of God the father from heaven to him, then he was led aſide, then the divel preſently came upon him, ſo it wil many times be with you, when at any time you have got your hearts up to God in a day of faſting, prayer, or the like, and have got ſome ſenſe of Gods love, take heed of ſecurity at that time more then at al times and that is the reaſon that you ſhal find, if you obſerve it, that very often after a day of faſting, after ſuch a day that you have got moſt in, if not the very night, yet the next day, you wil find ſtrong workings of the corruptions of your herets, to keep them down im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after that time, for the ſtirring of corruptions they are very malicious, and watch for the time that they may do us the greateſt miſchief of al.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Further the ſtirring of the Corruptions that remain in us, are very burdenſome in regard of their unſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by that I meane this, (to ſpeak plainly to your hearts) the ſtirrings of our corruptions, if we ſhal gratifie them many times, yeild to them, as it were, for peace ſake, as ſometimes the heart of a man or woman is ſo troubled with the workings of corruption that they think they muſt needs yield that they might be quiet, wel if thou ſhalt yeild to them to quiet them, they wil come upon thee more and more, with greater ſtrength they wil come upon thee then before, as now, if any one that is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to us in ſeeking to get ſuch and ſuch a thing of us, and at length becauſe of trouble to us we yield to them, then afterwards they grow more and more upon us, incroach more and more upon us and are very troubleſome and burdenſome to us, it is ſo in the ſtirring of corruption, if you yield to your corruption for one thing, it comes more and more upon you, ſo that the only quiet you can have is by being at open defiance with them; now this is another thing wherby the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44661:62"/>
of the hearts of Gods people are very burdenſome to them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly, The Corruptions in the hearts of Gods people are very burdenſome, becauſe they are very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, this is an higher degree: they are burdenſome in the root, and then in the working they are more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but then in the prevailing they are yet more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome; If ſo be a Child of God, that looks into his hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is true, the Saints of God they ſhal get the day at laſt, but here as long as they live, their corruptions often prevail and foiles them which is very grievous and burdenſome to them.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOw it muſt needs be that a gracious heart muſt feel theſe things to be very burdenſome.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the life of Grace, whereſoever it is, is a very tender and delicate thing; nothing is ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and tender as the life of Grace, and therefore it muſt needs be ſenſible of this burden of Corruption ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what degree it doth remain in the Soul. As thus, you know a man or Woman, the more delicate and tender they are in their fleſh, having had very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bringing up, or it may be their natural Spirits are very delicate more then other men, ſome men their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſpirits are more groſs, and can bear burdens with leſs ſenſe, but now thoſe that are more finer and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44661:66"/>
if you lay a burden upon them, Oh! How bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome is it unto them, now Grace makes the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to be delicate, fine, and pure; a pure conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it puts the Hearts into a moſt pure conſtitution, and therefore it muſt needs be ſenſible of the evil of ſin according to the remainers of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Where Grace is, Corruption muſt needs be very burdenſome in this regard alſo, becauſe that Grace keeps the Soul in continual action and ſtirring, now look as a man that hath a Leg that is broken, if he could lie ſtil, and never ſtir, it would not be ſo grievous and burdenſome to him, the pain and breaking of his Leg would not be ſo burdenſome if he could lie ſtil, but if this man, whoſe Leg is broken, muſt be ſtirring, walking, and going up and down, Oh! how burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is it that his Leg is broke. So it is with the Soul, it is true, if the Soul might be ſtil a ſleep, and doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then, though there be Corruption in them, it would not be ſo grievous, I but Grace whereever it is puts the Soul unto action; and therefore it is called, the divine Nature, becauſe it is active, it puts the Soul on to be acting for God, and in the waies of life, now Grace putting the Soul to be acting, and Corruption that being as the breaking of the bones, it muſt needs be very burdenſome, that which moſt hinders their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Grace muſt needs be very burdenſome. You had need therefore take heed what you do when temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ſin comes, take heed you do not break your bones, and your Leggs, Why? Becauſe when you have broken them you muſt be ſtil ſtirring and acting for God. A poor man, it is a great deal worſe for him, if he break his Leg, then a Rich man; a Rich man may ſit by the fire, or lie in his bed a month together, but a poor man, if he break his Legg he doth not know what to do, he muſt to work, perhaps he cannot have that harbor that a Rich man may have, ſo I ſay, thoſe that are of ſluggiſh ſpirits, though Corruption prevaile it is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44661:66"/>
not ſo grievous unto them, but thoſe that are of active ſpirits and have Grace, and the more Grace that any man or Woman hath, the more burdenſome their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are, becauſe the more Grace there is in the Soul, the more active it wil be for God.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you wil ſay, <hi>Seeing the remaining of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Heurts of the Saints is ſo burdenſom, why doth God ſo order things in his providence, as his own dear Saints ſhould be ſo troubled with their Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions while they live in this world? God could deliver them from their Corruptions, why wil God make them cry out,</hi> O Wreched man that I am, who ſhal deliver me from this Body of Death? <hi>God could as wel perfect our Sanctification, as our Juſtification: why doth God thus order things in his providence, that his own dear Saints ſhould groan under ſuch a burden of Corruption al their daies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For that breifly thus, Though it is true, that God could preſently take all our Corruptions; as ſoon as ever we come to Jeſus Chriſt, God could deliver us from our Corruptions, but the Lord wil not, he hath many holy ends why he doth ſuffer his own people to be under this burden while they live here in the fleſh, As.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That hereby he may ſhew forth his own power, the power of Jeſus Chriſt is exceeding magnified in this, that it can uphold little ſparks of Grace in the midſt of an Ocean of Corruption, that it can uphold poor weak Creatures under ſuch burdens, and carry them on not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, and bring them to eternal Life; the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, and the power of God, is as much manifeſted in this thing, as it is in keeping Heaven and Earth upon the Frame, or keeping it in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Lord doth not appear more to be an almighty God, in keeping Heaven and Earth in being, then he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44661:67"/>
doth appeare to be an Almighty God in keeping grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the heart notwithſtanding al the remainder of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, ſo that in this God hath Glory in another way then he hath from the Angels in heaven; the power of God appeares in upholding of the Angels, for if he did not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, they would fal into evil, as <hi>Adam</hi> and the other Angels did, but therein appeares Gods glorious power to uphold the Angels: but the glorious power in upholding the Angels, doth not ſo much appeare, as the glorious power of God in upholding the hearts of the Saints in the midſt of their corruptions; this ſhal be a ſpecial argument that the Saints ſhal praiſe God for, to al eternity, when they ſhal look back, and ſee what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were in before their converſion, yea, in their converſion, that though God granted them ſome grace, yet what abundance of Corruption was in their hearts al that time, and what a deal of ſtir they had to maintain that little grace; they wil ſtand and admire to conſider, that it ſhould be kept alive in the midſt of ſin, that a little ſparke ſhould be kept alive in the midſt of the Sea, not only in the midſt of the Sea, but when the ſea is tempeſtuous, you yil ſay it is no great wonder that the fire be kept burning when the ſea is calme; but when al is in a ſtorme, and yet a ſpark of fire ſhal be kept alive in the midſt of al the toſſings of the waves, you wil grant here is a mighty power: now the keeping alive of grace in thy heart in the midſt of ſo much corruption: doth argue as mighty a power in God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord doth ſo order it that ſtil his own people ſhal be under the burden of much coruption in this regard, becauſe that hereby the Lord draweth forth the exerciſe of faith in his ſon, in which his ſoul takes infinite delight, the ſoule of God takes infinite delight in beholding the working of the glorious grace of faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But you wil ſay wherein doth it appeare to be ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in regard of our corruption? Thus, for the Angels in heaven to believe in God, that he wil be eternally good
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44661:67"/>
to them, it is not ſo much, as for a poor ſoul in the midſt of al his corruptions, yet to be able to Triumph in the free grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt; notwithſtanding I am ſo vild, filthy, loathſome, and abominable to myſelf, and juſtly God and his Saints may count me a burden to them and caſt me off for ever, yet for al this, my ſoul ſhal cling to him, I wil caſt my ſelf upon him, and look upon him as a gracious father, a merciful God, a God that loves me, a God that rejoyceth in doing Good to me; for the ſoul to exerciſe faith in the Grace of God in Chriſt, it is a glorious thing, only take heed you do not miſtake it for preſumption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You wil ſay, <hi>For men notwithſtanding al their ſin to beleeve in Gods mercy this is rather preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption then faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, it is preſumpion in many, they miſtake themſelves, but in others it is true faith, and God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in it, and you ſhal know it by this; it doth draw the heart to God and the ſoul never finds ſuch a prevalent way to overcome thoſe corruptions that are in it, as to exerciſe their faith in the grace of God in Chriſt. I beſeech you, mark the difference between preſumption and faith in Chriſt, preſumption wil truſt in Gods mercy notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſin, but that doth indeed foment their ſin and makes them ſecure in their ſin, makes them the more ſecure in their ſin, but now when the ſoul ſhal by the true geminine act of faith reſt in the free grace of God not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding corruption, if it be right, ſuch a ſoul feels no means in the world of greater efficacy to cure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt corruption then this, to truſt in the free grace of God notwithſtanding corruption: and if thou findeſt it thus, thou haſt no cauſe to feare, truſt in Gods grace with confidence, for it is that which is wel pleaſing unto God, and that which the Lord delights in, and that which gives as much content to Gods heart as the exerciſe of any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44661:68"/>
grace whatſoever, and in that regard, becauſe the Saints ſhal never exerciſe ſuch an act of Faith in Heaven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s this, God wil have this in this world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is that that God ſees doth drive his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to him in prayer, nothing drives the Saints to God with more earneſtneſs in prayer, then the feeling of the weight of Corruption upon them, then they goe to God above al, God never heares ſuch ſtrong cryes come up to heaven in regard of any affliction as this; and by the way, you may find by this how your hearts are, when the hand of God is upon you in afflictions, then you wil cry to God, but I put this to you, hath there not come as ſtrong cryes to heaven upon the ſence of your Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as upon the ſence of any Affliction whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lord hath glory in this, in the exerciſe of the work of repentance, and humility; the keeping the Souls of his people in humility, and the contrition of their Spirits, that is exceeding pleaſing to God, the Lord is neer to a broken contrite heart, a melting mourning ſpirit, the Lord doth delight in the evangelical workings of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, this pleaſeth the Lord; the work of humiliation, mourning and ſorrow for ſin in an evangelical way, is a grace that is acceptable to God; God ſhal have none of that in heaven, and he hath it therefore here.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God hereby exerciſeth his wiſdome exceedingly, in bringing light out of darkeneſs; God doth many times turne, not only the afflictions of his people to their good, but he workes good many times out of ſin, not that hereby we ſhould be bold and preſumptuous in our ſins, we muſt take head of tempting God, yet know this, that God doth many times work exceeding much good unto the Saints, even out of their ſins, by occaſion of ſin, though their ſin hath no efficacy in this, but God takes occaſion in this, in otherwaies of his providences and workings of his grace to work good unto them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is Gods juſtice in it alſo, to lay a ſtumbling block before wicked and ungodly men, for when they ſhal
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44661:68"/>
ſee, that the godly that have the moſt grace they have much corruption in them ſtil, they rejoyce perhaps in it, and they little think that God aimes at the execution of his juſt judgment upon them that it ſhould harden their hearts, many wicked men, they think their condition to be very good, becauſe they ſee ſo much corruption in the hearts of the godly, and they are hardened therby, but they little think that God aymes at the execution of his juſt judgment upon them thereby.</p>
               <p n="7">7. God doth it for this reaſon, that the Saints may long more after heaven, therefore it is that the Lord in the ordering of his providence workes ſo, that they ſhould be kept under the burden of Corruption in this world, that they might long to be in heaven with their father, and that when they come to heaven they might know the difference between heaven and earth, between their ſtate there in heaven, and their ſtate here on earth. Thus though corruption may be a great burden to us while we live here in this world, yet the Lord hath many great ends and purpoſes to ſuffer thee, a poor creature, to be under remaining corruption, and therefore thou canſt not draw any ſuch argument, God loves me not, for if he loved me he would deliver me from this corruption, I have been praying a longtime to be delivered, and yet I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, do not gather any ſuch arguments from it, you know Paul prayed once and again, and al the anſwer he had was, my grace ſhal be ſufficient for thee: ſo though thou prayeſt under the burden of corruption again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, yet if once God ſay thus to thy ſoul, my grace ſhal be ſufficient for thee, thy corruption ſhal not cruſh thee and undo thee, but I wil ſſtrengthen thee, this wil be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
               <p>Now from al this that hath been ſaid, you may by way of conſequence ſee.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a great deal of difference between the ſins of the Godly and the ſins of the Wicked: the wicked they ſin, and the godly ſin too, we uſe to ſay we are al ſinners, but it is to the one a burden, to the other a delight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:44661:69"/>Secondly, You may ſee from hence alſo one reaſon why the Saints of God go on ſometimes ſo ſadly in their wayes, thou doſt not know what burdens they are under.</p>
               <p>But you wil ſay, we are better we do not feele it. No, they have not ſo much ſin as thou haſt, they have got ſome grace, thou haſt none, they have in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees mortified their ſins, thou haſt not; yea, they have their ſins pardoned, thou haſt not; but yet though they have ſome aſſurance, that the guilt of their Sin is removed, yet the very remaining of the Corruptions of their hearts is their burden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You wil ſay <hi>Why ſhould it be ſo burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome if they know the guilt of their Sin to be forgiven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I beſeech you obſerve it, there is a deale of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a carnal heart, and a Godly heart; one that hath a carnal heart, if he can be eaſed from the burden of conſcience, he is no more troubled; but now a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart, though he be firſt burdened with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the guilt of ſin, &amp; that burden be removed, yet there remaining a body of death, there is another burden ſtil upon him: ſo that the very remaining of ſome corruption is a greater burden unto him, then al thy corruption that is in the ful ſtrength of it, and together with thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion al the guilt that is upon thee; only thou art dead in ſin and doſt not feel it, if a whole building fal down, thoſe that are buried in the grave they would not feel it, but al you that are alive, if it ſhould fal down would feele it: ſo the wicked have the burden of their corruption in the ful ſtrength of it; in the guilt of it upon them and they feel it not, for they are dead; but the Godly, though they have the guilt of Sin removed, yet the very leaſt ſin remaining in them is a burden, though they have morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their ſin, and do it every day, yet the remaining of ſin is a great burden to them. And hence you may ſee the reaſon of the watchfulneſs of the Saints over their ſpirits, why they ſpend ſo much time, and riſe ſo early to heare the word, what is the reaſon you wil ſay, they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44661:69"/>
know that if they do not Labor under the burden of their Corruptions to a void ſin, it wil be a greater burden to Labor under the burden of ſin afterwards. Now you do not watch over ſin, becauſe you do not know what a grievous burden ſin is when they Labor under it, but ſuch a one as feels the Burden of Sin, the Lord be merciful to me, I had thought (ſaith he) my Back would have broke under the Burden of ſin. And therefore <hi>David</hi> Praies, for the healing of the bones that were broken: and that is the Reaſon of the watchfulneſs and carefulneſs of the Saints under this burden.</p>
               <p>Now the maine thing that hath been intended in al that I have ſaid about this Burden is this, That I might point out thoſe whom Chriſt cals to himſelf, that you might be prepared to hearken to the invitation of Chriſt to come to him for Reſt (though we are not come to that) yet take notice that there is Reſt in Chriſt for all theſe, from under all theſe Burdens. And ſo much for the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the remaining part of Corruption in the Hearts of the Saints.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe next Burden is, The Burden of affliction, the Burden of outward afflictions, Poverty, diſgrace,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44661:70"/>
ſickneſs, or any kind of trouble in this world; you ſhal find theſe things to be very Burdenſom to you. Now Chriſt cals ſuch as Labor under this Burden to come to him, and promiſeth to give them Reſt, Chriſt hath a tender affection towards poor Creatures under outward burdens, towards all thoſe that the Father hath given to him, eſpecially when they are Burdened with outward affliction and the Goſpel hath in it abundance of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to help and eaſe ſinners that feel the Burden of afflictions in this world, no ſuch way of eaſe and Reſt unto them as by the Grace of God in Chriſt as we ſhal open more fully when we come to the promiſe.</p>
               <p>Now the burden of affliction is very grievous to many, the Burden of poverty, diſgrace, ſickneſs or the like; thoſe whom God lets proſper in their waies, little think what burdens are upon their Brethren; how many in theſe daies are there of our Brethren, that groan under theſe Burdens, though we do not feel them? We know not how ſoon we may be brought under them, and therefore it wil be very ſeaſonable to ſhew the Reſt that we have in Chriſt even from under theſe Burdens. I have ſpent ſome time in opening the grievouſneſs of other Burdens, now this burden of outward afflictions men are ſo ſenſible of, that there needs not much for the opening of them, but only to tel all that feel theſe burdens, that they may come unto this promiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, and they are under this invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſt invites them to come to him for Reſt for theſe Burdens.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Outward afflictions are burdens, becauſe they are in themſelves part of the curſe of the Law, and if they be ſanctified to any, it is by virtue of this promiſe in the Text; if any affliction upon you be Sanctified it is thence. Before you come to Chriſt al outward afflictions, poverty, ſickneſs, or any diſturbance you have in your eſtate, it is in it ſelf the fruit of the curſe, and is ſo to you til you come to Chriſt: now to bear that that is in it ſelf a fruit of the curſe, muſt needs be a burden, becauſe it is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44661:70"/>
to Nature moſt afflictive to Nature, therefore bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Outward afflictions are burdenſom, becauſe they do hinder us much in doing Service, that Service that we were born for, that we were born to do in this world, they do hinder us of many opportunities of doing Service for God, outward Afflictions do. As now ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of body, what a Burden is it? Becauſe it doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe that are continually ſickly from doing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that God requires of them to do, and indeed that makes it to be moſt burdenſom to one that is gracious, it is not ſuch a Burden to one that hath a ſickly body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the pain that he feels, but becauſe by this means my Soul is hindred in thoſe operations that I would be glad to be exerciſed in for God, and doing good in the place I am ſet in. And ſo poverty, is therefore a burden, not becauſe I cannot live ſo bravely as others do, and have as fine Houſes, Clothes, and Diet as others have; No, but becauſe I muſt ſpend all my time meerly in getting proviſion for my family that I have little time for Gods Service; others can ſpend time in Gods Service, hear, pray, and meditate, but the chief time that I have to ſpend is ſpent to get bread; now this is a burden: And beſides becauſe of poverty I have little opportunity to do Service for God, thoſe that have Large eſtates, they have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do God Service, they are called forth to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Services, but I am not ſo as others are, now this is that that to one that hath any beginnings of Grace in his Heart is a great Burden. And by the way, it were a good argument of true Grace, if you that are under the Burden of affliction, if you felt the burden where it lies, I appeal to you that complain of the Burden of affliction, poverty, and the like, that you feel, I put this Queſtion to you in the name of God, what is it that makes your affliction moſt burdenſom? It is true, it is painful to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Oh! But the Lord knows, this is that that makes it grievous, and burdenſom to me, that by means of this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44661:71"/>
affliction, I am fain to ſpend ſo much time about mean works that I have little time to do good in my generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: others that have greater eſtates, I count them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier in this, that the Lord hath given unto them Larger opportunities to do him Service, then I have; I do not count them happy becauſe of their wealth, but becauſe they have larger opportunities to do God Service, but it is God that orders things thus, and I muſt be content to bear this Burden. I ſay, if thou haſt a heart thus complaining of thy Burden, it is a good ſign, and know, that in Chriſt there is abundance of Grace to Sanctifie theſe burdens to thee, divers other things might be ſpoken about the Burden of Affliction, I will add but one more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Outward afflictions is a great burden in this reſpect, becauſe it many times occaſions and helps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward many ſtrong temptations: outward afflictions do ſtrengthen, and do occaſion ſtrong temptations, which are very grievous to the Soul: As thus, when one is under affliction more then others, then comes this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſurely God loves me not, becauſe of this Affliction; then comes temptation to envy others, becauſe I am afflicted more then others; then comes temptation of diſtruſt, I ſhall periſh one day or other; then comes temptation of murmuring under the hand of God; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to take ſhifting Courſes, to ſhift for ones ſelf by unlawful means, Oh! what temptations have many that are under ſtrong afflictions in poverty, impriſonment, diſgrace, diſhonor in the world; what ſtrong temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have they to ſtretch their Conſciences. And this makes outward afflictions a grievous burden, becauſe they occaſion great temptations to poor Souls to ſtretch out their hands to folly, to unlawful courſes many times to help themſelves; Yea, The apprehenſion many times before it comes is ſo grievous, as it occaſions temptation to much Evil to prevent thoſe burdens, and yet for all that, the Lord is ſo pleaſed to order and diſpoſe of things
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44661:71"/>
in this world, that even ſuch as he intends everlaſting good to in Chriſt, go under ſuch burdens as theſe, moſt part of their Lives, they go under the burdens of Poverty, Sickneſs, and outward troubles here in this world.</p>
               <p>Many Reaſons might be given why the Lord ſo orders things in this world, that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear Servants, for whom Chriſt hath ſhed his precious blood, ſhall go under theſe burdens, though others that are wicked and ungodly ſhal ſcarſe know what they are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord doth hereby ſhew, that he wil have his Servants to ſerve and honor him, meerly out of Love, and not in a mercenary way to get outward things in this world, he will have us ſerve him out of Love, and out of Faith; if we ſhould proſper in outward things alwaies, our Service would be more Carnal; but now though his Servants meet with never ſuch Afflictions in this world, yet they love the Lord, and love his waies, and love his ſervice, and go on in faithful obedience to him; this ſhews the excellency of Grace, more then if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered in this world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the Lord ſees this the beſt means to mortifie our Corruptions; many times thou complaineſt of thy afflictions, but who knows if thou had'ſt not ſuch afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what ſins thou would'ſt have.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And God doth this to be a Stumbling block to the wicked, that they ſhould ſtumble at the afflictions of the Saints, and ſo periſh that way. Divers other Reaſons might be given, but all is to make way to that which is to come after, that the Lord cals all theſe, not only thoſe that Labor under the Burden of ſin, under the burden of the Law, &amp;c. But poor Creatures that Labor under the burden of affliction, poverty and the like to come to him for eaſe and Reſt.</p>

               <p>Secondly, What kind of Invitation it is that Chriſt doth make to thoſe that the Father gives to him, that ſhal indeed come to be ſaved by him; what kind of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they have from Chriſt, how Chriſt calls them to him; for this is a calling, and an inviting.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That all that Chriſt requires as a Condition of the Covenant of Grace for reſt unto our ſouls, is to come to him, nothing elſe is the Condition of the Goſpel by which we come to have Chriſt to be ours, but this, to come to him, Come to me ſaith Chriſt: that is the great Condition of the Goſpel, only to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There are ſome Rules to be propounded and obſerved, for our Coming unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The Laboring to draw your Souls unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, <hi>Come to me,</hi> what is that? what would Chriſt have you to do?</p>
               <p>For the opening of that in particular, it is this, When Chriſt calls you to come to him, you are to know, this notes a motion from Chriſt, to come to him.</p>
               <p>Firſt: It implies a beholding, a looking unto Jeſus Chriſt, as being the All-ſufficient Savior, to ſave our ſouls from al the evils that are upon us, and to ſupply unto us al good we ſtand in need of: As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, when he ſaith, Come to me; That is, O! poor, troubled ſinners; that are under theſe burdens, Do you behold me to be the great Mediator that is come into the world, to ſtand between all the wrath of my Father, and your ſouls, and to bring life and ſalvation to you, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44661:73"/>
is imployed, when I would go, I muſt know whither I muſt go, to whom I muſt go, ſo ſaith Chriſt, I am the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> redeemer ſent into the world by my father to that very end, that I may eaſe poor ſoules of their burdens, and ſuch ſoules as you are, look unto Chriſt therefore, as the great reconciler of God and man, the great mediator between God and man, having the fulneſs of al mercy and goodneſs in him, the great meanes of conveyance of al the grace and riches of God the father to ſinful ſouls, that is the firſt work of beleeving in Chriſt, for to look unto him to be ſuch a one as God the Father hath tendred unto us; that is imployed, but yet the ſoul comes not.</p>
               <p>Secondly: But then the ſecond is this, which goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To come to Chriſt, implies an unſetledneſs, when we come to a thing, there is the <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> and the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> we come from ſomething, ſo ſaith Chriſt, you have ſetled your hearts upon creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and you have looked upon them heretofore, as thoſe things wherein your good and happineſs doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but now your hearts muſt be taken off from thoſe, you muſt come to me that is there muſt be a removing from that ſtation you were in, from that kind of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you were before in, I cannot go to another place, and ſtay in the place where I was too: and ſo the heart cannot come to Chriſt and ſtay in the ſtate it was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, therefore that implies, that whereas you poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have ſettled your hearts upon creature comforts, and ſetled your hearts upon ſinful things heretofore, O! now, let your hearts be taken off from al thoſe things, know, that your good, your happineſs, your peace is not here, if you abide here, and ſettle here, you are loſt and undone creatures for ever. Let it not grieve your ſouls to part with the comforts that are here below in the creatures, for certainly, you miſtake, here doth not lie your good and happineſs, ſo that when the ſoul is beginning to ſtir after Chriſt, it is taken off from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, taken off from al creature comforts, looks upon
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44661:73"/>
every thing as vanity; O! Saith the ſoul I am cleerly convinced that my happineſs lies higher then the things here below; theſe are the reaſonings of the heart that is in motion to go to Chriſt. And not onely to be unſetled from the creature, but I muſt be taken off from my ſelf too, from al my righteouſneſs and duties, I muſt not think to ſatisfie God by any thing that I can do, no, but I muſt be convinced, that there is a greater thing required to make up my ſatisfaction with God, then any thing that I can do; and therefore my heart muſt be taken off from theſe things, Heretofore, I reſted in duties, that I was not ſo bad as others, but now I ſee there is another manner of righteouſneſs that I muſt have in a mediator, theſe though they be good in themſelves, yet they are not the things that can ever ſave my ſoul, but if ever I have peace with God and ſtand before him at the great day, it muſt be through another meanes then ever yet I have had, if I had gon on, and had thought to make up my ſatisfaction with God by what I have done, I had been an undone crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yea, my heart muſt be taken off from mine one bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, not to reſt in any thing that is in my ſelf, but I muſt go out and deny my ſelf, and ſo look for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life out of my ſelf. This is the ſecond thing that is here noted. <hi>Come to me,</hi> that is, firſt behold me, ſee and beleeve that I am the great mediator that is come into the world to ſave your ſouls: and then ſecondly, let there be an unſetling of your hearts, a taking your hearts off from whatſoever you were ſetled upon heretofore, that ſo you may be removed from thence, and that you may take another courſe for your life in Chriſt, and happineſs in him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Come unto me,</hi> that is, let there be a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a ſtirring of your hearts after me; Chriſt calls for the heart of ſinners, after he comes to be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them, they ſhould be in a working, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſpoſition making after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for union with him to the utmoſt that poſſibly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44661:74"/>
they can, the thoughts ſhould be working, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience working, and the wil opening it ſelf to receive in the grace of God, and the affection ſhould he ſtirring, and the whole ſoul ſhould be in a working diſpoſition after him. <hi>Incline your eare and come,</hi> as if Chriſt ſhould ſay though you are under great burdens, yet do not you ſink under them in a diſcouraging way, and lie down in a dul and a heavy way, No but let your hearts be ſtirring, working and acting after me continually, have a care of this, to keep your hearts in a ſtirring and working way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, and the grace that is offered to you in Chriſt, this is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> young beginners ſhould obſerve in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner, if God be beginning to work upon your hearts, you ſhould have a great care to keep your hearts in a ſtir-working, acting frame and diſpoſition after Chriſt; and above al things in the world, take heed of a dul, heavy dead ſpirit at this time when God cals you to come to Chriſt as the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I preſs hard after the mark,</hi> ſo it ſhould be with every poor ſoul that God is drawing after Chriſt, it ſhould be alwaies in a comming diſpoſition and they ſhould preſs hard toward the mark of the high prize of the calling that is ſet before them, Chriſt is ſet before thee, God ſets his ſon before thee with the treaſure of grace, and thou ſhouldeſt preſs and follow hard after God (as it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>David</hi> in one of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> 63, 8.) a hard following, ſtirring and working of the ſoul after the Lord as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to his ſon <hi>Solomon</hi> in 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.16. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p and be doing and the Lord wil be with thee,</hi> ſo I ſay to al unto whom the grace of God is offered, they muſt not be dul and ſullen, but up and be doing As the Apoſtle ſpeakes, in 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 20. <hi>According to the earneſt expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> the word that is tranſlated, <hi>earneſt expectation</hi> in the original, ſignifies to ſtretch out the neck, to look after ſome good that I would fain have come, that is the propriety of the word in the original text: ſo this ſhould be comming to Chriſt, that is, when Chriſt is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44661:74"/>
in the goſpel, there ſhould be the ſtretching out of the ſoul, in looking after the Lord Jeſus and a working of the ſoul after Jeſus Chriſt, keeping the ſoul working and ſtirring after Chriſt. Many poor ſouls, whom God is beginning to work his grace upon, looſe abundance of time and comfort, for want of this, of keeping their hearts in a working and ſtirring frame after Chriſt, they ſpend their time in the afflicting of their ſoules, but they do not keep their hearts working towards Jeſus Chriſt. As <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to his ſons, when they wanted bread in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>We have heard that there is corn in</hi> Egipt <hi>and why do we ſtand looking one upon an other?</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi> to his ſons, had you gon (ſaith he) you might have been come back again, and brought us bread by this time, ſo I ſay to many burdened ſouls, haſt thou not heard, that there is grace and mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, had thy ſoul bin working, ſtirring, and kept in an acting frame after Jeſus Chriſt, thou mighteſt have bin returnig, and have gotten reſt to thy ſoul by this time, thou ſtandeſt looking unto this thing, and the other thing, and poring upon thy corruptions, hadſt thou kept thy heart continually ſtirring in a working frame after Chriſt, the work might have been done by this time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Come to me,</hi> that is, ſaith Chriſt, come and lay al your burdens upon mee, come and role your hearts upon mee whatever burden it is, either of your ſoules or afflictions outwardly, what ever your feares and troubles are, yet come, and do you caſt al your burdens upon me, I am content to beare them al. That is a ſpecial work of faith, for the ſoul to role it ſelf upon Jeſus Chriſt, to caſt it ſelf with al its burdens upon the infinite rich, free grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, is it the burden of ſin? I have borne the burden of ſin already, Is it the wrath of God that is a burden to you? come and caſt this burden upon me, I have born the wrath of God; Or is it the burden of the Law? I have borne that burden for you, I was made an offering for you. I was made
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44661:75"/>
under the law, to deliver you from under the law. Is it the burden of any affliction? That was upon me. It is true, the burden of corruption was not upon him, but Chriſt wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from that too. Come to me, and whatever burden is upon your ſouls, caſt it upon me, role your ſouls &amp; al your burdens upon me (ſaith Chriſt) and I wil give you reſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, <hi>Come to me,</hi> that is, come and leave your ſoules with me, and commit them to me for life, for ſalvation, for peace, for whatſoever good you would have, be willing to betruſt me with your ſouls, be willing to betruſt me with al your comforts, be willing to betruſt me both with your preſent and with your eternal eſtate, in al your tranſanctions with God and dealing with God, truſt me withal; that is comming to Chriſt. When Chriſt bids us come to him, it is as much as if he ſhould ſay, come to me, and leave your ſouls, leave al your care, and commit to me al that you have, and whatſoever you are commit your ſelves wholly to me, to be diſpoſed of by me for al good whatſoever, and I wil take charge of you, I wil ingage my ſelf and al my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to have a care of you, and ſuply you in al your wants, and ſtrengthen you under al your burdens, and carry you through al difficulties, and bring you at length to life and ſalvation and perfect reſt together with my Father and my ſelf, that is the meaning of Chriſt when he ſaith, Come to me. So the Apoſtle in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>I know in whom I have beleeved, and that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him.</hi> That which I have committed to him, what is that? that is, his very ſoul, his life, his peace, his comfort, al his happineſs, he had committed to him, and ſo left al with him. Now then, take al theſe together, and when Chriſt cals the ſinner to come to him, that is. O! Sinner firſt beleeve this, that I am the great redeemer that is come into the world, to ſtand between Gods wrath and your ſoules, and to make up peace between God and you, and let there be an unſettling of your hearts from whatſoever
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44661:75"/>
heretofore your Souls did Reſt in, Creature comforts, your own Righteouſneſs, Duties, ſelf reſpects and ends, whatſoever they are, let your hearts be taken off from them all, and let your hearts now be in a ſtirring, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſition towards me, let all your whole Souls be ſtretching forth to me, and come and caſt all your burdens upon me, and leave your Souls with me, and I will take care of them, thus come to me.</p>
               <p>Now then, when any ſoul that is thus Laden, ſhall anſwer to this cal of Chriſt, and ſhal ſay, Lord, I come, here is the very voice and anſwer of Faith, when the Soul can ſay, Oh! Lord, I come, I ſee thee to be the bleſſed Mediator between God and my Soul, and for whatſoever my heart hath ſetled in heretofore, Oh! Lord, it ſhal be no more, and my heart begins to ſtir after thee, and I ſtretch forth my Soul to thee, O, Bleſſed redeemer, and here I caſt my burdens upon thee, none can eaſe me but thy ſelf, and I leave my ſelf with thee, I commit all to thee, and betruſt all that I have or can do, my eternal eſtate with thee, Lord, I come, here is the ſoul that comes to Chriſt. Then may the Soul be ſaid to come to Chriſt when there is an anſwer in theſe five Particulars. All this is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this word COME, though you cannot apprehend it, til it be unfoulded: as a piece of needle work, when it is foulded up, there is all the work indeed within, but we cannot ſee it, til it be laid open, and ſpread before us, then we can ſee all that is in it: So though there be many expreſſions in the Scripture that we underſtand not, yet there they be, but this is the work of the Miniſtry, to ſpread them, and to lay them before you, and lay them open to you, that you may ſee the Grace of God in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner when they be unfolded, now thus doth Chriſt call thoſe that are Laden to come to him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>How Chriſt calls Sinners unto him, ſet forth in two Particulars, Namely, <hi>1.</hi> By an outward and general call. <hi>2.</hi> By a Particular call to Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sinners. And how to know the voice of Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu will ſay, how, and in what manner doth Chriſt call to me, Chriſt is in Heaven, I cannot hear Chriſt call to me.</p>
               <p>Now for the call of Chriſt, Firſt, There is a general cal in the word, there Chriſt calls under the ſound of the Goſpel to come to him, but this call is rather a command of Chriſt then an invitaion, to ſhew unto al what is their Duty to do, rather then to invite them. But now, there is a more ſpecial call unto thoſe whom the Father hath given to Chriſt, and though they make uſe of the general call in the word, yet there is a ſpecial call to them, that is, Chriſt by his Spirit doth open the Riches of the Goſpel of the Grace in him to their Souls by his Spirit inwardly, he doth ſhew them to their Souls. Others come and hear the outward cal, that is when a Miniſter of God ſhal come and open the Goſpel, and there ſhew how God hath given his Son to us, he hath taken our Nature upon him, and died for ſin, and tel them that God requires all here in the Goſpel to beleeve in his Son, they hear his outward cal, I but they whom the father gives to Chriſt have the Spirit of God ſent together with the word, to open the Riches of Chriſt, that though they have heard it a hundred times before, Yet when the ſpirit comes, there is a ſhewing of the beauty and Riches of the Goſpel, more then ever, that allures their Souls to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:44661:76"/>Secondly, Not only this, but the Lord when he cals ſuch as ſhall indeed have mercy by Chriſt, and have his invitation to be effectual, he doth give a Particular cal unto that Soul, beſides the general cal: God doth not only in the word cal ſinners, and ſaith Chriſt came to ſave Sinners, and thoſe that were loſt, but Chriſt comes in Particular to ſuch and ſuch Souls, and cals them in a Particular ſpecial manner. For the Miniſters of God they are bound in the Preaching of the Goſpel, to give a general invitation to come to him, but God beſide the general hath a Particular cal, there is a voice of God in Particular to the Soul that he intends to bring to his Son, ſuch a one <hi>hears a voice behind him</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaks) <hi>ſaying this is the way,</hi> to Salvation, the way you have gone all this while is not the way to life, you will periſh in that way, Chriſt is the right way. As thus; I will open it in the general and Particular call by this ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. A Prince that hath had many of his ſubjects Traitors, yet he is pleaſed to ſend forth a general Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, makes a Proclamation to thoſe ſubjects, and makes it in general tearms, that though you have been thus and thus Traiterous againſt me, yet I am content every one that will come to ſuch a place, at ſuch a day, and ſubmit himſelf, he ſhall have a pardon; here is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Proclamation, and this is incouragement to come. But now ſuppoſe there were ſome poor Traitor that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſenſible of his wickedneſs, and how unreaſonably he hath dealt with his Prince, and may be ſits alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning his condition, and troubled in his ſpirit, and thinks with himſelf, how ſhall I be able to ſee the Face of my Prince, Oh! woe to me for the wickedneſs of my waies: Suppoſe the Prince ſhould come by and behold ſuch a one, take notice of him that is got into ſome corner or other, and is there ſmiting of his Breaſt, and lamenting his condition that he ſhould ſo provoke his Prince as he hath done. And ſhould call this poor creature, and ſay to him, Oh thou poor Creature that art in ſuch a place,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44661:77"/>
come thou to me. For ſo is the work of faith, God comes in particular to the ſoul, doth not only come in general, but after his general Call, when he doth ſee the ſoul troubled, the Lord doth give a particular Call to him, and ſaith, O! thou poor Creature, thou art under this burden, and thus ſenſible of it, and lamenteſt that thou haſt lived thus and thus, and made ſuch a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and thy ſoul, do thou come to me. And the truth is, till God ſpeak in particular to the ſoul, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of God in general, will not bring in ſinners, ſo Chriſt doth not only ſay in general, Come to me, but cals them in particular.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You will ſay, How ſhall we know it is the voyce of Chriſt? that is the third particular. Chriſt doth by the Spirit, ſecretly perſwade the ſoul, that it is his voyce, and not the voyce of deluſion; according to that in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2 8. <hi>The voyce of my beloved.</hi> As it is, when the Soul is departed from God, and comes again to him, the Lord Chriſt makes the Soul to know his voyce. So when he was in this world, after his Reſurrection, he confers with <hi>Mary</hi> a while, and ſhe thought it had been the Gardiner, and Chriſt he ſpeaks but a word, ſpeaks to her, and ſaies, <hi>Mary; Rabboni,</hi> (ſaith ſhe) Maſter preſently. Chriſt did not tell her, he was the Chriſt, but he ſaid <hi>Mary,</hi> and preſently <hi>Mary</hi> knew it was the voyce of Chriſt. And ſo when the Spirit of Chriſt ſpeaks to the ſoul, there is ſuch a ſecret inſtinct, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion and manifeſtation of God to it, that it doth know indeed that it is the voyce of God. I have been often at a Sermon, and heard many good men preach Chriſt, but I hear the voyce of Chriſt this day in my ſoul, and I know it is the voyce of Chriſt: Thus doth the ſoul that comes to Chriſt effectually.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And further, The invitation of Chriſt, when it is indeed effectual, as I know it is Chriſts voyce, Chriſt comes and knocks at the door, and the ſoul knows who it is (that is to be applyed to his particular Call). As
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44661:77"/>
Chriſt ſaith, I <hi>ſtand at the door and knock:</hi> that is to be referred to the ſecond particular, <hi>I ſtand and knock at the door, and if any man will open to me, I will come in to him, and ſup with him.</hi> God doth not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim pardon, but comes to the door of the ſoul, and ſtands at thy door particularly: you cannot but find this by experience, you that have the work of Grace upon you, you have lived under the means a long time, but God comes and knocks at your doors alſo; which is a mighty condeſcention of a Prince, that doth not only ſend ſorth a Proclamation, but knocks at the poor Traitors door; and ſo doth Chriſt: and when that is done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoul doth indeed come and caſt himſelf ſo upon Chriſt, and commit himſelf to Chriſt, there are ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret items and intimations that God doth intend love to it in particular, that he hath thoughts of love and mercy to the ſoul, though I have been very vile, and very wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, yet partly I gather it, by the way of God towards me, that there is thoughts of mercy to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>How doth that appear, that there is any ſuch intimation of Gods go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſs to a ſoul in particular when it is called to come to Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will give you this Ground, When the ſoul comes to Chriſt, and caſts it ſelf upon Chriſt, it doth it not at a meer venture, and knows not whether he ſhall have mercy or no. It is true, I come to Chriſt, and there is no other help, but I know not whether I ſhall have mercy or no, or whether there be any mercy or no for me, this is not the work of faith, this way is neer to faith indeed, when the ſoul can ſay thus, It is true, in the way I have been there is no mercy to me, and I know not whether there be mercy for me, but I wil try it, it hath not the reflect act of faith, but ſome ſecret perſwaſion of the ſoul, whereby it doth caſt it ſelf upon God, though not by a reflect act, it can certainly ſay, God intends
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44661:78"/>
mercy for me, but though it be very weak, yet ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation the ſoul hath that there is mercy from God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, becauſe Faith is not a bare venture, but Faith hath ſome kind of certainty though very weak, for to ſay, I will caſt my ſoul upon God, but I may periſh, I have no ground to think why God ſhould ſave me, this is unbelief; the work of Faith, according to the degree of it, hath ſome kind of certainty in it, though the ſoul for the preſent, be not able to diſcern it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The invitation of Chriſt, when it comes to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, hath, together with the voyce of Chriſt, an inward effectual power that goes along with it, a prevailing power to draw the heart to him. Chriſt doth not only ſpeak to the heart, and ſay to it, Come; but with the voyce he lets out a power upon the heart to come to him: I expreſs it thus: When Chriſt was in the fleſh, he goes and calls Diſciples to him; comes to <hi>Matthew</hi> that ſate at the receit of Cuſtom, ſaith he, Come and follow me; preſently <hi>Matthew</hi> leaves his ſitting at the Cuſtom Houſe, leaves all his Friends, and leaves all he had, and comes to him preſently. And ſo when Chriſt comes to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> his Brother, that were a fiſhing, and ſaith to them, Come to me; they leave their old Father, leave their Nets, leave their Ship, leave all, and follow Chriſt. Certainly we cannot but apprehend that there was a ſecret vertue went out from Chriſt with this his Word, that did thus prevail upon their hearts. As the poor woman in the Goſpel that had the bloody iſſue, ſhe did but touch the hem of Chriſts Garment, and ſhe finds a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vertue to cure her: ſo, where ever Chriſts invitation comes to be effectual, it comes with a mighty power, a ſecret vertue that goes together with his word to the ſoul to prevail upon it.</p>
               <p>Come to me, ſay many, Why doth Chriſt call me? am I able to come to him? Chriſt ſaith, Come; to them as he did to <hi>Matthew, Peter,</hi> and others; Chriſt did not call them, and ſay, Come, only; but he put
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44661:78"/>
vertue into his word: and look what vertue was then, the ſame is now in the miniſtry of the word, when he ſpeaks and ſaith come to Chriſt, together with this word there goes a ſecret power to prevaile upon the Soul that they muſt come. Now it may be, the Father, or Mother, or friend of a poor yong man perſwades him not to come, but he muſt come to Chirſt for all that, the truth is, it's as ſtrong a work of God to come to Chriſt now, as it was then to cal <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He not only calls them, but he reacheth out his hand, before he comes to be joyned with Chriſt, to have union with him. Chriſt when he ſees the Soul ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after him, he reacheth forth his hand to draw the Heart. You will ſay what is that for Chriſt to reach forth his hand, and invite that way? By that I mean thoſe gracious incouragements that Chriſt gives to all the beginnings of the working of the Soul after him, the Lord Chriſt not only invites ſuch, but gives forth his hand to reach forth ſtrength unto them, he will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the Smoaking Flax.

               <argument>
                  <p>That there is nothing required of Sinners but to come to Chriſt, with nine Conſequences ariſing from hence, and what hath been laid down in the two former Chapters. <hi>1.</hi> There is not any worthineſs required in ſuch as come to Chriſt. <hi>2.</hi> The Soul needs not to be troubled about the time and meaſure of its Humiliation before its coming to Chriſt. <hi>3.</hi> Nor about what intereſt it hath in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its comming to him. <hi>4.</hi> That the leaſt degree of Faith will give the Soul intereſt in Chriſt. <hi>5.</hi> That the work of Faith is Supernatural. <hi>6.</hi> That Faith is an humbling Grace. <hi>7.</hi> That beleevers after their coming to Chriſt ſhould be willing to do and ſuffer much for Chriſt. <hi>8.</hi> That they who are once in Chriſt, ſhal never be caſt off. <hi>9.</hi> That they know not what to do when they looſe their intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw the third thing is, That there is nothing elſe required, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Come to me and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Bleſſed Chriſt! is this all that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt; yes, come to me, and you ſhal have Reſt. You have it often expreſt in Scripture thus, <hi>Come, and buy Wine and Milk and Honey without price,</hi> it is but coming: and indeed the very coming is buying. And ſo in the 22. of the <hi>Revel.</hi> and the 17. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay come, and let him that heareth, ſay come, and he that is athirſt come, and whoſoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely.</hi> Here is nothing but come, three times come, and there is nothing elſe required, nothing that thou ſhouldeſt bring with thee, but only come. Only in this remember how I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44661:79"/>
opened it, what it is to Come, and then there is nothing elſe required, but only come. Then this gives light to many things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no unworthineſs of any ſinner, be he what he will be, before this invitation, that is ſufficient to hinder, Why? Becauſe Chriſt doth not ſay you that have been thus vild and wretched, you ſhal do thus and thus firſt, and then come to me. No, Whatever you have been, the firſt thing that Chriſt requires to eaſe, Reſt and peace, is, to come to him. It is true, there are ſome things in the Nature of comming required that muſt needs be done, before the compleat act of coming; as I muſt know what Chriſt is, and know my ſelf, &amp;c. theſe things of neceſſity are required not becauſe theſe are any condition of the Goſpel, but becauſe the other cannot be done without them. For I would open it thus to follow the former Metaphor. Suppoſe the King ſhould tel a Traitor, that upon condition that you come to ſuch a place at ſuch a time, you ſhall have your pardon. Well, all that is required for his pardon is but coming to that place, how if this man be at a great diſtance from that place, and many difficulties that hinder him, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ormes, Tempeſtuous weather, and many friends to hinder him, this is implyed, that he muſt have ſuch a deep apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the worth of his pardon, and of his miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition if he be not pardoned, that there muſt be a ſtrong reſolution in him to go through all difficulties whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. But marke, this reſolution of his and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that he meets withal in the way, theſe are no part of the condition of the pardon; all the condition of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is, but to be at ſuch a place, ſuch a time, but yet the other things they follow of themſelves, that if he doth come, and there be ſuch difficulties in the way, then he muſt have ſuch a ſenſe and apprehenſion of the good of his pardon as may ſtir up in him ſuch reſolutions, to paſs through all difficulties. But the firſt thing that brings him his pardon is his being there. So it is here with the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44661:80"/>
Soul, its true, the thing that bring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> my Soul and yours to pardon. Reſt and Peace with God, it is our coming to Chriſt, but now becauſe there is a great diſtance between Chriſt and us, many difficulties in the way, many things that would keep us from Chriſt, the wickedneſs of our Hearts, this temptation and that luſt. Now it cannot poſſibly be, If we come to Chriſt, but we muſt know, and become apprehenſive of the worth of the pardon, which may raiſe up in our hearts ſuch ſtrong reſolutions to paſs through all Difficulties whatſoever, and there is no Reaſon, why God troubles any man for ſin, but only this, that he might have ſuch an apprehenſion of the Good of the pardon of his ſin, as may ſtir in him ſtrong reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to get to Chriſt. But now this reſolution is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant, the condition is only to come, the condition is not becauſe we are afflicted, becauſe we ſee our ſins, but to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It follows likewiſe from hence, That no Man or Woman, that God is working upon to come to Chriſt, need trouble themſelves about the degree of humiliation, or the time of humiliation. You have a great many, that are ready to take advantage and to cry out againſt men that they Preach legally, when they ſay, they muſt be humbled and the like. I know no man living that ever Preached ſo, that they muſt be firſt under the Law, thus long under the Law, before they come to Chriſt, but if you would know what degree of humiliation is ſufficient, only ſo much as can bring you to Chriſt, that is, ſo much as can ſtir up your Hearts to reſolve to paſs through all difficulties to come to Chriſt, then you have the meaſure, and the time of humiliation ſufficient, and you need not trouble your ſelves any further about this, I have not been humbled ſo long as another Man, or ſuch a time, but if you come to Chriſt. For if I come to Chriſt, I muſt know what I come for, for a Pardon. A pardon of what? for my ſin, my ſin that I am condemned for; there muſt be a ſenſe of this, and if you come thus far, you need not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44661:80"/>
be afflicted for any degree, or time of humiliation, or the like, for you have that that is ſufficient, and God wil accept of your coming: if once you be come to him, God wil not ſay, Oh! but Friend, how have you been humbled in your comming, God knows you have paſt through many difficulties, God knows you would never have priſed Chriſt, except you had known what the worth of Chriſt is, by knowing what a miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you are without him; God wil not do this, but wil welcome you when you come, let the ſinner be what he wil, Chriſt wil own him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This helps us about intereſt in comming to Chriſt, you wil ſay, come to Chriſt, but how ſhal I know that I have any right to come to Chriſt? This very point an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers it, that nothing is required but comming, that which hath given any ſoul from the begining of the world any intereſt to come to Chriſt, is only comming to Chriſt; thy comming to Chriſt doth give thee right to Jeſus Chriſt. If thy grace, the grace of God doth make thee come, that very act of thine in coming gives thee intereſt and right in him, though thou hadſt none before. There needs no other right and challenge to Chriſt but Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Chriſt in the Goſpel to thee, and thy comming to him. But now (for it is pitty to let this paſs) it may be, ſome may think, wil not this tend to looſeneſs to ſay, its nothing elſe but to Come to Chriſt? I know it is extreamly abuſed many wayes, many wil abuſe it thus, when we are preaching the Goſpel, that if at any time we preach the miſerable condition of men to humble them, they wil ſay, it is a contradiction, but I beſeech you take heed of theſe vain Spirited men, who ſeek not Jeſus Chriſt in the way of the Goſpel. And though it may be through their weakneſs or the diſtemper of their hearts, they wil not, or do not ſee the way of the Goſpel, but they wil come to young people and weake Chriſtians and ſay, there's contradiction in this, for if this be true, how can the other be true? But theſe things that ſeem
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44661:81"/>
contradictory, they are very agreeable one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, if you would ſeem to give judgment upon what we apprehend we ſhal make the Scripture to contradict it ſelf. But now thoſe that are verſed in Scripture and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the mind of God in the Scripture can tel how to joyn theſe together, though others think they contradict one another. As that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, That we are juſtified by faith without the works of the Law.</hi> And that in <hi>James,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>we are Juſtified by workes.</hi> A ſtranger would think, theſe contradict one another, but they that are acquainted with the way of the Scripture, they can underſtand what this meanes: So theſe men that would make contradiction in the preaching of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Goſpel, they are ſtrangers to the way of God in the Goſpel, did they underſtand the way of God cleerly in the Goſpel, they would know how to make a ſweet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of ſuch things as they would make poor young ones, and weak beleevers to beleeve there is a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them. And therefore this I would hold, and hope we ſhal for ever hold as a ſtrong principle, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Goſpel is only comming, and that which the weight of our ſoules and eternal eſtates lies upon is, not our humbling, but it is the comming to Jeſus Chriſt. Do not ſay, that this tends to looſneſs, for that ſoul that ſees Chriſt as the glorious mediator to come to ſave him, this ſight of Chriſt, hath a great deale of power to ſanctifie the heart, for when I ſee this, I ſee, firſt, that I have to doe with God, and that there muſt be a mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and me, my ſins have made ſuch a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and my ſoul, this tends not to looſeneſs. And then as you were taught before, comming notes a remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one condition to another. Then it notes ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that my heart is taken off from the world, from my luſts, from my corruptions, my comming implies this. And thirdly, when I conſider the end of my comming, what the ſoul aimes at when it comes thus, I come to Chriſt to ſave me from the power of my ſins, as wel as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44661:81"/>
the guilt of my ſins. I come to Chriſt as the fountain of al my happineſs, I come to him for life and grace and all good. I come to him that I might live in him, and that I might live to God by him, Certainly to ſay that Chriſt requires only to come to him, this doth not tend to looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I come to Chriſt that I may commit my whole ſoul to him, is not this a ſanctifying grace? Indeed to preach thus, that you may come to Chriſt and no more, this pleaſeth Libertines, but when we conſider what is the way of the Goſpel, I muſt firſt know what it is to come, and then I muſt know that it is to leave ſomewhat; to know wherfore I come, that I may have al my happineſs in him. I come to him for life, for ſalvation, for union with God the father, that I may enjoy communion with him to everlaſting, here is no liberty to looſeneſs in comming, but a bleſſed maintaining of the condition of the Goſpel in the way of the ſoules coming unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It followes from hence that the weakeſt, and the leaſt degree of Faith that is, wil give us intereſt in Chriſt becauſe that nothing but comming to him is required. It is not run to me, or come ſtrongly to me, if I can but get to him, though it be crawling, though it be never ſo poorly, never ſo weakely, that doth it, by comming and cloſing with Chriſt. If that be the condition to come to ſuch a place for a pardon, though they come creeping upon their hands and feet through weakeneſs, yet if they be but there, they ſhal have that that is promiſed: ſo ſay I, though the ſoul in coming to Chriſt creep as it were upon hand and feet, come with much weakeneſs, it is that that gives intereſt in Chriſt, not ſuch and ſuch degrees of Faith and confidence as ſome have. It may be ſome poore, weake Chriſtians, are troubled at this, that they have not ſuch confidence and aſſurance as others have, they are ful of doubts and feares. We are to know, that it is not the degree and ſtrength of Faith that is required in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, but comming to Chriſt, <hi>Come</hi> to me, though it be with ſhaking, with trembling, though with mixture of much
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44661:82"/>
feare, yet come to me, and you ſhal have reſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It follows from hence, That the work of faith, and bringing true reſt unto the ſoul is a ſupernatural work, it is comming to him, that is, its the looking forward, by a righteouſneſs that is beyond our own, it is a leaving our own righteouſneſs, not reſting upon that, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in what we have, are, or can be inabled to do by the power of God; I ſay, that the way of the ſouls get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reſt in Chriſt by faith, it is ſupernatural, for it is by ſuch a way, wherein the ſoul comes to deny it ſelf in whatever it hath, whatever it doth, whatever it can be inabled to do by the power of God. It reſts not upon any thing that is in it, or done by it, no nor in any thing that God himſelf by his grace and infinite power can do in it, I do not ſay, do for it, for that is in Chriſt, but do in it, beyond what is in it ſelf, or Gods infinite power is able to inable it to do, it is comming to Chriſt, and therefore going out of our ſelves, this is ſupernatural; for there is nothing more natural to mankind then this, to reſt upon his own bottom, to deſire the ſtaff in his own hand, to leane upon ſome worthineſs, and ſome good in himſelf, this though he wil acknowledg that it is through grace, that he hath but ſomewhat which God works through him, that is the moſt natural to a rational creature, to reſt upon ſomewhat that he doth to make up his peace with God, and to be his righteouſneſs before God, And it is a mighty work of God to beat off the heart from this eſpecially. The heart comes thus far, to ſay it is true, I can do nothing of my ſelf, but it is by the grace of God that I do al: now for the heart not to reſt upon this as its own righteouſneſs, this is the hardeſt thing in the world. And although men may be convinced in their judgments, that they ſhould not reſt in any ſuch thing, but go out of themſelves to another principle, yet it is the hardeſt thing in the world to come off from it, and it is that makes the work of faith the moſt difficult thing in the world, becauſe it carries the ſoul out of it ſelf, from its
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44661:82"/>
own bottom, from its own principles, and the miſtake of this thing, is that that is the undoing of thouſands of thoſe that live under the ſound of the goſpel, that when they have ſomewhat reformed their lives, and think they are able to do thus and thus, yet here they reſt and go not out of themſelves, to look for reſt out of themſelves and do not come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> You wil ſay, <hi>What, not reſt upon what we do, and are inabled to do upon Gods grace, Faith it ſelf is a reſting upon Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, but this you muſt obſerve in your comming, you muſt not reſt upon your comming, but upon Chriſt, that you come unto, for their may be a deceit in that too. There be ſome that reſt upon works of humiliation, mourning for ſin, reforming their lives, and they think that is their reſt and peace. Others go further, and think they muſt beleeve in Chriſt, but they wil reſt upon their beleeving, ſo they reſt upon their comming, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the object that they come unto; but we muſt be taken off from reſting upon our comming, upon our very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and Chriſt muſt be all in all to have true reſt in. Therefore faith is a Supernatural grace, becauſe by that we are taken off from what we are in our ſelves, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on to ſomewhat elſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Upon this follows likewiſe That faith is an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling grace, it is that that muſt needs humble the ſoul where it is, for indeed it is the greateſt ſelf denial in the world, for a creature to come to be willing to rely upon free grace, for the ſoul to be ſo emptied of it ſelf, as to acknowledg, there is no worthineſs no good at al in it ſelf and yet it is content to live eternally upon meere almes, and to give God the glory of al. Is there any thing more hard to any of you, then to live to be beggers al your daies, to be beholding to others, ſo as to live upon meer almes and nothing elſe al the dayes of your lives? Now for the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44661:83"/>
creature to be ſo emptied of it ſelf, as to live upon meere almes to al eternity, upon nothing but meer free grace, and upon a principle of life without our ſelves, this is a mighty work of emptying of our ſelves, and of ſelf denyal. And therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. Its ſpoken of the Jewes; <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> This plainly ſhewes, that the bringing the heart to reſt upon the righteouſneſs that is of God by faith (for that is meant here) requires a ſubmiſſion of the heart, a laying down the heart, and a humbling of the heart; and indeed, this is the very ground, why the Lord doth ſo humble the ſpirits of men and women when he brings them to Chriſt, becauſe that the Lord knows, that the very act, the coming to Chriſt, is an act of the greateſt ſelf denial in the world, becauſe the heart muſt be emptied of it ſelf in that that is ſo much againſt the pride of mans heart, to live eternally upon meer free grace and nothing elſe. For there is nothing that man doth more deſire, then to have ſomewhat, ſome ſtock of himſelf to live upon. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed herein man comes to be more humble then <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency could be, for <hi>Adam</hi> had a ſtock to live upon in his own hand, to live upon in himſelf, not but God was the principle of it, but then God gave it him to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſtock of Grace he had in his owne hand. But now in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the way of God towards us is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> keepes the ſtock of life and grace upon which our ſoules muſt live eternally, in his own hand, I ſay, they are in Chriſts hand, not in our ſelves, and therefore our life is a better and ſafer life then that was, and thereby we cannot fal from God becauſe we live by the principle of life that is in him. It is a great miſtery, and almoſt impoſſible to unfould, only ſome glimmering we have in the word that this is ſo.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:44661:83"/>7. If there be nothing required but to come, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother conſequence wil follow from hence, and that is this. Hence then beleevers that come to Chriſt may learn this leſſon, to be willing to do and to ſuffer very much for Chriſt after they come, becauſe there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing required of them to the pardon of their ſins, but only to <hi>Come.</hi> I ſtrengthen the inference thus; If God had ſaid thus indeed, I have ſent a mediator to pacifie my wrath and to pardon your ſins, and before you come to Reſt, I require that you ſhould ſuffer ſo many hundred yeares of torment in fire, and that ſhould be a preparation to come, and then after you have ſuffered ſo much, then you ſhal come and have reſt; ſuppoſe this had been the condition of the covenant, now had it been ſo, we had al had cauſe to have fallen upon our face and have bleſt his great name, that we can have peace on any termes, and we ſhould have been, not only willing to accept of theſe termes, but to magnifie Gods grace that we can be thus ſaved at laſt. But the Lord hath not required that firſt we ſhould ſuffer ſuch and ſuch hard things, and then Come to Chriſt, but he calls upon us firſt to come, and requires nothing before. And therefore before we are able to do the Lord any ſervice, the Lord wil firſt accept of us, and pardon us, and heale us, and intereſt us in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and be our God, and take us to be his Children, and make us heirs of heaven and eternal life, &amp; this at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhal ever be able to do him any ſervice. What an infinite grace of God is this? how is he beforehand with us? for he calleth to the greateſt ſinner, that knowes what his ſin is, and is Laden, ſaith God, I require nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the receiving you to mercy, but meerly to come and caſt your ſouls upon me. You may ſay, Lord! we that have been guilty of ſo many ſins, ſo many years, might it not be juſt that God ſhould require, and ſay, I but, you ſhal live ſo many yeares to my honor, live ſo many yeares to my ſervice, and then I wil pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of you, no, but ſaith God, I wil receive you, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44661:84"/>
accept of you upon your comming, before ever you are able to do me any kind of ſervice; no, ſaith God, come to me, and you ſhal have firſt my favour, and you ſhal be firſt accepted, and firſt pardoned, and then indeed I expect ſervice from you, then I expect that you ſhould live as the redeemed ones of the Lord, and al that you ſhal do afterwards, ſhal be but in way of thankfulneſs to me for my grace. And indeed thus do beleevers live in the world, though they look upon what they do in a way of duty, but they do it in a way of thankfulneſs, that is the ſpecial thing that carries them on, the grace of God in his ſon, and that is a ſtronger argument to al kind of duties that now God requires of them, then what they had before. God doth not cal upon you to ſuffer firſt, and then he wil pardon your ſin, no, but ſaith God, I wil beſtow my favour firſt upon you, and try whither you wil ſuffer afterwards. God wil not do as men, try them whether they wil ſuffer and deſerve their favours, before they beſtow them on them, but ſaith God, I wil firſt beſtow my favours upon you, and then I wil try whether you wil ſuffer for me and do me ſervice. And therefore the leſs God requires as a condition before we come to Chriſt the more ſhould we be willing to do for God after we are come to Chriſt. As a man that ſhall receive a poor child into his family, and make him his heir, the leſs that was procured to the favour of the man, the more if the child be ingenious wil he do to him in way of thankfulneſs. Indeed if the friends of the Child come and indent with the man, and promiſe him a hundred pound, the Child thinks he is not ſo beholding to his maſter, for their was money given with him, I but now, if you ſhould ly at the dore and no friend to look after you, and not a rag upon you, and if then he wil take you in, and teach you his trade, and make you the heir of al he hath, Oh! now how infinitely ingaged are you to him, that how my maſter doth al this for me, and there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done before to procure his love. Thus Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44661:84"/>
is a forehand with us, Come to me, only come to me, that you might have Reſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Hence follows another note of very good uſe, ſeeing nothing is required firſt, but only coming to Chriſt, here is a ſtrong ground of aſſurance, that thoſe that are once in Chriſt, ſhall not be caſt away, but ſhall have eternal life, for there is not ſo great a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eternal life and the members of Chriſt, as there is between one that is in his Natural eſtate, and a member of Chriſt. Now God hath done more for thee in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thee unto Chriſt, then he ſhall do for thee when he brings thee unto Heaven. For there is a geater diſtance between thee and Chriſt, than there is between thee a Member of Chriſt and a glorified Saint in Heaven, and if God bring thee over this great diſtance, meerly out of free Grace, and nothing required but coming, that now thou art a member of Chriſt and therefore haſt right to Heaven, and thou canſt challeng Heaven through the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and God hath put a principle of life into thee to live unto Jeſus Chriſt, a principle of everlaſting life into thee, when there was no principle at all; God brings thee to Jeſus Chriſt meerly out of free Grace. Now if thou comeſt ſo freely to him, ſurely thou ſhalt not be ſhut out of Heaven, and therefore it may be a mighty incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What, if when we were enemies, we be Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Chriſt, much more now ſhall we be ſaved by his life. If when I was in the Gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity, God gave me mercy upon coming to his Son, ſurely he will not caſt me out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Another note that we may learn from hence is this, That thoſe that are beleevers, if at any time through their negligence, ſluggiſhneſs, or fals, they looſe the aſſurance of Gods love in Chriſt, looſe their Reſt in Chriſt, here they have a direction to know what to do. Look how thou did'ſt at firſt, when thou at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainedſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44661:85"/>
firſt Reſt in Chriſt, it was not by any Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of thine own, nor by thy humiliation, though that might make ſome way towards it. So now when thou art a beleever, and haſt loſt the aſſurance of Chriſts Love, and the comfort of Reſt in Chriſt, now thou muſt go and take the ſame way again, Chriſt cals thoſe that are beleevers to come to him; thoſe that have loſt the aſſurance of Faith, that is the way for Reſt, to renew the act of thy coming to Chriſt, juſt as thou did'ſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Though God did humble thee, yet the thing that did bring thee Reſt was, the coming to Jeſus Chriſt, ſo much more ſhould'ſt thou do now, being a beleever. When thou haſt not the Reſt in Chriſt thou deſireſt, thy way is to renew thy act of coming, of going to Chriſt, and ſo you may ſooner come to have Reſt that way, than by thinking thus. I know not whether my evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences be right or no, and I had need look to them, and therefore I had need to look whether my humiliation be right, and my Sanctification be right or no. I ſay, the renewing the act of thy faith in coming to Chriſt, will bring Reſt ſooner, and ſafer Reſt, and therefore thou ſhalt come to ſee thy Sanctification better too, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the act of thy Faith in coming unto Chriſt, and thou wilt have thy Reſt ſooner that way, it follows from hence becauſe at firſt converſion there is coming. Thus much for the Conſequences that follow from the point of Chriſts requiring only to come.</p>

               <p>NOw there is only two things remaine, and that is, ſome Rules to be propounded about our coming to Chriſt, And then ſome means to draw the Hearts of ſinners to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the Rules, that we may obſerve them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in coming to Chriſt, and come to Chriſt in a right way, I ſpeak to thoſe whoſe Hearts are about coming to Jeſus Chriſt, their hearts are ſtirring after Chriſt, and they are ſetting upon all the means to come to him.</p>
               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <head>RULE I.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, Though God requires that thou ſhouldeſt ſeek Chriſt in all his ordinances, in the performance of all Duties, yet it muſt be thy great care not to reſt in the means that lead to Chriſt, before thou comeſt to enjoy Chriſt himſelf. This is the great miſtake in the world, that thoſe things that are the means to lead to Chriſt, they reſt in, though indeed they have not Chriſt. As
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44661:86"/>
now for inſtance: to come to hear the word, I ſuppoſe if I aske you, why you come, you will ſay, you come that you might find Chriſt there, yet how many people reſt in this meerly, that they do hear the word, they hear Sermons, and ſcarce ever cal this into queſtion, have I met with Jeſus Chriſt in the word to day, have I found Jeſus Chriſt there, this their Hearts are not ſo much troubled about, but they come meerly to hear the word, it's a good thing, But now they Reſt in the means, that lead to Chriſt before they are got thither. As if a man were a going a journey to ſuch a place about ſuch buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he ſatisfies himſelf in this, I am going on my way, but have I got the thing I go for? We are to know that Prayer, the word, the Sacraments are all but as means to bring us to Chriſt, now what a fooliſh thing is this, to ſatisfie our ſelves, that we are in the way, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the thing, but have we the thing that we journey for? Jeſus Chriſt is the thing that we ſeek for, have we him? The wiſe Merchant had the Field, I but he ſaw that there was a Pearl in the field, and then he went and ſold all that he might have the Pearl. The field is the Preaching of the word, and other ordinances, in theſe ordinances is the Pearl, now that which we ſhould look for in the ordinances is the pearl, and ſo uſe the field but only for the Pearls ſake. So that this is the way that we ſhould take to come to Chriſt, that is, in the uſe of all duties, and all ordinances, to look at Chriſt, that we would have by them, and be ſure to paſs through the ordinances til we get hold on him whom our Soul loveth: moſt people in the world, they ſtick in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances themſelves, and have got no hold on Chriſt, but meerly ſpend all in duties and ordinances, that they wil do. God requires of them to pray, and they wil pray, and God requires of them to hear the word, and they will hear the word, I but, they do not conſider, that there is ſomthing beyond Prayer, and beyond the word. Have I got to Jeſus Chriſt in Prayer, have I got to Jeſus
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44661:86"/>
Chriſt in the word. And that is a good ſigne when the hearts of ſinners are ſatisfied with nothing, with no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances except they find Jeſus Chriſt in thoſe ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, be ſure to go through the ordinances unto Chriſt.</p>

                  <head>RULE. II.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, In your ſeeking after Chriſt, be ſure that you rather pitch your eye and your heart, upon the perſon of Chriſt himſelf, then upon the good things that come from Chriſt, that is the way to pitch your eye and your heart upon Chriſt himſelf, rather then upon the good things that come from Chriſt, for coming to Chriſt, and being in him, is only as being married to him. Now the party that marries, he looks more upon the perſon then upon the portion, he looks upon the excellency of the perſon; ſo ſhould the Soul in coming to Chriſt, look upon him as the only great mediatour of the Covenant, as the only reconciler of God and man, as the only perſon in whom all our good, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and glory lies. Labor to ſee an excellency in Chriſt himſelf, as wel as to come to Chriſt. There are many ſouls that would come to Chriſt, why? becauſe they think there is no mercy but in Chriſt, and they would be loath to go to Hel, and therefore they cry to God for mercy in Chriſt, I but, they ſee not any excellency in Chriſt, but thou muſt look upon the excellencies of Chriſt, and look through the ordinances unto union with Chriſt, look after union with the perſon of Chriſt himſelf, and ſee an excellency and beauty in the very perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, to be able to ſay, I ſee the glory of the Father in him, and my Soul makes after him to have union with him.</p>

                  <head>RULE. III.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, In thy coming, be ſure of this, to come with thy whole ſoule; that is, do not come to Chriſt only as one meanes of help for you, and thinking it is Good to make uſe of al means we can, and Chriſt I ſee to be as likely a means as any other. No, but come to Chriſt as the only means, ſo as to caſt thy whole ſoul upon him, not to hang upon any thing elſe, and ſo to give out, as it were, an arme to him, and yet to have ſomewhat elſe to reſt upon if that fail. As we come to a friend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and deſire ſomewhat of him, but how? ſo as we would make a friend other where, that if that fail we may have two ſtrings to our bow: but we muſt come to Chriſt and lay the ful weight upon him alone, the ful ſoul upon him. We muſt come to Chriſt, not as if we were over ſome deep pit, and here is one thing to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is ſtrong enough, that if we would lay weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is alone we might be ſafe. Wel, but there is another thing, that is a rotten thing, now we are loth to venture upon the ſtrong, the ſound, not knowing it to be ſo, but we lay a part upon the rotten, and part upon the ſound, by this perhaps we may come to fal and periſh, becauſe the ful weight was not laid upon that that was ſound. So here, the Lord propounds his ſon as an alſufficient redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for us, in whom there is righteouſneſs and ſalvation, and requires of thoſe that come to his Son, that they ſhal come with their whol ſouls, and lay the whol weight of their ſoules upon him for life and ſalvation, and al their good and happineſs. Now if they think to have two ſtrings to their bow, they would have Chriſt, but they would have the world too, and their own wayes too, upon this a Thouſand to one but they miſcarry. It was an excellent ſpeech of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſending for his father <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 45.20. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent to have his father <hi>Jacob</hi> brought to him, now there
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44661:87"/>
was many things that <hi>Jacob</hi> had regard to before, but now, ſaith he, regard not the ſtuff, for the good of all the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> is yours. So when the Lord doth cal any poor ſinner to come to him, the Lord ſaith to it, regard not the ſtuff, let your Heart be wholly taken off from all Creature comforts that are moſt dear unto you it is all but ſtuff, here is Heaven, here is the Riches of Heaven, the Riches of Chriſt is yours, and then doth the Soul come to Chriſt indeed, when it laies all upon Chriſt, and is ſatisfied with him alone.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="part">
                  <head>RULE. IV.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, When thy Soul is making towards Chriſt, labor to keep him continually in thine Eye and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in his excellency, Glory, and beauty, keep the object before thee all the while thou art coming towards him. As it is in any journey, if I am going to a place, and I can ſee the journeys end, it is in mine eye, I can ſee the ſteeple before me of the place that I am going unto; when the Marriner can ſee the harbour that he is going unto, this is comfortable. So the Soul that comes to Chriſt muſt reſolve and ſay, I muſt keep him in mine Eye, in his luſtre, Beauty, and Glory, that ſo I may ſee a greater good in Jeſus Chriſt than in all things elſe, that the goodneſs that is in him, doth out-bid all good whatſoever. Now this is a great help to come to Chriſt: for one of the greateſt hinderances of the Soul in coming to Chriſt, is this, that it looſeth the ſight of Chriſt in coming, and the Devil propounds other ſpectacles before its Eyes in coming, and ſo it lookes into the deep pit of its own Heart, and ſees no other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but diſcouragement, whereas it ſhould keep up its Eyes upon Chriſt the Son of God, who is opening his Arms ready to imbrace it. And there is a ſecret power and influence that comes from Chriſt unto the Soul to draw the Soul to him. So long as the Soul keeps Chriſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44661:88"/>
in his Eye, as the poor Woman ſaid, <hi>If I can but touch the hem of his Garment</hi>; Nay; you may go further then ſo, and have a degree of Faith, Nay, If I may have but a ſight of Chriſt, I ſay, there is that in the ſight of Chriſt that will draw the Heart unto Jeſus Chriſt. As they ſay of ſome kind of creatures, the very ſight of them will kil a Man, that if they do but ſee you, or you them, there will come poyſon from them that wil kill you, ſay the Naturaliſts. But I am ſure it is true of this, that if you can keep Chriſt in your Eye, the very ſight of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſt, wil be of excellent vertue to draw the Soul to Chriſt. And therefore you that are coming to Chriſt, obſerve this, ſome that are coming to Chriſt it fares with them, as with the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were going to <hi>Canaan</hi>; they had gone a pretty way, and made ſome progreſs, but then they fel into diſcontent when they found a little diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and upon that they were brought back again, and wandred forty Years up and down in the Wilderneſs, and this was the puniſhment of their murmuring and diſcontent; So it is with many that are going out of their natural State unto Jeſus Chriſt, they are come very near to him many times, and then fal into fits of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, pining, fretting, and diſcouragement, and ſo are brought back again and made to wander in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſcouragement for many Years together.</p>

               <div n="5" type="part">
                  <head>RULE. V.</head>
                  <p>Fifthly, Labor throughly to convince thy Soul of this thing, that whatſoever ſorrow for ſin, whatſoever hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, whatſoever trouble of ſpirit keeps thy Heart from Jeſus Chriſt, it is not of God, but rather from thine own corruption; it is not of God in thee, except you will ſay, it's of God as an affliction, it is not of God, but ſuffering the Devil to try thee, but whatever ſorrow it be for thine own wretchedneſs, or unworthineſs, if
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44661:88"/>
this keep thee off from Chriſt, and diſcourage thee from coming to Chriſt, convince thy Soul of this, that it is not the gracious work of God in thee, but the troubling of the Devil in thee. The truth is, many poor ſinners, when they are once troubled for their ſins, they take a kind of Satisfaction in this, they think this is a good thing, and they are glad of it. I grant you, trouble for ſin is a good thing, and you are to be glad of it, but if your trouble for ſin hinder you from coming to Chriſt, and makes you think, becauſe you are ſo unworthy you may not come to him, this trouble is not mixt with godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, be convinced of this.</p>

               <div n="6" type="part">
                  <head>RULE. VI.</head>
                  <p>Sixthly, Take heed of all kind of diſcouragements and hinderances in your coming to Chriſt, but then take heed eſpecially of all determinations, take heed of inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Souls by determining againſt your ſelves, as ſaying, ſurely the Lord will never ſhew mercy to me, the time is paſt, the Lord hath forſaken me, I have uſed ſo much meanes ſo long time, and God is not yet come to me, No, The Lord never intends good to me, Oh! Take heed of theſe determinations, for they are ſinful, wherever they are, there can be no juſt cauſe in thy Heart, be it as vile as it will, for ſuch determinations as theſe are: and know, when thou giveſt way to ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations as theſe, thou doſt but inſnare and fetter thy Legs by this, and then thou ſayeſt, thou canſt not come to Chriſt; Chriſt calls to thee, and thou art infet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with thy own thoughts, for ſo, one may lay fetters upon ones own Legs, by ones own thoughts, to hinder this ſpiritual coming to Chriſt. As if a man ſhould tie fetters about his Legs, and ſay, when he is called to come to ſuch a place, I cannot come. Do not ſit down and ſay, I ſhall never have Mercy, and I am one that belongs not to the election of Grace, and I ſhall never come to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44661:89"/>
Chriſt, take off ſuch thoughts when thou art about coming to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <div n="7" type="part">
                  <head>RULE. VII.</head>
                  <p>Seventhly, At thoſe times when thou canſt not feel thy Heart active as thou deſireſt to go after Chriſt, yet keep thy Heart ſtil towards Chriſt, keep it tending that way. Why cannot I go to Chriſt? Chriſt calls me to go to him. Oh! I have a dead Heart, and a heavy dull Heart, yet I know I am neerer Chriſt there, than if I ſhould neglect his Ordinances, I wil preſent my Soul where Jeſus Chriſt is, and may be he may caſt in ſome Vertue into my Heart to make it more ſtirring after him, but however I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon this, I will not turne away from Chriſt, I will keep my Heart where I am howſoever, If I can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and here I will ſtand, and here I wil look, and I will cry to him, and cry to God as the Church doth, <hi>Draw me and I will run after thee</hi>; and though I cannot beleeve, yet here I will ſtand, and ſigh and cry, and cal, and if I periſh I will periſh crying to God, that God would draw my Heart, Oh draw, draw our Hearts, and we will run after thee. Bleſſed Redeemer, doſt thou cal us? ſend forth ſomwhat of thy ſpirit, that may draw our Hearts, and then we will run after thee. Keep thy Heart in ſuch a frame, for this is a great diſcouragement about coming to Chriſt in the Hearts of many. Chriſt calls, and we have many ſweet incouragements in the word to come, I, but it is to them that have their Hearts ſtirring and working towards Chriſt, to go to him. But I have a dead, and dull Heart, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work towards him. I but if thou canſt not ſtir and work after him, yet ſet thy Soul in ſight of Chriſt, and look towards him, and waite til Gods time come, when he will let ſome influence into thy Heart, this will be a mighty help this way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:44661:89"/>And take heed of liſtening to any temptation that may draw away thy heart from coming to Chriſt. It is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Scripture that you have in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20. it is of <hi>Samuel</hi> Speaking to the people of Iſrael that had ſinned againſt the Lord, and were troubled for their ſin, and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto the people. <hi>Fear not, you have done this wickedneſs, yet turn not aſide from following the Lord, but feare the Lord with al your hearts and turne ye not aſide, for then ſhould ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.</hi> You have ſinned againſt the Lord, and you are troubled, what ſhal we do? Saith <hi>Samuel,</hi> though you have thus ſinned, yet do not turne aſide to vanity. So do I ſay, you have ſinned againſt the Lord, and Chriſt cals you to come to him, and you complain you have a dead and dul heart, I but then, do not turne from Chriſt to vanity, ſet your ſelves ſtil in the ſight of God, and attend upon him in thoſe Ordinances, that he uſeth to preſent himſelf in.</p>

               <div n="8" type="part">
                  <head>RULE. VIII.</head>
                  <p>Eighthly, When thy heart begins to come to Chriſt, give up thy ſelf to the ſtream of Gods ſpirit, for the ſpirit of God wil be ſtirring ever and anon, though not at al times alike. Thou art attending upon the Ordinances, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting when the ſpirit of God ſhould come to draw thy heart to Chriſt, wait upon this ſtirring, and if thou feel the Spirit beginning to draw thy heart to Chriſt in any meaſure, Oh! then joyn with the work of the ſpirit of God, and give up thy ſoul to the ſtream of Gods ſpirit; do not thou draw back; it may be Gods ſpirit is drawing thy heart to Chriſt, and thou preſently draweſt back with diſcouraging thoughts, upon conſideration of thy Vileneſs, and that thou art not humbled: now when thou feeleſt Gods ſpirit ſtirring in thee, give up thy ſoul to the ſtrength of Gods ſpirit. As when a man goes to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44661:90"/>
learne to ſwim, he is not to lay down himſelf, and keep a padling with his hands and feet, but there muſt be a giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of himſelf to the water, Sometimes a man keeps ten times more ſtir to keep himſelf from drowning, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that can ſwim; one that hath got the art of ſwimm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while the other ſinkes to the bottom, the water helpes him, and he keeps himſelf above water. Juſt thus is the difference, between ſome that are troubled in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences for their ſins. and others, between ſome that are coming to Chriſt and others. Some that are coming to Chriſt, and have not the right art of giving up themſelves to Chriſt, they are ſinking, and in mighty confuſion of ſpirit, and keep ſuch a do with their own hearts, and ſtrange confuſed thoughts they have, and horror of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and al becauſe they fear they ſhal ſink down to the bottom of deſtruction. Now there are others that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of ſinking and drowning as wel as they, but coming to underſtand what the way of Chriſt is, and what it is to come to Chriſt, though they have nothing in themſelves to keep them from ſinking, yet they come to learn how to give up their ſouls to the ſtream of Gods ſpirit that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them on to Jeſus Chriſt in a more ſolid way, and with a great deal leſs trouble they come to Jeſus Chriſt, and there they get into the arke and ſo are ſafe for ever. Whereas others they skrabble on the outſide of the arke, as if a poor man ſhould be skrabbling upon the ſhip, no body lookes after him, he fals down and is drowned at laſt. So thoſe that skrabble and do not give up themſelves unto the arke, they fal down again and at the laſt periſh You have a ſcripture for this in 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 20.33. The Servants of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> they diligently obſerved whether any thing would come from the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they ſay, thy brother <hi>Benhadad,</hi> this is the thing, they go in a way of ſeeking to the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for his brother <hi>Benhadad,</hi> and this is the way, they watch for any word that might paſs from the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereby they might have any hope, and at laſt he ſaid, <hi>my brother
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44661:90"/>
Benhadad,</hi> and they take hold of this preſently. So it ſhould be with a ſinner that is ſeeking after Chriſt, he ſhould diligently watch what may come from the Spirit of Chriſt, that may give any incouragement; doth the Spirit move in thee, and begin to work in thee to draw thee to Jeſus Chriſt? Oh! thou mighteſt have got a great way thither, it may be thou mighteſt have been in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and in his armes by this time if thou hadſt taken this courſe.</p>

                  <head>RULE IX.</head>
                  <p>Ninthly, The ſoul that is about coming to Chriſt, that doth not yet know whether it is truly got to Chriſt, it ſhould often renew the act of coming, for certainly there are many that are at Chriſt, but do not know it. It may be ſome ſoule may ſay, I had thought I had got to Chriſt before, but I ſee my Corruptions prevail, and I am afraid I am not come to Chriſt; wil not theſe ſoules think that they muſt not come to Chriſt til they have overcome their Corruptions? wheras the beſt way to overcome thy corruption is to come to Chriſt, to renew the act of thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Chriſt, and the longer thou ſtaieſt from renewing this act of thy coming to Chriſt, the more ſtrong thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions grow in thee. Certainly do thou ly down as long as thou wilt in any ſullen mood, and ſay, my Corruption is thus and thus, and I am afraid I never went to Chriſt, thy corruptions would grow ſtronger in thee, thou muſt not ſtay til thy corruptions be ſubdued before thou goeſt to Chriſt, but renew the act of coming to Chriſt again, ſay I wil try it again, may be I did not do it aright at firſt, and if I miſs it the ſecond time, I wil try it again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the hundredth time. Do not ſay if I had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſin thus and thus, I would come to Chriſt, it is as much as to ſay, if I were firſt ſanctified by Chriſt, then I would come to Chriſt for juſtification, and is this the right order? No, thou muſt come firſt to Chriſt, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44661:91"/>
thou mayeſt have thy corruptions ſubdued. It would ſeem a ſtrange thing that if a king ſhould come to a woman and tel her he would be married to her, and ſhe ſhould ſay, no, if I were a Queene I would take him, but ſhe muſt firſt be married to him, and that makes her to be a Queen. So here, the ſoul muſt not firſt ſay, if I were firſt ſanctified and had overcome ſuch and ſuch corruptions, I would come to Chriſt no, but by coming to Chriſt &amp; renewing thy act of coming to Chriſt, that ſanctifies thee. That is a rule that I would leave with al young beginners, ſpend more time and more ſtrength, in renewing the very act of beleeving, of rolling thy ſoul upon the grace of God in Chriſt, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting thy burden upon him, then in any other worke what ſoever, there is no other thing that thou canſt ſpend thy time &amp; thy ſtrength more profitably in, then the renewing the act of coming to Chriſt. Come ſaith Chriſt; ſaith the ſoul, I had thought I had come, but I was deceived; ſaith Chriſt, yet come again, and come again and again, this is the onely way to overcome any corruption in thy heart. So that when Chriſt cals thee to come, remember theſe rules, Oh! that you would lay them up to make uſe of them at al times. When you heare ſuch things out of Gods word, remember what hath bin ſaid in this text what is implyed in the coming, what way you would come, and O! that the Lord would help poor ſoules thus to come to him, and know for your incouragement, that if God give you a heart to anſwer to his cal, to come to his Son, this is an evident ſigne of your predeſtination, for whom he cals he hath elected, yea, do but think thus with your ſelves, what an infinite mercy is it to me, that I am in ſuch a condition, as that, God calls me to come, I might have had my eares filled with this, depart from me ye curſed. Thus many are caſt off from God, and God bids them depart from me ye curſed, thou art as great a ſinner may be as they are, now whereas God might have ſaid depart from me thou vild ſoul, thou paſſionate ſoul, thou filthy unclean ſoul, I ſay, this ſound might have been in thin eares, but inſtead of that ſound there is the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44661:91"/>
ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt in the miniſtry of this word calling to thee, come to me, yea, he doth not onely cal thee, but he hath given thee many rules, how thou ſhouldeſt come to him. If a Prince ſhal firſt make a proclamation for a rebel to come to him for pardon, and ſhal ſend to him, and make out many rules how he ſhal come, and direct him to ſuch a place, what a mighty incouragement would this be to ſuch an one to come in. Now this the Lord Chriſt hath done to thee, he hath not only proclaimed that he is mediator between God and thee, but he hath ſent his ſpirit to cal thee, and he hath ſent his meſſenger to give thee rules how to order thee, that thou ſhouldeſt take heed of ſuch a by way and ſuch a turning, and obſerve theſe and theſe things for thy help, thus Chriſt hath done for thee. If the Lord doth give thee a heart to anſwer to Chriſts cal, know, that this calling to thee by Chriſt in his word, wil be no other but a forerunner of that cal that Chriſt ſhal make to thee another day, There's a cal, come to me al ye that are weary and heavy Laden, and I wil give you reſt, Inherit the kingdome prepared for you. This is worth ten thouſand worlds, and when the ſoul anſwers to his cal, ſuch a ſoul may go away, and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted that Chriſt wil cal you after another manner. He cals the poor laden ſoul to give you now reſt, but he wil cal you afterwards before men and Angels to receive the inheritance, Come not to reſt only, but come to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, the kingdom prepared for you before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world.</p>

                  <p>Nine means to draw Sinners to Chriſt, namely, That, <hi>1.</hi> He that cals us is the Son of God. <hi>2.</hi> He is our neer Kinſman, (wherein three ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are included. Firſt, The terror of Gods glory is taken away. Secondly, He is infinitely inclined to do good unto the Sons of men. Thirdly, In uniting the divine nature with the human, he hath done a greater work than to ſave a ſoul.) <hi>3.</hi> He is the mediator. <hi>4.</hi> He deſerves that we ſhould come to him. <hi>5.</hi> The ſoul gets infinite good by coming to Chriſt, inſtanced in four particulars. <hi>6.</hi> We are miſerable in our ſelves. <hi>7.</hi> Chriſt wil cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly receive them that come to him, which is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in three particulars. <hi>8.</hi> We ſtand in great need of Chriſt. <hi>9.</hi> The not coming to Chriſt wil aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate all other Sins. With an anſwer unto ſome Objections.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW that which followes to be ſpoken unto in this ſecond part of the text, the invitation it ſelf, is the drawing of the hearts of ſinners to come to Chriſt, the work that we have to do, is, that in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. <hi>He ſent his ſervants at ſupper time to ſay to them that were bidden, Come, for al things are now ready,</hi> There the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is ſet out unto us by a rich mans making a great wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſupper, and when he had prepared al his dainties, he ſends his ſervants to invite the gueſts, ſaying, al things are ready, this wedding is nothing elſe but the excellent things in the Goſpel, the excellent things that are in Chriſt and the ſervants are the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44661:92"/>
ſent out to cal ſinners, to cal the gueſts to come, for all things are ready. So then in the name of Chriſt I cal unto al laden ſinners to come to Chriſt. And for the drawing of the ſoules of thoſe that are thus laden, theſe ſeveral things are to be propounded.</p>
               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <head>ARG. I.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider who Chriſt is that calls, and what he is; <hi>Come to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. What is Jeſus Chriſt that doth cal you to come to him? The very knowledg of him, what he is, would be a mighty argument to prevail with the heart to come to him, he that cals you to come to him, is the Son of God, the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, the brightneſs of the glory of God, the character and image of his perſon, as he is ſaid to be, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. He is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the Father, he hath the glory of the Father in him, he is the glory of heaven and earth, the adoration of Angels, he hath al fulneſs of al good in him. If a great Prince ſhould cal to you as you go in the ſtreets, and ſay come to me, would not you preſently adreſs your ſelves to make towards him, to go to him? know, when Chriſt calls you to come to him, it is more than if al the Angels in heaven ſhould ſtand together, to cal you to come to him. When once the ſoul comes to know who it is that cals, to know the voice of Chriſt, and what he is, it is a mighty argument to work the ſoul towards Chriſt. But you wil ſay, alas, Chriſt is ſo glorious, how ſhal we come to him? his glory is enough to overwhelme us, when the Angels did but appeare in ſome glorious manner, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſome of the prophets and holy men, were not able to ſtand before them, we cannot come to Chriſt becauſe of his glory.</p>
                  <p>Therefore know, in the ſecond place, That as he is ſo glorious in himſelf, the luſtre of heaven, ſo he hath taken our nature upon himſelf, he hath clothed himſelf with our nature, and he is ſo united into an hypoſtatical uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with us, to be made the ſame perſon, yea, ſo to be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44661:93"/>
the ſame perſon, that the ſecond perſon in Trinity is, to be of the perſon that he is, that the ſon of man ſhould be the ſame perſon that the ſon of God is, this is the greateſt miſtery in the world, and it is the greateſt work that ever God did, abundantly greater than making heaven and earth, for God to unite our natures ſo neere unto his ſon, this God hath done, ſo that Chriſt that calls you to come to him, is not only God bleſſed for ever, equal with the father, and ful of Glory, but he is your kinſman, he is your neere kinſman, that hath taken your fleſh upon him. Now had you one that were neer a kin to you, that were advanced to be the Emperor of al the world, and he ſhould cal to you and ſay, come to me, would you not make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him? Jeſus Chriſt hath your nature in heaven with him, and it is in an hypoſtatical union united to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, and the fulneſs of the Godhead dwels bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him, as in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. Now it is he that cals you to come to him, certainly, there are great things in him, and to be had by him, as you ſhal ſee more by and by.</p>
                  <p>Now conſider this one particular, viz. who Chriſt is that calls to come to him, and in the conſideration of this there are two or three mighty ſtrong arguments to prevail with the ſoul to come to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that Chriſt is the ſon of God, and yet man, God man, ſo united, hence the terror of the Glory of God comes to be taken away, ſo as poor wretched fleſh may be able now to converſe with God, being vailed with our own nature, God being vailed with fleſh. It is true, if God in his own Glory, as he is in himſelf in the higheſt heavens, ſhould cal us to come to him, we might be afraid leaſt we ſhould be overwhelmed with his glory, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand before him; we cannot look ſo much as upon the glory of the ſin, how ſhal we be able to go to the body of the glory of God? Are we able to go to the body of the Sun? No, it would burn us up, how can we be able to go to the glory of God then? Now becauſe the Lord knows that his glory is ſo great, he hath been pleaſed to provide ſuch a way to take off the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44661:93"/>
terror of his greatneſs, though we be frail fleſh, yet the Lord hath done that which may encourage us to come to him, for he hath vailed his glory with Human Nature, and therefore we may now through Chriſt be able to ſtand before, and converſe with the infinite glorious God. This is a great miſtery, the greateſt, that God hath taken our fleſh upon him, and vailed his glory with our fleſh, that he might have his terror taken from us, and we may be able to come to him, here was one ſpecial end that Chriſt was made man, that the Lord might deal with us in a more familiar way, than otherwiſe he could.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that Chriſt that is God-man, in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, cals us to come to him: hence we have this Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That certainly, the Lord is infinitly inclined to do good unto the Children of men, this is a mighty incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for all poor Souls to come to Chriſt, for when thou heareſt, that Chriſt the Son of God is made man in one perſon, by that thou may'ſt gather this for thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that certainly God is infinitly inclined to do good unto the Children of men, God would never have wrought ſo ſtrange a work, as to unite our Natures into one perſon with his Son, if he had not meant to do ſome infinite good unto mankind; the Lord hath given a moſt evident demonſtration of it, in uniting mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to his own Son. As if the King ſhould be pleaſed to marry his Son to one that is the neareſt Kinſwoman you have, you would by that gather ſuch an argument as this, and all your friends would conclude, ſurely the King doth intend much good to this family, that he is ſtrongly inclined to prefer this family: So when God is pleaſed to marry his Son to our fleſh, Yea, to take our Nature into a nearer union with him, then the Wife is taken into the Husband, we may gather this argument, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Surely, God doth intend much good unto the Children of men, and therefore come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From this conſideration, who Chriſt is, God manifeſted in the fleſh, we may gather this incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44661:94"/>
to come to him, That the Lord in uniting the divine Nature with the Human in Chriſt, hath done already a greater work for the Children of men, than the ſaving of their Souls comes to; the ſaving of thy Soul is a difficult work; thou thinkeſt thus, Alas! for me to come and think to be ſaved by Chriſt, this is too great a thing, too good to be true, it is not poſſible that ever ſuch a poor ſinner as I am, ſhould be raiſed to the glory that I hear of in the word, that God will raiſe his Saints unto, thou thinkeſt that the Salvation of thy Soul is ſo great, and ſo mighty a thing, and therefore that perhaps doth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſcourage thee in coming: but then, when thou heareſt what Chriſt is, and how God hath united the divine and human Nature together in one perſon, from thence thou mayeſt gather this incouragement, that God hath done a greater work than to ſave thy Soul, for ſo it is: It is a greater work for God to unite the divine and humane Nature together in one perſon, than to ſave all the Souls in the world. As if Chriſt ſhould ſay thus, Oh, Come to me, know what I am, I am the Son of the Father, of the ſame Nature and being, and I am likwiſe made man, God the Father hath united my divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to your fleſh, and in this he hath done a greater work than the ſaving of your Souls, in this he hath ſhewed what intentions he hath for the good of mankind, and in this the terror of the almighty is taken away, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come to me, that is the firſt Argument, come to Chriſt.</p>

               <div n="2" type="part">
                  <head>ARG. II.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, Come to Chriſt, Why? For Chriſt hath come to you; do you come to him, for he hath come to you; that Chriſt might come to you, he hath even come, as it were, from the Boſome of the Father, and for a time was willing to have his glory Eclipſed, to come into this world, to be in the forme of a Servant, to be in a mean
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44661:94"/>
condition here in this world, Chriſt hath ſuffered more in coming to you, than you can poſſibly ſuffer in going to him, Chriſt is content to come from the Father to you, what is it that you can go from to come to him. He is ſaid in the Book of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> to come leaping over the Mountaines, he comes leaping over all difficulties to you, if you think there are ſome difficulties in your going to Chriſt, know, that there was far greater difficulties that lay in the way in his coming to you, but whatſoever there was in the way, he was reſolved to go through them all, and did come, and was here in the world, in the fleſh, that he might ſave you, and he that is thus come to you, cals you to come to him.</p>

               <div n="3" type="part">
                  <head>ARG. III.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, You muſt know, That Chriſt is the great Mediator that is ſet between God and the Children of men: it is he that hath undertaken the great work, the greateſt work that ever was in the World, to Mediate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the infinite offended God, and your ſinful wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls, for through your ſins there was ſuch an infinite diſtance made between God and you that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you ſhould ever have gone without this Mediator. It is an argument of mighty uſe, if rightly underſtood, and throughly conſidered of, the vaſt diſtance that ſin hath made between God and ſinful creatures, that they can never come to God, but through the glorious Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that is come into the world, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God and man, that was made by God the Father the Head of the ſecond covenant, and hath undertaken to make up all the wrongs that our ſins have done unto God, to pacifie the wrath of God, and to ſatisfie the juſtice of God, it is he that hath undertaken to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and you, and it is he that cals unto you to come to him. If there were a company of Priſoners in danger of Death, and one ſhould come to the Prince to mediate for them, to make peace between the Prince and them, one that the priſoners ſhould know to be the only
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44661:95"/>
Son of the prince, the delight of his Soul, and he is ſent by the Prince himſelf to come to make peace and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it for them, and he comes unto the Priſon doors, and cals to the Priſoners lying in their dungeon, and ſaies, ariſe, and come to me, hearken what I ſhal bring to you, obſerve my direction, and peace ſhall be made between the Prince and you, you ſhall have pardon, you ſhall have your lives; would not this ſtir them up to hearken unto him, and greedily to come unto the grate? Chriſt is come for this very end, this was the work that God the Father ſent him into the world about, to be a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himſelf and poor, wretched, ſinful creatures, and now he comes unto them, cals unto them and ſaies, come to me, If you did but know what Chriſt was, and what his work was in coming into the world, it could not but mightily draw your hearts to come to him when he cals.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="part">
                  <head>ARG. IV.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, Come to me ſaith Chriſt, for if ever there were any that deſerved to be hearkened unto, and to come unto when he cals, certainly I deſerve it; For I have not only come to be a Mediator, but the truth is, it hath coſt me my blood, I have manifeſted ſuch Love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that I have laid down my Life for you, I have ſhed my moſt precious blood, I have been willing to be made a curſe, and all for the ſaving of your ſouls; my Love hath been more to you, then to mine own life, for that was laid down for you. I have undertaken, indeed, to mediate between my Father and you, but it hath coſt me much, yet in Love to you I have thus done, all my blood is ſhed, the work is done, the price is paid, Come to me that you may have Life. And this is the meaning of that forementioned place, The Servant is bidden to go and invite the Gueſts, for all is ready, ſo here, the work is done, Chriſt hath done the work, there could not be that argument to our fore Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> they could not have ſuch an argument to draw them, Chriſt could not ſay to them, Come to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44661:95"/>
me, for I have not only undertaken to Mediate between the Father and your Souls, but I have laid down my life for you, ſhed my blood for you, I have paid the price already for you, I have purchaſed your Souls, I have done the whol work, it is finiſhed. But now there is this Argument to draw your Hearts to Chriſt, for the work is finiſhed, the greateſt work that ever was, or ſhal be undertaken in the World, the greateſt work of all is finiſhed, and upon the finiſhing of this work, Chriſt cals you to himſelf, and ſaith, Come to me.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="part">
                  <head>ARG. V.</head>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider the infinite good that your Souls ſhall have by Chriſt in your coming to him, this draweth the Heart indeed, not only to ſee who it is that calls you, for commonly when we hear one cal, we wil ask, who cals, and if it be one that we expect good from, we come to him. (This we ſhewed already.) But this argument is from the infinite good that your Souls ſhall have when you come to him, the very firſt moment you come to him, you will be bleſſed creatures, there will be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite change of your condition, for conſider.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If there be any good to be had in all the mercy that there is in God himſelf, if there be any good to be had in God the Father, in the divine eſſence, in the infinite, eternal, firſt-being of all things, it is to be had by coming unto Chriſt, for Chriſt ſaith, in <hi>John,</hi> 14.6. <hi>No man comes unto the Father, but by me.</hi> You cannot come to God but by Chriſt, as was intimated before, in regard of the diſtance between God and us through ſin, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to God til you underſtand Chriſt to be the great means of conveyance of all good from God to his creature. Chriſt is the great means of conveyance of all good unto the creature. <hi>All are yours, you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and the Laſt verſe. All things are Gods, that you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44661:96"/>
but how come they to be ours, all things are yours, that is the happineſs of thoſe that are come to Chriſt. He doth not ſay, all things are Gods, and you are Gods, No, but all things are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods. Whereas other people, in ſeeking after mercy from God, go this way to work, they go immediatly to God, and think that if ever they receive any mercy or good, it muſt come from God, they muſt have it from God, but there is ſomthing comes between God and you, all things are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods; ſo that God himſelf is the infinite Fountain of all good; Chriſt is as it were the Ciſterne, into which all the mercy and goodneſs of God is to be conveyed, and beleevers by Faith have every one a Pipe, as it were, put into this Ciſterne, ſo they come to have conveyed all good, the fullneſs of the divine Nature, they are united unto Chriſt, and ſo have all Mercy conveyed from God unto them, here is a ſtrong argument to draw the heart to come to Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt is the great conveyance of all good from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her unto the Soul, is not the mercy of God ſweet unto a Soul, that is Laden with the Burden of Sin? This mercy you muſt have in me, ſaith Chriſt, or elſe you ſhall never have a drop of it. We are to know therefore, that by our ſins the conduit Pipe of all the Mercy in God is ſtopt, ſo as not one drop of ſaving mercy for eternity can be let into the Soul, and though we ſhould cry for mercy never ſo much, and ſhreeke out, yet we are to know, that the Pipe is ſtopt by ſin, and there is no other way to open this pipe, but only by Jeſus Chriſt, he is the opener of the pipe of Gods infinite Grace, let out to the Children of men. Now if we look upon the Grace of God, we are firſt to conſider, that by our ſins we have ſtopt the current of al the Grace of God, and it is only Chriſt that lets out this current, and now Chriſt ſaith, come to me, all you that would have mercy. Would you have Mercy? O yes, it is true, we would have mercy, but we find this Mercy
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44661:96"/>
of God is ſtopt by our ſins. Now ſaith Chriſt, come to me, and by me, all the ſluces of the Grace and mercy of God are opened to poor Souls, we know God is a God of mercy, the God of all conſolation, in himſelf the Father of mercies, he is infinitly merciful, ſo that when we come to God, we come to the God of mercy, the God of all conſolation, we come to the Father of mercies, we come to him who is infinite in mercy, whoſe Nature is mercy, to him that is imfinitely above all creatures in mercy. All the merciful creatures in Heaven and Earth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him are nothing, Yea, take all the merciful Saints in the world, the moſt merciful diſpoſitions that were in all the creatures in the world, and put them into one man, you would ſay, this were a merciful man. If all the mercies, in all the bowels, of all the Saints, that ever were from the beginning of the world, were put into one man, would not you think him to be a merciful man? if he called you to come to him for mercy, would you not come? Such a man that hath all mercies, of all the Saints that ever were in the world put into him; yet this man would be a moſt cruel man in compariſon of the infinite mercy that is in God. If we were in cruel ſtraites and had to deal with ſuch a man that had the bowels of the mercy of all the men in the world; thoſe that are in miſery, they go to their friends, and ſay, Oh! it is wel I did fal into ſuch a merciful mans hand. But now thou that art a poor troubled ſinner, if thou comeſt to Chriſt thou comeſt into the Arms, into the bowels of the infinite God, that is infinitely above the bowels of all mercies that are either in Heaven or Earth, and therefore come to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly: Further, not only come unto the bowels of mercy, but by coming to Chriſt, thou comeſt to God as a Father, Come to me, ſaith Chriſt, thou ſhalt not only come to the Father, but the firſt moment you come to me, I ſhall preſent you to God as a Child, and God to you as a Father, the infinite God is a deadly enemy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44661:97"/>
to all out of Chriſt, but by coming to Chriſt there is peace with him, you come to have union with him, and you come to be made one with God, into the neereſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God next unto the Hypoſtatical union. There is divers ſortes of union with God, there is the Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical union, but next unto that is a Miſtical union, and ſuch a union have the Saints, the Soul that was before an enemy unto God, and caſt out from him, the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſuch a Soul comes to Chriſt, it hath ſuch a union with God, that is the neereſt union that any creature can have, next unto the human Nature of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly: Yea, Not only to be united to him, but thou ſhalt come preſently to have his Image ſtamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, his Spirit put into thee, to live the Life of God, to have communion with him here, and thou ſhalt be ſaved: the very moment thou comeſt to him, thou ſhalt have Righteouſneſs to ſtand in the preſence of the infinite Holy God.</p>
                  <p>I, You will ſay, if we come to God, we come by Chriſt, but God is a Holy and a Righteous God, and how ſhall we be able to ſtand before him, being a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God and we ſuch ſinners? Therefore this is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this, that the firſt moment thou comeſt to Chriſt, he will put the holy Robes of his Righteouſneſs upon thee, that ſhall make thee able to ſtand before the infinite God, ſo that whatever thou art in thy ſelf, it is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible but God ſhould be wel pleaſed with thee, and ſhould take delight in thee as his own, thou may'ſt walk up and down in the preſence of God, and all becauſe He ſees thee in the Robes of Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly: And further, The firſt moment thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to Chriſt thou ſhalt be ſafe to eternity, for all the hazard of miſcarrying to eternity is over at the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou comeſt to Chriſt, this thou ſhalt have in the firſt moment of thy coming to Jeſus Chriſt, this is for the comfort of thoſe that come to Chriſt. More of theſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44661:97"/>
Particulars we ſhall have, when we come to the promiſe that is here made in the Text, <hi>And you ſhall have Reſt.</hi>

                  <p>Sixtly, For a further argument of drawing the Heart unto Jeſus Chriſt when he cals to come to him, conſider, what a poor wretch thou art in thy ſelf, a vile, baſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne, Deformed, Miſerable, Succourleſs, Helpleſs, Shiftleſs Creature, a Beggar. If a Prince as he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the Streets, ſeeing a poor Beggar lying upon the ground in the durt, ſhould be pleaſed to call to ſuch a creature, and ſay to him, come to me, would it not reviue his Spirit? If one ſhould tel him the King the Prince cals, how would he ſtir himſelf. Now thou art the pooreſt Creature in the world, never any poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that lay groveling in the durt ful of Sores and wounds, was in a worſe condition then thou art, when thou ſeeſt ſuch a one, think that thy condition is far worſe then his. If the King were going in his Robes to the Parliament a long the ſtreets, and ſhould ſee ſuch a poor creature lying by the Walls, and ſhould take ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him, and call him to him, and ſay, let that poor creature come to me, it would incourage him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; this invitation from Chriſt is juſt the very ſame, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſees thee lying in thy gore blood, as it is deſcribed in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 16. where the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of them that are in their Natural eſtate is moſt elegantly ſet down, they lay in their blood, none Eye pittyed them, then I came, ſaith God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaid unto thee live, and this time was the time of Love, ſo when thou lieſt in thy poor, wretched, miſerable condition, in thy filth, in thy baſeneſs, in the Gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity, this bleſſed Redeemer this great Prince of al the world, he cals to thee and ſaies, Oh! thou poor creature, Come to me.</p>

Now this that is tranſlated in your Books, <hi>In no wiſe caſt out,</hi> it hath a greater force in the Greek, there is two Negatives, for though we in Engliſh ſay, two Negatives make an affirmative, it is not ſo in Greek, for it is for a ſtronger confirmation of a thing, and ſo it may be read, He that cometh to me, I will not not caſt out, as if ſo be Chriſt ſhould ſay, he that comes to me I will not, I will not caſt out. As we, when we would expreſs the fervency of our Spirits, we double our ſpeech; ſo doth Chriſt, he would expreſs the Fervency of his ſpirit, and therefore he ſaith, he that cometh to me, I will not, I will not caſt out.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whoever thou art upon coming to him he will not caſt thee off, for this was the great errand that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44661:98"/>
Chriſt came into the world for, to receive poor troubled ſouls, and to eaſe poor Laden ſinners; it was the very buſineſs that Chriſt came into the world about, it is the work that God the Father hath ſent his Son into the world about, that he might receive ſuch poor wretched ſinful creatures as thou art, and if it were not, that he ſhould receive thoſe that come to him, he ſhould loſe the end that he came into the world for, and therefore he will receive you when you come, for Chriſt ſaies, I ſhal elſe loſe the end of that that was the greateſt work that ever was done ſince the world began, or ſhal be done to al eternity, that is, my undertaking the Mediation between God and you; if I ſhould not receive poor Souls that come to me, that great work would be loſt, that work wherein my Father and my ſelf is ſo much glorified, for this is the glory of Chriſt to do ſo, and Chriſt ſaw there was ſo much glory to be had this way, that it did move Chriſt to come into the world, to take ſuch a courſe as this is to ſave Souls, Chriſt knows that he ſhould to all eternity be magnified by Angels, for the ſaving ſuch Souls as thou art, Yea, Chriſt knows, that the Father wil love him more, for he ſaies. <hi>The Father loves me, becauſe I laid down my life for the Sheep,</hi> John, 10.17. It is that that will delight God the Father, it is that that wil make God the Father to delight in the Son, it is that whereby Jeſus Chriſt gets the very end of his death; til he had laid down his life; till he had made his Soul an offering for ſin, he was not ſatisfied. This is it that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied him, that he ſhould ſee his Seed, and amongſt others, thou art one, thou that comeſt to Chriſt, thou art of the Seed that Jeſus Chriſt is ſo ſatisfied with, that he gaines the very end of laying down his life for thee, and certainly, Chriſt will not caſt thee off, but wil receive thee and therefore come to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He will receive thee, for he hath heretofore received as vile wretches as thou art.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, There was never any ſo vile as we are.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44661:99"/>
Its true, we may, and ought to judg our Selves as vile as the worſt; though we have not committed ſuch vile ſins outwardly as others have, yet becauſe we know not the Hearts of other men, nor do we know what means others have had, therefore we are to judg ourſelves as vile as any: but know, that Chriſt hath received as bad as thou art, thoſe that pierced Chriſt, that ſhed his blood, Chriſt received 3000. of them in one day, he received three thouſand in one day of thoſe that had inbrued their hands in his blood; and the ſtory ſtands in the Scripture for an everlaſting Monument, to incourage poor ſinners to come to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, though thou art a vile ſinner, and a wretched creature, yet know, the greater thou haſt been in thy ſin, the more will the Grace of God in Chriſt be magnified, and certainly, there is in Chriſt ſuch a Grace as is able to ſwallow up great ſins as well as little, as the infinite Ocean of the Sea, is able to ſwallow up great Veſſels as well as ſmal: were it not a ſilly thing, when we were to caſt a Veſſel into the Sea, to ſay it is too great a Veſſel: God is willing to have his Grace magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to thee, though it be to the hardening of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. If there is an infinite Ocean in God to ſwallow up great, as well as ſmal ſins, ſo long as this keeps thee off from coming to Chriſt, ſo long thou diſhonoreſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Grace of God in Chriſt. Were Gods mercy only ſuch as his common bounty is to other of his creatures, this might keep thee off, but now, it being the infinite Ocean of mercy in his Son, and purchaſed by Chriſt, it is an infinite diſhonor to the Grace of God in Chriſt to ſtand upon tearms, and not to come to Chriſt, what doſt thou think that mercy is worth, that coſt the Blood of Chriſt? Thou thinkeſt thou art a great ſinner, and that it muſt be wonderful mercy that muſt ſave thy Soul. Its true, and it's well thou thinkeſt So, but now conſider further ſinner, what doſt thou think of the mercy that ſhall be as much worth as the Blood of the Son of God?
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44661:99"/>
For him to be made a curſe for ſinners, will that do it? If that will do it thou mayeſt come to him. How much doſt thou think the mercy of Chriſts coming to take Mans Nature upon him is worth, to take our ſinful Nature upon him? If he will do it, thou mayeſt come to Chriſt. Yea, Further, know, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receives any that come to him, but Beggars, none but Beggars, none but miſerable creatures, none but thoſe that are wretched, that are vile; and Chriſt did never yet from the beginning of the world receive any man upon theſe tearms, becauſe he was not ſo vile as another man, as thus, here is one that is thus vile, here is another that is not altogether ſo vile, I will receive him upon this ground, becauſe he is not ſo vile, this was never the ground; but when he receives them, he receives them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on free Grace, and therefore it is not how vile thou art, for that is the Glory of Chriſt to ſave vile creatures, and he ſaves none but thoſe that come as Beggars, thoſe that come and do ſee themſelves, as vile wretched, worthleſs, unworthy, miſerable, damned duſt and Aſhes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Only ſuch are objects for the Heart of Chriſt to be ſet upon; rather make it an argument to drive thee more to him, as <hi>David</hi> did, in the 25. <hi>Pſalm. O Lord have mercy upon me, pardon my Sin, for it is great,</hi> So, Lord, I am vile, I am wretched, I am unworthy and therefore Lord receive me, Lord, therefore I come unto thee, do not ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> once did, Maſter depart from me I am a ſinful Man, No, but the truth is, he ſhould rather have ſaid thus, Maſter, Come to me, or Maſter I come to thee, becauſe I am a ſinful man: So thou ſhouldeſt not ſay, O Lord, depart from me, becauſe I am a ſinful creature, Or, Lord, do thou come to me, becauſe I am a ſinful wretch.</p>
                  <p>And know, that upon thy coming to him thou wilt have wonderful welcome, wonderful great entertainment above all that thy Heart can think of. O the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing by Jeſus Chriſt, of thoſe Souls that come to him;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44661:100"/>
and this is the very Reaſon why poor ſinners, at their firſt converſion, have their Hearts ſo filled with joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at their firſt coming to Chriſt, Chriſt doth give them ſuch wonderful imbracements, til they come to be more Strengthened, and then perhaps Chriſt will have them live rather by Faith, than by ſence. It is in the new Birth as in the Birth of Nature, Children when they are firſt born, they ſhoote up mightily; take a Child that comes very little out of the Womb, come to it a quarter of a Year after, the Child is ſhot up a great deal, you may ſee it a great deal taller, and bigger, every Limb increaſed, but take it at ten years Old, and it grows not ſo much then as at the firſt, and the Reaſon is, becauſe it coming out of the worm Womb, it could not ſubſiſt if Nature did not haſten to ſtrengthen it ſelf at firſt: ſo men, when they come to Chriſt at firſt, they ſhoote up and grow to ſuch inlargement of Spirit, and they do ſo ſenſibly perceive, Yea, and others do ſo ſenſibly perceive a greater growth at their firſt coming than afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when they firſt come, Chriſt will Strengthen them againſt all diſcouragements, Chriſt will uſe you tenderly, Chriſt will not upbraid you for your former ſins, and ſay, What! you that have lived a prophane life, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner of my ordinances, a ſcorner at my waies, and at my people, Chriſt will not upbraid the Soul, but he wil be render of you, he will paſs by your ſins, and heal your weakneſs, <hi>He will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax.</hi>

                  <p>Yea, and yet further, let me tel you this, that while you have heard the word of God by a poor miniſter, in the name of Chriſt to cal you unto him, to draw you to come unto him, if you ſhal reject this invitation, and other invitations, that you have by the miniſters of the Goſpel, know that of al the ſins that ever you committed in al your lives, this wil prove to be the greateſt, that you have ſtood out againſt this invitation, it is that that wil aggravate al your ſins. It may be ſome of you may think, wel, this is an incouragment to ſinners, we are called to Chriſt, and we are tould, that the vileſt may come to him, and Chriſt wil receive them. This is wel, but yet if thou wilt reject this invitation, and ſhalt yet let out thy heart to other vanities, and to the ſatisfying of thy ſinful luſts, this I ſay, this invitation of Jeſus Chriſt, wil be the greateſt aggravation of al thy ſins that ever thou Committedſt in al thy life, thy whoredome, thy drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thy ſwearing, al thy ſabbath breaking, wil not be ſo heavy upon thee, wil not be ſo deep upon the ſcore as one rejection of Jeſus Chriſt calling thee to come to him, and therefore take heed of abuſing the grace of Chriſt in calling you to come to him. For know, if there could be any ſign given to know who are Reprobates and who not, I would rather pitch upon this ſigne, one that ſhould go away after the grace of God is opened to him, and he invited to come to Chriſt, one that ſhould go away not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hardned in ſin, I ſay, I ſhould rather pitch upon this than any other ſigne. There is no ſin hardeneth the heart of God more than this. I wil give you one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for this. In <hi>Luke.</hi> 14.16, 17. When God as the maſter of the great feaſt, ſends his ſervants and invites men to come to the wedding, that is in truth to do that that I have been doing al this while to invite poor ſinners to come to Chriſt. Now divers make excuſes, ſome had

Oh! it were a dreadful doom to be paſt upon any ſoule, God forbid it ſhould be paſt upon any ſoul, and yet when we come to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt in the miniſtry of the Word, we cannot ſpeake of it without trembling hearts, without feare, leaſt ſome ſhould be hardened, and ſo God provoked by their reſiſting of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are three waies that God the father drawes thoſe to his ſon, that he intends ſhal be ſaved for ever by him. Firſt he draws them by the cord (as I may ſo ſpeak) of Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by enlightning their minds, by ſhewing them what his ſon is. Secondly, He draws them by the cords of mercy. Thirdly, he drawes them, by ſetting conſcience upon them, to put them forward, when the Lord is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul to Chriſt, he makes uſe of the conſciences of men and women, to put them on to come to Chriſt. O! thou wretched ſoul, is not that that thou heareſt in the word the truth of God? is it not the word of the Lord? haſt thou not now a gracious offer? Is it not a mercy that thou art out of hel this day? and is it not a mercy that thou art not drowned in the ſea? that thou art brought to land, to heare one more offer to come to Chriſt? Wilt thou yet go on in thy ſins? Wilt thou yet prize thy luſts, before al that infinite good that is in Jeſus Chriſt? doſt thou think this wil be peace in the end?

He ſaith, <hi>Come unto me, ye that Labor and are heavy Laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> This is that that now we are come unto, The gracious promiſe that Chriſt makes to draw Souls unto himſelf, he will give them Reſt, <hi>And I will give you Reſt.</hi> And what more fit Argument and ſeaſonable can there be at this time, this time we know is a time of trouble, a time of diſturbance, there is much perplexity and diſtreſs in our Nation, and what will be more acceptable unto us than this, to hear of Reſt? this is that that Chriſt doth promiſe to al them that come to him, that beleeve in him, he ſaith, he will give them Reſt.</p>
               <p>Before I come to open this gracious promiſe, which is exceeding ful of marrow and fatneſs, as we ſhall find, when we come to the opening of it. I ſhall firſt, give you one note, briefly, from the connexion of theſe words with the former, <hi>Come to me, ye that Labor, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> You ſee Chriſt, that he might draw ſinners to himſelf, makes a gracious promiſe of that that he knows will do good to ſinners at the Heart, he will give them Reſt. From hence the note is this in the general.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God would have us, even when we are coming to Chriſt, have ſome reſpect to our ſelves, and Chriſt encourageth us in coming to him, even to have ſome aime at our own good.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>That is the note cleerly, from the Connexion of the words.</p>
               <p>Before we open the promiſe (I will give you Reſt) ſaith he, if you come to me, in that Chriſt doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that which he knows will take the Hearts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as a great good unto them, to draw them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44661:104"/>
hence I ſay, the note it cleer, That in our coming to Jeſus Chriſt, it is lawful for us to have ſome aime at our own good, Yea, not only lawful for us, but we ought ſo to do, for we are to look upon Chriſt ſo as Chriſt propounds himſelf unto us, not only lawful, I ſay to look upon Chriſt ſo as he propounds himſelf to us, but it is our duty ſo to look upon him. Now when Chriſt propounds himſelf unto us as an object to draw our Hearts to him, he doth propound himſelf as one wherein our ſouls ſhal gaine abundance of good, one that we ſhall get much by. Now though it is true, we ſhould Labor to be above our ſelves as much as may be, we ſhould Labor to deny our ſelves, in ſome ſence, yet not ſo, but that we are to look at our own good, even in our coming unto Jeſus Chriſt. Now this I might ſhew you in abundance of Scriptures, in the very firſt commiſſion that Jeſus Chriſt gave unto his Apoſtles, after his Reſurrection, to go and Preach throughout the world, he ſaith unto them, in <hi>Mark,</hi> 16.15. verſe, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature, he that beleeveth and is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſhal be ſaved.</hi> This is cleer, that Chriſt would have us in our firſt beleeving, to have an aime at our own good. And ſo we find ſuch a kind of promiſe as this is in the Text, In <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16. verſe. <hi>Thus (ſaith the Lord) ſtand in the waies, and ſee, and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk therein, and ye ſhall find Reſt for your Souls.</hi> Inquire after the good waies, and you ſhall find Reſt for your Souls. So that you ſee, God propounds duties together with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the Lord knows what is beſt for us, and what wil work moſt upon us, and therefore, for us to think, that we muſt have no aime at all of any good to our ſelves in coming to Chriſt, and that it is no grace, but ſelf-love to come to Chriſt for our own good, this is a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I ſpeak the rather this point, becauſe I know how uſeful it is unto many poor Souls, whom the Lord
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44661:105"/>
is drawing unto Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord hath taken off their Hearts from ſinful ſelf, they would not enjoy themſelves in the luſts of the fleſh as formerly, the Lord hath made them willing to deny their own opinion, their own wills, their own affections, their former waies, to deny themſelves in the comforts of the things of this world, ſo as to prize him, and Chriſt, and his waies, the way of Chriſt more than they prize their very lives here in this world, and yet for all this, there comes a temptation upon them. I but, you ſeek Chriſt only to free you from Hell, and to ſave you, and therefore it is but ſelf-Love, it is no true Grace, becauſe that you ayme at your ſelves, rather than Chriſt, the Devil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevaile with a Heart that is drawing to Chriſt, thus, telling of it, Oh! but you prize your luſts more than Chriſt, or you prize your eaſe more than Chriſt; or you prize your eſtate, and your liberty more than Chriſt, or your life more than Chriſt, if ſo be that the Devil ſhal come thus and tempt, ſuch a ſoul could in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be able to anſwer, and to appeal unto God, and ſay, Lord! thou that knoweſt all things knoweſt it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that howſoever my Heart heretofore went after my luſts, after the world, after my eaſe and liberty, and I followed the common courſe of the world, and made thoſe things to be my greateſt good and comfort, yet Lord, thou knoweſt it is otherwiſe with me now, my Heart is ſet for Chriſt, and I can ſay, from the bottom of my Soul, with that bleſſed martyr <hi>Lambert,</hi> None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt. Now when the Heart is got thus farr, one would think thou mighteſt be above the Devil, and come to get aſſurance, I, ſaith the Devil, though you be taken off thus far, that you dare not commit any known ſin, and you ſeek after Chriſt, more than your eſtate and your liberty, yet there is one thing more that your hearts is not taken off from, you do not prize Chriſt moſt of all, you ſeek Chriſt to ſave you from Hell, and bring you to Heaven, that is it that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44661:105"/>
you ſeek Chriſt for, and therefore I know your Heart is not right all this while, this is a temptation that ſeizeth upon many men. Now I confeſs, it is a temptation that is beyond many men, they do not know what this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, that I prize Chriſt only to deliver me from Hell, and bring me to Heaven, this temptation is above the higheſt form of the courſe of the world, then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary profeſſors. Now the Spirit in the Text thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers this temptation, the Soul thus anſwers: It is true, I do ſeek Chriſt to ſave me from Hell, and bring me to Heaven, the fear of the wrath of the great God under which I ſaw my ſelf to be, and the diſpleaſure of God, was mighty upon my Spirit, the Lord hath made my Soul to be ſenſible of the dreadful breach that ſin hath made between him and my Soul, and the Lord hath cauſed the fear of eternity to fall upon my ſoul, and I come to be convinced of this, that ſuch is the breach between God and my ſoul, that there is none but Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator of the ſecond Covenant, that is able to make up the breach, and my ſoul makes after him as the Mediator, as he is propounded in the word, in the Goſpel, to be a Mediator between God and mankind, ſo my ſoul makes after him, and cloſeth with him: and what can the Devil ſay to this? For my heart doth cloſe with Chriſt, in the way that Chriſt is tendred unto me in the Goſpel; for ſo he is tendered, God himſelf ſaith thus, <hi>God ſo loved the world that he ſent forth his only begotten Son, that whoſoever belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> Thus God ſets forth his Son, as if God ſhould ſay thus, Be it known unto you, O poor wretched ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are in danger of eternal periſhing, that I have ſent forth my only begotten ſon into the world, and tender him unto your ſouls, to the end that your ſouls may not periſh, but have everlaſting Life. Thus God tenders his Son. Now then, when a ſoul ſhal be made ſenſible of the danger of eternal periſhing; and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44661:106"/>
the Lord ſhall make it apeare to the ſoul, what the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and the glory of eternal life is, and the ſoul ſhal come to ſee that the being delivered from periſhing, and the obtaining of eternal Life, is only to be had in Chriſt, and upon this doth cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, and caſt it ſelf upon him, and adventure it ſelf to lay the weight of its eternal eſtate upon Chriſt, the ſoul that doth thus receive Chriſt, according as he is tendred in the word, whatever objection may be to the contrary, this is to receive Chriſt, according as he is tendred in the word. Yet further, for the helping againſt this temptation it fals ful in this Text, <hi>Come unto me, and I wil give you reſt.</hi> Now many poor ſouls do come to Chriſt that they might have reſt, but then the devil puts this in, Oh! but you come to Chriſt for your owne good.</p>
               <p>Now for the helping againſt this temptation, know,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Lord at the firſt converſion, doth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily make uſe of the creatures ſelf-love, but it is of ſelf-love for eternity, and that is a higher degree of ſelf-love, than the moſt people in the world do attaine unto; Some people in the world they love themſelves only for this preſent life, but when God makes a man or woman to love himſelf for eternity, it is a good ſigne that the hand of God is upon the heart, and that the Lord doth intend good unto that ſoul, when the Lord begins to make thee to love thy ſelf truly for eternity, to love that that is true and of eternal good, it is a good ſigne that the Lord doth intend good unto thy ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Lord proceeds, not only to make thee to begin to love thy ſelf for eternity, that is to love that immortal ſoul that the Lord hath put into thee, but when the Lord comes to ſhew thee wherein thy true good for eternity lies, that it doth lye in this, that thou ſhalt be delivered from the wrath of God, and ſhalt not be caſt out of his preſence, but ſhalt come to have union with God, and live in his preſence to the praiſe of his Grace
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44661:106"/>
to all eternity, this is thy good, this thou doſt account thy happineſs, that thou maiſt be delivered from being caſt out of Gods preſence, and that the Lord would bring thee unto himſelf to live with him, and to joyn with the Angels and Saints to the praiſe of his infinite Grace in Chriſt eternally: Thou accounteſt this to be the good that thou wouldeſt have in thy ſalvation, I ſay, the revealing of this to thee, and the carrying of thy Heart unto Chriſt upon this ground, this is faith, it is true Grace, for here God hath ſo twiſted, (as I may ſo ſpeak) the glory of his own Name, and the good of his creature together, as they both are joyned in one, and ſo the Heart may be carryed to both of them at one time, to joyn in one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea further, Let me tell you, when thy Heart looks at this as thine own good, and this is the Reſt that thou wouldeſt have, whereas I ſee, that by my ſins I am cut off from God, and ſo I can have no peace nor Reſt, and I ſee my happineſs, and the Reſt of my ſoul is, to have union with that God, that my ſins hath cut me off from, and that I might live for ever to the praiſe of the infinite and glorious firſt being of all things, I ſay, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in though thou aimeſt at thy own good, before thou art aware of it, and thou doſt, it may be, explicitly Reaſon with thy own Heart; but I do regard God above any good in my ſelf, yet in that thy Heart is upon it to that end, that thou mayeſt have union with the Father, and live eternally with him to the praiſe of his Grace in his Son, I ſay, in this act, though thou art not able expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly to conceive how thou lookeſt at God above thy ſelf. Yet God ſees it, there is that work of God in thy Heart, to raiſe God there above thy ſelf: and therefore, thoſe poor ſinners, that are much afflicted under the Burden of their ſins, let them but Labor and Eye God, ſo as to look at Chriſt as one that is a Mediator between God and them, to bring God and their ſouls together, to ayme at this, and they need not trouble themſelves with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44661:107"/>
anſwering any further that temptation, O! I come to Chriſt, but it is only that I might be ſaved. I do not know that in all the Book of God (to give you this one note about it, and then we paſs from this point) that we find this as a note of an Hipocrite, that he doth love his own ſalvation too much, we never find it as a note of an Hipocrite, that he doth come to Chriſt that he might be ſaved, and ſeeing the word of God doth not ſet it out, as the note of an Hipocrite, let not us nouriſh this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in our own Hearts, ſo as to hinder us from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, thy Heart would have Reſt in coming to Chriſt, therefore come to him, that thou mayeſt have Reſt. And thus much for this note from the Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the promiſe, Come to Chriſt for Reſt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Reſt promiſed by Chriſt in general: And that there is no Reſt for a Soul out of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt now for the promiſe it ſelf. We read in the 16. of <hi>Iſai.</hi> the firſt verſe, that Chriſt ſaies, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted me to Preach good tydings unto the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken Hearted, to proclaim li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Captives, and the opening of the priſon to thoſe that are bound, to proclaime the acceptable Year of the Lord, and the day of Vengeance of our God, to comfort all that Mourne, &amp;c.</hi> Here we have a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſt, and in this my Text, this prophecy of Chriſt is fulfilled, Chriſt is come here in the Text, to Preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken Hearted, to proclaime liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, all this is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44661:107"/>
contained in this promiſe, <hi>I wil give you Reſt.</hi> Reſt is that that all creatures in the world deſire, the end of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Reſt, ſo the Philoſophers ſay, the end of motion is quietneſs, it is the end of all motion whatſoever, if the creature were where it would be, and had what it would have, then it had Reſt. But now in motion, what is the Reaſon that the fire aſcends upwards? but becauſe the proper place of the fire is above: and that the Earth, and all heavy things fal downward? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their proper place is below; but let them be where they would be, and have what they would have, and then they are at Reſt.</p>
               <p>So it is with the rational creature, when the rational creature is in its proper place, that that is the proper place for an immortal Soul, and when an immortal ſoul comes to have the Capacity of it to be filled, when it comes to have what an immortal Soul is capable of, then it comes to have Reſt, and this is a Reſt that Chriſt doth promiſe here in the Text, <hi>and I will give you Reſt</hi>: that is thus, If you come to me, you ſhall firſt be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from all your burdens, from all miſery whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And Secondly, you ſhal be where you would be, and injoy what you would have; ſo that indeed, this promiſe containes the freedome from all evil, and the enjoyment of all good, there cannot be Reſt until there be a freedome from evil, and an injoyment of all good, that is the general here in this promiſe, I will give you Reſt. There is a great deal of difference between the Reſt that Chriſt here promiſeth to give, and that that men ſeek after in the world. We read of the Rich Glutton in <hi>Luke,</hi> 12. ſaith he, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe,</hi> Soul be at Reſt: for the word there in the Greek, it is of the ſame that here this word is in my Text, of Reſt, Soul take thine eaſe, or Soul be at Reſt, Why? <hi>For thou haſt goods laid up for many Years.</hi> Now mark the difference of the Reſt of the Soul of a worldling, and the reſt of the Soul of a Chriſtian: A worlding ſaies,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44661:108"/>
Soul take thy Reſt, for thou haſt meat, and drink, and thou haſt goods laid up for many Years. A Chriſtians Reſt is this, Come (ſaith Chriſt) to me and I will give you Reſt; the Reſt of a Chriſtian, it is in the Son of God, it is in the Mediator of the ſecond Covenant, it is in him that brings the Soul unto the Father, and brings all the treaſure and Riches of the Grace of the Father unto the ſoul, it is in him that a Chriſtian finds reſt; and a worldling only, in meat, and drink, and other things, as we ſhall ſee more afterwards. Thus in general what the meaning is.</p>
               <p>Now in this promiſe of Chriſt, there are two things to be handled; the Firſt implyed, the Second ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.</p>
               <p>That which is implyed is this, That there is no reſt in the Souls of the Children of men out of Jeſus Chriſt, that is plainly implied, Come to me, and I will give you reſt. So that here is plainly implied; That there is no reſt for an immortal Soul out of Jeſus Chriſt, it can have no reſt out of Chriſt. And then that that is expreſt is this, That in Jeſus Chriſt, as ſoon as the Soul comes to have union with Jeſus Chriſt, it ſhall have true reſt indeed, there is ful reſt to be had in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now for the firſt, That out of Jeſus Chriſt, there can be no reſt unto the ſoul: As we read of the Dove that <hi>Noah</hi> ſent forth; when his Ark was floating up and down on the Water, he ſent forth a Dove, and you find in the ſtory of <hi>Noah</hi> there, in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 8.89. That when the Dove was ſent forth, ſhe flew up and down, but ſhe had not whereon to reſt the Sole of her Foot, and therefore ſhe comes flying to the Arke again: ſo it is with a ſoul that is not in Chriſt (for the Arke was a type of Chriſt) it may floate up and down in the world here, but certainly, there is nothing for the ſoul to reſt it ſelf
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44661:108"/>
upon out of Chriſt. Indeed, we read, that when <hi>Noah</hi> ſent forth a Raven out of the arke, the Raven came no more, but the dove came again, and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Dove and the Raven doth elegantly expreſs the difference between thoſe ſouls that God hath an intent to do good unto in Chriſt, and thoſe that are left by God, and have no other portion appointed for them than the things of this world: men of this world whom the Lord intends no higher good, than the things of this world, they are like the Raven, they flutter up and down in the world, but never come to the arke, never come to Chriſt; the other that the Lord hath an intent to do good unto, although they may for a while be floating up and down here in this world, yet ſo wil God order things, that their ſoules ſhal never have any reſt and quiet, til they come to Jeſus Chriſt, nothing in this world ſhal ſatisfie them, but the Lord wil make them ſeek to be ſenſible of any emptineſs, that they have not that good that their ſoules were made for, no reſt to be had out of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is a Scripture or two that is very obſervable. I might Name multitudes, But I ſhal content my ſelf with one or two. That place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> will be ſufficient if I Name no more, it is in the 57. Chapter of the prophecy of <hi>Iſa.</hi> and the two laſt verſes. There you ſhal ſee al men that are out of Chriſt deſcribed in this, of having no reſt, the 20. verſe. <hi>But the wicked are like the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up myre and dirt, there is no peace (ſaith my God) to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or there is no reſt, ſaith my God, to the wicked: yee that are mariners know what a troubled ſea doth meane, a ſea that is troubled caſts forth myre and dirt; and juſt thus is a wicked mans heart, it is like the troubled ſea, it caſts forth mire and dirt.</p>
               <p>And as when the ſea is moſt troubled, it caſts forth moſt dirt, ſo it is with wicked men, when wicked men are moſt troubled, then they caſt forth moſt wickedneſs.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44661:109"/>
So ſomtimes it may be, you find it, when you are in a ſtorme at ſea, ſome kind of men, inſtead of ſeeking God and praying unto God they fal a curſing, and ſwearing, and railing, and ſo their hearts are more troubled, than the troubled ſea, and thereby caſt out more filth and dirt out of their hearts, than is caſt out by the troubled ſea. Or if not at ſea, yet when they are here at land, as men that have no reſt and peace with God, every thing troubles them, having not reſt in Chriſt, they are troubled in their family, and with their neighbors, they do caſt forth nothing but mire and dirt, oaths, ſwearing, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, Oh! how do they come forth of wicked men when they are croſt at any time: when you ſee at any time the husband, or the wife to be croſt and troubled, when you ſee them in a diſtemper, and hear them ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, curſing, railing, blaſpheming, ſpeaking wicked ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in their paſſion, remember this text, of the 57, of <hi>Iſa.</hi> the 20. verſe, That a wicked man is like the troubled ſea that caſts forth mire and dirt. Oh! that you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, and apply it to your own hearts, is it thus with my heart. I fear that there are many, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences tel them, that this text doth lively ſet forth their hearts, their conſciences tel them, that when they are troubled they caſt forth mire and dirt, Oh! what mire and dirt hath been caſt forth by many, when they have been in trouble! now, that the Lord would ſettle this text upon your hearts, for the Lord ſaies it is the wicked man and woman, when they are troubled that do caſt forth this mire and dirt. But the ſpecial thing I aime at is in the next verſe, <hi>There is no peace (ſaith my God) to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> no peace, no reſt, this is a truth that doth belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al men and women that are out of Jeſus Chriſt, there is no peace, no reſt unto their ſoules, and as he doth deny al kind of reſt that ſuch a one can have, ſo you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, what a confirmation there is, <hi>Saith my God.</hi> It is God that ſaith it, as if the prophet ſhould ſay, I am now preaching unto you about the reſtleſs condition that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44661:109"/>
you are in, remaining in your natural eſtate, as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to God, while I am preaching of this, it wil be a ſad thing to you, it is a ſad argument you wil ſay, the prophet tels us, there is no reſt, no peace; but as if the prophet ſhould ſay, it is not I that ſaith it, it is my God that ſaith it, God doth pronounce this upon every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man and woman, that there is no peace, no reſt unto ſuch; let the world have never ſo much reſt and peace, though there ſhould be no war abroad in the world, yet there is no peace unto wicked men, no reſt unto their ſoules. I ſhal demonſtrate this more cleerly afterwards that there is no reſt nor peace to any wicked men in the world, though they ſeem to others to live in never ſo much eaſe, reſt and peace.</p>
               <p>Further, there is no peace to the wicked, <hi>ſaith my God</hi>; it is not I ſaith the prophet, but God that ſaith it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would teach us this note, That when any miniſters of God preacheth that which is hard to us, we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it is not their words, but Gods that ſpeakes to them, that God that wil make al good, that he ſpeakes by them, which is according to his word, according to what he ſaith in his word, there is no peace, ſaith my God.</p>
               <p>Further, there is <hi>no peace,</hi> ſaith my God, it may be that many would flatter you, and ſay there is peace, and theſe miniſters do but trouble people, trouble conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and what needs ſo much ſtir, what needs ſo much a doe, no queſtion the prophet did aime at theſe falſe prophets, as there were many that we reade of in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> that cryed peace, peace, when there was no peace. There was many falſe Prophets that lived in thoſe times, that ſaid the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> preacheth to you things that are too hard, God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and have we not al infirmities? and therefore it is but truſting in Gods mercy; and do we not do as others do? and we hope it ſhall be with us as with others at the laſt, and it is but repenting at laſt: now in oppoſition to al theſe, ſaith the prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> there is no peace, ſaith
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44661:110"/>
my God, let all the falſ prophets plead what they will, let them ſay what they pleaſe, yet my God ſaith, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wicked and ungodly man and Woman, there is no peace to their Souls.</p>
               <p>Further, It may be there are ſome that their own Hearts would ſay, peace, peace, as many men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that when they hear out of the word thoſe things that are very dreadful, and do come very near to their Conſciences, their Conſciences tel them this word of God neerly concernes them, yet they will be ready to bleſs themſelves in their own thoughts and ſay, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſhall be peace to them, juſt as we read in 29. of <hi>Deut.</hi> 19, and 20. verſes, ſaith the Lord, <hi>It ſhal come to paſs that if any man when he heares the words of this curſe, ſhall bleſs himſelf in his Heart and ſay, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine own Heart; the Lord will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his Jealouſie ſhal Smoake againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this Book ſhall lie upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his Name from under Heaven.</hi> How dreadful doth God ſpeak, and to whom? To that Soul, that ſhall hear out of Gods word, that there is no peace, no Reſt unto them in that condition, in the way that he is now in, yet it may be, ſaith the Lord, when you ſhall hear pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this day in my word againſt them, you ſhal have many in your auditory ſhall ſay, I ſhall have peace though I walk in the imagination of my own Heart. Now we do not find ſuch a dreadful expreſſion in all the Book of God againſt any, as we do againſt thoſe that ſhall ſay, they ſhall have peace, though they walk in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own Heart. Now hear, ſaith the prophet, may be ſome of you will ſay in your own Hearts, I ſhall have Reſt, I ſhal have Peace, but ſaith the Prophet, there is no Peace to the wicked, ſaith my God, though your own Hearts ſay, you ſhall have Peace, and what need we trouble our ſelves with the Miniſters words, but

my God ſaith, there is no peace to the wicked: methinks, here we have a place, that ſpeakes of wicked men direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in oppoſition to that which the Church ſpeaks of her ſelf, in <hi>Lamen.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my ſoul, therefore wil I hope in him.</hi> Now let us obſerve, at this time when the Church ſpeakes this, and ſaith, the Lord is her portion, ſhe was in a very afflicted eſtate and condition, and it may be that her enemies would ſay, that the Lord had forſaken her, and neglected her, I but, againſt al the enemies in the world, her faith prevailes, and ſayes, Let al the devils in hel ſay what they wil, let al the world ſay what they wil, yet my ſoul ſhal ſay, the Lord is my portion, that is, that faith that Gods ſpirit hath wrought in my ſoul ſhal inable me to ſay that the Lord is my portion. So on the contrary, when wicked men are in proſperity, and feel not the hand of God upon them, perhaps friends may flatter them, falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets wil flatter them; may be their own hearts wil flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves, but now to anſwer al, ſaith the prophet, there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God, my God ſaith it.</p>
               <p>Further, there is no peace, ſaith my <hi>God,</hi> no reſt to any out of Chriſt, this is to note, from whence it comes that wicked men can have no peace, why they can have no reſt, it is from God, it is God that wil not give it, God is againſt them. There are many wicked men and women, whoſe conſciences are begun to be inlightened, and they many times have trouble of ſpirit, and when they awake in the night, they are troubled, and when they go about their buſineſs in the day, they are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and when they come home, they are troubled, and ſo troubled as they ſcarce know what it is that troubles them. Now perhaps you have not known what it is that troubles you, but this text in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57, and the laſt verſe, tels you what it is that troubles you, it is the Lord that is out with you, its the anger, the diſpleaſure of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44661:111"/>
the almighty that is upon you in thoſe wayes that you have walked in, and therefore it is that the prophet brings the name of God, to ſhew whence it is that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men can have no peace.</p>
               <p>Further, It is obſervable, that he adds, it is <hi>My</hi> God; he doth not ſay there is no peace, that God ſaith, though that had been enough, but my God, that is thus, as if the Prophet ſhould ſay through the mercy of God, the Lord hath revealed this mercy to me, and my Soul hath ſome intereſt in this God, and ſince I knew God in Jeſus Chriſt, my ſoul hath found peace and Reſt in him, and he is my God, and hath revealed himſelf to me, he whoſe mind my ſoul is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure acquainted with, my God ſaith, there is no Peace to the wicked. And though however others may think, it is a ſtrange thing to tel ungodly men, that they are in a condition wherein they can have no peace, when they hear of the dreadful wrath of God againſt all ungodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be revealed out of the word, yet thoſe who are acquainted with the waies of God, thoſe who know the holineſs and juſtice of God, thoſe who underſtand the mind of God, thoſe who are acquainted with the ſecrets of the mind of God, thoſe men know, that there is a reality in what is declared againſt ſuch and ſuch wicked men, they can ſay, that to ſuch there is no Peace, they can wonder how it is poſſible that ſuch men can go on quietly in their way, they wonder how they can eat their meat in quiet, they wonder how they can ſleep in quiet, they that know what a breach ſin hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul, and know what a wonderful work it is to make up the breach between God and the Soul that ſin hath made, thoſe men can underſtand this, and ſo wonder at their ſecurity. That is the meaning of the prophets words in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> There is no peace to the wicked (ſaith my God) as he inſtanceth in thoſe words in the relation he hath to God, ſaith my God, becauſe he knew the way of God, he knew a wicked
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44661:111"/>
man could have no peace, others that know not the way of God, they think wicked men may have peace; as now, come to ſome men, and ſpeak of the natural mans Eſtate, and how we are all Children of wrath, and of ſin, and of the ſeverity of Gods juſtice, and holineſs; now a carnal heart, who knows not God, he thinks ſtrange of this, and thinks, people are troubled more than needs; but now come to another that underſtands what the way of God is, and knows what the way of God is in making peace between God and them, come to one to whom God hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe known in Chriſt, ſuch a one wil preſently ſubſcribe to al that is revealed of the wrath of God, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs of God, and of the righteous judgment of God: thus the prophet doth, My God, that God, that hath revealed himſelf to me, he ſaith, there is no peace to the wicked.</p>
               <p>Further, there is yet a further note, there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God, there is this note from it, That it is a ſad thing, when ſuch as are wiſe, Godly and gracious, that are acquainted with the wayes of God, ſhal think others conditions to be naught, when ſuch men ſhal be ſuſpicious of it, much more if they were able to ſay cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly what their eſtates are, but when ſuch as are wiſe, and holy, and walk cloſe with God, when they ſhal ſay to you, there is no peace, you had need look to it; is there any godly friend of yours, whom in your conſcience you beleeve is truly godly, that walks cloſe with God, and faithfully with him, and enjoyes communion with him? if ſuch a friend ſhal but think your condition to be naught it is a ſad thing: thus it is, when the prophet ſaith, there is no peace to ſuch and ſuch wicked men, ſaith my God, that is, through Gods mercy, I have an intereſt in him, and in his name pronounce this, that there is no peace to ſuch and ſuch wicked men.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Six Reaſons of the former Doctrine. <hi>1.</hi> The ſoul out of Chriſt is departed from God. <hi>2.</hi> Every man by nature is an enemy to God. <hi>3.</hi> Every man by nature is bound over to the juſtice of God to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what he can charge him with. <hi>4.</hi> In a man out of Chriſt there is every thing to diſquiet him. <hi>5.</hi> Every one out of Chriſt is condemned. <hi>6.</hi> Such every moment may be Plunged into a Gulf of Wrath.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WELL, Becauſe this text hath taken up ſome time in the opening of it, and hath much in it, I wil name no other than this; for this indeed is ſufficient to prove, that al out of Chriſt can have no peace nor reſt unto their ſoules. Would you know why, and how it comes to paſs, that <hi>None that are out of Chriſt can have Reſt unto their ſoules</hi>? I ſhal not ſpend much time in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening what I have to ſay, but thoſe that are to be deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered for the opening of this point are exceeding dreadful, they ſpeake dreadfully to thoſe that are out of Chriſt: but now becauſe you have already heard ſo much, of the willingneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to be reconciled to you, and his invitation of you to come to him, and I have ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to deliver to you, about the true reſt that a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſoul hath in Jeſus Chriſt, therefore I may take the more liberty, to ſhew unto you the reſtleſs condition that every ſoul is in that is out of Jeſus Chriſt. I wil do it very breifly in theſe particulars,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Certainly, a ſoul out of Chriſt, can have no reſt, becauſe it is departed from God, know this, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44661:112"/>
Oh! that the Lord would make you to know it, that every man and woman naturally is departed from God, is gone from God, from the womb we have departed from him, &amp; there is a great diſtance between God &amp; every one of our ſouls naturally, al the union we come to have with God, it is in his ſon, it is in Chriſt, therfore, til we come to be in Chriſt, there is a great chaſma, a gulf, a depth, a vaſt diſtance between God and al our ſoules, and this is one of the firſt things that the Lord is pleaſed to ſhew, and to convince a ſoule that he is about to ſave, of the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that there is between God and the ſoul natturally, now it is impoſſible for a ſoul to have reſt that is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, for God is the proper Centre of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90. <hi>Thou art our habitation</hi>; the ſoul can have no reſt but in God, for God is the proper place of an immortal ſoul, the true good of an immortal ſoul it is the injoyment of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good: now if the ſoul be ſeparated from that which is the true good, and proper place of it, it is impoſſible it ſhould have any reſt. In the 12. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the latter end, it is ſaid of the wicked, <hi>The wicked walk round about,</hi> the words are termed in the old Latin, in a circuit, up and down, but now a godly man, walkes in a ſtrait line, he goes to the center, in a ſtrait line to God as the center, and there it finds reſt; but when it is in its natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it walkes in a circle, up and downe, ſeeking for reſt and finding none, as it is ſaid of the uncleane ſpirit in the Goſpel, that walks up and down ſeeking reſt, but finds none; ſo it is with men in the world, they would fain have reſt, and ſeek ſomewhat that is good, but finds none, for they are departed from God that is the only reſt of an immortal ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, not only ſo, but every man by nature is an enemy to God, and therefore cannot look upon God, the infinite, eternal, firſt being of al things without terror if he knowes him; no man or woman that knowes what
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:44661:113"/>
God is, that is able to look upon him without terror in his natural eſtate, and therefore it is not poſſible they can have any reſt ſo long as they continue enemies to God, and that certainly, is the ſtate of man by nature, the ſcripture is as cleere in this, as in any one point of divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we are al by nature enemies to God, and canſt thou be at quiet when thou art an enemy to God? think with thy ſelf, it may be, thou haſt ſlept quietly, lived mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and eat and drank with a great deale of peace, as you think; but this is your condition, that you are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an enemy to the infinit, eternal firſt-being of al things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You wil ſay, If we do not know it, we may have reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Juſt ſuch a reſt as a man that were aſleep upon the top of a maſt, true, he doth not know his danger when he is a ſleep, but yet, wil you ſay, that the man can have true reſt when he is there; ſo though men do not know what their natural condition is, and though their ſecurity have a kind of falſe reſt, but wil you cal that reſt? wil you ſay, ſuch a man is gone to his reſt, that is gone to ſleep upon the top of a maſt? ſuch a reſt haſt thou had al the dayes of thy life before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Every man by nature is guilty, is bound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the infinite juſtice of God, to anſwer for al that the Lord hath to charge him with, to anſwer it before the Lord, and to ſatisfie the ſtrict Law of Gods divine juſtice for al that the Lord hath to charge him with, and is this man in a condition to reſt? can this man have reſt, if he do but underſtand this? If a man be found guilty, and be bound over to the Seſſions or Aſſiſes, truly, that man wil have little reſt, til he have got himſelf free; for a ſoul to be bound over by the infinite, eternal God, to be bound over to eternal juſtice for whatever the Lord hath to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44661:113"/>
charge him withal, is this a condition to reſt in? this is the condition of al out of Chriſt, of a ſoul before it comes to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Not only is a man guilty before the Lord, but whatſoever there is in one to diſquiet him in the world, it is the condition of ſuch a one that is out of Chriſt. What wil diſquiet one? to be in debt, will not that diſquiet one? to be in danger of debt, to be arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſoone as he comes out of his doores, can ſuch a man ſleep quietly, or eate his meat quietly, and drink quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Let me tel you, that al the while you are out of Chriſt, you are in debt unto the infinite and eternal God, and bound to give ſatisfaction fot what the Lord hath to charge you withal, yea, and for ought you know, the next creature that you have to deal withal, may be as a Sergeant, ſent from the eternal God, to lay hold upon you, to arreſt you, and to caſt you into priſon, until you have paid the uttermoſt farthing. I remember I have read of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar, Plutarch</hi> reports of him, that he knowing of a Chief man in <hi>Rome,</hi> that was much in debt he ſent to buy the pillow that that man lay upon; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is much in that pillow, thought he, that a man in ſo much debt could reſt upon: only noting thus much, that it is a mighty trouble, and a reſtleſs condition that ſuch a one is in, that is in debt; if that be ſo, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, every man and woman out of Chriſt is in a reſtleſs condition, for they owe to God the debt of puniſhment, becauſe they have not paid to God the debt of obedience, and God muſt have his debt paid, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or in their ſurety, and thy ſurety is only in Chriſt, and Chriſt undertakes to pay for only thoſe that come to him, whom he hath invited to come to him, and if Chriſt do not undertake to pay the debt for you, you muſt pay it your ſelves, or be caſt into priſon; and that is the reaſon of the damned lying in hel for ever, becauſe they lye to pay the debt of obedience that they owe to God, and therefore the ſcripture cals our
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44661:114"/>
ſins, our debts, if you examine the ſeveral expreſſions of the evangeliſts, one ſaith treſpaſſes, the other debts, whereby it is apparent, that Chriſt did never intend to bind his people to uſe thoſe very words, but only ſhew a platforme and a patern of prayer, that we are to pray to that effect, this is an argument that no man can poſſibly anſwer, for one Evangeliſt hath the Lords prayer in one kind of words, and the other Evangeliſt hath the Lords prayer in other kind of words, one ſaith, forgive us our treſpaſſes, and the other ſaith, forgive us our debts; now it is true, they come to al one in effect, I but then ſay I from this, that it is not Chriſts intention to tye us punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to the words that he ſpake, but to make the prayer of Chriſt a patterne of prayer to us, ſo much for that point.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, for this condition, the reſtleſs condition that al men are in that are out of Chriſt, it is this they; are not only debtors and guilty, but every one out of Chriſt is condemned, not only bound over, a priſoner may be bound over, I but he may hope to eſcape when he comes to tryal, but this is certain, every man and woman out of Chriſt is a condemned creature, the ſentence is paſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon them. I wil give you a cleare ſcripture for it, in <hi>John,</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that beleeveth not in Chriſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already,</hi> not onely he ſhal be condemned at the great day of judgment, but he is now condemned, he is condemned already. I might give you divers other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit,</hi> this doth plainly imply, that then there is condemnation to them that are not in Chriſt, that do not walk after the ſpirit, but after the fleſh. Now can any man be at peace when he is a condemned creature? would you think, that a man that were condemned at your Aſſiſes, the Judg having paſt the ſentence of death upon him, if you ſhould come to ſuch a man and find him aſleep, would you not ſay, alas! can you reſt now?
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44661:114"/>
Do you think the night is a night of Reſt that is before the execution of a condemned man? Now let me ſay to you, that thoſe that are come to Chriſt, they know that their condition was ſo before they did come to him, this is a certain truth, that til you come in unto Jeſus Chriſt and be a beleever in him, you are under the ſentence of condemnation, he that beleeves not, is condemned, you that walk after the fleſh are under Condemnation.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, God forbid, we hope we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Now the 8. of the <hi>Rom.</hi> the firſt verſe, will ſhew you to your faces in what condition you are in, <hi>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt.</hi> Who are they that are in Chriſt and delivered from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? They are thoſe that walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit. Shall it be caſt upon this now? I do challenge every Soul to put it upon the tryal, to ſee whether they dare venture their Souls and eternal eſtate upon this Scripture, look to it, it is the word of God, it is that word of God that muſt ſtand for ever, when thou and I am fallen, There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit. Now then, thy eternal eſtate lies upon this, thy ſoul lies upon it, that if thou be a man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that doth walk after the fleſh, that is, look what pleaſure the fleſh deſires, what luſts of the fleſh are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to thee, thy Heart walks after them, thou liveſt accordingly, and it is thy great care to make proviſion for the fleſh, the care of thy life to make proviſion for the fleſh, and when thou haſt made proviſion for the fleſh, thou giveſt liberty to thy ſpirit to ſatisfie it ſelf in the luſts of the fleſh, thou art the man and woman that yet art not in Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore art certainly under condemnation; and is this a time to Reſt now in? Is there Reſt for ſuch a Soul that is in this condition? All thoſe therefore, whoſe conſciences tell them, that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they have walked after the fleſh and not after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not after thoſe truths that they find in the word;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44661:115"/>
perhaps they can go to the word, and ſay, it is true what the Miniſter ſaith, if we could do what he ſaith, and in the mean time caſt off the thoughts of thoſe truths that are according to the word, and caſt off what God ſpeaks in his word, for what he ſpeaks in his word ſhould be as real to thee, as if he ſpake it from Heaven, and therfore thou art out of Chriſt, and I ſpeak in the name of God of all theſe things, that I might the more effectually draw mens hearts to come unto Chriſt for Reſt. For I do not mean to leave you thus, to tel you, that you have no Reſt out of Chriſt, but I intend to tell you, how you may have Reſt in Chriſt. Only firſt I would convince you that out of Chirſt there is no Reſt for the Soul, and if you have had Reſt all this while out of Chriſt, it hath been a curſed, a vile, a wretched Reſt, it hath been no other but ſuch a Reſt as this, of a man that is condemned to die, Nay, Let me tel you all out of Chriſt are not condemned to die a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but an eternal Death.</p>
               <p>But you wil ſay, they have Reſt enough, it doth not trouble them. I anſwer, What Reſt? juſt as if a condemned man ſhal go to bed, and fal aſleep, and dream that he is at home in his Houſe, with his Wife and Children about him, at home with his friends, at his work, at his meat, and O poor man, how he rejoyceth that he is at home, and hath got his Wife and Children, and all is ſafe and wel, this man pleaſeth himſelf in his dream al this while, and at length (poor man) he awakes, and he ſees he is in the priſon, he ſees the ſhackles about his heels, and the watch at the door, and for ought he knows, he may die the next day. Certainly, this ſets forth as lively the condition of natural Men in the world as can be, they are al condemned, but they are in a dream, and they think they are out of al danger, al wil be ſafe, that there ſhal no miſery befal them; O but, when the Lord ſhal come to awake them out of this dream, they wil ſee themſelves in priſon, under the ſentence of condemnation, and then
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44661:115"/>
they wil wonder that they have been ſo quiet al this while.</p>
               <p>Sixthly: Yea, Let me ſay further, if thou beeſt out of Chriſt thou are not only under the ſentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but for ought thou knoweſt, every moment thou mayeſt be plunged into the Gulf of the wrath of the infinite God, it is true, God hath ſpared thee along time, God hath continued thy Life in his Patience, perhaps, twenty, forty, fifty years; well, but how doſt thou know, but that may fal out in one night, or day, or moment, that never fel out in al thy life, though thou haſt been ſpared a long time, yet thou knoweſt not but before morning, thou maieſt be among the damned in Hell, and is this a condition to reſt in? For a man and Woman to be in ſuch a condition, as when he comes to examine, how doth things ſtand between God and my Soul? How ſtand I to God? What reference have I to God? Or what reference hath God to me? How do I know but I may be ſwallowed up in the Gulf of the eternal wrath of the infinite God, and there lie under it for ever? What do I know to the contrary? And if this prove to be my portion, it had been better ten thouſand times I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been borne, and is this a condition to reſt in? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if God hath revealed any truth in his word, theſe are the truths of God. The condition of one out of Chriſt is like one that hath ſuffered Shipwrack, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he gets one of the Bords that are broken off from the ſhip, and is floating up and down the Sea upon it, and yet in ſuch danger, that every wave coming, he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be drowned, do you think it is poſſible for any one to ſleep there? Its true, You are not drowned yet, but you ſee your ſelves in danger by every wave that comes to be ſwallowed up, and to be ſunk to the bottom. It may be it hath been the caſe of ſome of you, that have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Shipwrack, that you have been dilivered in a boate, I beleeve when you have been there you could hardly ſleep quietly, if you ſhould neſtle down in your boate, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44661:116"/>
ſay, wel, here I wil take my reſt, would not every one think you a mad man? Juſt thus, for al the world, it is with men in their natural eſtate, they take up their reſt, whereas they know not but there wil come preſently ſome dreadful wave of the wrath of God, and ſwallow them up, and ſo they are undone for ever, certainly, there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God, if this be ſo.</p>
               <p>There are divers other particulars that might ſet forth for the opening of the condition of al men that are out of Jeſus Chriſt, no reſt can come to them, and al to make Jeſus Chriſt precious to you, that you might ſeek the happy condition that is to be had in Chriſt. Oh! that any thing that hath been ſpoken might be ſettled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hearts, that you might go with that poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner, that you read of in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles Chap. 16.30. and ſay, <hi>Men and bretheren, what ſhal we do to be ſaved?</hi> The Lord hath ſhewn me my reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs condition, I ſee the reſt I have had, hath been a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs condition. And Oh that it might make you but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after Chriſt, but to put your ſouls into an inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition after Jeſus Chriſt, that you may hearken unto what ſhal be delivered unto you about the bleſſed reſt that Chriſt doth here promiſe in this invitation, when he ſaith, <hi>Come unto me, You that are laden, and I wil give you reſt,</hi> be not afraid to apply your ſelves to thoſe things that have been delivered, whenas theſe things are ſpoken out of ſuch a text as doth ſufficiently hold forth to you the true reſt that is in Chriſt, for this promiſe of reſt, it is made to them that do labor &amp; are heavy lade. Now if theſe truths of God that have been delivered to you, do ly as a load upon your ſpirits, if you go away with your hearts burdened with it, be not diſcouraged, for you that are burdened with ſuch truths as theſe are, come to Chriſt and he wil deliver you from this burden, and you ſhal have in this that quiet that ſhal remain everlaſtingly; al the quiet that you can have with putting off theſe truths
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44661:116"/>
that have been delivered cannot hold long, but there is a ſtorm a coming, that wil try every man and womans qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, of what nature it is; whether true quiet, or falſe; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true reſt, or falſe; do not therefore caſt off what hath been delivered, but apply it to your ſouls, that ſo you may be the more prepared to heare further of the bleſſed reſt that Chriſt doth here promiſe unto you.</p>

The ſaints of God, they have Gods covenant, and Gods promiſe, other men have nothing but Gods patience to keep them. A mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor in priſon is not executed many times, Why?

woful diſperate hardneſs of Heart, for where almoſt is the Man and Woman that is convinced of this Reſtleſs condition? That ever were in this Reſtleſs condition? This I dare undertake to aver, concerning every one, that you were once in ſuch a condition as I have now ſpake of, how you have got out of it, that you muſt look to, and what argument you have that you can be able to reſt your Souls upon for your deliverance out of this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do you examine, but this condition every one is in naturally; <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacab,</hi> was in this condition once, and therefore every one muſt look unto it now while this Reſt is opening unto you, and here indeed is the Reaſon of the tumultuouſneſs of ſpirit that is in moſt people. What is the Reaſon that people hurry up and down in ſeeking after the things of this world? That they are in a Reſtleſs condition? Their Souls have not union with God in Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore they are hurried up and down here in this world to ſeek after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort this way, and that way: but the truth is, as with the unclean ſpirit in the Goſpel, they ſeek for Reſt but find none: as I tould you before, the Dove ſought up and down for Reſt, but ſhe found none, til ſhe came to the Arke; and ſo the Reaſon of the diſturbance of the Spirits of Men and Women, is from hence, that they are not acquainted with the true Reſt that there is in Chriſt, but we let this paſs.</p>
               <p>Only one thing more in this point, before we ſhal come unto the next, and that is, to ſhew the inſufficiency that there is in al things in the world to give Reſt unto the Soul til we come to Chriſt: Al men out of Chriſt are in a Reſtleſs condition: There is an inſufficiency in al things in the world to give Reſt til we come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And for that I ſhall give two or three Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Firſt, Becauſe the Reſt of an immortal Soul muſt needs be in the reference it hath to God; Now al the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44661:118"/>
Tranſactions between God and us, are only in the hand of Chriſt, it is not committed unto any creature, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſact any thing between God and us for any good, but through Chriſt; now then, if al our Reſt muſt needs be in our reference unto God, and al the Tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us muſt be in the hand of Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, then certainly, there is an inſufficiency in al things in the world to give Reſt unto our ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly, There is an inſufficiency in all things in the world to give Reſt unto the Soul, becauſe the miſery that we are in is ſo deep, and the happineſs that our Souls are capable of is ſo high, that it is impoſſible that any creature can reach the one or the other, either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from the one, or to raiſe up unto the other, only Jeſus Chriſt in whom we have Reſt can do it, becauſe that there was never any thing that came to that depth of humiliation, nor hath that height of Glory (put both together) Chriſt hath ſubjected himſelf to the loweſt degree of humiliation that ever creature could ſubject it ſelf unto, and Chriſt is in the higheſt degree of Glory that it is poſſible for any creature to be in, above al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: his ſubjection unto ſorrow and trouble was ſuch as no creature can ſubject unto, and his glory is higher than any creature is capable of, therefore he, and only he, is able to deliver from the depth of miſery in which the Children of men are, and raiſe them to the true happineſs and Glory that their Natures are capable of.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thirdly, There is an inſufficiency in all creatures to give Reſt unto the Soul, becauſe all ceatures here in this world that we have to do withal, except the Angels in Heaven, are under the curſe, and the Angels are only miniſtring ſpirits to attend upon Chriſt, and to be ſent upon Chriſts errand, they do nothing but in order to Chriſt; now all other creatures are under the curſe, and being under the curſe through mans ſin, it is impoſſible
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:44661:119"/>
that thoſe creatures that are under the curſe ſhould give Reſt unto our Souls, and I do not know any argument in the world of greater ſtrength to take off the Hearts of men from reſting in creature comforts than this, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand cleerly, that al creatures here in this world, are under the curſe through our ſins, the whole world that is under the curſe by our ſins cannot make us happy, and therefore there is an inſufficiency in al things in the world to give Reſt unto our Souls. Do but conſider then what are the things that moſt people Reſt in Particularly, and then we ſhal ſee the vanity of men in ſeeking for Reſt out of Chriſt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The inſufficiency of every thing beſides Chriſt to give Reſt to the Soul is further enlarged, with ſeveral Choice Conſiderations,</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIrſt, There are ſome that are ſo vile, as the cheifeſt Reſt and comfort of their Souls is in the pleaſure of ſin, in the delight that they do take in ſatisfying of their ſinful luſts, that is the comfort and Reſt of their Souls, if they be troubled at home, Wife, Children, or Servants do but trouble them, what do they do to eaſe themſelves, they go abroad among company, and there drink, and play, and ſwear, and perhaps be unclean. And others, when they are croſſed, how do they eaſe themſelves by venting their paſſion, and the truth is, it is a moſt holy truth I am ſpeaking of, Oh! That ever it ſhould enter into the Heart of a creature, to make it to be the greateſt quiet, eaſe, and Reſt of his Soul, to ſatisfie himſelf in ſinning againſt the bleſſed God, and yet, I appeal unto you, do not your conſciences tel you, ſome of you, that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44661:119"/>
this is your condition? And do you not know Men, that the greateſt comfort, eaſe, quiet and Reſt of heart that they have in this world, is in the ſatisfying of their ſinful luſts? How far is this from ſeeking out Reſt in Chriſt, in the Son of God, in the great Mediator of the Covenant; yet this is the condition of moſt people, take away the ſatisfaction of their Souls in their ſinful luſts, and they have nothing to quiet their Hearts with, but when they are there, now they are ſafe, now they are quiet. Do but conſider of this one thing that now I am ſpeaking of, That to have Reſt, and quiet, in any way of ſin, it is no other, but juſt as if a man had a burning Feaver, and he cals for a pot of Water, gets it to his mouth, and drinks it up every drop; now in the very time he is pouring this down his Throat, he hath ſome Reſt, ſome eaſe, he finds ſome eaſe from the fit of the feaver while he is drinking down the pot of Water; but do you think this wil be Reſt to him? Do but ſtay a quarter of an hour, or may be an hour or two, then you wil find him in his ſcalding burning fit, then he burnes ten times more than he did before, and it is like to coſt him his life, but he finds trouble and diſquiet, and that gives him eaſe, and therefore he drinks it down and this indangers his Life afterwards. So it is with men, that ſeek after eaſe and Reſt unto their Souls in any way of ſin, thy pleaſure in thy ſinful waies, take all the pleaſure of thy Life from thy youth to the day of thy death, and put it altogether, yet in reſpect of eternity, it is but juſt like the eaſe that a poor man in a Feaver hath, while the water is going down his Throat, all thy pleaſure is no more, and thou art like to be ſcalding and burning in Gods wrath to al eternity for that one draught of thine, for the eaſe and Reſt that thou hadſt in the way of ſin; I am ſure when Chriſt had the burden of our ſins upon him, he found it no Reſt, and therefore it cannot be eaſe to thy Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are others, though not ſo vile, yet they Reſt not in the act of ſin, but in the creature, if they
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44661:120"/>
can have good trading, quick voyages, and have as their neighbors have, then they are ready as the rich man in the Goſpel to ſay, <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, eat and drink, for thou haſt goods laid up for many yeares</hi>; and this is the reſt that moſt people in the world do ſeek after; they think, that if they might have as ſuch and ſuch have, then they had reſt enough, but be it knowne unto you, that this is an argument that thou doeſt not underſtand nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor the things of God, if thou thinkeſt that al the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world, yea, if God ſhould give thee the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of al the creatures in heaven and earth, if thou ſhouldeſt think that they would give thee reſt, I ſay, thou doſt not ſavour at al the things of God; but thoſe that underſtand what God is, yea, thoſe that have but one ſparke of true ſaving grace, this ſpark of grace doth ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the ſoul, that al the creatures in heaven and earth cannot give reſt, cannot give quiet, but ſtil it hath a higher good to ſeek after than al the creatures in al the world. There is a notable text of Scripture which we have in the book of <hi>Job,</hi> in the 26. of <hi>Job,</hi> and 7. verſe <hi>He Stretcheth forth the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</hi> Wilt thou ſeek thy reſt in that which hangs upon nothing? the whole earth hath nothing to reſt upon, and therefore nothing in the earth can be reſt unto thy ſoul. In <hi>Micah</hi> 2.10. as it is ſaid there in that place, ſo I may ſay of creatures, <hi>Ariſe ye and depart, for here is not your reſt.</hi> The whole world is as a wheel, in a continual motion, and therefore in <hi>James</hi> 3.6. Where the text ſpeakes of the courſe of nature, or the wheel of nature, the whole world is as a wheel running up and down, and therefore there can be no reſt in the enjoyment of the creature.</p>
               <p>Wel, but there are ſome yet would fain have reſt there, having got good eſtates, ſome of you have got good voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and God hath proſpered you in your young dayes, and having got great eſtates, now you would have reſt, that is, to live idlely, and to live uſeleſly, and to keep at
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44661:120"/>
home, and let al things go which way they wil, it is good to be quiet in ones old dayes, when God hath delivered you from many dangers at ſea, now you think the only way is to live quietly at home, and to meddle with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and this is the reſt of your ſouls, this is the reſt that many men have after their yonger time is paſt, and how then to live and do nothing, this is their reſt, now: Oh! that God would but ſpeak to the hearts of theſe men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do but conſider this, That by living thus idlely and unuſefully thou comeſt to have al thy parts and thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to corrupt; juſt as a ſtanding water, as waters in a pond do corrupt, and putrifie by their ſtanding, ſo men that live uſeleſly and are not active for God, and for the publique good, according to the opportunities that God puts into their hands, their hearts do putrifie and grow corrupt, there is a corruption that comes upon al their parts, the beauty, the excellency, the quickneſs, the livelineſs of their parts are taken away, and they begin to putrifie more and more, becauſe they are not imployed for God, what ever we have that we imploy not for God, and are not active in for God, it putrifies, and however many men think it a great happineſs, becauſe they have eſtates, and they may live and do nothing, there is not a greater miſery to a gracious heart, than to be uſeleſs for God, and for God to lay them aſide as ſuch as are uſeleſs, not to uſe them in his ſervice, it is the greateſt affliction to a Godly heart in the world; if God ſhould take away their eſtates, it would not be ſuch a great affliction, as to lay them aſide and do nothing for God, and therefore let no man think, becauſe he hath got a great eſtate, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may ly ſtil, &amp; do nothing, Oh! what wil this man do when he ſhal be called to account for al his time, for al his opportunity for al his eſtate? certainly this wil not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that he can ſay, he did no hurt, no, but thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have been active for God, God is active for thee in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy ſoul, al the Atributes of God is working for thee,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44661:121"/>
and al the paſſages of his providence is working for thee if thou be ſaved, and therefore this is a wretched conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for men to think no higher reſt but meerly freedome from outward trouble, and if there be any whoſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tels them, this is the truth, this is my condition, and God ſpeakes to my heart this day, this is the reſt that I have ſought after, know, that thou art not acquainted with the wayes of God, for certainly the reſt of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul is a high thing, Jeſus Chriſt came into the world from the boſom of his father, and laid down his life to purchaſe reſt for the ſoul, and doſt thou think that Chriſt did this only to purchaſe this, that thou mayeſt be freed from ſome outward trouble in this world? and that we might ſit in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now for that, though this be better than al the other, yet a man and woman may miſtake in this, thou truſteſt in Gods mercy for reſt to thy ſoul, what hath God revealed to thy ſoul concerning the mediator of the covenant? this may ſeem difficult to ſome, and that is this, that al the mercy of God in heaven cannot be ſufficient for the reſt of any ſoul, but through a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator in Chriſt; the ſoul muſt be brought to this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by the hand of Chriſt the mediator; thou muſt firſt come to Chriſt the mediator, before thou canſt have any reſt, even in the mercy of God it ſelf. You muſt know, and if you know any thing of the miſtery of the Goſpel you muſt know this, that though God be an infinite cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of mercy, yet al the current of Gods mercy is ſtopt by mans ſin, ſo as it can only be opened by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore thou muſt know God in Chriſt, and you muſt know how you come unto God
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44661:121"/>
in and through Chriſt, before you can reſt upon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, this is that which doth undo many ſoules, thoſe that are of the better ſort, they think to rely upon Gods mercy, think to reſt in that, and that is a ſure reſt to their ſoules, but they little underſtand how al the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the mercy of God is ſtopt, and there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it but by the hand of a mediator between God and man.</p>
               <p>Others they wil ſay, they do many good things, they do many good actions, they ſerve God, and they reſt in this, they do not commit the groſs ſins of the world, and they do performe duties, they pray in their families, and in their cloſets, &amp; this is that they reſt in, but the reſt of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul muſt have a better foundation than this, than al the duties, than al the ſorrows for their ſins, than al that God himſelf works in them, it muſt be ſomewhat without them, that muſt be reſt to their ſouls, and nothing wrought in us, no not the grace of God in us can be reſt to our ſouls, it muſt be the perfect righteouſneſs of a mediator, though it be wrought in us by faith can be reſt to our ſouls, yet nothing in us: So that you may miſtake and performe duties in a formal manner, but ſuppoſe you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them in a gracious manner, yet you muſt not reſt in them, you muſt go higher than al the beſt duties that ever you performed. Wo to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> if they had no other reſt but what their duties brought them, you muſt look higher than whatever you are, or can be inabled to do for your reſt.</p>
               <p>You wil ſay, what is there that can be higher than what we are inabled to do by God? There is a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Jeſus Chriſt by which you muſt come, there is an inſufficiency in al the creatures in the world to give reſt, and yet the truth is, the greateſt part of the world make al their reſt in theſe things: much might be ſpoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the danger of this, and much of the ſignes when our ſoules have true reſt in Chriſt, but we ſhal meet with
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44661:122"/>
that in the other point, in handling the Reſt that we have in Chriſt, I wil therefore paſs over this, about the inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the Reſt in al other things, only with this one thing. Know this, That that Heart that is touched with Jeſus Chriſt, as the Iron is with the Load-ſtone, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quiet either in creature comforts, or in hope of mercy, or in any Duty or performance, it can never be quiet til it gets union with Jeſus Chriſt. Juſt as it is with a Needle that is touched with a Load-Stone, ſhake it which way you wil, it wil never be at Reſt til it come to the North, and when it gets North, then it ſtands there: ſo it is with a heart that is touched with Jeſus Chriſt, there is the touch of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart of a beleever, and when the Heart is but touched with Jeſus Chriſt, it ſhakes, is ful of fears and doubts, and offer it this creature comfort, and the other creature comfort, it wil not do it, the Heart is not at reſt. But now, when there is the manifeſtation of Chriſt unto the Soul, let them come to a Sermon where ſome bleſſed promiſe to the Goſpel is opened to them, and Jeſus Chriſt preſented to them, and they find this to be the Reſt of their Souls, their Hearts come preſently and cloſe with this, and they are able to lay the weight of their eternities upon the promiſe of the Goſpel, upon the free Grace of God in Chriſt, they are able to lay the weight of their eternal eſtates here; however others think, that the promiſe of the Goſpel is but a noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet here they are able to lay the weight of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtates, and they can ſay with <hi>Simeon, Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in peace for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi> Here I ſee Reſt for my Soul, my Heart was ful of Terrors, fears and doubts, and I ſought for Reſt and eaſe in this, and the other creature comfort, and could not find it. But now Chriſt is made known to me, and here is the Reſt of my Soul. It is true, Godly people may be troubled for a while, but it is as the trouble of the ſhaking of a Needle in the compaſs,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44661:122"/>
and other men they are troubled too, there are ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple troubled in conſcience for their ſins, they come to a Sermon, and hear the evil of ſin opened, and God meets with their Particular ſin, ſome ſecret ſin that they live in, they are troubled, and they ſhake too, I but they are like a falſ Needle not rightly touched, that ſhakes as the other doth, but it wil ſtand at any point, do but put it this way or that way, and it wil ſtand here and there: would marriners give any thing for ſuch a Needle, that would ſtand at this point and the other point? So it is with wicked men when they are troubled, the Devil, the world, and their corruptions come and quiet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences out of Chriſt, and ſo indeed this hinders them from coming to Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they find quiet ſome where elſe. The Saints they are troubled, but their trouble and ſhaking in the world is like the trouble of a ſhip that is in the Haven at ſhore, that lies at Anchor; a ſhip that lies at Anchor, though the waves toſs it up and down, yet it is toſt up and down at Anchor: So here is the difference for al the world, between al the troubles of the Saints, and the trouble of ungodly men. Now when you have a ſhip at Sea, and have no Anchor, and the ſtorm drives it any way, when there comes a mighty Tempeſt and hurries it up and down, and you do not know but you may light upon a Rock, and be ſplit, you are troubled; But the Saints they are at Anchor, and you count your ſelves at Reſt though you are toſt by the Waves, when you are at Anchor.</p>

                  <p>Of the Reſt that a Beleever hath by Chriſt from the Guilt of Sin, laid out in ten Particulars. <hi>1.</hi> Chriſt takes upon himſelf al the ſin of them that come to him, and ſtands charged with them before his Father. <hi>2.</hi> He Satisfieth for Sin. <hi>3.</hi> The wrath of God is appeaſed. <hi>4.</hi> He is continually at the right hand of his Father to intercede for Sinners that come to him. <hi>5.</hi> Their Souls are ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt. <hi>6.</hi> The Soul at the firſt coming to Chriſt, is made perfectly righteous before God. <hi>7.</hi> Chriſt not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for all the Sins paſt, but alſo for Sins to come. <hi>8.</hi> Guilt ſhall never return, when it is once taken off. <hi>9.</hi> The Soul at its firſt coming to Chriſt is cloathed with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. <hi>10.</hi> Such are ſure that the day of judgment ſhal be the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their abſolution.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw we are but beginning the great point of all, the Reſt of the Soul in Chriſt what it is, and in this I ſhal take the Method that I followed in the opening of the Burdens of Laden Sinners, that were heavy Laden. I ſpake of five loades that were upon ſinners that Chriſt cals to him, that they might come to him for Reſt; now anſwerable to thoſe five ſhal we ſpeak of the Reſt that is to be had in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt Load was the ſence of the guilt of ſin, that was the firſt Load that was upon ſinners that Chriſt cals to come unto him that they might have Reſt.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the Reſt that the ſoul hath by Chriſt in the deliverance of it from the woful trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in reſpect of the guilt of ſin, I ſhal not ſhew here
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:44661:123"/>
what thoſe troubles are, for that was done in the former point, about thoſe that were weary and heavy Laden. Now if there be any that find their ſouls Laden under the burden of the guilt of their ſins, and that apprehend nothing but the wrath of God that is following and purſuing of them, that if you ſhould ſpeak to them and ſay, Chriſtian, what ſee you? Oh, I ſee an angry God above, and I ſee within me a guilty conſcience, and round about me I ſee nothing but the wrath of God ready to ſeize upon me, and underneath I ſee nothing but the bottomleſs Gulf ready to receive me; now to ſuch Chriſt ſaith, Come unto me, and I will give you eaſe and Reſt from al theſe fears, from al theſe troubles, and I will give you eaſe from all thoſe throws of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, from al thoſe grievous achings of your Soul, <hi>Come to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, What eaſe is it to a beleever, to be freed from the throbs of Conſcience, and the trouble of Heart that ariſeth from the guilt of ſin? Now this will be the firſt thing, this wil be eaſe to every beleever that comes to Chriſt, to conſider.</p>
               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt takes all the ſins of thoſe that come to him, and is willing to ſtand char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with them before the Lord, is willing that they ſhould al be ſet upon his Score, and laid to his charge; and therefore the Scripture tels us, that Chriſt was made ſin, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be Sin for us.</hi> Upon which <hi>Luther</hi> takes the boldneſs to ſay, that Chriſt was the greateſt ſinner in the world, not that he had ſin that he committed himſelf, but that he had all the ſins of all beleevers upon him, there is a tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the ſins of thoſe that come to Chriſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, and this is preſently upon thy coming to Chriſt, I ſay at the firſt inſtant of thy coming to Chriſt, al thy
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:44661:124"/>
ſins are tranſacted upon Chriſt, and he ſtands charged with them to God. As it is with a poor Woman, that is in great debt, that is afraid of Sergeants attending upon her, ſhe is a widow, and ſhe marries a Rich man, Oh! What eaſe hath ſhe, Why? For now all her debt is charged upon her Husband; Yet this may cauſe trouble too, if he do not know it before, but if ſhe tel him before, and he ſaies, well, this ſhal not hinder the match, I am content to pay all; but yet here is trouble ſtil, til the day of marriage, but when that is come, Oh! What eaſe is this to her! Now al the debt is charged upon her Husband, and ſhe knows her Husband is able to pay and diſcharge all. So ſaith Chriſt, I know all your fears, and ſorrows, and all your guilt, and what it is my father hath to charge upon you, I know it al, and it is not that that hinders me from being willing to be matched with you, Nay, the truth is, it is that that makes me willing, and it is that that makes me cal you, Come to me, Come to me, and the firſt moment you come to me, there ſhal be a diſcharge of al; you ſhal not ſtand charged, but I will ſtand charged with all. Here now is eaſe and Reſt, here is other manner of eaſe and Reſt, than to Eate and Drink, and injoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and contentment that this world affords.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>Yea, Secondly, Chriſt is Reſt from the guilt of Sin, by actual Satisfaction, the Lord Chriſt doth ſatisfie the juſtice of his Father, and this is applied to every belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at the firſt moment that he comes to Chriſt, there is a ful ſatisfaction made, ſo that a beleever now hath made ſatisfaction. When we come to Chriſt, our ſins are not ſo pardoned, as if God had no Satisfaction, but the Lord though he pardons us, and it is free Grace to us, yet notwithſtanding our ſurety gives ſatisfaction, the Lord Chriſt tenders up his Blood and merit unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:44661:124"/>
as a ful ſatisfaction for all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> debts, for al our ſins, the truth is, he hath paid it already, and upon your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him it is accounted yours, for Jeſus Chriſt hath ſatisfied the juſtice of God the Father, that thy Soul doth ſo much fear. What doſt thou fear in regard of thy ſins? Oh! My ſins make me liable to the juſtice of God; ſaith Chriſt, I have given ſatisfaction unto the juſtice of my Father to the very ful, and it was for thy ſins in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, Oh! The Reſt and eaſe that comes to the Soul by this, when the Soul can ſee, that all his ſins are done away, if we had but ſtrong Faith upon our firſt coming to Jeſus Chriſt, we might actually ſee all our ſins char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Upon this the wrath of God is come now to be appeaſed and ſatisfied, the Lord did look with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry countenance upon thee before, but now upon thy coming to Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord imbraceth thy Soul, and wellcomes thee, and looks upon thee as a friend, as a Child, and this doth eaſe the Soul from the trouble it hath by the guilt of ſin.</p>

                  <head>IV.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, Beſides all this, Chriſt taking our ſins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, ſatisfying divine juſtice and divine wrath, Jeſus Chriſt is continually at the right hand of the Father to be thy advocate, that if the Devil or any ſhal accuſe thee for any thing thou haſt done before, Nay in caſe thou feareſt any of thy ſins ſhould come up in the preſence of of God to accuſe thee, Jeſus Chriſt ſtands at the right hand of his Father to be thine advocate, what is the office of an advocate? But if there be any accuſation brought againſt ſuch a man, the advocate ſtands to anſwer to the accuſation; Jeſus Chriſt, he ſtands at the right hand of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44661:125"/>
his father thus to do. In <hi>John,</hi> 2. and the firſt verſe, <hi>My little Children, theſe things I write unto you, that ye ſin not, and if any man ſin we have an advocate with the father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> A comfort it is to have one ſtand to plead at the right hand of the father, to be thine advocate, Chriſt is as real an advocate at the right hand of God for al beleevers, as ever any had any advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in this world. I find often in ſcripture this, if you read in the 4. chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> you ſhal find there, that the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes of a reſt of God, the reſt of the ſaints of God, Gods people; and mark what is the firſt incouragment he gives, and what ground he makes of the reſt they have; in two or three places he ſpeakes of the reſt of Gods people, now the foundation of it is, <hi>For we have not an high Prieſt that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but was in al things tempted like as we are, yet without ſin, let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need,</hi> for we have a high Prieſt, that is the ground of the reſt of the ſaints of God.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="part">
                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>Fifthly, Come to me, ſaith Chriſt, and I wil give you reſt from al the trouble that you have by the guilt of ſin; thus, I wil ſprinkle your conſciences by my blood, that you ſhal be able to give an anſwer to al temptations that can come to you, not onely, I wil ſtand before my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but you ſhal have your conſciences ſprinkled with my blood, that you ſhal be able to give an anſwer to what accuſation ſhal be made by Satan, to diſturb your reſt, to diſquiet your ſoules.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a pure heart in ful aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water.</hi> Having your hearts ſprinkled from an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44661:125"/>
whereas before you came to me, you had an evil conſcience, that was ready to fly in your face, and that did fear you, vex you, and trouble you, I appeale unto you that underſtand what God is, and what it is for the creature to have to do with God, have not your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences kept you from ſleeping a nights, an evil conſcience that hath layen grating within you, you have layen upon your beds and could not ſleep, when your wife was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep by you; now to ſuch is this ſaid, Let us draw neer upon this ground, here is the ground, Let us draw neer with a pure heart in ful aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, that is, the blood of Chriſt comes now to be ſprinkled upon our ſoules and conſciences, and that is it that takes away the worme of our conſcience, perhaps other things may trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſcience for a while, but now the blood of Chriſt can waſh you from that, now when you come to Chriſt, the conſcience comes then to be able to anſwer what ſhal be laid to its Charge. Perhaps thoſe who are beleevers and are come to Chriſt, the devil wil be ready to object and labor to diſturb them, uſually after they firſt come to Chriſt, there is as great a diſturbance in the heart of a ſinner as before. But mark that text you have in the firſt of <hi>Peter</hi> the 3. and the 21. <hi>The like figure whereunto even baptiſme doth alſo now ſave us, not the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Through Chriſts Reſurrection a beleever comes to have a good conſcience, having been ſprinkled by his blood before &amp; through this reſurection he is able to anſwer the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that is whatſoever accuſation the Devil ſhal lay againſt the ſoul, the ſoul that is ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt is able to anſwer it, and this is the comfort that ſuch have, that we find our conſcience ſatisfied in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, perhaps at the firſt coming thou
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44661:126"/>
doeſt not feel it, but at the firſt coming thou beginneſt to be able to do it.</p>

                  <head>VI.</head>
                  <p>Sixthly, the reſt that is to be had againſt the trouble of the guilt of ſin is this, That upon the firſt coming of the ſoul to Chriſt, it is made as perfectly juſt before God, as ever <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as al the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs; thou comeſt off as cleerly from the guilt of thy ſin, as ever <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did: Its true, thou haſt not at thy firſt coming to Chriſt thy ſanctification made perfect, but this I dare avouch, that at thy firſt coming to Jeſus Chriſt thou haſt thy Juſtification made as perfect, as ever the Juſtification of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> was, and what a mighty eaſe and reſt is this? what! I a vile crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo defiled, I that have had ſuch a dreadfulneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirit, now to be able to ſee my ſelf ſtand as clear before the Throne of God, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> did, and as the Apoſtles and Prophets did, Oh! this is a comfort! We ought to labor to come to be equal with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in ſanctification, as we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with them in Juſtification, this is the eaſe that the ſoul finds that comes to Chriſt.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="part">
                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <p>Seventhly, The reſt that is to be had in Chriſt in point of Juſtification, in freedome from the trouble that ariſeth from the guilt of ſin, it is, that Chriſt undertakes not only for that thou haſt done, but for whatever thou ſhalt commit al thy life, O! that none but thoſe that are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers might heare me, did I ſay ſo. But this is a certain truth.</p>
                  <p>You wil ſay, though I by coming to him might ſtand Juſtified before my father, yet I am a poor creature, I ſhal ſin again and again, and bring guilt upon my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44661:126"/>
Yet come to Chriſt, here is free Grace in Chriſt, and know, that Chriſt laies in pardon for thee againſt whatſoever guilt thou ſhalt again contract unto thy Soul. <hi>There is mercy with thee that thou maieſt be feared, with thee there is forgiveneſs:</hi> Chriſt laies in for the Guilt of ſin, that thou ſhalt afterwards contract to thy Soul, ſo as thou ſhalt never be condemned. Perhaps thou ſhalt deſerve condemnation a hundred times, over and over again, but Chriſt will take care that thou ſhalt never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into condemnation, thou ſhalt never be in the ſtate of Condemnation, Oh the Reſt that here is.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="8" type="part">
                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <p>Eightly, When the Soul comes to Chriſt, there is no returne of any guilt, if Chriſt doth undertake for them that come to him, though Chriſt doth undertake for what is paſt, and what is to come, yet as it is with a malefactor though perhaps he hath his pardon and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Favor, yet he may think there is ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again, but now the guilt that was upon thee ſhall never return upon thee again. Though a man hath a pardon, if he do not carry himſelf wel, the former Guilt returnes again; but when once the Soul is pardoned, the former Guilt never returnes again, the Lord wil blot out all their ſinnes, and remember them no more. As when you caſt a thing out of your Ship into the bottom of the Sea, you never look for it again, ſo it is with God, all your ſins ſhall be caſt into the bottom of the Sea, and ſhal be ſo far from you, as the Guilt of them ſhall never come more to you when once you are come to Chriſt.</p>

               <div n="9" type="part">
                  <head>IX.</head>
                  <p>Ninthly, There is not only deliverance from guiltineſs, our juſtification is not only privative, but it is a clothing of the Soul with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, we have a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44661:127"/>
perfect Righteouſneſs, that is the great Mediator of the new covenant, here is a righteouſneſs that I am not only pardoned, but I have a perfect Righteouſneſs to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great God withal.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="part">
                  <head>X.</head>
                  <p>Yea, Tenthly, and Laſtly, The Reſt we have in Chriſt is this, that we are ſure upon our coming to him, that the great work of the day of judgment ſhal be the ſolemnity of our abſolution, the ſolemnity of thy pardon. One of the great works that God intends to do at the great day of judgment, it is certainly this, to make thy pardon to be ſolemnized by men and Angels, thou haſt now thy pardon, but the great work of God at that day ſhall be the ſolemnity of the abſolution and pardon of the Saints, then ſhal their ſins be put away anew, as the Scripture ſpeakes, and in the time of refreſhment then ſhal your ſins be done away, they are done away before, but then they ſhall be done away before men and Angels, thou ſhalt not fear at the day of Judgment, that God ſhal come and upbraid thee with thy ſins, al the while thou wenteſt under the guilt of ſin, what was more terrible to thy Soul than the thoughts of the day of Judgment, Oh how can I ſtand before the Holy God at the great day, and have all theſe ſins charged upon me? No, come to me ſaith Chriſt, and you ſhal never need to fear that great day of judgment any more, for the great work of that day ſhal be, to make your pardon to be ſolemnized, ſo that you need not to fear any longer the day of Judgment, but to long for that day, and if the great day of judgment be not terrible, yet the Particular day of Judgment may be terrible, the Lord hath a Particular day of Judgment for every Soul, in which God doth caſt every man one way or other, but then there ſhal be a great day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein all the world ſhal ſolemnly be judged. Now then lay al theſe together, Chriſt undertakes,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44661:127"/>
Chriſt ſatisfies the juſtice of his Father, Chriſt ſatisfies the wrath of his Father, Chriſt is an advocate at the Right hand of his Father Chriſt ſprinkles thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with his own blood, and thou ſtandeſt as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the point of juſtification as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Guilt of thy ſins ſhal never return again. And Chriſt undertakes for thee, that thou ſhalt not come into Condemnation. And thou haſt a perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, beſides thy freedom from Death, Chriſt clothes thee with his righteouſneſs, and ſo God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looks upon thee, and Chriſt doth aſſure thee, that the great work of the day of judgment ſhal be to ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize thy pardon. Thus ſaith Chriſt, come to me, all you that lie under the ſence of the Guilt of your ſins, come to me, and you ſhall have reſt, here I make all this good to you, and all this reſt is in thy coming to Jeſus Chriſt, all the reſt in the world is worth nothing to this, O therefore let us be willing to indure any trouble, it is no great matter what trouble we indure in this World, ſo we may come to Chriſt, and this is but one branch, this is but the eaſing of the Soul from the firſt Burden, and yet even this to the Soul of a beleever will God make good, if God give thee but a heart to make al theſe things real to thy Soul thou maieſt depart in peace and go away, and bleſs God, and even ſay with the Pſalmiſt, in <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 116. <hi>And now my Soul return unto thy Reſt,</hi> The words are in the original <hi>Reſts,</hi> and now my Soul return unto thy reſts. Oh, here are reſts, ten ſeveral reſts for a Laden Soul that is under the guilt of ſin, do not think it much, that we that are the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould ſpeak to you about the Reſtleſs cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>on that you are in by reaſon of ſin, be willing that we ſhould trouble you in a ſinful way, being we have ſo much reſt to bring you to. Do not think the Miniſter troubles you, do not complain of the word that troubles mens conſciences. I appeal to you, if there be any thing in Gods word to trouble mens Souls, is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44661:128"/>
there not again as much in Gods word to eaſe mens Souls, and give Reſt unto them? Now this is Gods reſt that is purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, our deſire is, that you might not cry Peace Peace unto your Souls, when there is no peace, and now when you hear but the beginning of the excellency that there is for the Soul in Chriſt. Now you ſhould even upon this cry to God, Lord, O that I might be partaker of this reſt, and ſtill to deſire to hear further and further of this bleſſed Reſt, that is to be had in Jeſus Chriſt. And thus much for the Reſt that is to be had in Jeſus Chriſt from the Burden of the guilt of ſin.</p>

                  <p>The deliverance from the Law by Chriſt ſet out. <hi>1.</hi> Privatively in five Particulars. <hi>2.</hi> Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in five Points more.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe next burden that was upon Laden ſinners that Chriſt cals unto him, it was the burden of the Law, you that are under the burden of the Law, come to me, and I wil give you Reſt. I ſhewed in many Particulars, wherein the burden of the Law conſiſted, when I opened the former Point of the Load of ſinners, but now I am to come to ſhew, how Chriſt doth deliver ſinners from the burden of the law, for ſo certainly he doth, we are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the Law by Chriſt, this is a great Point, and the right underſtanding of this will help us exceeding much in the underſtanding of many truths in religion. Wherefore, firſt, I ſhall ſhew you, how far Chriſt hath not delivered us from the Law, that is, where it is, where it is not burdenſom, Chriſt hath not delivered us from
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:44661:128"/>
that, but only from the Law ſo far as it is a Burden. Now you will ſay, in what reſpect may the Law be ſaid to be a Burden? Certainly in thoſe reſpects Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to give us Reſt, in what reſpect the Law is good and not burdenſome to the Saints. The Law cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is good as the Apoſtle ſaith, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Even at that time when his Soul was mightily troubled with his Corruption, and he even cried out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Sin</hi>? As it is in the latter end of the Chapter. But yet in the 12. verſe, He profeſſeth, that, <hi>The Law is holy, and the Commandement Holy, and Juſt, and good.</hi> Now then that that is Holy, and Juſt, and Good, certainly Chriſt did never come to deliver us from that, to redeem us from that, it can never be ſaid to be a burden to thoſe that are holy; that that is Holy, and Juſt, and good, cannot be a burden unto thoſe that are Holy, ſo far as it is Holy, and Juſt, and good.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Therefore, we are to know, that the Law (I ſpeak of the morral Law, not of the ceremonial law now, But of the morral Law, For the Apoſtle ſpake of that here in this place) the Law it is indeed the very glaſs of Gods holineſs, I ſay, it is a glaſs of the holineſs of God, in the morral Law we may ſee the luſtre and the glory of the holineſs of God himſelf, and therefore we are not to be delivered from it, as it is the glaſs of Gods holineſs, wherein we may ſee the purity of Gods Nature, the Law of God ſhews God to be a holy God, different from all the Heathens, who have not a holy and Righteous Law as our God hath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Law, it is an extract of the very Image that God made man in at the firſt, an extract of Gods Image, as it were a copy of the Image of God. What was the Image that God made man in at the firſt? But in the imperſſion of his Law in their Hearts,

the very writing of the Law of God in their hearts, which is that we cal the moral law, in that conſiſted the very Image of God in mans ſoul at his firſt creation, when he was in his innocency, and therfore we cannot be ſaid to be delivered from that as it is a copy and extract of Gods Image in the heart of man, it is rather renewed by Chriſt than aboliſhed by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Law, it is a glaſs wherein we are to ſee our own faces, wherein we are to ſee how far we are decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the image in which we firſt were made, and ſo far Chriſt hath not delivered us from it neither, for he would have us ſtil to look into the law, as into a glaſs, to ſee how far we are come ſhort of that that God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us, and that God did inable us to do, that is a third conſideration of the Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Law is a revelation of the wil of God, it reveales what is the holy and righteous wil of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his creature, and in that conſideration we are not delivered from it neither, we are to look into that to ſee what the wil of God is concerning us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, which follows from thence, the law is ſtil an authoritative rule for our converſation, to order our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; that the ſcripture is as cleer in, as in any one truth that is in the book of God, it is indeed a point, that were it not for a ſtrang kind of wantonneſs that hath poſſeſt the ſpirits of ſome, it were never needful to ſpend one quarter, or minuite of an houre upon it.

Do not commit adultery, do not kil: now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kil, thou art a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of the law, of thoſe ten commandements.</p>
               <p>It is true, as we ſhal heare afterwards, they come to us in, another way than formerly, they came to the Jews, but ſtill it is apparent, notwithſtanding any thing revealed in the Goſpel, though there may be a great deale of grace now mixed with every commandement that comes to us, and ſo the manner of bringing it to us may be a great deal more ſweet, and comfortable, than formerly it was, yet ſtill this abides as an everlaſting rule, That thoſe are tranſgreſſors of the law, and to be convinced of ſin even by the law, that do not in their converſation ſubmit unto the rules thereof; and what indeed is the very defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of ſin by St. <hi>John</hi> but this, ſin is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the law, ſo that in theſe five reſpects, as the Law is the glaſs of Gods holineſs, As it is the very coppy and extract of the image of God in which God made man at the firſt, As it is the glaſs in which we are to look to ſee our deformity, As it is the revelation of the wil of God, and as it is the authoritative rule for our converſation, ſo Chriſt doth not deliver us from it, but it ſtands in force in al theſe five reſpects, and there are no beleevers, no gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious godly ſoules, that do account the Law a burden in theſe reſpects, but bleſs God for the Law, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it their inheritance, and the joy of their ſoules, they bleſs God that ever they knew it, and their hearts lie under the power of it, and they are willing to order their lives by it.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But then what are we delivered from in the Law by Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:44661:130"/>Firſt, From the rigour of it, Chriſt delivers us from the load of the rigor of it, from this rigor, that it requires perfect obedience, ſo far we are delivered from the rigor of the Law; and yet this may be ſaid to be rigorous in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our weakneſs, for we had once power, but now the Lord doth take off the rigor in regard of our weaknes And ſo rigorous, in regard of the violent and rigorous way that it doth take to force on men unto obedience, we ſhal heare how we are delivered from that.</p>
               <p>Secondly, beleevers are delivered from the bondage of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> You wil ſay, <hi>How is the Law a bondage unto thoſe that are Godly, being the law of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is a bondage not in it ſelf, but in regard of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty, for it requires of us now, conſidering what eſtate we are in, ſuch things as we cannot do, and that is a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, to be put upon more than we are able to do, as the Iſraelites were by their taskmaſters: but yet ſtil God is righteous in this, becauſe it is not more than God did at firſt inable us unto in our firſt Creation, but in regard of that eſtate that now we are in, it is a bondage, in that it puts upon us, what we cannot do, and that upon pain of eternal death too.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are delivered from the binding over power (as I may ſo ſay) the power of binding over the ſoul to the juſtice of God upon every breach of the Law. Now the binding-over power, the power of binding them over to anſwer to Gods juſtice upon the breach of it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are delivered from in Chriſt; as a man that is bound over to the aſſize and ſeſſions to anſwer, afterwards when he comes to take out his bond, he thinks himſelf at much eaſe and at quiet, when the bond is taken out by which he was bound to anſwer; ſo Chriſt comes and takes out the bond by which beleevers were bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Gods juſtice for al their ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:44661:130"/>Fourthly, They are delivered from the condemning power of the law, that the law hath not now power to bring a beleever, that ſins through frailty, unto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: this is cleere from ſcripture, as I might ſhew ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral texts as we go along, <hi>You are not under the law</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>And there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, we are delivered from the Law as the covenant for life, the law at firſt was given as the covenant that God made with mankind for life, for God deales with the rational creature according to the nature of it, &amp; becauſe it is capable of a covenant with God, therefore God deals with it in the way of a covenant, and as ſoon as man was made, the Lord entered into a covenant with mankind, now the covenant was no other than the law, Do and live, that was the covenant that God did enter into with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and made our firſt parents <hi>Adam,</hi> the head of that Covenant, Do and live, upon thy doing ſhal thy life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend (ſaith God) thy preſent and thy eternal life. Now we are delivered from the law by Chriſt, that is, that now it doth remain no more unto beleevers, to be the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life unto them, they being once in Chriſt, but they are brought under another Covenant, a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. So that in theſe five reſpects we may be ſaid to be delivered from the Law by Chriſt, from the rigor of it, from the bondage of it, from the binding-over power that is in it, from the condemning power, and from it as the Covenant of life. Now here is enough, one would think, if ſo be that the ſpirits of Men were not very wild and wanton, for the quieting of the ſoul in the deliverance of it from the law.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Reſt that beleevers have from the Burden of the Law by coming to Chriſt, laid out in Ten particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. <hi>1.</hi> They do not ſtand or fall for life by the Law. <hi>2.</hi> The Law-giver is the Redeemer. <hi>3.</hi> The leaſt ſpark of Grace is accepted. <hi>4.</hi> Their wil ſhal be accepted as the deed. <hi>5.</hi> Obedience is required in a ſweet and gentle way. <hi>6.</hi> The Grace of God in Chriſt doth melt the heart. <hi>7.</hi> Their ſins make them an object of Gods pity. <hi>8.</hi> They have Chriſt to undertake for them as a ſurety. <hi>9.</hi> They are delivered, and yet ſatisfaction is made to the law. <hi>10.</hi> They have aſſurance that they ſhal never forfeit the covenant of Grace they are under by Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW then, from al theſe, we ſhal lay downe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propoſitions, wherein you may ſee what is the eaſe and reſt that beleevers have in Chriſt, in being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thus from the law. Take the eaſe that comes by Chriſt from hence, in theſe ſeveral particulars, O! thou beleever, that art under the load of the law, and come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Know, That thou doſt not ſtand and fal for thy eternal eſtate by the law, that is the firſt Eaſe and Reſt, the law indeed may threaten thee, and dreadful things may be revealed by it againſt thee, but be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in this, thy eternal eſtate ſhal not be caſt by it, it is ful of ſeverity, but thou art ſo far free, that whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou didſt depend and rely upon that for thy eternal condition, now thou art out of the power, out of the reach of it, ſo far that it hath not to do with thee, to caſt thy ſoul for thy eternal eſtate; we would not be at the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44661:131"/>
diſpoſe of any man that we look upon as ful of ſeverity and rigor in matters of great conſequence, but we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire rather to be, in ſuch caſes, at the diſpoſe of men, who are ful of pitty and compaſſion, know, O! thou beleever, who art in Chriſt, that thou art not at the diſpoſe of the Law, that is ful of ſeverity, for thy everlaſting condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but thou art at the diſpoſe of the Goſpel, of the covenant of grace, that is fild as ful with mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, as an infinite wiſdom could deviſe, it hath that fulneſs of compaſſion, more then poſſibly al the wiſdom of the angels in heaven, and men upon earth could ever have deviſed or thought on, beyond their imagination: Now for one to be at the diſpoſe of a man in matters of the greateſt concernment, that hath as much mercy in him, as ever man had in this world, yea, as much mercy in him as were in al the men in the world, If al the mercy that were in al the men in the world were put into one, the heart of one man, and you were to be at his diſpoſe in a matter of the greateſt concernment, you would think your ſelves wel, whereas before you lay at the mercy of a man that is very rigorous, and ful of ſeverity, now you come to ly at the mercy of a man that hath al the bowels and tender compaſſions of al the men in the world, would you not think this a good change? this is the change and the reſt that thou haſt when thou comeſt to Chriſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thy ſoul, thy eternal eſtate, lay at the diſpoſe of the Law that is ful of rigor, and ſeverity, now thy eternal eſtate doth depend upon a Covenant, that is as ful of grace and mercy as thy ſoul could deſire, thy ſoul cannot deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re a covenant to be fuller of grace and mercy, then that covenant that thy everlaſting eſtate depends upon, and muſt be caſt by, and is not here reſt now for a beleever if he doth underſtand this aright? that is the firſt thing, wherein the reſt of a beleever conſiſts by Chriſt, as being freed from the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> now he that is the lawgiver, is thy redeemer, thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt now to receiv the law from the hand of a mediator &amp;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44661:132"/>
here indeed is the principle eaſe and reſt of a gracious heart, to the mind of a Saint, a beleever, that now he comes to receive the Law from the hand of a mediator. There is many that ſpeake of deliverance from the Law as it came by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but if we underſtand things aright, we have no ſuch cauſe to think that neceſſary, to be delivered from the Law as it came by <hi>Moſes</hi> in one ſence, that is thus, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a tipe of Chriſt as a Mediator, for ſo he is called a Mediator, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>It was ordained by Angels in the hand of a mediator.</hi> God made uſe of the miniſtry of the Angels in delivering the law, and he gave it in the hand of a mediator, not to the people im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, for they were not able to beare it, but in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he was to bring the Law from God unto them, and it was not immediately given unto them, but in his hand as in the hand of a Mediator. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> is called a Mediator here, as a tipe of Chriſt, as he was a tipe of Chriſt; as he was a tipe of Chriſt in diverſe reſpects, ſo in this, and he tipified Chriſt in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that the Law to beleevers, comes not unto them meerly from God as a righteous and juſt God, as their Judg, but comes unto them in the hand of Chriſt as their Mediator, and there is a great deal of comfort in the Law to receive it thus, to receive it from the hand of Chriſt who is their Mediator, and (as I ſhewed before) who is their advocate; for ſo he is called in ſcripture: that now they ſhould receive the Law by his hand, that is at the right hand of the Father, to be their advocate, to plead for them when they ſhal through infirmity break the law; this is a mighty reſt to the ſoul, therefore beleevers are to look upon the Law coming from God, but coming from God in the hand of a Mediator, to look upon their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator as indeed their Law-giver, not only handing the Law to them as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, but the truth is, the Law-giver himſelf, Chriſt the Mediator hands the Law to them, yea, is their Law-giver, and receives the Law for them: now this muſt needs be a great eaſe, a great
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:44661:132"/>
Reſt to the Soul, if it underſtands this aright.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In Chriſt now thy condition is ſuch, that though there be never ſo many imperfections, never ſo many weakneſſes, Yea, ſtrong Corruptions, yet if there be but the leaſt Spiritual good, the leaſt work of Gods Grace in thee, the Lord hath a ſpecial Eye to that little good that there is in thee, and all thy Corruptions, all thy imperfections ſhall not hinder the acceptation of the little ſpark of good that is in thy Soul, this is our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by Chriſt: For in the opening of the Law, there I ſhewed, that whatever good man doth do being under the Law, let it be what it wil, yet except it be perfect, it is al rejected. All that are in their natural condition, and under the firſt Covenant, whatever they do, if there be any imperfection mingled with it, it is not at al ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but here is the Reſt that beleevers have, that the caſe is altered with them. Now though there be much corruption remaining in them, if the Lord ſees but one ſpark of grace, though never ſo weak, though it be but as the ſmoking flax, as the bruiſed Reed, yet they are accepted of God, having but the leaſt ſpark of any good at al in them: this is a mighty eaſe to the Souls of thoſe that labor under the bondage of the Law, That before ſeeing ſo much Corruption in their Hearts they had little Hopes of acceptation of any thing that was in them, now the Lord hath regard to any thing that is good, be it never ſo ſmal, Yea, And he wil find it out too. Perhaps thy Grace may be ſo ſmal, that it may be buried in the he<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of Corruption, that thou ſhalt not be able to find it out. The condition of ſome Chriſtians is, as a Maid that ſhal go in the morning to the hearth, and there raking up and down in the aſhes, to ſee if ſhe can find ſome ſpark of fire, and ſhe finds none, and is ready to think there is none there, but perhaps there may ſome ſpark lie in a corner, though ſhe finds it not: So it is here, corruption in the Heart
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44661:133"/>
is like the Aſhes, and Grace is like ſome ſpark that lies in a Corner, and when poor Souls go to examin their Hearts, they ſee a great deal of Aſhes, a great deal of Corruption, and are ready to conclude, the fire is out, no ſpark there, I but, though rhou canſt not find a ſpark there, yet being in Chriſt, God will find it when thou canſt not thy ſelf, if there be any that lies in any corner, as we hope there is ſome ſparks in many, though there is ſo much Corruption in the Hearts of many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people, that we wonder where their Grace lies, ſo much paſſion, frowardneſs, and the like, well, were it indeed that theſe were under the Covenant of works, under the Law, that corruption that doth appear in them would cauſe all to be caſt off, whatever might lie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in their Hearts, God would caſt it off, but now, if they be ſuch as are under the Covenant of Grace, and the Lord hath brought them to Chriſt, this is the Reſt and eaſe for their Souls, that all the Corruption that is in them ſhall not hinder the acceptation of the leaſt ſpark of the Grace of God that the Lord hath wrought in them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As the Lord wil find out every ſpark of good that is in them, ſo even their deſires and endeavors after the will of God, though they are not able to attaine to what they would, it ſhal be accepted as the deed. The other was, ſuppoſe you do not do the will of God, yet if there be any habit, any diſpoſition, any principle of Grace, though nothing be done, though they cannot perceive any begining of it, yet that ſhal, be accepted; but this is further; let them but ſtrive to do Gods will, let them Labor after perfection, and the Lord accepts the will for the deed. Hence in Scripture thoſe that are godly are called perfect, <hi>As many as are perfect,</hi> and <hi>Be ye perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:44661:133"/>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>Can we be perfect in this World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, But this is the Grace of God in the Goſpel, that thoſe that come to Chriſt, the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the will for the deed, here is bleſſed eaſe and Reſt for the Soul in Chriſt, wert thou under the Law, this could not be, and though men ſay they do, and they Hope God will accept of their deſires and endeavors. It is true, if thou art come to Chriſt, Chriſt will accept thee; but know this, that it is the priviledg of a beleever, it is not the priviledg of every one; there is a generation of men that are under the Law, whoſe deſires ſhall not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as I ſhewed in opening of the burden of the Law, <hi>But the man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them,</hi> So runs the Tenure of the Law, but here is eaſe for thy Soul, if thou doeſt underſtand how the Law runs, thy Heart cannot but ſink within thee, but this is that that gives eaſe to the Soul, I am now come under another condition, I being in Chriſt, Chriſt gives Reſt and eaſe unto the Souls of thoſe that come to him, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and endeavors ſhal he accepted of God as performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, now this is a bleſſed eſtate.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Reſt of the Soul in Chriſt, as it hath reference to deliverance from the burden of the Law, conſiſts in this, That now al the Duties that God requires at thy hand, are required in a ſweet and a gentle way, the ſervices that God requires, are required of thee in a gentle, and a loving way, God indeed comes and requires the ſame things that the Law requires of thee, I but, he comes to draw thy Soul with the Cords of Love, <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by the mercies of God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. <hi>That you give up your ſelves a living ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Service.</hi> We beſeech you by the mercies of God. Now the bond-ſlaves that are under the Law, they have not Duties required of them by ſuch cords and bonds of Love, but if thou doſt theſe things thou ſhalt live, if not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:44661:134"/>
thou ſhalt die, do and live, ſin and die, ſo the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires duties at your hands that are under the bondage of the Law: but now beleevers in Chriſt their duties are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the mercies of God, <hi>We as Embaſſadors beſeech</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>And if there be any Love any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</hi> Such kind of arguments are uſed to them, and were it that we preached only to beleevers, theſe kind of arguments were only neceſſary, and it becomes thoſe that are drawn by the Goſpel, to be drawn by ſuch arguments, and it is a good argument that your Souls are drawn by the power of the Goſpel, and are come to Chriſt, if you find the Lord doth draw your Hearts that way, and that thoſe Duties of obedience that formerly you were put upon in a rigorous way, meerly by the terror of your conſciences, your conſciences flaſhing Hell fire in your Faces if you did not perform them, if now you find, that the Grace of God in the Goſpel draws your Hearts more powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is true, every way you ſhould give to God obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, upon any tearms, but now, when you find, that God draws your Souls this way, it is an argument that you come to have Reſt in Chriſt. We read in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Ceremonial Law, a type of theſe things that I am now ſpeaking of, that the Book of the Law was laid under the mercy ſeate, you ſhal find in the ſtory, that the Book of the Law was laid under the mercy ſeate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cherubins under the mercy ſeate, there the Book of the Law was laid, that was the place that God appointed for it; to ſhew, that even thus doth the Law of God come now upon the Hearts of beleevers, it comes upon them as it were under the mercy ſeat, in the mercy ſeat beleevers look upon the Book of the Law, lying at the mercy ſeat, that is, every Commandement comes unto them in a gracious, alluring way, together with abundance of mercy, to draw their Hearts unto the obedience of it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Coming to Chriſt, you have reſt from the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44661:134"/>
Law in this, that the Grace of God in Chriſt doth much melt the Heart, and when it hath melted the Heart, to milk out the flagons of it, then this melting of Heart is accepted exceedingly by God, is very precious in the Eyes of God; now this comes from the Grace of God that we have in Chriſt, and it is a mighty Reſt of Soul to know this. As I told you before, It is not enough for any of you to ſay, it is true, we are all ſinners, but God knows I mourn for my ſins, I am troubled for my ſins, that is not enough for thee, friend, but art thou one that art delivered from thy natural condition? From being under the Covenant of works? Art thou one that is come to Chriſt, and brought to Chriſt? Art thou one that is in the ſtate of beleevers, being a member of Chriſt? Then thy repentance and mourning is acccepted.</p>
               <p>As now it is in many Caſes between Men and Men; ſome men are in ſuch a Capacity, that if they do ſuch a thing, it is accepted, but if another man, that is not in the ſame Capacity do the ſame thing, he will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; ſo it is here, thoſe men that are in this Capacity in Chriſt, and have together with the ſorrowes for their ſins, the ſorrows of Chriſt preſented to the Father. Canſt thou when thou art ſorrowing for thy ſins, preſent the ſorrows of Jeſus Chriſt by Faith unto the Father? Then thou art accepted; but know this, that no ſorrow for ſin is accepted, but ſuch as is joyned with the preſentation of the ſorrows of Chriſt unto the Father. Now what an eaſe is this to the Soul! That now the Heart hath a means to melt it, for the Heart was hardened before, the ſorrow for ſin is ſuch, that the Heart remains hardned, it is no other ſorrow but this, as it is with Marble-ſtones, the Marble-ſtone is hard, but yet in wet wether it will give and be very moiſt, but ſtil it is as hard as it was, it is a ſtone ſtil: So it is with many that are troubled for their ſins, being only the trouble that comes from the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44661:135"/>
Law, they are troubled but yet there remaines much hardneſs in their Heart, much peeviſhneſs and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt God and againſt men. You ſhall find in many people who have trouble of conſcience, yet there is much peeviſhneſs and frowardneſs in them, againſt God and againſt man, now when you ſee this in the Hearts of people manifeſted in their expreſſions, waies, and converſations, remember the ſtones that you ſee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pavements in wet wether, they give, and may be water trickles down from them, and yet they remain hard ſtill.</p>
               <p>But now when the Goſpel comes, it doth not only cauſe ſome ſorrow, but the Heart melts, and this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as very precious before God; and that is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we have in Scripture ſo many expreſſions of Gods high eſteem of broken Hearts and contrite Spirits, and how God looks at them. He that dwels on high, yet looks to him that is of an Humble and contrite Spirit, and that trembles at his word, and let me ſpeak this one word, for the eaſe of them that are troubled, and are come to Chriſt; thoſe tears that come from thy melted Heart, through the Grace of the Goſpel, they are of all things moſt precious in the Eyes of God, next to the blood of Chriſt, next to the drops of Chriſts blood, thy mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Lamenting Spirit, is one of the moſt precious things in the Eyes of God, God treaſures up every one of them, and this is the Reſt of the Soul, the Soul may have abundance of Reſt therefore in Chriſt, when thou comeſt to know that thy mourning for thy offences is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The eaſe that the Soul hath from the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Law is this, That whereas before, through the ſeverity of the Law, ſin did make thy Soul an object of Gods wrath, take ſin as it was in it ſelf, and coming from thee, God having no reſpect in Chriſt towards thee, ſin made thy Soul an object of Gods wrath, Yea, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44661:135"/>
of hatred too, for ſo the Scripture tels us plainly, that the Lord hates the workers of iniquity; now being come to Chriſt according to this invitation, <hi>Come to me ye that are Laden,</hi> now your ſins being looked upon in Chriſt, do rather make you an object of pitty and compaſſion to God, not from any virtue, not from any thing in its own Nature, but in regard of your condition: as thus, let a tender Mother look upon the Child that is ſick, that is wounded; it is true, the Mother cannot Love the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, or love the wound, the Mother would not have the ſickneſs, or the wound upon the Child, but doth not the ſickneſs or wound that is upon the Child, make the Child to be an object of pitty and Compaſſion, Make the bowels of a tender Father and Mother, to yern ſo much the more to the Child? So here, the Lord now looks upon thy ſin, being in Chriſt, as thy ſickneſs, as thy wound, and therefore doth pitty thee, as under thy affliction rather then under thy ſin. For the truth is, all thoſe that are the Saints of God and are come to Chriſt, they look upon their own ſins as their affliction, as the greateſt affliction they have in the world, as I ſhewed when I ſpake of the load and Burden of Corruption that remaines in their Hearts, Now God therefore looks up on thy ſin as thine affliction, and as for any other thing that is thy affliction, as it is the breach of the Law or the like, Chriſt undertakes for that, and ſo thou art delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the wrath that it doth deſerve, and thoſe evil effects that ſhould come of it through the revenging juſtice of God, Chriſt hath undertaken it, but yet it remaines thy affliction, though thou art delivered from guiltineſs, and condemnation, yet one that hath a gracious Heart Reaſons thus. Though I be delivered from my ſin, from the Guilt of it, from the condemning power that the Law hath through my ſin, yet it is my affliction, my trouble, and ſo I look upon it, now peace and Reſt be to that Soul from what the Law can require, ſo that, as we go along, we may not only ſee the benefit
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44661:136"/>
we have by Chriſt, but who they are that are thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, thoſe who though they know they are delivered from the Burden of it, yet they do account their ſins the afflictions of their Soul, whereas others, that are, meerly Legal, they apprehend their Souls as guilty and under condemnation, but if they were delivered from it they would look upon their ſins as their wounds and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Saints, they ſee that they are now made the objects of Gods pitty and compaſſion towards them; and hence is the Reaſon, that Chriſt is willing if it be poſſible, to find many excuſes that may be made for his poor Servants, thou ſhalt not need to find out any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if there be any thing that may alleviate and leſſen thy ſin, Chriſt will find it our, and leſſen it for thee. You know what Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples when they were ſleeping, and could not watch one hour, though he rebukes them, yet he ſaith, though the fleſh is weak, yet the Spirit is willing. Mark how Chriſt excuſe them, they do not ſay when Chriſt comes and ſaith, cannot you watch with me one hour? Alas it is true Maſter, the ſpirit is willing but the fleſh is weak, they do not ſay thus, but Chriſt ſaith ſo to them, and the truth is, this is the way, to leave their excuſe to Chriſt, their way is to aggravate their ſins as much as may be, and it is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of thoſe that are come to Chriſt, it is not their care to leſſen their ſins, but they do what they can to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their ſins, and lay it upon their Hearts for the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of their Souls, but Chriſt undertakes to excuſe them. And therefore you that have ſo many excuſes for your ſin, juſt as your Grand-Father <hi>Adam</hi> had, he put it off to the Woman, and the Woman unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and one to another, ſo you, it is true, my Nature is paſſionate, and I am froward by Nature, and a hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch excuſes men have, whereas all thy care ſhould be to humble thy Soul for thy ſins, and if there be any thing to alleviate thy ſin, and leſſen it, Chriſt will do that, and the more thou excuſeſt thy ſelf, the greater will be
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44661:136"/>
thy ſin, and it is better for thee, for another to excuſe it, than thy ſelf. As when a Child or ſervant ſhal offend, and one that is a neer friend or neighbor ſhal come and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, this is a great deal better than if they did it themſelves. Now thoſe that are under the Law, they have no excuſe to be made for them, but thoſe that are come to Chriſt they have Chriſt to make al the excuſes for them.</p>
               <p>Oh! take heed of abuſing the rich grace of God in Chriſt, this I know, that this is ſuch a pure quality, that it hath not ſuch a malignant quality in it that it wil be abuſed, and where you ſee any ſuch quality, know that they have it not aright, they have ſomething elſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the thing, as ſometimes you ſhal ſee two things as like one another as can be, ſuppoſe drinks made with ſome kind of compoſition, they ſhal look juſt like one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but one ſhal have ſome venom in it, enough to kil one, and the other ſhal be wholeſome and able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover one, yet both ſhal have the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But of that I ſhall ſpeake more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, When thou art come to Chriſt, thy ſoul may have reſt in him, for in Chriſt there is an undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a ſurety through the grace of the goſpel in him, thou haſt revealed to thee, that there is an undertaking by ſurety, this is a deliverance from the Law, whereas the Law requires perfect obedience at our hands in our owne perſons, their Law requires of the ſoul that it ſhal pay the debt in its own perſon, the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44661:137"/>
ſoul that ſins ſhal die, Now the grace of the Goſpel comes and tels thee of a ſurety, and ſuch a ſurety as God himſelf profeſſes he is wel pleaſed to accept of, and is as conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, as he is to have the debt paid by the creature, by the debtor himſelf, and this is a great eaſe; Would it not be a great eaſe to any of you, that when a creditor ſhal come upon you for a debt, layhold upon you, or put you in priſon, and afterwards the debt ſhould be paid by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other and layd upon him, and the creditor ſhal accept of him, and the creditor ſhal ſay wel, wil this man be your ſurety and pay the debt, if ſo, then ſaith the creditor I am ſatisfied, I am contented, what eaſe is this unto the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Thus it is with the ſoul that comes to Chriſt, when he hath been laden under the Law, and the Law comes to the ſoul for the payment of the debt, now coming to Chriſt imediately, Chriſt is entertained as the ſurety by God the father, and ſo there is the tranſaction of the debt upon him, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Chriſt is delivered from al this rigor, bondage, and other things that I ſpoke of in the Law, and yet ſo delivered from the Law by ſatisfaction to the Law, and this is further eaſe to the ſoul, I am delivered from the Law, But how? by ſatisfaction to the Law, there is ſatisfaction to the Law, that is ſuch ſatitfaction as the Law-giver himſelf doth accept of, which is only in Chriſt, not al that I can do, can poſſibly do it, if I could conceive that God were ſo merciful, as to accept of any thing I can do, yet it could not be ſatisfaction to the Law, but now our deliverance from the Law is in a way that is ſatisfaction unto the Law, and here now is eaſe, that the ſoul is freed ſo, as the Law is ſatisfied too.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Wheras the law required conſtant obedience, and if there were obedience to the end, to the laſt act, and the laſt act were ſin, al the other would be forgotten ſo as the ſoul would yet periſh notwithſtanding, and the Law could not aſſure any man of continuance to the end the law could never do it, could not aſſure any ſo long as they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44661:137"/>
were under the power of it, though they had ability to obey, and they went on according to their ability, went on divers yeares, yet they could never have aſſurance but that they might fal at laſt and ſo periſh. Wel, but now coming to Chriſt there is not only ſatisfaction for what is paſt, but an aſſurance of holding out unto the end, an aſſurance that this covenant that thou art now come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Chriſt, that there ſhal never be any forfiture of it? and that is a mighty eaſe and reſt, the ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of divers of theſe things were opened before, when I ſhewed how in Chriſt we were freed from the guilt of our ſins, but now theſe are things that do flow from thence, and the preſenting of theſe further, ſhewing the conſequences of what then was ſaid, may be further reſt unto the ſoul. For though I did al the other things as the principle of them, yet every poor ſoul is not able to draw forth every of theſe particulars, now that is the help of thoſe that are weake, to ſee the ſeveral ſteps of Gods grace in Chriſt, not only to ſee it in the lump, but ſee how it ſtreames in the particulars of it, to have theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before their ſouls, it is a mighty help to their faith and comfort, and this laſt that I have ſpoke of, it is not leſs then the reſt, but indeed it is the compleating of al the former, that the ſoul that comes to Chriſt, hath this reſt in Chriſt, that it is brought into a covenant, and with aſſurance that there ſhal never be any forfiture of that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for it is a part of the covenant, that God ſhould give Grace unto the ſoul, ſo as is ſhal never come to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, to looſe the bleſſing of the covenant, they may for the preſent looſe ſome comfort of the Covenant, but to be put from the bleſſing of the Covenant, it ſhal never be. It is a part of the purchaſe of the blood of Chriſt, that al that come to him ſhal never be caſt off from him again, it coſt the blood of Chriſt, and this is a priviledg that beleevers have more then ever <hi>Adam</hi> had, <hi>Adam</hi> was under a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes, and he was able to keep the Covenant, I but <hi>Adam</hi> never had this promiſe from God, that he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44661:138"/>
ſhould never forfeit it, that he ſhould never ſo break the Covenant as to be undone, <hi>Adam</hi> never had that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But now, all beleevers that are come to Chriſt, they have this ingagement upon a ſure ground, for it is upon a dear purchaſe Chriſt hath laid down his blood for thee, for this thing as well as any other thing, that thy Soul may come into an everlaſting Covenant never to be forfeited. And now, if all theſe Particulars be put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and theſe things be made cleer to the Soul by the Eye of Faith, if there be an Eye of Faith to behold the reality of all theſe things that I have perſented to you, I appeal to you, is there not Reſt to thoſe that come to Chriſt? Is it not worth a great deal of pains to come to Chriſt? Is there not that that will recompence all at laſt, whatever trouble there is at firſt, the work of humiliation and the like? yet when you come to Chriſt, there is that that wil recompence al your former trouble. As I ſaid before in the concluding of the other Particular, ſo may I ſay of this, as it is in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 116. <hi>And now my Soul returne unto thy Reſt</hi>: So may all beleevers ſay upon good ground; if theſe things be true that we have now heard, <hi>Then my Soul returne unto thy Reſt, for the Lord hath dealt bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with thee indeed.</hi> Oh therefore, be in Love with the Goſpel, ſtudy it much, look unto the depth of it, and prize Jeſus Chriſt, that hath purchaſed ſuch a Reſt unto your Soul. And you who are about coming to Chriſt, be Reſtleſs in your Spirits til you come to have this Reſt, and it were a lamentable thing that any thing in the world ſhould meet with you in the way and quiet your Hearts, that any thing ſhould quiet your Souls but Chriſt. And you that are beleevers improve this now, this is a ſpecial thing to be ſpoke of in this point, how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſhould improve this, and what it is that they ſhould learn by this, and how helpful this will be to them, and ſomthing for the ſatisfaction of thoſe that doubt that they are not beleevers; but we cannot do all things at

once, this ſhall ſuffice for the preſent, the meer preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to your Souls what Reſt there is in Chriſt from the load of the Burden of the Law, from the load that many feel to be upon their Souls through the burden of the Law.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containeth divers Conſequences from the Reſt belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have from the Burden of the Law. And Leſſons they are taught from thence.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO proceed now, There are divers things that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence, from the reſt that we have in Chriſt from the Burden and load of the Law.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak very breifly of them, and ſo paſs to what remaines, in the next burden, and reſt to that.</p>
               <p>From hence follows exceeding help unto beleevers againſt divers temptations that do exceedingly trouble the peace and Reſt of their ſouls, if they be delivered from the Law in thoſe ſeveral reſpects as at large hath been opened to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then firſt from the Meditation of this their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they may have Reſt and eaſe from this temptation, that becauſe of ſome imperfections, weakneſſes, and diſtempers of Heart, and ſins that they are guilty of, therefore they have no intereſt at al in Chriſt, they have no intereſt to beleeve in Chriſt, becauſe of that. The ſtrength of this temptation cannot ſtand with the right knowledg of Chriſt, as delivered from the Law, if Chriſt delivers from the Law, then an intereſt in Chriſt may ſtand, though we be not able to keep the Law. Yea, And further, we know this, that it is uſual with belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers upon the breach of the Law in any thing, to call
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44661:139"/>
their eſtates into queſtion, all into queſtion. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we know that we are to deal with God, not by the Covenant of works, not to be caſt by the Law, we would never be ſo ready to cal all into queſtion, upon any breach of the Law that our conſcience tels us we have been guilty of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Further, This would marvelouſly help againſt this temptation likewiſe. That God accepts not of what we do, becauſe it is not perfect, becauſe it is not compleat: when beleevers look upon their duties that they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and ſee ſo many imperfections in them, they dare not tender them up to God, God is an infinite, Holy, juſt God, and they are aſhamed of what they have done, ſo as they dare not tender them up to God, now the right knowledg of our deliverance from the Law, would help us againſt this temptation likewiſe. Remember O thou beleever, that thou haſt to deal with God in a Covenant of Grace, thou haſt to deal with him in Chriſt through a better Covenant then the Covenant of the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Further, This would help againſt this temptation alſo, that many times is in the Hearts of the Saints; That becauſe they hear of divers that have ſeemed to have more then they have, that have had more ability then they have had, have been able to do more for God than they have done, yet for all this have fallen away, and ſo, it may be, have periſhed for ever. Now ſaith many a poor Chriſtian, if ſuch Eminent men, of ſuch excellent abilities, that were able to do ſuch great things, if they that go thus far, fall away, what ſhal become of ſuch a poor creature as I am? Now by the underſtanding of our deliverance that we have from the Law by Chriſt, we come to have help againſt this temptation; for let a man have never ſuch abilities, and be able to do never ſo much work, yet this man may fall away, when one that is a thouſand times weaker in regard of abilities, that hath the leaſt dram of true Faith which brings him into the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:44661:139"/>
Covenant of Grace will ſtand, ſuch a one ſhall ſtand when the other fals. If indeed thy ſtanding did depend upon what ſtrength thou haſt in thy ſelf, then thou hadſt cauſe to lear, that ſeeing ſuch as did ſtand, fel away, what ſhal become of thee? But we are to know, that we are to deal with God, in a way of the Covenant of Grace, our ſtanding or falling doth not depend upon any thing in our ſelves, but upon Chriſt that hath undertaken for al thoſe that are his members. Thou haſt to deal with God in the Covenant of Grace, and being once brought into the Covenant, that will uphold thee though thou art weak, when thouſands of others that have a great deal of Natural abillity and common guifts of Gods Spirit, yet being not brought under this Covenant may vaniſh, Yea, Had they the ſtrength of an Angel yet if not brought under this Covenant of Grace made with belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Chriſt, they would fall and come to nothing. Whenas the weakeſt beleever that hath to do with God through Chriſt, and not through the Law, ſuch a one ſhal ſtand and not fal. Now the being delivered from the Law in Chriſt, will mightily help beleevers againſt theſe temptations and divers others, I know nothing that doth help beleevers more then this, in being delivered from the Law, in that ſence as hath been ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe from hence there are a great many Leſſons to be learned as.</p>
               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <head>The Firſt Leſſon.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, From this deliverance we are taught, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the hearing of the Threats of the Law, I ſpeak to beleevers, though others may make an ill uſe in hearing the deliverance from the Law, yet they muſt not miſs their Portion. I ſay beleevers are hereby taught how to receive the Threats of the Law, you hear dreadful threates of the Law out of Gods word againſt ſin. Now how ſhouldeſt thou entertain theſe threates? The way is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:44661:140"/>
this, when thou heareſt ſuch threates know, that God by this would have thee to conſider, what his mercy is, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of thee from what thou haſt deſerved. God would have thee to conſider what the evil of ſin is in it ſelf, and to conſider what Chriſt hath done, God would have thee to be driven to Chriſt by this meanes, to ſee thy need of Chriſt, to bleſs his name for Chriſt, and to prize Chriſt, who hath delivered thee from theſe threatnings. A beleever, when he heares the threates of the Law, is like a man that ſtands upon the ſhoare, when there is a greivous tempeſt and ſtorme, he ſees the waves riſe high, heares the winds blow, and the waves roare but he ſtands ſafe upon the haven, indeed he was in the ſtorme and tempeſt, but God hath brought him to the haven, and there he ſtands and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, It may be he ſees other ſhips a great way off ready to be ſplit upon the rocks, or ſwallowed up, but he is ſafe on the ſhoare, ſo it ſhould be with al beleevers, when they heare the threatnings of the law, they ſhould entertain them with bleſſing of the name of God, there was a time that my ſoul was under theſe as wel as any, but now the Lord hath delivered me, and brought me under another Covenant, brought me to his ſon, to Chriſt, and he hath undertaken to ſatisfie the Law for my ſoul, and ſo the beleever ſtands upon the ſhoar, and prayſes God, and this makes him love Chriſt ſo much the more, prize Chriſt ſo much the more, and bleſs the name of God that ever he heard the voice of the Goſpel ſounding in his eares: and therefore it is not tedious and grievous to him to heare the dreadful threatnings of the Law, he knowes how to make a holy uſe of them, his heart is drawn neerer to God by it as wel as by the promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. It is an ill ſigne, when men and women cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to heare the threatnings of the Law, a dangerous ſigne that they are under thoſe threatnings, if they were not under them it would not be troubleſome to them to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44661:140"/>
heare them, but they that are delivered from them, they know how to make uſe of them. Many men and women wil ſay, when they hear of the terrors of the Law, what doth this but harden us? the hearing of the terrors of the Law doth more harden us; but if thou wert acquainted with the Goſpel, thou wouldeſt be ſoftened by hearing of the terrors of the Law, becauſe thou wouldeſt prize Chriſt more. And therefore beleevers muſt not look upon them as things that no way concerne them, though they be not under them to be caſt by them, yet they do concerne them nearly, and therefore God would have thoſe things revealed, even to beleevers, becauſe of many gracious uſes that beleevers are to make of thoſe things.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, from what hath been delivered both from the burden of the law and the reſt in being delivered from it, this Leſſon may be learned, Here we may ſee how beleevers are in the courſe of their lives, to mix humility with confidence, they may learne how to be humble, and yet how to be confident, how to rejoyce and yet how to tremble; there is no ſuch way to learne the mixture of humility, with faith and confidence, and the mixture of joy and trembling as this is, know the Law and the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under it, and then the reſt that is to be had in Chriſt, this wil teach thee to be ſenſible of thy own wretchedneſs, and what a condition thou art in naturally, and yet how to be confident in the grace of God in Chriſt. This wil teach thee how to feare in regard of what thou art in thy ſelf and yet to rejoyce in regard of what thou art in Jeſus Chriſt, in the reſt thy ſoul hath Got in Jeſus Chriſt. Many people do not know how to mingle theſe two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if ſo be they be humbled for their ſins, then they are dejected, in their ſpirits, they cannot tel how, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe humiliation for their ſins, and faith and confidence in Gods grace together, they think the humiliation for ſin wil hinder Gods grace, and therfore they cannot indure to hear of ſuch things as tend to beat them down, to humble them
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44661:141"/>
for their ſins, but they ſay, they muſt beleeve altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Gods grace, aad the other wil bring them to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Certainly, thou art not acquainted with the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſs, if thou doeſt not underſtand how theſe two may ſtand together, to be deeply humbled for thy ſins, and yet at the ſame inſtant of time, the ſoul to be raiſed with the Mercy of God in Chriſt both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>It is true, vices are oppoſite one to another, but graces are never oppoſite one to another, thoſe that underſtand the Miſtery of Godlyneſs they know how to mingle theſe two together, at one and the ſame time. You know that the ſcripture ſaith, that Godlineſs is a miſtery, <hi>Great is the miſtery of Godlyneſs,</hi> and indeed Godlineſs conſiſts in the skil that a Chriſtian comes to have, to know at the ſame time, how to be humbled, and yet to be confident, yet to be beleeving, and one the other ſide, to rejoyce, and yeat to feare, many cannot rejoyce, but they grow looſe and wanton with their joy; and others cannot feare; but their hears grow lumpiſh and dead if they do feare; now the heart that underſtands what it is to be under the Law naturally and what reſt Chriſt hath brought unto us in delivering us from the Law, can tel how to rejoice in trembling, and to beleeve in humiliation, and there is no ſuch way to make ſuch a mixture of both as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it is to be naturally under the Law, and what the reſt is that we have in Chriſt, I confeſs theſe things wil not perhaps come ſo ful upon the hearts of thoſe that do not in ſome meaſure remember what we have ſaid her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, both from the burden of the Law, and the reſt that we have in Chriſt, thoſe wil not be able to make ſo much uſe of this that I am ſpeaking of, I could wiſh theſe things would have come altogether, but we cannot do al things at once.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, A further thing that is to be learned from the deliverance we have in Chriſt from the Law, it is this; here appeares plainly, that the way of Life and ſalvation is above nature, it is ſupernatural, for that that I have opened in the reſt we have in Chriſt from the law, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you, that beleevers are not to ſtand or fal for their eternal eſtates by any worke of the Law, if they performe any worke of the Law, this, doth not bring them to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, if they breake the Law this doth not caſt them down unto death, therefore the way of life and ſalvation is ſupernatural, for nature can teach a man no further then this, that he muſt ſerve God, &amp; if he do th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> God wil bleſs him, and love him, and if he ſin againſt God, God wil afflict him and chaſtiſe him, nature can tel of no way how a man ſhould be ſaved but only by ſerving of God, and by doing the workes of the Law, nature teacheth a man no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but this together with the other, that if he doth that, that God forbids, he muſt expect the wrath of God, and to ly under Gods wrath, and beyond this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot go. Now then for to heare of ſuch a thing as this is, that my ſoul ſhal not depend upon what I neglect, nor my eternal life ſhal not depend upon what I do, that is a high myſtery that is infinitely above nature. I do not ſay what the neglect of Gods wil doth deſerve of eternal periſhing, yea, even in beleevers; but now they are under the Covenant in Chriſt, they have the reſt in Chriſt, that their ſouls ſhal not be caſt one way or other by what they do or what they leav undon, though if they neglect his wil the Lord may make them to know it here while they live in this world. And if upon this any ſhal ſay, then what need we regard what we do, if any ſhal ſay ſo, we need go no further with this man but ſay unto him, <hi>Thou haſt no part nor portion in this thing,</hi> thou haſt no part in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the Law by Chriſt, ſhal we ſin becauſe grace abounds? God forbid, the Lord forbid that there
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44661:142"/>
ſhould enter any ſuch thought; into any of our Hearts, They that are godly have the Spirit of God in them, and will not Reaſon after ſuch a manner, however this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that in Chriſt we do not depend for life and Death upon the works of the Law, and therefore the way of the Goſpel is a high way, a ſupernatural way, it is a way beyond that that moſt people imagine: moſt people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth look no higher for a way of Salvation, but meerly through the works of the Law, and they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly miſcary, by what you have heard. You ſee that the way of Salvation is a higher thing than Nature.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth Leſſon.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, We may learn from hence, that if Chriſt have given Reſt to beleevers by delivering them, from the rigour and ſeverity of the Law, that now they are not to be caſt by it for their everlaſting eſtates, then they need to be ſo much the more faithful with God, to do what poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they can to ſerve the Lord in an evangelical way. Thou wert in ſuch a condition, that thou wert under ſuch a Law, as if thou didſt fail in any one point thou wert caſt for ever: but now thou art under ſuch a Law as God accepts of thee in Chriſt, hadſt thou not need be more faithful, and induſtrious in thy endeavors, in that thou haſt received ſo much mercy to be under ſuch a Covenant? The truth is, the other might diſcourage thee to think, that let me do what I can, my Soul is caſt for my everlaſting eſtate, but now if thou beeſt brought under the Covenant of the Goſpel, and the Lord Chriſt hath made thee to know that thy Reſt is in him, how careful ſhouldeſt thou be to walk with him in all well pleaſing? to give up the ſtrength of thy Soul to walk in his waies. I wil appeal to thee, ſuppoſe thou wert in the condition again, that the Lord looked upon thee with a ſtrict Eye, and required ſuch abſolute obedience, that if thou faileſt in any thing, nothing that ever before
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44661:142"/>
thou didſt ſhould be accepted, poor ſoul, if the Lord ſhould ſay to thee, what if thou ſhouldeſt be delivered from this Law, and be brought under the Law of Chriſt? Firſt, that thou ſhalt not depend for thy everlaſting eſtate upon the Law. And Secondly, that whatſoever thou doeſt ſhal be accepted, though with much imperfection, how wouldeſt thou prize this? and even Covenant with God, and ſay, Oh! Lord, bring my ſoul under this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and I hope I ſhal for ever endeavour to walk in al wel peaſing before thee, this ſhal not by any meanes in the world quench my endeavors, and make me more ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh but more ſtrengthen my heart. As ſuppoſe now one ſhould be in ſuch ſlavery under the Turke that let him do what he can, he ſhal be beaten, and a Prince ſhal come and ranſome him, and take him into his owne houſe, and expect no more obedience from him then the obedience of a Child, adopting him for his Child, and al the obedience that he wil expect ſhal be a childlike obedience, and he wil be his father. Now were it not a vild and unnatural thing for ſuch a one to be careleſs of giving contentment to this Prince, that wil accept of him as a Child, when he hath delivered him from ſuch a ſlavery and bondage that he was under before? Thus it was with beleevers, thou wert under a dreadful bondage, under the Law, and thou art brought to Chriſt. and he makes thee to be a child of God, and be procures that thy obedience ſhal be accepted that is filial, and Child-like, ſhalt thou be more negligent now, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? now thou ſerveſt God upon better termes then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before and wilt thou be more ſluggiſh.</p>

                  <head>The Fifth Leſſon.</head>
                  <p>Fifthly, from our being delivered from the Law, we are to Learne this, That we are not to judg our coming into Chriſt, nor to judge our faith by the Law, by our
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44661:143"/>
coming to Chriſt we are delivered from the Law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I ſay) we are not to make up any judgment of our coming to Chriſt, nor to judge our faith by the rules of the Law. Though the propounding of this it may be, is a little obſcure at firſt, yet you wil find it of marvellous uſe to help beleevers in their way, ſome beleevers very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, eſpecially weak ones, judg of their coming to Chriſt, or their faith, by the Law, they make the law a rule of their faith, which certainly ſhould not be, for if by faith we are delivered from the Law, then it muſt needs follow, that the Law cannot be a rule of our faith. You wil ſay, what is that, to make the Law a rule of our faith.</p>
                  <p>That is thus, Beleevers think that becauſe their faith is weak, and ful of doubts, ful of imperfections and doubtings therefore they have none at al. Now what is this but to make faith it ſelf a legal thing, for indeed, if faith were legal, then it could not be accepted where there were any mixture of imperfection, a legal faith could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be accepted with any mixture of doubting, and with any imperfection, But an evangelical faith can be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This I may meet with perhaps afterwards, but for the preſent it follows more fully and immediately from what hath been delivered from our reſt from the Law, and I deſire to ſuggeſt it now to beleevers, as a marvellous help to them, that they do not make their faith legal, as thus. Come to many beleevers that are ful of doubts and feares and why do they not beleeve? It is true, ſay they, there is reſt to be had in Chriſt, and much to be had in this, I but this is to beleevers, and I am afraid I am not a beleever. And why art thou afraid thou art not a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? becauſe of ſuch and ſuch ſins, and becauſe I cannot do as I would. Now what is this but to make faith legal? now faith that delivers us from the Law, of al graces, that muſt be evangelical, our mourning for ſin is to be looked upon as evangelical, and yet ſome beleevers look upon their mourning for ſin as legal, they think God wil
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44661:143"/>
not accept of their mourning Why? Becauſe they cannot mourne as much as they would.</p>
                  <p>That is true if thou wert under the Law, then no mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at al would be accepted as under the Law, but now thou muſt look upon it as evangelical, and thy obedience as evangelical. It is an il thing, that beleevers look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their mourning for ſin, and obedience, and the like, as under the Law, and not as evangelical, this is a great hindrance to them, but now, much more is it to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their faith as legal: As thus, becauſe their faith doth not come up ſo fully to the perfection that they do deſire yea to that perfection that the Law requires in any thing that we tender up to God, For though the Law doth not mention any thing of our beleeving in Chriſt, yet thus much the Law requires, that what we do ſhould be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered up to God, and what we tender up to God, With perfection; Now beleevers looking upon what they tender up to God as imperfect, this makes them to make their faith Legal.</p>

                  <head>The Sixth Leſſon.</head>
                  <p>Sixthly, another Leſſon that beleevers are to learn from the Reſt that they have in Chriſt from the burden of the Law is this, that if they find any way or meanes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the terrors that come by the Law, certainly then they need not be troubled with al the terror that poſſibly can come from any creature, from any men. If thy faith can deliver thee from the terror of the Law, and give reſt to thy ſoul, notwithſtanding al the terrible things in the Law threatned againſt thy ſin, then thy faith may deliver thee much more from the terror of men, for take al the rage and power of al the men in the world, and devils in hel, they are not ſo terrible as the threates of the Law. Now if God hath given thee ſuch a grace into thy heart, as thou by that comeſt to know a way to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee from the terror of the threatning of the Law, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44661:144"/>
to give Reſt unto thy ſoul from that, then thou needſt not be afraid of al terrors from wicked men, do but ſet that grace of thine a work, ſet it in exerciſe upon ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as have given thee Reſt from the Law, and this wil free thee from the terrors of wicked men in the world.

                  <head>The ſeventh Leſſon.</head>
                  <p>Seventhly, Another Leſſon that beleevers are to learn from their deliverance from the law which is of marvelous uſe to them in their life and converſation is this, That cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is the moſt unbecoming thing in the world, to ſee a beleever to be rigorous towards his brethren, Chriſt hath delivered thee from rigor, then wilt thou be rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous? Chriſt hath given thee Reſt, wilt not thou do what thou canſt to give thy brother reſt too? If Chriſt hath delivered thee from great troubles, burdens, and bondage that thou wert under, why ſhouldeſt thou not endeavor with al thy might to deliver thy brother from burdens, troubles, any thing that might grieve thy brother? Oh! what an unworthy thing is it, that a Chriſtian, that hath received ſo much reſt from Chriſt, yet ſhould be a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44661:144"/>
man or woman to his brother or ſiſter? Chriſt doth therefore give Reſt to thee, that thou mayeſt be of a quiet diſpoſition towards others, that thou mayeſt be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful towards others; To ſee one that profeſſes to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the Law, and to have Reſt in Chriſt, to be rigorous to thoſe under him, rigorous to his ſervants, rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to his Children it is miſerable; remember what rigor Chriſt hath delivered thee from, and remember to be quiet ſpirited to thy brother.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows in the next words to my text, <hi>Learn of mee, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhal find reſt unto your ſoules,</hi> I wil give reſt to your ſoules that ſo you may be of a meeke and quiet diſpoſition towards your brethren, but of that when we come to thoſe words that follow; we ſhal then ſpeake of the weakneſs and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs of ſpirit that ſhould be in Chriſtians,</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the reſt from Legal Performances, and the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al waies how this reſt comes from Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are delightful to the ſoul, becauſe Chriſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders God unto the ſoul in a gracious way. <hi>2.</hi> They are not performed as ſatisfactory, but as teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of love and thankfulneſs. <hi>3</hi> Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf offers up the duties to God. <hi>4.</hi> They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from the Law in the heart. <hi>5.</hi> They have the Promiſes joyned with them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw to make ſome entrance into the next thing, which hath great affinity to the other, aad that is the reſt that is in Chriſt from the trouble of ſpirit that there is in many, in regard of <hi>Legal performances,</hi> that you know I opened at large, the great burden that there is in the ſpirits of many people, who have convinced Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and there Conſciences pul and hale them to duty, and they dare not but performe duty, but when they do their duty, their very duties are a burden to them, for they do them, in a legal way. There are many I know that are acquainted with this, it is impoſſible to ſpeak of ſuch a ſubject but that there are divers that know what I meane, though others know not, to be under ſo much power of Conſcience, as not to dare to omit a duty, though the duty be burdenſom to them. There be many that are not under ſo much command of Conſcience, but though conſcience require them to do ſuch a duty, they dare omit the duty, and they are not troubled at it; but but there are others who have not felt the Grace of the Goſpel to ſet their ſouls at liberty, they are under ſo much command of conſcience, that they dare not but do what Conſcience requires, and yet the Lord knows, the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44661:145"/>
duties that they have performed have been girevous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens them, they have gone under the command of their Conſciences as under a grievous burden.</p>
               <p>Now to theſe Chriſt ſpeaks, come ro me and I wil give you reſt, in the beleeving in Chriſt, in the exerciſing of faith in Chriſt there is deliverance from this burden, and many poor ſouls that for many yeares have gone on under this burden, whom the Lord hath opened to them the grace of Chriſt, their hearts have been at liberty, ſo as they have been as conſcientious in performing of duty as before, but now their duty is made the joy and delight of their ſouls, they have gone to them with rejoycing, and made the Commandements of God to be their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the joy of their hearts, and their duties are as ſweet to them as the hony and the hony comb. Now this is the argument that we are upon, that in Chriſt there is reſt from this burden, Chriſt gives ability unto beleevers, thoſe that are his members to performe duties with freedom of ſpirit, and indeed evangelical duties are duties performed with freedom, that is the difference between legal performances and evangelical; one is done as a burden, and the other is done with freedom of ſpirit. Now I ſhal ſhew unto you, how Chriſt gives this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>Where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> you know the ſcripture I ſuppoſe, now this freedom of ſpirit in the performance of duty comes by Chriſt theſe waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when the ſoul is come to Chriſt it hath reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt renders God unto the ſoul in a gracious way Chriſt takes off the terror that was before of God, takes off that from the heart. The reaſon why duties are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as a burden to thoſe that are legal is this, becauſe they tender them up to God, but ſo as they look upon God as a terrible judg, they muſt do what God requires, I, but when they come into his preſence, they come into his preſence as a judg, being very terrible, Now when
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44661:146"/>
the ſoul comes to Chriſt, Chriſt renders God very ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ely unto the ſoul of a Chriſtian, renders God the father as his father, or her father. For ſo Chriſt ſaies, <hi>I go to my father and your father,</hi> to look upon God, not only as a father, but our father, as being the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, So beleevers in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duties, look upon God as a father in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relation. He is my father, he hath begotten me a new to himſelf, and ſo he is my father, he is my father, he hath adopted me to be his child, but he is the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt too, and Chriſt is mine two, ſo that I have an intereſt in the fatherhood, as I may ſo ſpeak, as the father of Chriſt, I go to my father and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>So when beleevers come to tender up any ſervice to God as a duty, they come to God as their father, and as to the father of their redeemer too, now this brings a mighty deale of eaſe unto the heart of a beleever in the performance of duty a great deal of difference there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a fathers calling the child to him, and a rigid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere maſter or judge calling of one to him. When the child heares that his father cals him, he runs, and loves to be in the preſence of his father, but when one ſaith to a ſervant, your maſter calls you; he knows not whether he be called to be beaten with ſtripes or no.</p>
               <p>This is the difference between legal performances, and evangelical, thoſe that are in Chriſt, when Chriſt calls them to duty, you muſt go into the preſence of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and of the father of your bleſſed redeemer, you muſt go to duty in him. Come, go to prayer ſaith Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to one, they cannot but go indeed, but when they go to prayer their heart is ſtruck with feare, terror, and diſcouragement in prayer: but Conſcience ſaith to one that is a beleever, come, you muſt go to prayer, what is that? but come, you muſt go before your father and injoy communion with your father, the father of your redeemer cals you to have communion with him, &amp;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44661:146"/>
how doth your heart ſpring to come into the preſence of ſuch a father! So that Chriſt renders them lovely to his father, and ſo delivers them from the burden that they are under in legal performances.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In Chriſt, beleevers when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uties, they do not tender them up unto God as ſatisfactory for any thing that is paſt, but meerly to be teſtimonies of their love and thankfulneſs for what they have received, now duties are a great deal more eaſily done this way then another. It is true, they wil gather arguments from their former neglect to ſtir them up to do the more, I but, now they are not called upon to their duties to make God amends, and ſatisfy for what is paſt for that would be a burden, for ſuch as performe duties in a legal way, and are not acquainted with the doctrine of the Goſpel, they know not how to ſatisfy God, but only by doing ſo much the more, by how much the more they have neglected heretofore. I have neglected God al the time of my youth, and now conſcience begins to be awakned and tels me I muſt ſerve God, and perform duties, and I had need be more diligent now, that I may make up and ſatisfy for what I have neglected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now when we perform duties in this way, they are very burdenſom, As ſuppoſe a man hath run in debt, and he is ſet up in a trade, I but whatſoever he gets it muſt be to ſatisfy what debts he is run out in before, this muſt make him go on in much heavineſs, he thinks that whatſoever he gets, muſt go to ſatisfy what he hath run into before. But now take another man that hath run into arrerages, and hath a freind, a kinſman, that coms and layes down al the debts that he owed, and gives him a ſtock &amp; ſayes now you are a Freeman once again, go on, &amp; whatever you get ſhal be for your ſelf, this man goes on, a great dealemore livelier then the other: juſt thus it is between the conſciences of thoſe that performe duties in a legal way, and the conſciences of that perform duties in an evangelical way. One that is legal, conſcience tels him
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44661:147"/>
of ſuch arrerages that he hath run into with God, and whatever he can do for time to come is too little to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy for what he hath neglected before, now conſcience puts him upon it, do he muſt, ſerve he muſt, obey he muſt, I but he doth it with no heart at al I work, and I obey, &amp; I do, but whether this wil make up the arrerages for what is paſt, I do not know. Now a beleever performes obedience, but it is upon other termes, Chriſt comes and layes down a price, and diſcharges him of al former arrerages, and puts a ſtock of grace into the heart, and ſays unto him, now live, and imploy this your ſtock in the ſervice of God, and trade with it, get more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and more grace with it, and you ſhal have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and the good of every holy duty that you performe, the good and benefit ſhal come to your ſouls. Now ſuch a ſoul goes unto duties in a cheerful way, and they are no burdens at al to it, becauſe he performes them not for ſatisfaction of any arrerages behind, but now he trades for himſelf, and every day he gets, and gets, and gets for himſelf, that is another way how Chriſt gives reſt unto the ſoul in regard of performance of duties, that they are not burdenſom unto the ſoul as heretofore they have been.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another way of delivering beleevers in the performance of duties as a burden is this. When in the duty that ſuch a one performes Chriſt goes along with them unto the father, and he himſelf tenders them up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the father, and thus they come to be eaſy unto the hearts of beleevers; whereas thoſe that perform duties in a legal way, they go alone unto Gods preſence, without any to go with them. And again when they are there, they muſt tender up al they do themſelves to God, and the truth is, they can have little heart to this, knowing, what God is and how they have offended God and provoked him. As thus, ſuppoſe a malefactor, that hath wronged the king, he muſt go into his preſence and petition, but he hath no body to go with him, and no
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44661:147"/>
body to joyne with him to tender up his petition, but he muſt go himſelf, now he goes with no heart in the world, with no encouragement, indeed, he muſt go, there is no other way to ſave his life, he muſt die elſe, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo alone, and having none to help him, he goes very heavily. But now ſuppoſe another that is to go into the preſence of a King, and the Kings deare and only Son, Shal take him by the hand and ſay, come, I wil go with thee, and what haſt thou here? a petition, come give it me, and I wil preſent it to my father, and I wil get it granted, O! how merrily and cheerfully doth he go into the preſence of the King. Juſt ſo it is between a legal performer of duties, and an evangelical performer of duties, thoſe that performe duties in a legal way, and go into the preſence of God in a legal way, they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, they have no body to go with them to help them, and this muſt needs make them to go very heavily: But a beleever needs never go into Gods preſence alone, it may be you are at prayer alone in your cloſets, but you are not in Gods preſence alone, Chriſt takes you by the hand, and carries you into the preſence of your father, and thoſe poor petitions, and broken prayers that you preſent, Chriſt takes them in his hand, and preſents them to the father, and this the ſoul may ſee by faith, and O! how comfortable is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when duties are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſuch a manner as this, I go to a duty, but Chriſt ſtands by mee, takes al that I have to tender up to the father, and he tenders it up for me.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another way is this, That now al duties that are performed by a beleever, they are performed from the Law that is written in his heart, he is made a Law unto himſelf, there is the ſpirit of Chriſt put into him, that now he doth not performe duty becauſe he muſt do it, but becauſe it is ſuitable unto the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is put into him, for ſo the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>we are partakers of the divine nature,</hi> there is the very ſpirit of Chriſt put into a beleever, and the Law of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44661:148"/>
Chriſt written in his heart, ſo that there is no duty that God requires of him, but the Law of that duty is written in his heart, to do it and according to his meaſure, he can ſay as Chriſt did, <hi>It is written in my heart to do thy wil O! Lord,</hi> what doth the Lord require ſuch and ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be performed and doth my conſcience tel me in the name of God, that ſuch duties are to be done? Lord, this is even written in my heart and therefore Lord, I come, the Lord would have me do this, and it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but what is written in my heart to do. Conſcience tells me I muſt do it, and it is no ſooner told me by my conſcience, but my heart tels me I am ready to do it. Now what a reſt is this in performing of duty, when there is a diſpoſition in the heart of a man or woman to do the duty that God requires of them, they are a Law unto themſelves, there is no duty that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res from them, but if there were neither heaven nor hel, yet they would do it naturally, it is as natural to them to do the wil of God as for a fiſh to drink in water. It is ſaid of wicked ones, that they drink in iniquity as the fiſh doth water, ſin is natural unto the wicked, and grace is likewiſe natural, though not altogether ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for there is nothing in the heart but makes ſin natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. But it is true, when one is a beleever, there is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the heart oppoſite to good, I but there is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the heart that makes it natural for the ſoul to drink in the Commandements of God, as a fiſh drinks in water, and therefore beleevers, ſo ſoon as ever they have any touch of Chriſt, how readily do their hearts come off to duty. As for inſtance, in <hi>Zacheus,</hi> you know how Chriſt came to look upon him, there was a touch of Chriſt upon his heart, and preſently he comes off, and though before he was a covetous man, and there was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs in his heart, and he had got much by forged cavillation yet preſently he ſaith, <hi>Behold the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:44661:148"/>
Now what duty is harder then reſtitution? when a man hath got much by wrong to reſtore it again, as often you have heard, you can have no comfort, al your ſorrows wil do no good, til you have made reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and the ground is plain, becauſe til you make reſtitution you continue in the wrong, you have done wrong to ſuch a man, ſuch a time in his eſtate, wel, you do him wrong to day, and to morrow and the next day til you reſtore, I ſay you continue in your ſin til you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, if you be able to reſtore. Now you cannot ſay a man repents of his ſin, if he continue in his ſin, and you continue in your ſin, though God doth not require you to go and make your ſelf known to them, yet though your perſons be not known to them, the wrong muſt be made known to them, Juſt ſo is the difference between one that is only under the terror of the Law, and one that hath got reſt in Chriſt, the difference is as in a Ship, a Ship that hath one part of it ſticking in the mud and ſands, and the water beating it up and down, and ready to burſt it in peeces, but now if the tide come and fetch it off, And it is got upon the ſtreame, then you may by the touch of a little finger thruſt it this way and that way with eaſe, when it is once upon the water: So it is with a heart before it comes to Chriſt, when it hath only conviction of conſcience, though it have ſome illumination, that is as the water that beats the heart up and down, and it cannot be at quiet, but is ready to be burſt in peeces, I but it ſticks in the mud ſtil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore duties are very hard, and Conſcience doth but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tire the heart, and beate it, and trouble it, I but now when it is come to Chriſt, it ls like the Ship a float upon the water, and now upon any touch of Chriſt it is ready to be put upon this duty, and the other duty, and the motion of the ſoul now is without any danger or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it moves up and down with eaſe, when the heart is got off from it ſelf, and the world, and the creature it moves in the waies of God with aboundance of eaſe,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44661:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſet ſuch a one upon the hardeſt duties you wil, and he goes on with a great deal of eaſe, and quiet and Reſt of ſpirit, he doth not think the Commandements of God hard, doth not look upon the commandements of God now as hard commandements, whereas one that is legal in performing of duty, though he do the duty, he looks upon the comand of God as a hard commandement You have an excellent ſcripture for that in the firſt of <hi>John</hi> 5. and the 3. Speaking of beleevers that when once they come unto Chriſt, the commandements of God are not greivous unto them. <hi>This is the Love of God that we keep his commandements and his commandements are not grievous.</hi> But one that is in Chriſt, a beleever, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any commandement, though it be never ſo greivous and hard to fleſh and blood before they come to Chriſt, as in the commandement of Reſtitution, I wil mention that, I might mention others as to pray in your families, to be conſtant in prayer morning and evening, and to keep your heart conſtant in praier to God, 'its perhaps grievous to thoſe that perform duties in a legal way, but when once the heart comes to God, then the commandement of God is not grievous. I do not ſay, but corruption may now and then prevail and then they are burdenſome, but when the heart hath got grace, the commandements of God are not burdenſome at al, but they are eaſie to the ſoul, for ſo Chriſt ſaith in a few words after my text, <hi>My yoake is eaſie and my burden is Light.</hi> Many people complain of the way of God, Oh! the way of God is ſo hard, and duty ſo ſtrict, to live ſo exactly, who is able to do this? I confeſs in the way you are in it is tedious and hard, but if you had the ſpirit of Chriſt, and were come to Chriſt, thoſe duties that you account now hard, would be eaſie, you would never have more comfort, more eaſe and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, then when you are performing of duty. You wil think this a riddle, to ſay, that the ſoul ſhould never have more eaſe, reſt, quiet, and comfort then when a man walks more ſtrictly and exactly, and keeps to the rule. Now

ſaith a carnal heart, this is a miſerable bondage, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters cal for ſtrictneſs, what a bondage and wearineſs is this, as they in <hi>Malachy</hi> ſay, now you think this ſo, Why? becauſe you are but legal al this while, and if you did performe duties ſtil in that way, they would be a burden to you, but you miſtake in this, you think there is no way to keep Gods Commandements, but in a Legal way, I but know this, there is an evangelical way to keep Gods Commandements, Gods Law, and that makes every duty to be eaſie and light un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o the Soul· You think there is no ſuch quiet and content of heart, as to be at liberty, and to ſatisfie the fleſh, and have your minds fully pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but were you acquainted with the miſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you would find, that thoſe things that now are ſo eaſie, and give you ſo much quiet and comfort, would be the moſt troubleſome things in the world &amp; the ſtrictneſs of Gods wayes that you think ſo burdenſome, you would find to be the moſt eaſie and comfortable things in the world. And therefore let not the Devil ſteal you away from the ſtrictneſs of Gods wayes by this deluſion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he doth but delude you, O! that ye had but the ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus in you; and that you were come to Chriſt, you would find then eaſe in the moſt ſtrict and difficult duties in the world, you would find your ſouls to be at eaſe in the performance of them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Duties are not burdenſome unto thoſe that are come to Chriſt, becauſe that in Chriſt al duties have joyned together with them the promiſes; when duties are performed in an evangelical way, when the ſoul is come to Chriſt then it looks upon evey duty that God requires, as having ſome promiſe annexed unto the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to inable the ſoul to do what God would have it do, and by this it hath now Reſt in performance of it. Doth God require ſuch and ſuch things of me, then the ſoul doth not only look upon the commandement, but how a promiſe goes along with the commandement. As how, I might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ance in divers ſcriptures, how promiſes
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44661:150"/>
go along with commandements, I wil give you but the comparing of one ſcripture for the preſent. Compare the 10. of <hi>Deuter.</hi> with the 30. of <hi>Deuter.</hi> In <hi>Duter.</hi> 10.12. there you ſhal find it thus. <hi>And now O Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God, require of thee, but to feare the Lord thy God, to walk in al his waies, and to Love him, and to ſerve the Lord thy God with al thy heart and with all thy ſoul, to keep the commandements of the Lord thy God, and his ſtatutes which I command thee this day for thy good.</hi> Then at the 16. verſe, <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more ſtifnecked.</hi> Here you ſee what God requires, they are great things that God requires, that we ſhould feare the Lord, and walk in his wayes, and love him, and ſerve him with al our heart, and keep his commandements and ſtatutes, and circumciſe our hearts, and the like, theſe are hard duties, being performed in a legal way. But now, when the ſoul is in Chriſt, ſee what a promiſe the ſoul finds together with theſe commandements, In the 30. of <hi>Deu.</hi> and the 6. <hi>The Lord thy God wil circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with al thy heart, and with al thy ſoul that thou mayeſt live.</hi> Here God requires them to circumciſe their hearts, that they might love him, and feare him, and keep his commandements but that is the Law, were there no more it would be a very heavy burden, for a poor ſoul to have this ly upon it, that I muſt love the Lord with al my heart and with al my might, the Lord knows what diſtractions I have in my ſoul, and in my heart, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires me to cercumciſe my heart, I am not able to do it. but now mark how the Goſpel runs, in the <hi>Deu.</hi> 30.6. <hi>And the Lord thy God wil circumciſe thy heart, &amp; the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with al thy heart and with al thy ſoul that thou maiſt live·</hi> The Lord wil do it, the Lord commands me to do it, and yet withal the Lord ſaith that he wil do it. I might inſtance in a great many other particulars, that the Lord requires firſt what
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44661:150"/>
we ſhould do, and if we be left here, now it is hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but then if we can find a promiſe where God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that he wil do it for us, this wil be eaſier to us. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is the diffierence between the Law and the Goſpel, the Law commands us what to do, and gives no ſtrength, but the Goſpel never commands us to do any duty, but there is a promiſe that engageth the Lord to help the ſoul in the performance of that duty. And now, is not here reſt for the ſoul? when the ſoul ſhal look upon the large extent of the duty that the Law of God requires of it: The Law requires of me to love the Lord with al my heart, and with al my ſoul, and with al my might, and to keep his commandements and ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and to circumciſe my heart, Lord! what ſhal I do in this? Now then when the ſoul can look upon Chriſt, &amp; the covenant of grace, &amp; conſider, that that runs thus that the Lord wil circumciſe my heart, that I may love the lord with al my heart, &amp; with al my ſoul &amp; that I may keep his commandements &amp; his ſtatutes, that God doth as wel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf to inable me to do the duty, as he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me to do the duty, now here is reſt unto the ſoule.</p>
               <p>I wil conclude this particular with this one ſimilitude, as it is with the body, Phyſitians obſerve, that together with every veine where the blood runs, there runs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an artery together with the veine, now the artery is the vehiculum of the ſpirits that are in the body of a man, that puts livelineſs and quickneſs into the body: So for al the world thus it is in regard of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the Law and the Promiſes of the Goſpel. I compare the Commandements of the Law unto the veines, they are theſe duties required of thee in the whol courſe of thy life, but if thou haſt veines of blood, and haſt no arteries, no ſpirit, thou wilt be but dul, though the blood be ful in the veins, yet there wil be little ſtrength. But now there is the ſpirit that goes along in the arteries that gives life to the veines. So now, they that are under the Law they know many duties that they ought to do, I but except they have the promiſes of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44661:151"/>
Goſpel, to goe along with them, they have little life, little activity to do the duty. Therefore Chriſtians, when you heare any duty out of Gods word that you ought to performe, conſider, here is the duty, here is the veine, I but where is the artery, there is a promiſe in the word that goes along with the duty to inable me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the duty. Now if I take both together I may go on in the way of Godlineſs with a great deal of eaſe and quiet, and no duty needs to be troubleſom to me. The want of the knowledg of this one thing makes the lives of many people to be very diſconſolate, and makes them go on deadly and dully in the performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereas if they would make uſe of this one thing, when they are put upon any duty to ſearch and find out in the word the promiſe wherein God inables us to do the duty, and plead the promiſe, and ſay, Lord, thou requireſt the performance of this duty, but thou haſt promiſed to inable me to do it, I ſay, if thou wouldſt do thus, thou wouldeſt find that thy duties would not be burdenſom to thee, but thou wouldeſt ſay, wel, I ſee my ſoul hath reſt in Chriſt in the performance of al thoſe ſervices that heretofore have been very greivous and burdenſom to me.</p>
               <p>Object, I But you wil ſay, <hi>We have many promiſes in the Goſpel to inable us, but the promiſes are conditional, and I may forfeit the promiſe by not performing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, We have in the Goſpel, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſes, as wel as conditional promiſes: there is ſome promiſes that depend upon no condition at al but only beleeving, as that promiſe where the Lord ſaith, <hi>I wil take away the heart of ſtone and give a heart of fleſh,</hi> what condition is there? does God ſay, that if you firſt repent, and performe ſuch and ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that I require of you, then I wil take away your
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44661:151"/>
heart of ſtone? No that is an abſolute promiſe. And ſo likewiſe that promiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>I wil put my feare into your heart, that you ſhal not depart from me</hi>: God doth not make this promiſe with condition. You wil ſay, Why then hath not al their ſtony hearts been taken from them becauſe the promiſe is abſolute? I anſwer, it is abſolute from any precedent condition, but yet God would have us come to the promiſe, and cloſe with the promiſes and caſt our ſouls upon it, he does not promiſe to do ſuch and ſuch things upon condition, that if you wil do ſuch and ſuch things before, then I wil do this and that for you: no, but only this, do you caſt your ſoul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promiſe and depend upon it: and when thy ſoul is at a loſs in regard of conditional promiſes, when thy heart miſgives thee, and tells thee, that thou haſt not performed the condition of ſuch &amp; ſuch promiſes, &amp; that therfore they do not belong to thee and thou canſt not for the preſent have comfort in the conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, then make uſe of abſolute promiſes, and caſt thy ſoul upon them, and they wil bring in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal promiſes; and know this, that al conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes depend upon abſolute promiſes in the Goſpel: and as when thou canſt not make uſe of conditional promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thou maiſt go to abſolute promiſes; ſo when thou makeſt uſe of abſolute promiſes, thou ſhalt be inabled to do what is required of thee in conditional promiſes. And here is the difference between the Law and the Goſpel; the Law requires, and doth not give ſtrength to inable to do what it requires, but the Goſpel requires, and gives ſtrength to performe what it requires.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, There is reſt unto thoſe that come to Chriſt in this, becauſe when they performe duties in Chriſt, they do not performe them that they might have life or that they might have pardon, that they might get life by them or that they might obtain pardon by their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but they performe them now as the fruit of their
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44661:152"/>
life, and as a fruit of their pardon, and this is a great deale of reſt and eaſe to the heart, in the performance of duties. There are many poor troubled ſouls, whoſe conſciences pul them on to duty, but why do they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them? becauſe conſcience accuſeth them for their ſins, and they know what need they have of Gods mercy, they ſtand guilty before God, and therefore they perform duties that they might get a pardon, and they know that they were made for eternity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make conſcience of duties that they might get eternal life by them, as I when I opened ſhewed the burden that there was in legal performances. But now when the ſoul comes to Chriſt it hath reſt in this, for the very firſt thing that is done in Chriſt is that al thy ſins are diſcharged, the pardon is granted, and thou art put into an eſtate ſafe for thy eternal life, and al the hazard of eternal life is now over. Now then, that that is required of thee, is only as the fruit of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of thy ſin, and as a fruit of thy ſafe condition that thou art put into for thine eternal life, and here is a great deal of difference, between performing of duties that I might have pardon, that I might get eternal life by it, and performing of duties as a fruit of my pardon, and as a fruit of the aſſurance of my wel being to al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. As for inſtance, a man that is in danger of his life, ſtands before the judg, and there is no way for pardon for him, but he hath his book given to him, as you know the way is to have the benefit of the Clergy (as we uſe to cal it) now when he knows if he reads he ſhal have his life, but life lies upon it, and the judg is ſtrict, and ſets one by him, that the ordinary ſhal not prompt him, and he wil have him read out: and his life lyes upon it. I ſuppoſe you have heard of ſome that were able ſchollers, and able to reade wel enough at other times, yet at ſuch a time were not able to read one word for a world. But ſuppoſe this man now have his pardon, and you then put him to read, then he can read with delight, he hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44661:152"/>
enough now to read, his eyes that were bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are looſned. Now ſuppoſe he were to read a Pſalm of mercy before he had his pardon, and when he had his pardon there is a Pſalm of thankfulneſs for his life given him to read, he could read it then with delight, juſt thus it is with thoſe that performe duties in a legal way, they ſtand before God as their judg, and look upon what they performe as that which their ſouls depends u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, that if I do not do ſuch and ſuch things that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me, my ſoul lyes upon it, alas this ſtraitens the heart, and it is put into a condition of feare. But now when the ſoul is come to Chriſt, and the Lord hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pardon to it and hath quieted it by the blood of his ſon, now ſayes God, read, performe duties, and let al the duties you performe be in way of bleſſing my name, and praiſing of me, for giving of you your lives. And indeed, this is the principal ground of al that God requires of ſuch as are come to Chriſt, meerly that thou ſhouldeſt go out before the Lord in way of thankfulneſs for pardoning thy ſins, and accepting of thee in his Son. And ſo likewiſe if ſo be a man were amongſt his enemies, and ſhould be ſet to do ſome work and buſineſs, and is ſet ſo to it, that if he do not do it, he is a dead man, they wil have his life if he doe not do it, alas, he goes about it with a great deal of dread and fear. But now, if this man ſhould come home to his fathers houſe, and his father ſets him about a work, and he doth it ſo, that though he would not do the work, yet he ſhould not looſe his life, he ſhould go about it with a great deal more freedom of ſpirit. Thus it is with beleevers when they come to Chriſt, they come to their fathers houſe, and their father ſets them about workes, but ſo as he wil not lay their lives upon it, their ſoul doth not ly upon their duties, thy eternal eſtate doth not lie upon duties; as heretofore you have heard in being freed from the Law, ſo now make uſe of it in deliverance from legal performances. That the Lord though he wil be ſtrict to mark what is done in every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44661:153"/>
he wil not be ſtrict to take advantage of thee. It is true, it is ſaid that the Lord ſpared not his owne ſon, but he wil ſpare thee. In <hi>Malachy</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Lord wil ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own ſon hat ſerveth him.</hi> And ſo in the <hi>Romans</hi> it is ſaid <hi>God did not ſpare his own ſon,</hi> and yet in <hi>Malachy</hi> that he wil ſpare thee as a man ſpareth his only ſon that ſerveth him. What ſhould be the meaning of this? That God ſhould not ſpare his only begotten ſon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he wil not ſpare him, but thee? This is the reaſon, he did not ſpare him that he might Spare thee, here is the reaſon why God wil ſo ſpare thee in the performance of thy duties, becauſe he would not ſpare his ſon, he was ſo exact to him that he might not be ſo exact to thee.</p>
               <p>Indeed when Chriſt came to performe duties, the life of al the world, lay upon that, that if Chriſt had failed in one thing, the life of al the world lay upon it, yet ſo they lay upon him, that they were not grievous to him, becauſe he was moſt able to perform it: But thou muſt make uſe of Chriſts performances in way of obedience ſo as to give thee reſt &amp; eaſe in performance of thy duties, think thus, I come now to performe duties, and thankes be to God, my life, my eternal eſtate, lyes not upon it, but Chriſt what he performed my ſoul, and al the world lay uyon what he did, and the weight that Chriſt was willing to take upon him in his obedience, is that which makes any obedience ſo eaſie and comfortable to me. I remember we read in the Law, that in peace offerings, a female was accepted: in other caſes ordinarily God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the male, but in peace offerings, the female; now peace offerings was for thankſgiving, and indeed the whole life of a Chriſtian is nothing elſe but a peace-offering, his whol converſation, al the duties that God requires of any chriſtian it is nothing elſe but a peace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, to offer an offering of thanks-giving for the mercy he hath received from Chriſt, in this peace offering the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44661:153"/>
Lord accepts of a female, though it be but weake, And this is the ſixth thing wherein the reſt of the ſoul in the performance of holy duties, when it is once come to Chriſt doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, As the ſoul doth not performe duties that it might get life thereby, it is not in that way now, ſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duties when the ſoul is come to Chriſt, is a part of eternal life it ſelf, and therefore there is reſt in it, it is ſo far from getting eternal life by it, as it is rather eternal life, it ſelf, then ſo much as any way to eternal life, for this may be ſaid, though I performe duty, it is true, God hath taught me ſo much, that now under the Goſpel we muſt not think to get eternal life by our duty, by our works, this is popery, yet it is the way to eternal life the way that tends to it, it is, <hi>via ad Regnum,</hi> the way to the kingdom, though not the cauſe of Raigning. Nay, I wil ſhew you a further thing then ſo, the wayes of obedience and holineſs in a Chriſtians courſe, they are rather eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life it ſelf, then the way to it, they have more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in them then being the way to life. It is true, it were a great deal of eaſe and reſt to ones ſpirit, to conſider of holy duties but as the way to heaven, if a man were going a journy, and knew the ende of his journy ſhould be very glorious to him, if it were to receive a crown, a kingdom, though it were a boyſterous day, and ſtormy weather, and the way were very foul, he would not be troubled at it, but he would account it very comfortable, to know that he is in the right way, for he thinks this wil lead me to my journeys end, and when I come there, that wil make amends for al. And the truth is, there were eaſe and reſt enough in the waies of God, if God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale no more unto a ſoul then this, theſe are the wayes that lead thee to life and ſalvation, that lead thee to a kingdom, to glory; eſpecially conſidering that before we were out of the way, we were wandering in the wayes of death and deſtruction, and God by his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand hath brought us into the right way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:44661:154"/>When a man is going a Journy of great conſequence, and he is gone out of the way, and God by his providence hath brought him into his right way, O! what eaſe is in his ſpirit: Before, when he was out of the way, what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and diſquietneſs of heart, but now when he comes into the way, Oh! what eaſe and quiet is in his ſpirit, ſo I ſay, this were eaſe and reſt enough of ſpirit to know, that whereas before the ſoul was wandering in the path of death, now it is in the path of life. But I tel you further then ſo, that when thou art performing of holy duties, and exerciſing of the grace of God; in the performance of thoſe duties, thou art not only in the way of eternal life, but thou art in eternal life it ſelf, not only in the way to the kingdom, but in the kingdom, not only in the way to heaven, but in heaven, it is eternal life, <hi>This is eternal life to know thee the true God, and thy ſon whom thou haſt ſent into the world.</hi> And that place in the Epiſtle of St. <hi>John</hi> he ſpeakes of a murderer, one that did hate his brother, in the firſt of <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hateth his brother, is a murderer, and you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</hi> Then it appeares, that one that loves his brother, and is Godly and gracious, hath eternal life abiding in him, for that muſt needs follow, if this be the evil condition of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, that hates his brother, that he hath not eternal life abiding in him, then by the rule of contraries, it muſt needs be a truth, that he that hath holineſs and loves his brother, he hath eternal life, abiding in him, and therefore ſuch a one he hath eternal life already to come downe to him, &amp; he is in heaven already. So the ſcripture makes grace but the beginning of glory, it is no other but the very beginning of heaven in the ſoul. And therefore in that golden chain in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom God hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated them he alſo hath called &amp; whom he hath called them he hath juſtified, &amp; whom he hath juſtified them he hath alſo glorified.</hi> Marke but where is the link of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44661:154"/>
It is not, whom he hath predeſtinated he hath called, and whom he hath called he hath ſanctified, and whom he hath ſanctified he hath glorified. One would have thought the chain ſhould have gon along in that linke, but there is no mention of ſanctification, Why? becauſe ſanctification is nothing elſe but glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation begun, and glorification is nothing elſe but the perfecting of ſanctification. Now I beſeech you obſerve this as a moſt ſpecial thing that belongs to a Chriſtian, the beſt duties that we performe are nothing elſe but the life of heaven to us, nay the truth is, it is the life of God. And therefore it is ſaid of ungodly men before they come to Chriſt, they are <hi>ſtrangers to the life of God,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thou art come to Chriſt, thou haſt the life of God in thee, and the life of heaven in thee, and the beginning of Glory, Glory and eternal life thou doeſt live whilſt thou art in performance of holy duties. What is the happineſs of heaven, but for the Saints and Angels to be exerciſed in magnifying the riches of God, and of Chriſt? now thou beginneſt it here, and therefore if thou knoweſt what this is, thou art not, I ſay, to look upon any duty that thou performeſt meerly as a duty but thou art to look upon it as a priviledg, yea as part of thy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. That is a certain truth, that Gods work, it is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the improving of that principle would help us very much in our Chriſtian courſe, if thou didſt live and account every duty that thou performeſt to God to be wages, Oh! with what ſweetneſs wouldeſt thou go on in the performance of thoſe duties that God requires of thee, thou art receiving thy wages when thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of duties. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and the laſt. <hi>The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> At the 22. verſe it is thus. <hi>But now being freed from ſin and become ſervants unto God, you have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting life. For the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> You have your fruit unto holineſs, it is the fruite unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:44661:155"/>
which is the gift of God, and holineſs it is nothing elſe but the gift of God, and the beginning of eternal life, the fulneſs of eternal life, that indeed is the end of it, but the fruit that you have for the preſent it is holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that holyneſs that is the gift of God, it is the beginning of eternal life here in this world. Then indeed is a chriſtian wel improved in Evangelical obedience, when he doth account duties to be mercies, and when mercies are turned into duties, as when we turne Gods mercies into duties, that is an argument we receive Gods mercies from a Covenant of grace, and there wil be linkes of Gods mercies towards us, ſo when we account our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be mercies, that is an argument there is evangelical obedience in the heart, and there wil be a conſtancy in the heart in performing of them. Thoſe that performe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in an Evangelical way, they look upon them as a golden chain about their necks for ornament, and not as a chain about their necks as bonds and Fetters to tie them to them. Here is the difference between one that performes duties in a legal way, and one that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes duties in an Evangelical way; One that performes duties in a Legal way, he lookes upon duties as bonds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, he is bound to them as with a chain; but the other that performes duties in an Evangelical way, his duties are as ornaments, as chains of Gold about his neck. And the ground of this ſimilitude, I have in <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.22. <hi>My ſon keep ſound wiſdom and diſcretion, ſo ſhal they be life unto thy ſoul, and grace unto thy neck.</hi> The wayes of wisdome, that is the wayes of Godlyneſs, they are life to the Godly, and they are a grace to the neck, that is, they carry Gods commandments about with them, not as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner carries his chaines, but as one that carries a chain about his neck, and he glories in it. That place is very obſervable likewiſe for this, that you have in <hi>Deuter.</hi> 33. comparing ver. 2. with the words that follow after. Verſe the ſecond, The Law of God is called a fiery Law. <hi>From his right hand went a fiery Law for them.</hi> But marke verſe 4. <hi>Moſes commanded us a Law, even the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44661:155"/>
of the congregation of Jacob.</hi> From hence this note plainly reſults, that let there be never ſo much ſeeming ſeverity in any Law of God, in any commandement that requires duty, yet even this commandement of God is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an inheritance unto the ſoules of the Saints of God, to be as the joy of their hearts, they account their riches to be in Gods commandements, not only to be in heaven, but the very commandement they account their riches, and their happineſs. Many men and women take upon them the commandements of God, and the duties of obedience, as neceſſary burdens, they muſt do them, I but the Saints, thoſe that come to Chriſt, they take the commandement of God upon them, as that wherein their riches, their glory, the joy of their heart doth conſiſt, and therefore how often do you heare of <hi>David</hi> ſaying, that the commandements of God were ſweeter to him then hony and the hony combe. That they were more delightful to him then gold and riches. And ſo in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> Better then Rubies and precious ſtones. He doth not ſay, the glory of heaven is better then al theſe, but the way of Wiſdom, and the commandements of God are better then al theſe, So that here is the life of a Chriſtian, he performes duties not onely as a way to heaven, but as an injoying of heaven while he is ſerving of God; and this is the ſeventh particular, wherein the reſt of the ſoul in Chriſt doth appear, in the performance of holy duties.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, When a Chriſtian is brought to Chriſt, Chriſt gives him reſt in the performance of holy duties becauſe that Chriſt doth elevate and raiſe his ſpirit to be ſome way proportionable to whatſoever God requires of him, ther's an elevation of ſpirit, a ſtrengthening of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Chriſt to come to ſome kind of proportionableneſs to what the Law of God requires of them. It is true, ſet a poor weake man, a ſick man about any hard worke, and Oh! how tedious is it unto him, for a ſick man, to go
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44661:156"/>
and carry ſuch a burden, or to do ſuch a hard work, it is very irkſome unto him, but now when this man comes to be healthy and ſtrong, to have his veines ful of blood, and his arteries ful of ſpirits, now he goes along in his work and accounts it no burden at al, becauſe he hath got ſtrength in him. So the commandements of God they are hard to thoſe that performe them in a natural way, from a natural conſcience, notwithſtanding al the ſtrength that can come in by a natural conſcience, the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are very hard unto them; but when once the ſpirit of Chriſt comes, there is ſtrength. As it is ſaid <hi>where the ſpirit of Chriſt is there is Liberty,</hi> ſo where the ſpirit of Chriſt is there is ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>Two other wayes whereby the former point is cleered, with ſome conſequences from the ſame and the uſe of the whol. The Firſt way is, that whilſt the ſoul is performing duty, the ſtrength of it is continually renewed. Secondly, The ſoul hath the love of God ſhed abroad into the heart. The firſt Conſequence is happineſs of a Chriſtian here. Secondly, Hence cometh the perſeverance of beleevers. The uſe of al is to exerciſe much faith in Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Ninthly, The Reſt that the ſoul hath in Chriſt, that is to goe on in duties with freedom of ſpirit, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them burdenſome to it is this; when the ſoul comes to Chriſt, it hath not only ſtrength to do the duty, but whilſt it is performing of duty it hath this ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and it receives in ſweetneſs, and good, and ſtrength from Chriſt, while it is in action, while it is in the performance of duty, and his duty is very eaſy, ſweet, and comfortable unto him. As thus, if a man be doing a work that is hard, ſuppoſe he layes on upon a knotty piece of timber, and there is nothing comes of his work, and it doth not go on before him, and he ſpends his ſtrength and gets nothing for the preſent by his worke, he quickly grows weary. But now if a man be doing a work that the more ſtrength he ſpends, the more he gets, the more his ſtrength is inlarged, the more renewed, and never gets more ſtrength, then when he is ſpending of ſtrength, and that when he is at work he receives in ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44661:157"/>
by it, ſurely this man wil go on in the work, he may work ſinging, when al the while he is working, he ſpends not ſo much ſtrength as he gets, and he doth not only work to receive wages, but there is commings in, ſweetneſs comming in the very time of his work, this man works with a great deale of eaſe. Thus it is in Evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; when a ſoul comes to performe duties in this way, now his ſtrength is renewed day by day, the more ſervice thou doſt for Chriſt, the more ſtrength comes in. As now a man that is benummed with cold, perhaps you that are marriners, when you come to handle your cables, or any thing in the ſhip, you can ſcarce feel any ſtrength by reaſon of cold, but when you are at work, and you begin to be warme, your ſtrength comes in. So it is with a Chriſtian, when he begins to perform duties, it may be he is dul, dead, and the like, but let him go on in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and then ſtrength wil come in. I appeale to many of you that have performed duties, you have gone to do a duty, and you have been dul, and unfit for it, and you have been ready to let it alone thereupon, wel but conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence puts you upon it, and you muſt do it, now when you were in the duty, hath not Chriſt come in and hath not the ſtrength of Chriſt come in to inable you to do the duty that you never could imagine it, which for ever might be an incouragement to you to go on in the duty, and to avoid that temptation, never to neglect the duty from any unfitneſs to the duty, for when you are at the duty, then comes in ſtrength from Chriſt to performe the duty, for you cannot expect ſtrength to come in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you come to the duty, but up and be doing, and then ſtrength wil come in. Yea, and the more duty you do, the more ſtrength wil come in; and hence it is, that a Godly man, though he may be weary in duty, yet he can never be weary in doing of duty, he may ſee a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between himſelf and carnal men. Take a Godly man, though he may be weary in duty, yet he can never be weary of duty, whereas it is otherwiſe with thoſe that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:44661:157"/>
performe duties in the ſtrength of a natural conſcience, thoſe that perform duties in the ſtrength of a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are weary in working, As ſome tools you know wil weare in the uſing, but others the more you uſe them the more brighter and better they wil grow: So it is with thoſe that perform duties in the ſtrength of a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they wil wear away, and that is the reaſon that they leave them off, but one that performes duties in an Evangelical way, the more he doth the more he ſhal be able to do, and therefore Chriſtians, let that be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to you, the more you do, the more you ſhal be inabled to do, he that had five talents and uſed thoſe five talents he had more talents given him, and he that had but one, and ſate down ſullen and uſed it not, it was taken from him; and as ſtrength comes in ſo thou ſhalt ſuck in a great deal of ſweetneſs into thy heart. <hi>In the keeping of thy commandements</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) there is great reward</hi> not only <hi>for</hi> the keeping of them, but <hi>in</hi> the keeping of thy commandements. Now when a man is working, if ſo be he had his wages comming in every houre when he is a working, it would incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him, but if he thinks he muſt ſtay for his wages that is more greivous, the work that is done with preſent ſweetneſs comming in, that work is an eaſy work, and that is the reaſon of that expreſſion In <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 10. verſ. 11. <hi>Ephraim is as a heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corne, but I paſſed upon her faire neck, I wil make</hi> Ephraim <hi>to ride,</hi> Judah <hi>ſhal plow, and</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhal break his clods.</hi> The text ſeemes to be hard at the firſt reading, but there is much in it, ſuitable to what I am ſpeaking of <hi>Ephraim</hi> is as a heifer that is taught and loveth to tread out the corne, but ſaith God, I wil make <hi>Ephraim</hi> to ride, <hi>Judah</hi> ſhal plow, and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhal break his clods. I wil make <hi>Ephraim</hi> not only to tread out the corne, but to plow. The meaning was this, you know that was the law, <hi>you muſt not muzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44661:158"/>
corne.</hi> whereas we threſh the corne, they had their oxen to tread out the corne, and it was the law, that al the while he was treading out the corne, his mouth muſt not be muzled, but he might feed al the while he was treading out the corne, now this was eaſier then when the beaſt was ſent to plow, and had no corn to eate the while. Now ſaith God, <hi>Ephraim</hi> loves only eaſy work, if he may have the work that is ſweet for the preſent, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is content with that work, but <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> doth not love the work that is difficult at firſt and ſweet afterwards, So this ſhewes that one that is of a lazy diſpoſition, he loves the work that hath ſweetneſs at the preſent. Now truly, there is no other work that the Goſpel requires at our hands, the Goſpel doth not require ſo much plowing, as the work of treading out the corne Al the work that the Goſpel requires of beleevers, is ſuch as the heifer had while he was treading out the corne, that is, al the while thou art working, thou maiſt be eating, thou maiſt have the bleſſed ſheaues of the Goſpel to feed upon, for there doth come a conſtant ſweetneſs into the hearts of the faithful in doing the work of the Lord, go on in doing the work of the Lord, and thou ſhalt find reſt and ſweetneſs in thy ſoul comming in upon thee.</p>
               <p>And that is the reaſon that Schollars can ſtudy ſo hard, many houres together, which would be tedious unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I put it to you that are imployed in other things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that think the work of a ſchollar ſo eaſy a work, get up in a morning, and ſhut your ſelves into your cloſet, and read, meditate, and write for two or three houres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then come forth and go to it again, and ſpend half a day, or a whole day together in ſtudying, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp; writing, and ſee if you do not find it more tedious and tireſome to the fleſh, then any other work. But now Schollars though it is tireſome to the fleſh, they can go on and make it eaſy to them, why? becauſe they find ſweetneſs in their work, it is not with them as with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:44661:158"/>
men, other men work that they may have wages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, but al the while they are about their work, they have truths come in, and heavenly notions comes in to them, while they are about it, and ſo makes the work eaſy unto them, this is happineſs of a Chriſtian that the while he is in his work, the ſun of righteouſneſs ſhines u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, and there is ſweetneſs comming in unto him, and herein is reſt and eaſe in the performance of duty.</p>
               <p>Tenthly and laſtly, When the ſoul comes to Chriſt, it finds abundance of reſt in holy duties, becauſe now it hath the love of God ſhed abroad in its heart, and that makes every thing delightful to it, the love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart, you know <hi>Jacob,</hi> becauſe he loved <hi>Rachel,</hi> though he was abroad in froſty nights, he accounted it nothing, becauſe he loved <hi>Rachel</hi>: Oh! when the love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart of a Chriſtian, then there is nothing that he doth but is delightful to him it makes every thing eaſy. For that is a certain rule, that love is aſhamed to mention any difficulty, you never hear love to complain of any thing to be heard, and thoſe that complain of holy duties to be heard, certainly they want the love of God. Now you have heard in theſe ten particulars, wherein the eaſe and reſt of ſpirit in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of holy duties doth appeare, there is much more to be ſaid in the latter end of the Chapter, when it is ſaid that Chriſts yoke is eaſy, and his burden light, which if God give opportunity we ſhal come unto.</p>

                  <p>Now from al this, firſt, here you may ſee the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Chriſtian, you do not think that a Criſtian is happy here, but he ſhal not have only heaven hereafter, but his way to happineſs is heaven here, Oh how good is the way of the Goſpel, that gives us reſt in our way to heaven, ſuch reſt that al the malice in the world and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="2">II. Hence we ſee the reaſon, why true beleevers do
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:44661:159"/>
perſevere, you hear oftentimes ſpeaking of the doctrine of perſeverance, &amp; you are ready to thinke, I but is it certain the ſoul that once comes to have true Grace ſhal cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly perſevere? yes, certainly, one that is once come to Chriſt, wil not go from him again, why? becauſe there is ſo much reſt in holy duties. It is true, thoſe that are drawn to holy duties they wil not abide, as it is ſaid, <hi>The ſon abides in the houſe but a ſervant abides not alwaies in the houſe.</hi> So, ſuch as perform duties in a legal way, they wil be gone, they wil not abide, but now one that is come into Chriſt and hath a ſon-like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he continues. As we ſay in phyloſophy, no violent thing or motion is perpetual, and indeed, thoſe that performe duties in a legal way, a hundred to one, but they wil prove Apoſtates at laſt, but one that performes duties in an Evangelical way, wil continue and hold out unto the end.</p>
                  <p n="3">III The maine uſe of al is to ſtirr up the hearts of thoſe that are Godly to know what the Goſpel means, to exerciſe much faith in Chriſt that they might have much comfort in performance of duties. Do not content thy ſelf that thou doeſt duty, but think with thy ſelf, Oh I have heard of ſuch a way, that Chriſtians in performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of duty find a great deale of reſt and eaſe, why ſhould not I get that way. Thou heareſt of it, Oh! that thy ſoul might be unquiet til thou comeſt to underſtand the way, then your duties would be more ſound, more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, more ſupernatural, more acceptable then they are. The Lord loves a cheerful giver and ſo he loves a cheerful ſerver, you love to heare your ſervants ſing at their work, but if you ſet your child or ſervant about a work, and he goes heavily and dully about is, grumbling and pineing, and think you to be a hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, then he doth but a little work, ſo they that perform duties in a legal way, the truth is, they perform little duty, and that is not acceptable, but when a ſoul comes
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:44661:159"/>
to find reſt in duty, it makes it more ſpirituall more plentiful, and more acceptable, and thoſe duties are very pleaſing unto the Lord.</p>

We are not now to ſpeak of the reſt in deliverance from the trouble of ſoul in the ſenſe of the guilt of ſin, that was before ſpoke of, but now we are to ſpeak of the reſt, in giving power againſt the remainder of corruption that there is in the heart. This reſt is the reſt of Sanctification that here we are to ſpeak of, I wil give you reſt. And in this point there are a great many of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:44661:160"/>
uſeful and ſweet things, that might require very large handling, but I ſhal endeavor as much as I can to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract al within a few things for this reſt of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>There are in it theſe five things to be followed, that ye may ſee cleerly the method that I ſhal proceed in, and ſo go along with me.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>I ſhal ſhew you, that Sanctification is a great reſt to the ſoul, or deliverance from corruption, is a great reſt to the heart of a beleever, there is much reſt in Sanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That this reſt it is in Chriſt, al our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and helping againſt corruption is in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>How Chriſt comes to be this reſt unto the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Some conſequences that wil follow from this conſideration of Chriſts being the reſt of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Conclude with exhortation to come unto Chriſt for this reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Sanctification the Reſt from Corruption.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. Sanctification is great reſt unto the ſoul of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, the truth is, there is nothing troubles the heart of a ſtrong beleever, but only the want of his Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, nothing in the world I ſay troubles the heart of a ſtrong beleever but that. It is time, a weak beleever is troubled for want of the apprehenſion of the pardon of his ſin, a weak beleever hath trouble of ſpirit ſtil in the ſenſe of the guilt of ſin, but a ſtrong beleever gets
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:44661:160"/>
over that. A weak beleever hath trouble by the Law ſtil, becauſe through the weakneſs of his faith, he is not able to make uſe of the Covenant of grace that God hath brought him into, ſo as to deliver himſelf from trouble that way, a ſtrong beleever gets over that. A weak beleever performes duties, but there is a great deale of legality in his performance of them, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they are troubleſom to him, but a ſtrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever gets over that burden, but now the remaining corruption that is in the heart, none in this world gets over this. Indeed in great part the ſtrong beleever hath got power there alſo, a great deale more then the weak one hath done, but the cheife burden that lies upon a ſtrong beleever in this world is the remainder of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is yet in him. And ſo for the next burden of affliction, the ſtrong beleever gets wel over that too, but this is one cheife burden of the ſtrongeſt beleevers that the world hath, that yet there is much remaining corruption in them. As it was in <hi>Paul,</hi> though a ſtrong beleever, ſaith he. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am who ſhal deliver me from this body of death,</hi> as you heard it formerly opened to you, ſo that ſanctification is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reſt that beleevers have, it is a reſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In this regard, becauſe it is the right temper of the heart. As corruption was a burden, becauſe it was the diſtemper of the heart, as ſickneſs is a burden, ſo ſanctification it is the right frame and temper of the ſoul, and ſo brings eaſe and reſt unto the ſoul. If your bodies be diſtempered with ſickneſs, you are a burden to your ſelves by it, you know not what to do, a ſick body firſt lies down in one place, and then in another, and wil change roomes, and change beds, &amp; change poſtures, becauſe he is a burden to himſelf. Let the diſtemper be gone, let the body be put into a right temper, and now he hath reſt, now he can ſleep quietly, now he hath eaſe in his body, his pain is over. Now ſanctification is the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:44661:161"/>
health of the ſoul, then the ſoul comes to be healthy when it comes to be holy, holineſs is the due temper of the heart and therefore it is reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sanctification is the reſt of the heart, becauſe in that the ſoul doth in great part attain its end, now what is it that the ſoul reſts in, ſo much as in its end; every thing reſts when it comes to its end, the end is as the proper place in which every creature reſts, now by ſanctification the ſoul doth attain its end in great part, as.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it attains the end that God intended in the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it a man or woman, now they attain in great part the end for which they are born, thou art born to that end that thou mighteſt be holy, that thou mighteſt live here in this world unto God, which by ſanctification thou doſt that is the end God aymed at, the end why thou art borne, why thou cameſt into the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is the end of al Gods wayes towards thee, a ſpecial end of al the paſſages of Gods providence to thee, of al the workings of God towards thee in this world, of al the wayes of his providence to thee, that thou mighteſt be godly, that thou mighteſt live to him to his praiſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is the great end of Chriſts coming into the world, Chriſt came into the world, that he might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a peculiar people, Zealous of good works, and that he might ſanctifie them unto himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is the end of al Gods ordinances towards thee, why doſt thou enjoy any ordinance, but that they might ſanctifie thy heart.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is the end, if thou beeſt one that is in any meaſure Gods already, it is the end of thy deſires, what are the deſires of a gracious heart, but that he might be
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:44661:161"/>
holy to God, and be freed from the body of death.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It is the end of thy Labor, what doſt thou endeavor after? what doſt thou labor after, if thou beeſt Godly, but that thou mayeſt be more Godly, that thou mayeſt be more ſanctified, ſurely that which is the end of our comming into the world, that is the end of al Gods wayes towards thee, that which is the end of al Gods ordinances, which is the end of thy deſires, and the end of thy Labor, that muſt needs be reſt, in attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou muſt needs attain Reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sanctification is reſt unto the ſoul, in that the ſoul lives even the life of God, the ſoul doth not only live to God but lives in God, and therefore muſt needs live in Reſt. You have a notable expreſſion for that in 1. <hi>John.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Let that therefore abide in you, which we heard from the beginning, if that which ye heard from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſhal remain in you, ye alſo ſhal continue in the ſon and in the father.</hi> You ſhal continue in the ſon and in the father. When the truths of the Goſpel working on the heart unto holineſs, abides in the heart, ſuch a ſoul doth abide in the ſon and in the father, lives in God, and therefore muſt needs have reſt, muſt needs have reſt there where it lives in God. Its true, the Saints they live in the world, but as they live in the world ſo they live in God, even in God here.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sanctification it muſt needs be reſt unto the heart becauſe that is a principle that raiſeth the ſoul, above the region of al kind of trouble and moleſtation. As the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers tel us, that here, in the inferior region, there are ſtormes, tempeſts, changes, and alterations, but in the region on high, the third region, that is above ſtormes, tempeſts, winds and bluſterings, there is nothing but qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, nothing but peace there. It is true, while the heart of a man or woman is grovelling here below in the world
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:44661:162"/>
as al are til God raiſeth them by Grace, their ſpirits are ful of trouble, vexation and moleſtation. <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God, but he is like the troubled ſea which caſts forth mire and dirt.</hi> As you heard in the opening of that ſcripture. But now when God gives grace, and ſanctifies the heart, the Lord raiſeth the heart above theſe regions of trouble, raiſeth it on high, gets it up in the higheſt region, there is nothing but quiet, calme peace, eaſe, and reſt unto the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Sanctification is reſt unto the ſoul, becauſe it is ſuch a principle, as turns every thing to Good, and that muſt needs bring reſt when God ſanctifies the heart, works grace in the ſoul, it is of that excellency, that it hath a virtue and efficacie in it to turne every thing to good. Now that were indeed a precious ſtone, that could turne every thing into gold that it toucheth. A great deal of labor there is about the Philoſophers ſtone, that they ſay tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth other mettals into gold, now grace in the heart turnes every thing into gold, as it were, ever thing into good, it hath that excellency in it, that whatſoever befals ſuch a man or woman, grace can turne it to the good of them. Al the workes of Gods providence, al things that ſeem to goe never ſo contrary unto the good of a man or woman that hath grace, if ſuch a one do but act his grace, or her grace, this wil turne things that ſeem to be moſt contrary, to the good of them, it wil turne it unto good; Thoſe things that others vex at, and fret at, and, think themſelves undone by, a gracious heart, one that hath grace can turne them to advantage, and get good by them, ſuch a one that is in ſuch a condition, they have got ſuch a virtue from God, God hath given them ſuch a principle within, as whatſoever befals them, he can by the acting of that principle turne it to Good. What need then ſuch a man or woman have any trouble in this world? no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wil you ſay, do not ſuch and ſuch things fal croſs to them, ſuch and ſuch afflictions fal as croſs to ſuch men as
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:44661:162"/>
any others? That is true, things may fall as croſs to them as any, I but, they have a principle within them, that turnes al thoſe croſſes and afflictions to good, that we ſhal ſpeake more unto in anſwering to the fifth burden of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions, but only to ſhew it now, in the reſt that the ſoul hath in ſanctification, becauſe it turnes al things to good.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, Sanctification is a reſt to the ſoul, becauſe indeed it is the beginning of glory, it is but the beginning of heaven, and we are in heaven, there is nothing but reſt, there is peace and reſt in heaven, ſanctification is glorification begun, and therefore reſt unto the ſoul. This now is the firſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I wil give you reſt, that is, come to me, you ſhal have power over your corruptions, you ſhal have grace and holineſs, that ſhal be reſt unto your ſouls.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Sheweth that Sanctification is only IN Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEcondly, That this ſanctification it is in Chriſt, al the ſanctification of a Chriſtian it is in Chriſt, there are ſome common gifts that God gives unto other men, there are gifts of nature, &amp; there are gifts of common grace, gifts of the ſpirit of God that are beyond the gifts of nature, &amp; yet they are ſuch as are given in a common way to thoſe that are ſtrangers to Chriſt. The heathen had many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon gifts, and ſo others now may have many common gifts, but ſanctification is the proper gift of Chriſt, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be had in Chriſt. Al the ſtrength of nature, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abilities, education, morality, natural parts, can never raiſe the heart to the leaſt degree of ſanctification, I mean, of the ſanctification that is ſaving. In a large
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:44661:163"/>
ſenſe it may be called a ſanctification, as the ſcripture ſometime doth, a ſetting ſome kind of men apart for ſuch ends: but ſanctification that is true holineſs, that is the image of God, and the beginning of glory, that is only in Chriſt, and al the ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h of nature, and parts, can never raiſe the ſoul unto the leaſt degree of it.</p>
               <p>And that it is only in Chriſt, I ſhal give you ſome ſcriptures to ſhew it, and it wil further appeare, when we come to the third thing, in ſhewing you how it comes from Chriſt, which is the principle. That text is very ful for it, which we have in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. if there were no other; <hi>But of him are ye in Jeſus Chriſt, who of God is made unto us wiſdome, and righteouſneſs, and Sanctification and Redemption.</hi> Chriſt is made unto us of God; wiſdome, to enlighten our blindneſs; and righteouſneſs, for our juſtification, and ſanctification, and redemption; that is, to deliver us from al kind of evil, to deliver us from the power of ſin, and to renew the image of God in us, that is ſanctification, and redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, that is to deliver us from al kind of evil, and to bring us to the redemption of the ſons of God, to the perfect liberty that is appointed to ſons. Chriſt is made to us ſanctification; ſanctification, that is, not only that Chriſt hath merited our ſanctification, but in a further degree, efficiently, ſo as our ſanctification is from him, and it is he that workes it in us, and upholds it in us, the beginning and the progreſs of our ſanctification, it is from him, as wel as merrited, by him. For we are to know, that Chriſt hath laid down his life to merit of God the father, as wel ſanctification, as juſtification, or glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Chriſt hath not only laid down his life for to merrit the pardon of our ſins, to purchaſe that from God, to ſave us from hell, but it was a ſpecial end of Chriſts laying down his life, to merit our being ſet at liberty from the bondage of our ſins, our deliverance from corruption the renewing of the image of God in our ſoules for the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:44661:163"/>
preſent, which is that indeed may cauſe us to prize holineſs ſomewhat more then we have done. We muſt not look upon holineſs as a duty, that we muſt be holy, and as a neceſſary meanes to heaven, but we muſt look at holines as the purchaſe of the blood of Chriſt, he hath purchaſed holineſs for al thoſe that he hath layed down his life for. And therefore (as we ſhal ſee afterwards) it is impoſſible for any to be holy, but thoſe that have part in Chriſt, ſo that Chriſt is made ſanctification by his merit, and by the efficiency that is in him; it is he likewiſe that works it in our hearts, we have it not immediatly from God the father but from God the father through Chriſt, through his ſon we come to have ſanctification, and therefore we ſhal ſee it afterwards, how different our ſanctification is from the image of God that there was in <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt, and the holineſs that there was in <hi>Adam, Adam,</hi> he had his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs immediately from God as Creator, but thoſe that are now made holy, and ſanctified now, they have not their holineſs and ſanctification immediately, or as from God their Creator, but they have it from Chriſt, Chriſt, that is, the ſecond perſon in trinity, he it is that is made to us ſanctification.</p>
               <p>And then, that it is in Chriſt appeares further, in that notable place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. that was quoted in the former point about the load of corruption, Where ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> cries out in the 24. verſe, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhal deliver me from this body of death,</hi> that is the remaining corruption that was in his heart. Marke the very next words that follow. <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, the deliverance that I muſt have from this body of death, it is from God, but how? through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, The Apoſtle doth not only thank God for it, and ſay, al grace muſt come from God, but he thanks God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Thus we muſt underſtand how grace comes unto us, indeed, God is the fountain of al, but it
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:44661:164"/>
muſt come from God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, as al mercies that we have for the pardon of our ſins. Now it is not from God immediately, as the firſt perſon, or as Creator of heaven and earth, but it is from God through Jeſus Chriſt. So al the holineſs that we have now, it is from God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>And then take one ſcripture more, and then we ſhal come to the third particular, which is the cheif we aimed at, and that is in the 26. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> the latter end of 18. verſe. <hi>That they may receive remiſſion of Sins, and inheritance amongſt them which are Sanctified by faith that is in Chriſt.</hi> It is a ſpeech of Chriſt unto <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſent him to preach, and tels him to what end it ſhould he, <hi>To open their eyes and turne them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt.</hi> Multitudes of ſcriptures there are for this purpoſe.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:44661:164"/>1. We are to know, That a ſpecial end why Jeſus Chriſt came into the World, it was to diſſolve the works of the Devil, that was a ſpecial End of Chriſts coming into the World. In 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil, for the Devil ſinneth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for this purpoſe the ſon of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil whoſoever is borne of God doth not commit ſin for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, &amp;c.</hi> It is a ſtrange ſcripture whoſoever committeth ſin is of the devil; you ſay you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Devil, but the holy Ghoſt ſaith, if you commit ſin that is walk in any way of ſin. For you wil ſay, who is there that commits not ſin? Well, but the words are thus: <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is apparent, there is a kind of commiſſion of ſin, that is an argument they are of the Devil, for they are the words of the Holy Ghoſt? <hi>And for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> It was the end why he came into the World, yea, it is a ſpecial thing that Chriſt is anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to by God the Father, to deliver Souls from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of their corruption, and to work Holineſs in them: That you have in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. and the beginning, that notable propheſie concerning Chriſt, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> (that is upon Chriſt, for it is a propheſie of him) <hi>becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,</hi> to Spiritual Captives that are under Spiritual bondage. And then in verſe 3. <hi>That they might be called Trees of Righteouſneſs, the planting of the Lord</hi>: So that that is the firſt conſideration of Chriſts giving the reſt of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that it is the end for which Chriſt was born, and it is the end for which he was anointed by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to Sanctifie the hearts of thoſe that he ſhall redeem. So that Chriſt is our Sanctification, by attaining the end of his own coming into the World, by fulfilling of that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:44661:165"/>
that God the Father hath anointed him for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt is our Sanctification, as the great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance that God hath ſet up for the Sanctifying of the hearts of his people. I ſay, Chriſt is ſet up as the great ordinance oppainted by God for this end, the Lord hath ſet him up and filled him ful of holyneſs, that holyneſs might be conveyed through him unto the ſouls that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him. And therefore it is ſaid, in that known place, As in <hi>John,</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fullneſs we receive Grace for Grace.</hi> Of his fulneſs Jeſus Chriſt is filled ful of holineſs, as a ciſtern fild ful of precious liquor, and grace muſt come through him unto the ſouls of all thoſe that are Godly, that are beleevers. Faith draws grace from him, grace for grace, that is, grace anſwerable to grace, as print for print in a ſeal, there is print for print in the wax, look what print there is in the ſeal, the ſame print is in the wax, So look what grace is in Chriſt, there is anſwerably in ſome meaſure the ſame grace in the Saints. Of his fulneſs we receive, and al the beleevers that ever were in the world have received al the grace that ever they have had from him, out of his fulneſs, and from him as the great ordinance that God hath ſet up, for the diſpenſation of the graces of his ſpirit, for the working of Sanctification in al thoſe that ſhal be ſaved. Yea Chriſt, is ſuch an ordinance appointed by God the father for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs, and ſanctification, as indeed, there is ſo much virtue in him, that the very looking upon Chriſt, hath a power to ſanctify the heart, the very looking upon him. As the brazen ſerpent in the wilderneſs, you know, was the great ordinance of God appointed for the healing of thoſe that were ſtung with ſerpents, and being the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance appointed for their healing, thoſe that did but look up to the brazen Serpent received virtue preſently, and were healed of their ſting, of the deadly diſeaſe that was upon them by the ſtinging of Serpents, now this was by virtue of that ordinance. Now then I reaſon thus, if when God makes but a piece of braſs an ordinance, there
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:44661:165"/>
ſhal be ſuch a virtue in it, that the very looking upon it ſhal have power to heal the body, then if God ſhal make his own ſon Jeſus Chriſt, God bleſſed for ever, God and man, to be an ordinance to heal the ſouls of his people, ſurely then thoſe that look up to him by the eye of faith, wil receive healing of their ſouls, as they did receive by looking upon the brazen ſerpent. The very beholding of Chriſt hath a power to ſanctify the heart. And therefore if you would have holyneſs, you muſt often look upon Chriſt, ſet Chriſt in your eye, be not only poring upon your Corruptions, and looking down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the blackneſs that there is in your ſpirits. Many Chriſtians are laboring under the burden of their corruptions, a long time, why? becauſe they ſpend their time and ſtrength meerly in poring upon their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and looking down to their corruptions. But Oh Chriſtian, thou muſt look up, ſet thy eye upon Chriſt the great ordinance, and behold him as the great ordinance ſet up by God the Father, for the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of grace to the ſouls of beleevers, and for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of al their ſouls and wounds, and then there wil come healing virtue from him. We read of the poor woman that had the bloody iſſue, that ſpent al upon the Phyſitian, ſhee did but come to Chriſt, and touch the hem of his garment, and then ſhe was healed. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt hath a great deal of virtue in him, that the very touch did heal her, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>who hath touched me?</hi> virtue went from him at the very touch of the hem of his garment, Chriſt is the great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and he is ful of virtue and excellency, the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, and touching of him, brings virtue to the ſoul, to heal the ſoul of its corruption.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, more particularly Chriſt brings ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the heart, becauſe the death of Chriſt is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, to have an efficacy to mortify ſin and corruption, it is from application of the death of Chriſt,

filled with virtue, and appointed by God for that end, that it ſhould have efficacy upon the heart, to mortify cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the heart. A man may reſolve againſt his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, he may vow and covenant againſt a ſin, he may ſtrive and ſtruggle againſt a ſin, he may pray againſt a ſin, he may faſt to overcome his ſin, he may uſe all meanes that he thinks he can poſſibly uſe to overcome his ſin, and yet ſtil his ſin not dead in him, perhaps the meanes that he may uſe to reſtrain ſin, may keep down his ſin, but it wil never mortify his ſin. The applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the death of Chriſt, that is appointed by God, for Chriſt is appointed himſelf as the great ordinance. But now more particularly I ſay, that the way that is appointed by God for the mortifying of corruption, it is the application of the death of Chriſt to the ſoul, the virtue that comes from Chriſt as a dying Chriſt, from Chriſt as a crucified Chriſt, from Chriſt as a dead Chriſt to mortify corruption in the heart. That is cleer from that place in Rom. 6. the begining. <hi>What ſhal we ſay then? ſhal we continue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid, how ſhal we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein</hi> (dead a part of his coming) <hi>know you not that ſo many of us as were baptized into Chriſt, were baptized into his death? therefore we are buried into Baptiſm by his death.</hi> And in verſ. 5. <hi>For if we have been planted together, in the likeneſs of his death.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in verſ. 6. <hi>Knowing this that our old man is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> The old man is crucified with him, in his being crucified, there is a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in Chriſts death for the crucifying of corruption, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin. He doth not ſay, that we might have ſome power againſt ſin, that ſin might be reſtrained, or that ſuch a particular ſin may be kept down, but that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed. So that in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the death of Chriſt, there is not only the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:44661:166"/>
of this particular ſin, but the Body of ſin comes to be deſtroyed: all thoſe principles of ſin in the ſoul, with the connexion of them, and joyning one to another, as the Members are joyned in the Body, they come to be deſtroyed, that is, though not wholly caſt out and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, yet the ruling power of them is taken away; as ſoon as ever the ſoul is come to Chriſt, the Body of ſin hath a deadly ſtroke given to it. There are many of you ſtriving againſt this particular corruption, ſomtimes one, and ſomtimes another, for thoſe that are Gods Children, their hearts are more inclined unto ſome ſins than others, and at ſomtime to ſome particular ſin more than other. It may be one labors under the burden of paſſion, and another of unbelief, and another of Pride, and another of wantonneſs, and divers particular corruptions they are laboring under. It may be at ſome times you find one corruption ſtir, and you ſtrive againſt that; and another time another corruption ſtirs, and you ſpend your ſtrength againſt that, but now here's the way to ſtrike at the whol Body of Corruption at once. If one ſhal go to cut down a Tree, and ſtand chopping at one ſprig, and one branch, and another branch, the Tree may ſtand long enough for al that: But now, if he would get the Tree down, he goes to the root, and a few blows gets down all there. So this is the wiſdom of a Chriſtian, That when he comes to labor againſt any corruption, he doth not ſpend his time ſo much againſt this or that particular corruption, but ſtrikes at the body of corruption: and how gets he ſtrength againſt that? By applying the blood of Chriſt, the death of Chriſt by faith againſt that, and by this means the body of death comes to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And here is the reaſon, that Chriſtians in a little time grow ſo much, and get ſo much power againſt their corruptions, whereas others are a long time before they get any power at all. Thoſe that are not acquainted with the way of Chriſt, you ſhall have one that hath been a notorious wretch, a wicked perſon, a ſwearer, a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:44661:167"/>
Sabbath-breaker, if it pleaſe God to bring him to the Word, and reveal Chriſt to the ſoul, you ſhall have a mighty change in this man in a week, a great change, that he doth not only leave off now drunkenneſs, and then lying, and then ſwearing, and then Sabbath-breaking, but all goes down together; Why? Becauſe at one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the death of Chriſt, al the body of ſin comes to be deſtroyed, though not quite dead and withered. As a Tree though it may be dead, yet the Leaves may be green ſtill: So though there be not at firſt the withering of them, yet there is the deadly ſtroke given, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the way to kill them is to renew the application of the death of Chriſt. And indeed this ſhould be the care of a Chriſtian, not to keep from the acting of ſin ſo much, as to find that the death of Chriſt is applied to him. And hence you never read of any ſuch thing as mortification in any Heathen Author in the World, the mortification of corruption is a Riddle to all Heathen Writers in the World. The mortifying of corruption, and the mortifying of their own hearts, this is a peculiar expreſſion of the Goſpel, and indeed it is peculiar to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. Many men, through good Education are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, that they are very fair in their courſe; others as they come to more underſtanding, the vanity of their youth being overcome, there is not that prophaneneſs committed by them as heretofore; I but, what is this to mortification of the body of death that is in their hearts, this is only peculiar to a Chriſtian, and it is from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the death of Chriſt, the application of a Chriſt dying, of a Chriſt crucifying, of a Chriſt ſhedding his blood for ſin; this hath a virtue to mortifie ſin. There is a great deal of difference between a mortified luſt, and a reſtrained luſt, a mortified ſin, and a reſtrained ſin. The difference lies in this one thing, for I muſt not go out to handle the Point, but only this one thing take it by the way: When a luſt is mortified, there is not only a ceaſing from the act of it, but there is now an unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:44661:167"/>
between the heart and the ſin, whereas there may be much reſtraint of ſin, and yet ſtil there may remain a ſuitableneſs between the diſpoſition of the heart and the ſin, only they dare not commit it, but when ſin is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, the heart is ſo changed, that there is an unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs wrought between the heart and corruption now, and this mortification of the body of ſin is by the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is our ſanctification, and he only, becauſe it is by him that the ſpiritual curſe that is upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans heart naturally is taken away, it is Chriſt only that doth deliver the ſoul from the ſpiritual curſe that is upon every mans heart naturally. You know this is the condition of man by nature, he is under the curſe of the Law. <hi>Curſed is the man that abideth not in al things that is written in the Law to do it.</hi> But now, we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ordinarily this curſe to be, either in outward miſery or elſe in hel fire curſed eternally, but we are to know, that one branch of this curſe is that that is upon the ſouls of men here, There is a ſpiritual curſe that is upon the ſouls of men by the fal of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that is, God giving them up unto themſelves, unto the luſts of their own heart, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own counſel and wayes. Now I confeſs, as it is in the curſe of outward afflictions in this world, it is in ſome degree upon ſome, and in a further degree upon others, but al are under it naturally, ſo this ſpiritual death is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in ſome degrees upon ſome, and in more degrees, upon others, but every ſoule is in ſome meaſure, in ſome degree or other given up to the luſt of its owne heart, there is a final degree of giving the ſoul up to the luſts of its own heart ſomtime, but there is in every one a meaſure a degree of this, and the reaſon of the prevailing of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of mens hearts may appear in ſome meaſure by this. It is ſtrange to ſee, that notwithſtanding al the convictions of conſcience, &amp; telling men of the dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their wayes, that it wil never be peace in the end, that they wil rue it at the laſt, and their conſciences give
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:44661:168"/>
them many a ſecret nip, yet they goe on ſtil, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the terror in the Law many times, nay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the hand of God hath bin ſtrong upon them, and they have cryed out againſt their ſins, and promiſed againſt them, and notwithſtanding that they find that their ſins do deſtroy the very health of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, waſte their Eſtates, take away their good names, and thereby looſe al their friends, yet they are not able to overcome it, As the Scripture ſpeakes of ſome that have <hi>eyes ful of adultery, they cannot ceaſe to ſin.</hi> Now ſometimes they plead this as an excuſe for their ſin, and ſay, they would fain leave it but they cannot, and they think this is a ſufficient excuſe for their ſin, an excuſe, no, this their cannot may be from the ſpiritual curſe that is upon their ſouls, becauſe the curſe of God is in a high degre upon their hearts, giving them up in juſt judgment unto the luſts of their own hearts. And this I take in ſome part to be the meaning of that place, in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. verſe. <hi>The ſtrength of ſin is the Law.</hi> Now ſpiritually the meaning of it is this, that al the ſtrength that ſin hath to condemn one, to kil one, to bring death, it is by the Law, that I take to be the ſpecial ſcope of thoſe words. But there is included likewiſe in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion thus much, that the law of God giues a ſtrength to ſin. How, you wil ſay, doth the Law of God give a ſtrength to ſin? Thus, there is the juſtice of God in his Law, by virtue of the Law of God, and the juſtice of God in it, man is given up unto his ſin, and ſo his ſin comes to have a power and ſtrength over him, the ſtrength of ſin it is the Law, the Law requires this, the juſtice of God in the Law requires this. That thoſe that do forſake God ſhould be forſaken of him, that thoſe that give their hearts up to ſatiſfie themſelves in any way of ſin, that they ſhould be given up to that ſin, So the ſtrength of ſin is the Law, the Law makes ſin to be ſo much the ſtronger that way. Now therefore, how ſhould the ſoul come to be deliuered
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:44661:168"/>
from the ſtrength of ſin? the Law muſt be ſatisfied, the Law muſt be taken off, the ſtrength of the Law muſt be taken away, and none can take that away but Chriſt, Chriſt takes away the ſtrength of the Law, but the Law is not executed upon Chriſt, ſo as he was to be given up, but the text ſaith, he was made ſin, he came to take our ſin upon him, it was as neere as might be, though he was not capable of having the execution of the Law upon him but the ſcripture ſaith, he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ade ſin for us, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a very great meaning of this place, though acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of ſin, and ſuffering for ſin be the cheif meaning of the place, yet it hath beſides very much of this in it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt is our ſanctification, by being the head of the ſecond Covenant, and ſo through our miſtical union with him, there is a virtue of holineſs conveyed from him by being the head of the ſecond Covenant, and we being members of him as the head, we come to have the virtue of holineſs to be drawn from him. As it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> how come we to have ſo much ſin conveyed to us by <hi>Adam</hi> by propagation, but thus? As we may read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>By one man ſin came into the world.</hi> Now <hi>Adam,</hi> he was the head of the firſt Covenant, and by being the head of that, al mankind are looked upon as members of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> he being the head in that notion of the Covenant, in that conſideration. <hi>Adam</hi> was not looked upon as a parent only, as the firſt father, but as the head, and we are not looked upon only as the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> but as members, ſo that al men were looked upon as one in <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes but of two men, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> that look as ſin is conveyed to us, being members of the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and he being the head of the Firſt Covenant, ſo grace comes to be conveyed unto the ſoul by our being members of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt being the head of the ſecond Covenant, here is the way of conveyance of holineſs, our union with
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:44661:169"/>
Chriſt, So that now the holineſs that is in Chriſt, comes to us by virtue of the miſtical union. As by virtue of the natural union of the members of the body with the head, there comes animal ſpirits to the members of the body; ſo by virtue of our miſtical union with Chriſt our head, there is conveyed holineſs and grace to ſtrengthen us againſt our corruptions.

                  </gap>at hath the oyl, not only of gladneſs but holineſs too, doth deſcend down to al his members by virtue of the union they have with him. And for that end you have a moſt famous ſcripture in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>For the Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of ſin and death.</hi> It is a ſcripture that hath very much in it. What doth he mean by the Law of ſin and death? The Law, that is the mighty power that there is in ſin, and ſo in death that comes by ſin in the hearts of unbeleevers. There is a Law of ſin, the ſtrength of ſin I ſpeak of, ſin hath ſtrength going along with it, hath power with it. So a Law of ſin there is in the hearts of men, they are compelled to ſin, as, I may ſo ſpeake, as a man is compelled to a thing by a law, a law of ſin, though this be no excuſe to them. And let them know, that ſo far as they are compelled to ſin, they are compelled to death to. But how ſhal this Law of ſin and death be overcome? Marke the words, <hi>The Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt, hath made me free from the Law of ſin and death.</hi> The Law of the ſpirit of Life, here is two gradations, that is, the holineſs that is in Chriſt, that is likewiſe a Law as wel as the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in the heart. The corruption in the heart hath a ſtrength in it, and the holineſs of Chriſt hath a ſtrength in it too, So that when grace comes into the heart, the heart goes on in a way of holineſs, in a holy kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, <hi>We can do nothing againſt the truth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. But yet there is a neceſſity of willingneſs goes along with it too, there is a Law of Love and kindneſs,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:44661:169"/>
but by this word of Law is meant, a ſtrong impetuouſneſs, a migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y power that carries the ſoul on to holineſs. Again, ſecondly it is the Law of the ſpirit, and of the ſpirit of life, the holineſs of Chriſt it is a holineſs that is ful of life. Firſt it is Life. And ſecondly it is the ſpirit of Life. Now the ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of life is a higher degree then life, as the ſpirit of a thing hath the quickning of the thing in it, beyond what the whol bulke of the thing is. When the ſpirit of herbs or any ſuch thing is extracted you know thoſe ſpirits have much quickning in them, beyond the things themſelves, ſo the ſpirit would expreſs the mighty activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the holyneſs that comes from Chriſt, it is life, it is the ſpirit of life, and then it is the Law of the ſpirit of life Oh my brethren, you ſee then here, that Godlineſs is no dul thing, it is no heavy thing, no poor, weake, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible thing, but it is the life, &amp; it is the life of Chriſt, &amp; it is the ſpirit of life, and it is the Law of the Spirit of life, he ſpeakes of grace when it comes to that, as the Law of the ſpirit of life.</p>
               <p>There is but two things in ſin, the Law of ſin and death, and in grace there is life, and the ſpirit of life, and the law of the ſpirit of life, and al this in Jeſus Chriſt. It is not in our owne reſolutions, purpoſes, endeavours, but in our union with Jeſus Chriſt, and this it is that brings grace unto the heart, though there be much corruption before, yet the ſoul being thus one with Chriſt, and looking upon Chriſt as the head of the ſecond Covenant, and doth draw virtue from Jeſus Chriſt, a mighty ſtrong virtue to help the ſoul againſt corruption, and quicken it in the wayes of God, and thus comes the reſt to the ſoul by Chriſt in ſanctification,</p>
               <p>Carnal hearts, they know no way in the world how to get grace, they heare talking of grace, and leaving of ſin, but they know not how to get it, and they wil go and pray, read, heare, and the like, I but you muſt know, that grace lies in another way then you think of, for you think it muſt come from God, I but it muſt come from
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:44661:170"/>
God in a miſtical way through Chriſt. Perhaps ſome of you hearing the myſteries of the Goſpel underſtand this, that as God is the fountain of al grace, ſo it muſt be conveyed by Chriſt as through the ciſterne, I but you muſt underſtand alſo, that you muſt have it from God through Chriſt, as he is a head unto you, and you are the members, through a miſtical union that your ſouls muſt have with Chriſt, ſo as you be made one with Chriſt, you muſt be made one with Chriſt. As the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can never receive any ſpirit from the head, except it be united to the body, it is not by being tied to the body. If you take an arme of fleſh and tie it to a mans ſhoulder it wil never receive life that way, but it muſt have a natural union. Juſt thus your common Profeſſors, that meerly have the name of Chriſtians, and are not ſpiritually uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, they are like to Armes ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So your common Chriſtians, they have ſome knowledg of Chriſt, they are only faſtened to Chriſt, as a wooden leg is faſtened to a mans body, they make ſome uſe of Chriſt, ſome profeſſion of Chriſt &amp; can ſpeake of Chriſt, &amp; what they heare ſpoken of Chriſt, is ſomewhat ſerviceable and uſeful to them, I but they have not life from Chriſt, and hence they have not holineſs from Chriſt, they have not the true holineſs that comes from the Law of the ſpirit of life that is in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Another thing that is to be conſidered of in Chriſt, how the reſt of ſanctification comes to the ſoul through him, is this, In Chriſt there are the greateſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for holineſs that poſſibly can be imagined, and Chriſt comes to be a reſt of ſanctification that way: when the ſoul comes unto Chriſt, and knowes Chriſt in the right way, the ſoul ſees in Chriſt enough againſt ſin, and for holineſs, if it never ſaw any thing elſe there is enough in Chriſt to help againſt ſin, and for the furtherance of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:44661:170"/>
of holineſs, that that is diſcovered in Chriſt hath a mighty power to help the ſoul againſt ſin, and to further it in the way of holineſs, as now to inſtance the mighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that there are in Chriſt, againſt ſin and for holineſs, as.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing two ſtrong Arguments in Chriſt for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Firſt, In him the ſoul ſees the greateſt breach between it and God by reaſon of Sin. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In him it ſees the greateſt Hatred of Sin in God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIrſt, in Chriſt, there the foul ſees the greateſt breach that can be imagined that ſin made between God and the creature, it is true, when we preach the Law to you, and tel you of the curſe of the Law that is due to ſin, this acquaints you with ſomewhat of the breach that ſin made between God and you, and this may terrifie you, but the truth is, the breach between God and a ſoul by ſin, is never throughly ſeen, til you come to Chriſt, the ſoul never throughly ſees ſin til then, when it comes to Chriſt, and ſees Chriſt indeed, ſees Chriſt ſo as one that hath union with him, then it underſtands the evil of ſin after another manner then ever it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And that is the reaſon, that faith doth more purge the heart from ſin, then al the terrors of the Law poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly can do, yea, if God ſhould let a crevis into hel, and let you ſee into al the torment that is there, they could not diſcover ſo much the evil of ſin to you, as when you come to have a real ſight of Jeſus Chriſt, how ſin made ſuch a breach between God and us, as can be made up no other way, but the ſon of God muſt come and take upon him mans ſin, this is the greateſt diſcovery of the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:44661:171"/>
evil of ſin that poſſibly can be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You wil ſay, <hi>Others know this as wel as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, they know it after a ſort, but none can know this throughly, but thoſe that through faith have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſight of Chriſt, and ſo have the real ſight of the evil of ſin, in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another ſtrong argument of the evil of ſin in Chriſt is this, the infinite hatred of ſin in God, that God ſhould ſo infinitly hate ſin, that he would not ſpare his owne ſon, this ſhewes the evil of ſin. We heare much of hell and of the terror of the Law, now when I come to conſider the fruit of Gods hatred of Sin in his ſon, this ſhewes me a great deale more the evil of ſin, And therefore, though the terror of the law may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain men from ſin, I but when the ſoul comes to know the infinite wrath of God againſt ſin, that he would give his ſon to ſatisfie for ſin, this ſhewes the evil of ſin, and this ſhewes the infinite holineſs of God, that he would ſend his only ſon to purchaſe holineſs. And in this we ſee the infinite love of Chriſt to die for ſin, the infinite price of the ſoul to purchaſe it, and the infinite difficulty in the deliverance from ſin, and nothing can prevail upon the heart more then the viewing of Chriſt. There is ſo many things that I cannot ſpeak of them, that when the ſoul comes to Chriſt, makes the ſoul hate ſin, and makes it in love with holineſs. The knowledg of Chriſt in any common way, hath as much power to reſtrain ſin as any thing, but now the knowledg of Chriſt in a ſpiritual way, in a ſaving way, it hath an infinite efficacy in it. And the truth is, the ſpecial way for a ſoul to help it ſelf againſt its own corruptions, it is much to dive into the knowledg of the Goſpel, look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Goſpel, pry into the myſtery of the Goſpel, be much converſant in the miſtery of the Goſpel, and there conſider what argument thou maieſt draw againſt thy
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:44661:171"/>
ſins. They are poor, low arguments, that common people draw againſt their ſins, they have a temptation to ſin, and they think, Oh! let me take heed I do not do it, for my maſter and miſtris wil know of it, or ſuch a one wil know of it, or if I do it, I ſhal be brought to puniſhment, theſe are poor, low arguments, But ſaith a beleever, Oh let me not commit ſin, Why? It is that that brought the ſon of God down from heaven to be made a curſe for man. It is that that made the greateſt ſtir in the world that ever was, it is that that Gods ſoul infinitly hates and it is that that made ſuch a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſoul and God, as only can be made up by the ſon of God. Theſe are the arguments that a beleever hath againſt ſin, and a beleever being converſant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n theſe arguments, and often exerciſing faith in Chriſt, they being made real to the ſoul. They muſt needs have a mighty power to overcome any corruption whatſoever. As we read in the Goſpel, when the husband man that let out the vineyard ſent for fruit, and they took the ſervant and beate him, and killed another, at length, ſaith he, I wil ſend my ſon, ſurely they wil reverence him. So may I ſay, there is ſuch and ſuch arguments againſt thy ſin, to overcome thy Corruption, and to put thee on to the way of holineſs, perhaps thoſe arguments thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions break, and they are but like <hi>Sampſons</hi> cords, thy corruption ſnaps them aſunder like flax. I but, ſaith God, I wil ſend my ſon, and reveale the glorious miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel in my ſon, I wil ſhew to their ſouls what my ſon hath done, and what the deep counſels for the ſalvation of their ſoules in my ſon are and theſe ſhal prevail upon you. And here is the reaſon of al their fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſin, and ſtrictneſs in walking with God, when the Goſpel hath convinced them; you wonder why they wil be ſo ſtrict and fearful to offend, do you wonder at it? Oh my brethren, they have arguments, perhaps, that you know not of, God hath revealed much of his ſon to them, the wonderful miſteries of Godlineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:44661:172"/>
in his ſon, and they are the arguments they go upon. They do not go upon ſuch mean and low arguments as you do; meane and low arguments may keep men in an orderly courſe, to live quietly with their Neighbors, and keep them from thievery, drunkenneſs, ſwearing, and the like, arguments that the heathen had skil of may keep them from thoſe things. But the ſaints, beleevers, that are acquainted with the wayes of Chriſt they have higher arguments, they behold him with the eye of faith, and ſo they come to have power againſt their ſin, and to have eaſe in their ſouls. Thus, ſaith Chriſt, come to me, you have Corruptions prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over you, and you perhaps ſtrive with them with ſuch and ſuch arguments, but come to me, and I wil give you ſuch things, you ſhal ſee ſo much againſt ſin, and ſo much for holineſs, as that that I ſhal diſcover to you ſhal help you againſt your corruptions, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you in the way of holineſs, and ſo you ſhal have reſt unto your ſouls.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing how Sanctification comes from Chriſt, in ſix Particulars more. <hi>1.</hi> It is he that reveals the Father to the Soul. <hi>2.</hi> Through Chriſt the Love of God is ſhed abroad into the heart. <hi>3.</hi> All the Promiſes are made to us through him. <hi>4.</hi> In him all the Ordinances are effectual. <hi>5.</hi> He ſends the Spirit into the heart. <hi>6.</hi> Chriſt Rules in the heart.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEventhly: Chriſt comes to be our Sanctification, we have the reſt of ſanctification in Chriſt thus: It's Chriſt that doth make known the Father unto the ſoul: <hi>No man knows the Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but the Son, and him to whom the Son reveals him.</hi> I ſuppoſe you know the Scripture; <hi>And if you have ſeen me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you have ſeen the Father,</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 14. It is Chriſt that makes known God unto the ſoul, and there is a mighty power to work Holineſs in the heart by the knowledg of God. Saith the Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a lyar.</hi> The knowledg of God cannot ſtand with the neglect of Gods Commandements. There is a mighty power in the knowledg of God for the Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart, the very looking upon Gods Holineſs hath a great deal of power to ſanctifie the heart; and the reaſon of al the wickedneſs and prophaneſs in the world, it is becauſe men know not the Lord, know not what an infinite, bleſſed, glorious God they have to deal withal: <hi>They that know thy Name, will truſt in thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. So may we ſay, Thoſe that know thy Name, O Lord, will fear thee, they will ſerve thee, they will walk before thee in obedience and Holineſs. Now the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:44661:173"/>
knowledg of God, it is in Chriſt, there may be ſome kind of Natural knowledg of God out of Chriſt, in beholding the Works of God, we may know ſomwhat of him. But as the Scripture ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>After that in the Wiſdom of God,</hi> that is, in the Creature, in the Glory of God that ſhines in the Creature, <hi>the World by Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom knew not God.</hi> The World by Wiſdom, that is, the World by all their Natural Underſtanding, by al Learning that Phyloſophers had, that ſaw much of the Glory of God ſhining in the Creature, yet ſaith the Text, by al their wiſdom they knew not God; but yet <hi>it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that beleeve.</hi> And what preaching was this? verſe 23. <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified, &amp;c.</hi> So that there is no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledg but only in Chriſt, when the Soul comes to Chriſt, then the Lord Jeſus Chriſt reveals the Father to him, reveals the Counſels of God unto the Soul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals the very heart of God unto the ſoul; and hence it is that many poor people that are very ignorant before they come to know Chriſt, know little or nothing of God at al, but had ſtrange thoughts of God; yet as ſoon as ever the things of the Goſpel come to be revealed to them, they begin to have high thoughts of God, high and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thoughts of God; and thoſe high and honorable thoughts of God, do mightily prevail upon their hearts to purge out ſin, and ſanctifie their hearts exceedingly. Do but conſider of thoſe places where the preaching of the Goſpel hath been but very little, what poor thoughts they have of God, they know not God, and therfore they live in all manner of Ungodlineſs. But now, when the preaching of the Goſpel comes to any place, and God comes to be known, there the Devil is caſt out, and the hearts of people being filled with the knowledg of God, they come to be ſanctified unto the Service of God. That is another thing, It is Chriſt that reveals the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto the Soul, and ſo comes for to ſanctifie the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:44661:173"/>Eighthly, It is through Chriſt that the love of God is ſhed abroad into the heart of a beleever, and that hath a mighty power to ſanctify the heart, the ſhedding abroad of the love of God into the heart, this only can be in Chriſt. There may be, though out of Chriſt, common fruites of Gods bounty, general patience, goodneſs, and the like, but the ſpecial love of God, that hath a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying power that goes along with it, it is that only that is in Chriſt, and when the ſoul comes once to have union with Chriſt, there flowes the ſweet ſence of the love of God unto the heart, it is ſhed abroad, according unto the ſcripture Phraſe, that the heart being filled with the ſweetneſs of Gods love, and comes to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby, then al baſe love of the creature, and the love of ſin comes to be eaten out, and the heart comes to be carried on, in a bleſſed, ſweet, and gracious manner after the Lord. Al the terror of the Law cannot ſanctifie, ſo as the ſhedding abroad of the love of Chriſt in the heart can. Indeed, by the terror of the Law ſin may be reſtrained, but by the terror of the Law the heart can never be ſanctified. This is a certain truth, the terror of the Law may reſtrain from ſin, but it can never ſanctifie the heart, the terrors of the Law are uſeful to be preached in that way, for to reſtrain Sin, but when we preach them, we do not think that we can thereby poſſibly ſanctifie the heart, corruption may be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a while, but, that which muſt ſanctifie the heart muſt be the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, As I remember. <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> compares the love of God in Chriſt in the heart of a beleever, to the fire that is within the furnace, and the love of God in his common bounty, to a few ſparkes that fly out at a diſtance from the mouth of the furnace; take al the love of God that is in the creature ſuppoſe the Lord ſhould give unto you the poſſeſſion of al the world, and ſhould make a thouſand worlds and give thee poſſeſſion of them al, this were but as a ſpark from the furnace; but the love of God in Chriſt is as the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:44661:174"/>
heat of the furnace: and as the heat (you know) conſumes ſtubble, &amp; combuſtible matter put into it, ſo there is that heat in the love of God ſhed abroad in the heart by Chriſt, that conſumes the luſt of the heart, and the ſoul growes up into holineſs thereby.</p>
               <p>It is with the heart of a Beleever, as it is with the fruites of the earth, you know, that the froſt may keep down ſome weeds, but it is the ſun-ſhine, it is the beams of the ſun, and the warme beames that makes the fruit to ripen and to grow up, that fruit that growes in the ſun is ſooneſt ripe, your graſſe that growes in the orchard is ſowre and the beaſt wil not eate it, and other herbs that grow in the ſhade comes to no maturity, nor to be ſo good as thoſe that grow in the ſun, fruit that growes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wal, how quickly doth that grow ripe, whereas the other that grows in the ſhade withers; ſo there are ſome that live altogether under Legal feares, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conſcience perhaps they have ſomtimes fruite but it is ſour fruit, it is not ſo ſweet fruite as comes from thoſe that are under the ſun-ſhine of the Goſpel, that have the ſhine of the love of God upon their hearts, their fruite is ſweet, and they thrive better, and looke more lovely and live a more amiable and lovely life then the lives of others. And this is another way, how Chriſt comes to be our ſanctification in ſhedding abroad the love of God into the heart; and that the ſcripture is ful of, how the love of God is ſhed abroad in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Chriſt is our Sanctification in this reſpect, becauſ al the promiſes of the Goſpel are made to us in him he is the foundation of al the promiſes that are in the Goſpel, they are al made good in him, they have a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſanctifying power in them, Chriſt is our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, I ſay, becauſe it is through him that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are made, which hath a mighty ſanctifying power. As for the Firſt? In 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For al the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:44661:174"/>
of God in him are yea, and in him Amen unto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God by us.</hi> Al the promiſes of God in him are yea &amp; in him amen: al Goſpel promiſes are made unto us by chriſt &amp; that is a very uſeful &amp; a notable meditation, to conſider of al promiſes that they come unto us from Chriſt, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent meditation to ſet out the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt that in him are al the promiſes, they are in him yea, what is the meaning of that? That is they are confirmed to us in Chriſt, in him they are made certain to us, they are made good in him, or as ſome of your books read it thus, <hi>For al the promiſes of God in him are yea,</hi> and I find it is, I know not whether it be in your books, but <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and other interpreters ſay, it is read in ſome copies thus, <hi>Therefore in him let them be yea and Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</hi> Al the promiſes of God in him are yea, that is, they are made certain things in Chriſt as the foundation, therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; ſo <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith it is read, therefore, let them be Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in him unto the praiſe of God. That is, as God hath made al promiſes in him as certain, ſo let us look upon Chriſt, and ſee the promiſes of God in him, and beleeve in them, and ſo by our faith ſay Amen unto the promiſes that are made in him unto the glory of God, ſo ſhal we Glorifie God, when we ſhal look upon the promiſes by our faith, and ſay, Amen unto our ſoules. Now the word, Amen ſignifies firme and ſure, that is, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word Amen. Sometimes it ſignifies at the end of our prayer, ſo be it, Amen, it is an Hebrew word that ſignifies, ſo be it, let it be, O Lord, as we have prayed, and according to thy promiſe, that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word Amen, when you conclude your prayer with Amen. It is a word that is uſed for faith, and it is the expreſſion of faith after we have made our prayer, and that is the meaning here, therefore al the promiſes in him are yea, they are made in Chriſt and affirmed in Chriſt as certain, therefore in him let them be Amen unto the ſoul, let them be as firme and certain things unto us, for
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:44661:175"/>
us to reſt upon, unto the glory of God by us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhal we glorifie God, ye have ſo many precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in Chriſt, but now they are unto the glory of God by us, we by faith ſay Amen to them, and we make them as firme and ſure unto our ſoules by the exerciſe of our faith upon them. So you may underſtand in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure this ſcripture, which hath exceeding much in it, thus you ſee by Chriſt the promiſes are made to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> I but you wil ſay, <hi>How doth this help our ſanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, exceeding much, there is nothing helps the ſanctification of the ſoul of a beleever, more then the promiſes of the Goſpel, thoſe that are exerciſed in the promiſes of the Goſpel, they grow more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in ſanctification then others. The promiſes of the Goſpel are channels, not only of mercy for our ſalvation, but of holineſs for our ſanctification, and for that you have a moſt excellent ſcripture, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes, dearly beloved let us clenſe our ſelves from al filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the fear of God.</hi> It is as ful a ſcripture as I know any, here you may ſee, what uſe the holy Ghoſt would have you make of the promiſes of the Goſpel, and of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. It may be you think that ſeeing there is ſuch promiſes of mercy you may take more liberty to the fleſh, but that is not the reaſoning of the ſpirit, he would not take more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty therby, but ſeeing we have ſuch promiſes, ſaith he, let us clenſe our ſelves from al filthineſs, filthines cannot ſtand with beleeving of promiſes. And marke, he ſaith, <hi>from al fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the fleſh and of the ſpirit.</hi> So that it is not enough for you to ſay, you have as good a heart towards God as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, I thank God my heart is right, my ſpirit is right, I but you muſt clenſe from al filthineſs of the fleſh, as wel as of the ſpirit, and theſe promiſes if you have the right uſe of them, they wil be mighty clenſing. And marke, from <hi>al filthineſs,</hi> it is not enough to clenſe from ſome groſs filthineſs, that is, that you do not live in the groſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:44661:175"/>
ſins that others of the world live in, and that your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors live in, that you are not whoremungers, drunkards cheaters, prophaners of the ſaboth, and the like, but theſe promiſes wil cleanſe from <hi>al filthineſs,</hi> that is, there ſhal be no filthineſs that ſhal ſtick to you as to the wicked and ungodly, but it wil clenſe gradually, by degrees from al Filthineſs of the fleſh. <hi>And ſpirit,</hi> or of ſpirit, not to make you make conſcience of wicked actions, but cleanſe you from your very thoughts, theſe promiſes wil clenſe from the filthineſs of the fleſh. I perhaps they may a little ſerve the turne for them, I but from the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the ſpirit, the filthineſs of the thoughts, the Filthineſs of the affections, thoſe inward ſpiritual wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes. Of pride, malice, and the like. May be you would count it a vild thing to be accuſed of whordom, the Filthineſs of the fleſh, I but what ſay you to the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſpirit, of pride, malice, diſtruſt, earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſs, and ſuch like, theſe promiſes are to clenſe from the filthineſs of the ſpirit, aſwel as of the fleſh. And then <hi>perfecting holineſs in the feare of God,</hi> it makes them fear God more, and then it perfects holineſs, ſuch a one as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the promiſes of the Goſpel, is content with no meaſure of holineſs, but growes higher and higher til he comes to perfection. Here you ſee the uſe of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, what a clenſing nature promiſes have, Oh my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be much exerciſed in promiſes, lay up promiſes, if you would get power over your corruptions.</p>
               <p>And then one ſcripture more for this is that, in 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes.</hi> The promiſes of the Goſpel they are precious, more worth then a world, a beleever that knows the preciouſneſs of the promiſes, accounts more of them then of his eſtate. What do you account precious? that you may have your ſhips laden home with precious things, I but to have your hearts filled with precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it is far better then theſe. But now, wherein do
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:44661:176"/>
theſe promiſes appeare to be ſo precious? It appeares by this, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, <hi>that by theſe you might be partakers of the divine nature,</hi> that by theſe great and precious promiſes you might be partakers of the divine nature, that is of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of ſanctification, that is called the divine nature, having eſcaped the corruptions that is in the world through luſt. By theſe the ſoul eſcapes the corruption that is in the world by luſt, and not only eſcapes the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the world, that is, doth not live ſo wickedly as others do, but comes to be made partaker of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature through theſe promiſes. So that Chriſt is the reſt of ſanctification, becauſe in him al promiſes are made, they have a mighty clenſing virtue to ſanctifie the heart, you would willingly have intereſt in promiſes, and have the mercy that the promiſe holds forth, now as you would have the intereſt in the promiſes, and have the mercy that the promiſes holds forth, ſo you muſt labor to feele the efficacy of the promiſes to clenſe your hearts and make you partaker of the divine nature.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Chriſt is ſanctification, becauſe in him al the ordinances are effectual, the ordinances are effectual on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt, Chriſt gave his ordinances unto his Church at firſt, and then they come to be effectual through him, It is not what you come to heare in the word, but how much of Chriſt you have in the word, you come to the ſacrament, it is not what you partake of there, but what of Chriſt you get there, it is not what you partake of there, but what of Chriſt you get there, it is Chriſt in the word, ſacrament, and prayer, that is the efficacy of al the ordinances, the ordinances are but al as the <hi>vehiculum Chriſti,</hi> the conveyance of Chriſt unto the ſoul. And therefore we ſhould when we come to any ordinance think with our ſelves, what have we of Chriſt, what have we of Chriſt here? have we met with any thing of Chriſt here? In the word, prayer, ſacraments, hath my heart
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:44661:176"/>
been drawn neerer to Chriſt in them? For certain it is, that it is Chriſt, that is the virtue and kernel of al the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Hence it is that thoſe that are acquainted with Chriſt, and have been brought to him, they come to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit more in one month now by the ordinances, then they did in al their lives. Before the ordinances were as empty things, and liveleſs things to you, but in Chriſt they come now to be made effectual.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, Chriſt is our ſanctification, by ſending the holy Ghoſt into our hearts, for the holy Ghoſt comes from the father and the ſon, we can never expect the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of the holy Ghoſt, nor the ſanctifying worke of the holy Ghoſt, but through Chriſt, for ſo Chriſt ſaith in that place in <hi>John</hi> 16.14. concerning the ſpirit He ſaith he wil ſend his ſpirit, <hi>He ſhal glorifie me for he ſhal receive of mine.</hi> The ſpirit, the holy Ghoſt doth receive of Chriſt, when he comes into the heart, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there be any ſanctification by the Holy Ghoſt, it muſt be through Chriſt, he muſt receive of Chriſt, he works from the father and from the ſon. And therfore the ſcripture hath that phraſe, <hi>We are baptiſed into one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that is by being baptiſed into Chriſt, having the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work of baptiſme, we are made partakers now of that one ſpirit, the Holy Ghoſt. Now ſuch is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ſanctification, as it cannot be wrought by any natural meanes, but it muſt have the Holy Ghoſt to be ſent into the heart, and therefore the ſaints are ſaid to be <hi>the temple of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now what ever worke of the Holy Ghoſt there is required for ſanctification that muſt be in and through Chriſt, and from Chriſt. The Holy Ghoſt never comes to ſanctifie any, but the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt, for he is the ſpirit of Chriſt, as wel as of the father, and never comes to any but to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt in this work of ſanctification.</p>
               <p>There are ſome common gifts of Gods ſpirit, that the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:44661:177"/>
heathens have, but for this gift of true holineſs it is only in the members of Chriſt, that the holy Ghoſt doth come into.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is our ſanctification by his Kingly power, ſwaying his ſcepter in our hearts, and ruling there, ſubduing our luſts as a king ſubdues rebels, and walking and governing the hearts of his people. Chriſt doth exerciſe a kingly power when any ſoul doth beleeve, when Chriſt comes into any heart, he comes into the heart to exerciſe a kingly power there, to ſet up his throne in a kingly manner, and by this he comes to ſanctifie the heart, and give reſt. And, as in a kingdom, there are mutinies, ſeditions, and the like, ſo in the hearts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, there are mutinies and ſeditions, even againſt God himſelfe. But now, whenas the king ſends forth power, that very power prevailes againſt al things, if it prevail in a way of juſtice, al things are brought into right and due order again: So here, when Chriſt comes into the heart as king of righeouſneſs, and then as king of peace, hereby he comes to bring reſt and quiet unto the heart by his kingly power. Carnal hearts, they think, that the kingly power of Chriſt would be a diſturbance to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but certainly, the government of Chriſt in the heart brings the only reſt and quiet unto the ſoul. Now theſe and ſeveral other particulars might be named, but joyning theſe with the other that went before, you may ſee, how Chriſt is reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Six Conſequences from the former Doctrine. I. The difference between beleevers and the ſtate in Adam. II. We ſee the difference between Civility and true holineſs. III. We ſee the reaſon why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vowes and Covenants to live holily come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. IIII. It is impoſſible for any to be a member of Chriſt, and not be holy. V. Be not hindred from comming to Chriſt, albeit you have not ſo much holineſs as you deſire. VI. Hence we learne how to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand Chriſt aright.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW there are divers conſequences that flow from hence. As,</p>
               <p n="1">I. Hence we may ſee the difference between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of beleevers now, and that in <hi>Adam,</hi> and we may ſee that beleevers are in a better condition then <hi>Adam</hi> was Why? becauſe the image of God in which <hi>Adam</hi> was made, it may be ſaid to be natural, that is, that onely comes from God the creator, from him making him a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and giving him the perfection that was ſutable to the nature of a rational creature, there was al the holineſs that <hi>Adam</hi> had. Al the holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was in <hi>Adam,</hi> was but only that that was ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto a rational creature in ſuch a condition, and when he had it, then he was to trade, as it were, with that ſtock himſelfe, and to live by the ſtock that God gave him at firſt, only a general concourſe of Gods providence there was, ſo long as he did continue to obey God, that Gods providence ſhould go along with him, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him in his eſtate, And this was the eſtate of <hi>Adam.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:44661:178"/>But now the holineſs and righteouſneſs that the ſaints have, comes from another principle, it comes not from God as creator meerly, but from God through a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, from God through his ſon, it comes through Chriſt and it is a partaking of the ſpirit of Chriſt, and of the father, and the holy Ghoſt in Chriſt. We do not read of ſuch a kind of work in <hi>Adam,</hi> only the text faith, <hi>the Lord made him according to his own Image,</hi> but that he ſhould have his holineſs through union of the ſecond perſon in trinity, and through the ſpirit that is ſent into him by the father and the ſon, and to be made a temple of the holy Ghoſt we read not. He had the principle of holineſs to be in himſelf, but we have our principle of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in Chriſt ſtil, we are not truſted with our holineſs though holineſs be conveyed to beleevers, yet they are not be truſted with the principle of their holineſs, but it is in Chriſt ſtil. But <hi>Adam</hi> was not ſo, <hi>Adam</hi> ſo long as he ſtood God would go on with a concourſe of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him, but God never made ſuch a covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> that he ſhould have a principle of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs laid up in his ſon and that by faith he ſhould fetch out this principle of Holineſs.</p>
               <p>I wil ſhow you the difference between the ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> and a beleever, by this ſimilitude; a father puts a ſtock into his ſons hand, but ſo, as he tels him, here is your portion, I wil give you your portion, go and trade with it aſwel as you can, but you are never like to have any further from me, but only what you get by this ſtock: This was the ſtate of <hi>Adam,</hi> God gave <hi>Adam</hi> a ſtock of holineſs, a ſtock of righteouſneſs at Firſt, and bid <hi>Adam</hi> trade with it and that that he ſhould have to live upon ſhould be that that he got by that ſtock, and thats al. But now it is true, we have al loſt that ſtock, and turned banckrupt, now God is pleaſed to ſet up ſome of mankind again, there are others that muſt periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nally, and be caſt into priſon, and there rot in priſon
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:44661:178"/>
eternally, but to ſome God is pleaſed to give another ſtock, yet ſo, that he wil not truſt them with it wholly, but thus, he gives them Grace, and bids them go and trade with it, but ſo as he gives them it by little and little, and reſerves the maine ſtock in his Sons hand, and ſaith, go and trade with this, and as you want come to Chriſt, if you have any loſſes in your Trade come to my Son, and you ſhall have it made up again, you muſt give account to my Son every day. And now one that is ſet up and hath a little ſtock, but ſo that he muſt give account to his Father every day, and then he being faithful though he have loſſes he wil make up his loſs, and ſuch a courſe is taken as he ſhal never break again, for he ſhal have a continual ſupply in his Fathers hands, or unkles hands, or freinds hand, and this is the caſe of beleevers, though it is true, they are not made ſo perfectly holy as <hi>Adam</hi> was; we have not ſo great a ſtock as <hi>Adam,</hi> but our ſtock is better, for together with our ſtock of holineſs we have a ſupply from Jeſus Chriſt, and that we have ſhal be taken care of by him, that we ſhall not looſe what we have, and if there be the leaſt impairing of what we have, he will make it up again. So that our holineſs comes now from another ſtock, is upheld by another principle then then ever <hi>Adams</hi> was, and this is the Reaſon why the Saints never fal as <hi>Adam</hi> did, becauſe the holineſs that they have can never decay, they can never turn banckrupt ſo as <hi>Adam</hi> did, but they have the principle from Chriſt, the water of life that ſhal flow into their hearts from Chriſt eternally.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another Conſequent that follows from our Reſt in our Sanctification in Chriſt is this, hence we ſee the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between civility, or Morality, and true holineſs, true Sanctification, you have heard, I ſuppoſe, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſpeak of civil Men, and men that have meer morality, and live civilly, I make no Queſtion but you have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred what they have meant, what is this morallity? We
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:44661:179"/>
hear Miniſters ſpeak of Morral men, ſuch a one is a good Morral man, or ſuch a one is a civil man, what would they have more? Would they not have men civil? Do they not live inoffenſively? Pay every one their own, they do no wrong, they come to Church and ſerve God, what would they have more? And yet we hear Miniſters ſay, this is not enough, to be civil, and not to live in ſcandalous ſins as others do, this is not enough. Now it is true, this is not enough, and by that which you have heard out of this point, you may diſcern that it is not enough, and that there is more required then ſo, and by this you may know the difference between your civil and moral man, and thoſe that have true holineſs and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. Your civil man and moral man, he hath reſtraining Grace, that keeps in his Corruption, and what he doth it is through ſtrength of Reaſon, he ſees in Reaſon that to live in ſuch a wicked courſe as others do, to Lie, Swear, Drink, be unclean, Cheat and Cozen, the light of Nature teacheth that this is a ſin. And ſo the Heathen, the moral Philoſophers, that is, thoſe that by the light of Nature ſaw the evil of ſuch notorious vices, and ſaw what the Rules of Nature were for the guiding of their manners. So I ſay your civil men, they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſomwhat of the light of Nature, they ſee by the light of Nature that they muſt not live in ſuch and ſuch ſins as others do, and it is better to live juſtly, yea, and to be bountiful to the poor, many reach ſo far, I but all this goes no further then the common light of Nature, then the prudence and Reaſon of a man as a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may carry him to.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay what is more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is more, there muſt be Sanctification of the Heart through the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, there muſt be a principle of Grace that muſt come into the Heart, as a fruite of the Second Covenant that God hath
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:44661:179"/>
made with ſinners in Jeſus Chriſt, through the miſtical union that the Soul hath with Jeſus Chriſt, this is higher. Now when a Soul comes beyond civillity, it is wrought upon by God after this manner. I come now to ſee the breach that there is between God and my Soul, what my eſtate is by Nature, that I am a Child of wrath, I am dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, though I have not lived ſo wickedly as ſuch and ſuch have done, yet I ſee my ſelf a Child of wrath, and an heir of Hell and death notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that I have done. And I ſee that only through the bleſſed Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt this breach is made up, and I can only have union with God through him, and his Spirit of Sanctification that muſt come to my Soul, through the Covenant of the Goſpel, I muſt have my Heart raiſed up to God in an other manner, not only to live civilly but holily, to have the Image of God renewed in me through the Spirit of Chriſt, and ſo to live the life of Chriſt, and feel continual ſupply to come to my Heart through Chriſt, to feed upon the promiſes through the Covenant of Grace, and thereby to have my Heart Quickned more and more, and to perfect my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the fear of God through the promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, This is more then the civil and meer morral man can come unto.</p>
               <p>Your civil man is known, Firſt, In this, that what he doth is meerly according to common prudence and light of Nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The cheif of his Religion it is in Negatives, that he is not ſo bad as other men.</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, If he have any thing poſitive, it is but in outward actions, ſerving of God, but as for being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the myſtery of Godlineſs, and power of holyneſs, of the neceſſity of a Mediator, of the need of continual ſupply of Grace from Jeſus Chriſt, this he ſeeth not. And further, This civil man he is not burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Corruption, with the remainer of corruption,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:44661:180"/>
but thinkes himſelf in a very good condition. Indeed he ſaith, he muſt be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, but I put this to any civil man in the world, what need doeſt thou Find of Jeſus Chriſt for thy ſanctification? art thou ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with thoſe inward corruptions in thy ſpirit, that the world can take no notice of? And doſt thou goe groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under thy Corruption, ſo as to ſee the need of the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, a ſupply of the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt to help thee againſt thy Corruption, and ſanctify thy heart, this thou art not acquainted withal, this is a point above thee, and therefore in this point we come to ſee the difference between civility and true holineſs. We come to ſee by this, that Godlineſs and holineſs it is a myſtery. The ſcripture ſpeakes of a myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and of the power of Godlineſs, and Godlineſs is therefore powerful, becauſe it is a myſtery. If we muſt have our holineſs from Chriſt as a mediator that Chriſt is firſt filled wsth holineſs, and our ſoules by faith muſt draw our holineſs from him, then certainly Godlineſs is a miſtery, the Godlineſs that muſt ſave ſoules is a myſtery, beyond that which ordinary men of the world underſtand. Few underſtand what is the way of God in conveyance of grace unto the ſoules of thoſe that he intends eternal life unto.</p>
               <p>The way of God in conveyance of grace unto the ſoul, is not this, in giving you reaſon to underſtand that ſuch and ſuch things are naught, and therefore for your own eaſe and quiet in the world you muſt live civilly, but the way of God is to reveal his ſon to you, and reveale a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of union with Chriſt, to be made a member of him, and to draw virtue from him as from a head, and to ſee a fountain of life from him flowing into thy heart continually, ſo as to repaire to Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond perſon in trinity, made man for thy ſoul. I ſay, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to him as the fountain of al grace to be conveied from him unto the ſoul, here is the miſtery of holineſs
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:44661:180"/>
that is beyond al the civility and morality in the world. Oh that you did but by this point underſtand ſomewhat of the miſtery of Godlineſs and that it might cauſe but ſome ſuſpicious thoughts in the hearts of thoſe that have lived but civilly and morally, that for many years together it may be have bin good neighbors, pay every one their own and no body can accuſe them for wrong, but Oh that they would bethink themſelves, wel, I have lived thus and thus long, but hath my ſoul bin acquainted with the myſtery of the Goſpel, to fetch virtue from Chriſt as a mediator? And have I a ſtock of grace from him to trade by, that what I trade by I have from him? Have I found the burden of my inward corruption? And have I got eaſe and reſt by virtue of the promiſes of the Goſpel? And have I ſearched into the Covenant of Grace, and found there promiſes to convey comfort unto my ſoul? Hath my heart been exerciſed after this manner? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if thou haſt not, thou knoweſt not what the way of the Goſpel is, what an evangelical life is, what is a true evangelical life. When the ſoul is inabled to live upon Chriſt, that thou feeleſt thy heart live upon Chriſt, ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drawing virtue from Chriſt, for the mortifying of thy corruptions and quickning thy heart in the way of holineſs, this is a true evangelical life, and that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſequence drawn from this, That Godlineſs is a myſtery, and beyond civility and morality.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Another Conſequence that may be drawn is this: Hence then we may ſee the reaſon that many people, their vowes and Covenants to live better then they have done, doth ſo often come to nothing; our Sanctification is in Chriſt, our overcoming of corruption it is by virtue of Chriſt, then from hence, I ſay, we ſee plainly the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the vowes and covenants of ſo many people, that do promiſe in the time of their ſickneſs, or when they are in any danger at ſea to live better. Oh, ſay they, if ever God reſtore us, they wil never live as they have done, they wil live better then heretofore they have done,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:44661:181"/>
and though they do not ſpeake thus for the preſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive people, but ſpeake what they do intend, their hearts are fully reſolved to leave their ſins, and to live better, yet when they are reſtored they live as before, when they come to land, whatever promiſe they made at ſea yet they live as before. What is the reaſon of this? Becauſe they are not acquainted with the miſtery of Godlineſs, they know not how to fetch ſtrength from Chriſt to inable them to keep their reſolutions, they do not know where the ſtock of grace lies. They depend upon their owne reſolutions and promiſes, they do not ſee the ſtrength that ſhould come from Chriſt, and hence it is that al their vowes and covenants come to nothing. As we reade of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> he ſaid, after his ſtrength was gone from him, that he would go forth as before, but the Lord was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him: So you think, if God reſtore you, you wil live better, and overcome your corruptions, you wil not live as before, I but the ſtrength of Chriſt is not with you, you do not know that the ſtrength of Chriſt is departed from you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> had grace from God as the creator, it is not for us to pray to God for grace as creator of al things, but we muſt ſeeke God in Chriſt, and ſee how the fulneſs of al the Godhead dwels bodily in him, and ſo we come to have ſtrength againſt our corruptions.</p>
               <p>I remember a <hi>German</hi> Divine writing to his friend, profeſſeth that before he underſtood the way of the Goſpel, he had vowed and covenanted a thouſand times againſt ſome ſins, and could never overcome them, but after the Lord revealed to him the way of the Goſpel, that al ſtrength comes in by exerciſing faith in Chriſt, and ſeeing the father giving his ſon to ſupply al grace, and exerciſing faith in the Covenant of grace, he found ſtrength againſt his corruptions, ſo that he was able very comfortably to walk with God in the wayes of holineſs.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:44661:181"/>
So Chriſtians that underſtand the way the Goſpel wil find abundance of power againſt their corruptions, more then they did with al their ſtriving and paines taking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; though we ſhould ſtrive and take al paines we can, yet we muſt know that this wil not do it, without the exerciſe of faith in Chriſt, for the helping of us againſt our corruptions.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. From hence followes alſo, that it is impoſſible any ſhould be a member of Chriſt, but he muſt needs be holy, becauſe Chriſt is our ſanctification, Chriſt is Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ful of holineſs, that holineſs might be conveyed to his members; therefore thoſe that have yet their luſts in the ſtrength of them, that have not the reſt of ſanctification in ſome meaſure, ſurely the ſpirit of Chriſt is not in them theſe cannot ſtand together, to be a member of Chriſt, and yet to walk in Filthineſs, theſe cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For Chriſt is the great prophet that teacheth, and the great King of his Church to governe, and certainly whatſoever is brought to him, muſt be taught of him, and governed by him, it is impoſſible to have communion with the fountain of al holyneſs, and yet for al that to live under the power of ſin, this cannot be.</p>
               <p n="5">V. From hence followes likewiſe, That for any to be hindred in their comming to Chriſt, becauſe they have not that meaſure of holineſs that they deſire, this is a great temptation for any ſoul that ſees the want of grace, the want of ſanctification, and labors under the burden of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, for any ſuch ſoule to be hindered in the coming of it unto Chriſt, becauſe it hath not what grace it doth deſire, this is a very ſtrong and a dangerous temptation of the devil, which we are to take heed of. It is a moſt irrational temptation, and yet this is that that many poor ſouls are troubled withal, they think thus, when we exhort them to come to Chriſt, alas, what ſhould I do, poor creature, I am ſo vild, I have ſuch a wicked and ſinful
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:44661:182"/>
heart, how ſhould I come to him? were I thus and thus, had I power over my corruptions as others have, then I could be bold to come to Chriſt. Now what a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this? Chriſt ſaith, come and I wil give you reſt, you ſay, if I had reſt I would come. Chriſt is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of al holineſs, therefore to be kept off from Chriſt, becauſe I want holineſs, is a very great temptation; it is the work of the Divel, ſhould I be kept off from Chriſt for want of holineſs, when Chriſt is appointed by God the father to convey holineſs unto the heart, to renew the image of God in mee, and to draw it more beautifully then ever it was before?</p>
               <p>Remember the point you have heard, that Chriſt is our ſanctification and al holineſs comes from him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely my want of holineſs ſhal not drive him from me; but draw me to him. Let me not ſay as <hi>Peter,</hi> Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depart from me, for I am a ſinful man, the truth is he ſhould rather have ſaid, Maſter, come to me, for I am a ſinful man. So many poor ſoules wil ſay. Lord, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to Chriſt, becauſe I am ſo ſinful, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt come to him the rather becauſe thou art ſo ſinful.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. From hence we learne how to underſtand Chriſt aright, and how to beleeve in Chriſt aright; ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they underſtand Chriſt only as a ſavior, that they muſt be pardoned by Chriſt, and ſaved by him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from hel by him, but you muſt underſtand him to be ſanctification to you alſo, you muſt truſt in Chriſt to ſanctifie you, as wel as ſave you, if you underſtand Chriſt aright, you muſt underſtand him to be a ſanctifyer, as wel as a ſavior &amp; if thou beleeveſt in Chriſt aright, thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in Chriſt as a ſanctifier as wel as a ſavior; &amp; thus much of the conſeqences, that follow from the Reſt of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in Chriſt.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOW for the laſt thing that I propounded, To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and draw beleevers to come to Chriſt, and in this I ſhal endeavour to take away the many hinderances of the ſoul in comming to Chriſt for ſanctification, and alſo give ſome incouragements to the heart to come to Chriſt for ſanctification.</p>
               <p>You ſee, here is the way to get power over corruption, and to get grace, namely to come to Chriſt, Yea ſay you if I knew I were a member of Chriſt, and had intereſt in Chriſt then I could come to Chriſt for power over my corruption, and for grace, but I am afraid I have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For anſwer to that, which is the main ſtop and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of faith, know that if thou haſt but a heart to come to him for grace that is as good a ſigne of thy inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt as any ſigne thou haſt, that is as good a ſigne of evidence of intereſt, as any thou canſt expect.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:44661:183"/>2. You muſt come to him for grace, and if thou haſt not intereſt before, yet thy very comming to him now for grace to help thee againſt corruption, that very act of thine may give thee intereſt in Chriſt. What is it that unites thee to Chriſt? what is it that makes a member of Chriſt? what is it that gives intereſt in Chriſt? It is but the coming to him, as you heard before in the point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is you wil ſay, If I had a right to him.</p>
               <p>If thou comeſt now to Chriſt, to get power over thy corruption, and to get grace, I ſay, though thou hadſt no intereſt before, this very act may give thee intereſt in Chriſt, and therefore be not diſcouraged but come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wilt thou ſtay til thou doſt find power againſt thy corruption, before thou wilt come to him, then thou wilt never have power againſt thy corruption, for you have heard, that it is Chriſt that is the foundation of thy ſanctification.</p>
               <p>And then for incouragements, there are a great many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent incouragements for poor ſinners to come unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The conſideration of the neere union that there is between Chriſt and us, in regard of his very humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. is a very notable ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for our incouragement. <hi>For both he that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth and they that are ſanctified are al one, for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to cal them brethren,</hi> He that ſanctifieth, and thoſe that are ſanctified are al one, what is that. That is, Chriſt is of the ſame nature that thou art, Chriſt hath taken our nature upon him, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead doth dwel bodily in him, ſo that thou mayeſt goe with the more boldneſs. He that is thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not aſhamed to be called thy brother, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not look upon him as at ſuch an infinite diſtance as thy judge, but looke upon him as thy brother, as one with him. He that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:44661:183"/>
are all one, Thou and Chriſt together are one body. Now what incouragement is here to expect Sanctification from Chriſt to overcome corruption becauſe Chriſt and you are made one body, of the ſame Nature, and ſo neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united and made one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider that if Chriſt did love thee ſo dearly as to lay down his life for thee, ſurely he wil never ſuffer thee to periſh in thy corruptions, ſhall Chriſt come down from Heaven, and lay down his life for poor Souls, and ſhall he ſuffer them to die under their corruptions? Now if a many ſhould be willing to lay down his life for a Child and he ſhould come and ſee the Child lie in the dirt, ready to be ſtifled in the dirt, could he go by and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Child? This is our caſe, Chriſt hath come and laid down his life for poor ſinners, but yet they ſee themſelves ready to be ſtifled by their corruptions and they cry to him for help, ſurely Chriſt wil not paſs by and let thee lie in thy filthyneſs, to be ſtifled in thy corruption when thou waſt ſo dear to him, as to lay down his life for thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another incouragement is this, know, that thy corruptions are the burdens of Chriſt as wel as thy burdens, they are burdens to thy Soul, and burdens to Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore he doth certainly pitty thee under them, and wil help thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If Chriſt had ſo much pitty as to heal the bodies of poor creatures here in this world, ſo that there was no diſeaſed body that ever come to him, but he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, ſurely then Chriſt wil heal Souls, Chriſt hath more regard to immortal Souls then to bodies.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt knows what it is to be tempted, for Chriſt had no Corruption in him, yet Chriſt knows what it is to be tempted, and Chriſt knows by his own experience what a Burden it is to be tempted to ſin, and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:44661:184"/>
ſurely Chriſt cannot but know what a Burden it is to be overcome with ſin. Now Chriſt himſelf had the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of being tempted unto ſin, and Chriſt knows that thy Burden is greater then his burden was, and that it is more to be overcome then to be tempted to ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knows how to pitty thee.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Know it is to the Honor of the Death of Chriſt, the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and the life of Chriſt, to help thee againſt thy Corruptions, and quicken thee in Grace. Chriſt accounts his reſurrection and life, to be honored, when he ſees the virtue and power of it to be in the Hearts of beleevers. Wherefore then, if it be to the Honor of the Death, and reſurrection, and life of Chriſt, it may be incouragement to thee to go to him for help againſt thy corruptions. And this remember when thou art upon duty, and begging for help againſt thy corruptions, carry this Rule with thee. I come to pray againſt my ſins, but together with my prayer, let me act my Faith. I come to hear the word, I but together with my hearing, let me act my Faith upon Chriſt as Mediator to help me againſt my corruptions. I come to the Sacrament, but I come to have communion with Chriſt to help me againſt my corruptions. Oh! act thy Faith in the promiſes of the Goſpel, through the bleſſed Covenant, and thou ſhalt find abundance of ſtrength againſt thy corruption, and Reſt unto thy Soul.</p>

Be not ſatisfied with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances further then you meet with Chriſt. III. Come not ſo much for comfort and peace as for holineſs. IV. Be ſenſible of new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. V. Converſe with Chriſt in the Goſpel.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Shal now only add a word or two for the concluding of this, and ſo go on to the next reſt that is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p>Come to Chriſt for the Reſt of Sanctification, for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, for the truth is, there is no true holineſs, but that which we have by our coming to Chriſt. The Scripture ſpeaks of true holineſs, there may be abſtaining from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins, and performance of many duties, but no ſaving holineſs, but that that is had from God through Chriſt as Mediator, no true holineſs til the Soul comes to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Chriſt, and have it that way, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs that we have by exerciſing of Faith upon Chriſt as the Head of the Covenant, that indeed is the myſtery of godlineſs, that is the true godlineſs, that is godlineſs in a myſtery, which the world is not acquainted with, that is the power of godlineſs, the powerful holineſs that comes by Chriſt. And indeed that is the Reaſon why there is ſo much ſtrength of Grace in the Hearts of the Saints, becauſe they have it from Chriſt, it is from the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt that is in him, and Chriſt is the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> his ſpirit is a ſpirit of might. Common gifts have not that ſtrength as this holineſs that comes from Chriſt hath, the holineſs that is from Chriſt, that is the only ſupernatural holineſs,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:44661:185"/>
it is that that is the divine Nature, whereas that kind of abſtaining from ſin and performing of duties, that civil men have, and that comes in by common gifts, that is not the divine Nature, they have it but in a natural way, what they have is by ſtrength of Reaſon and argument, but that which comes in by the exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt, that is ſupernatural, that is of a divine Nature, and that is aboundant, aboundant is the holineſs that the Soul comes to have in exerciſing of Faith in Chriſt. In draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grace from Chriſt the Heart grows more in the way of Holineſs, it exerciſeth much more Faith in Chriſt, in a little time, then it did in a long time before, though perhaps thoſe were truly godly before and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt yet for want of a right underſtanding how all Grace comes from God through Chriſt, and ſo draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it that way, they did not thrive in the waies of Godlineſs. That text in the 3 of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and the 17. Is moſt admirable for this, the Apoſtle praies. <hi>That Chriſt might dwel in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in Love.</hi> there is the ſtrength of Grace, when Chriſt dwels in our heart, <hi>That you may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height, and to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledg, that ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> Here is the fruite of it, that you might be filled with all the fulneſs of God, a ſtrange ſpeech, had it not been in Scripture who durſt have expreſt himſelf thus that by comming to know God in Chriſt, you may come to be filled with all the fulneſs of God in Chriſt. It were very much to ſay thus, by knowing God in Chriſt, you may come to have God, that is ſomwhat, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that you may come to be filled with God, that's more, But Thirdly, That ye may come to be filled with the fulneſs of God, that is yet more, yea, Fourthly, That you may come to be filled with all the fulneſs of God. What a gradation is here, that ſhews the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:44661:185"/>
uſe of knowing God in Chriſt. Whereas now, other men and women, that onely are taught in their childhood to ſerve God, they muſt ſerve God, and they are reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from many ſins, and they performe duties, they wil pray, and come to heare, but not being acquainted with the myſtery of the Goſpel, and drawing holineſs from God through Chriſt, how far are thoſe from having this text made good in their hearts, that is, from being filled with al the fulneſs of God. Whereas afterwards they come to have more cleere underſtanding of the miſtery of Godlyneſs from Chriſt: then they come to enjoy communion with God more then ever they did, whereas before they were ſtrangers to God, now they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, now they feele Gods fulneſs come more fully into their hearts then before, now they feele a fulneſs from God, and ſo come by degrees to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is ſaid in this text, to be filled with al the fullneſs of God.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of al the emptineſs, ſcantineſs, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs that is in your heart, is for want of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, how God hath filled Chriſt with al fulneſs, from whom wee are to receive grace for grace, and by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace from Chriſt we come to have permanent holineſs and laſting holineſs, and this indeed is the reaſon, as heretofore ye have heard, why the grace of the ſaints en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever, and they can never faile, whereas the grace of Adam did faile, becauſe the one comes from God through Chriſt, and the other did not, that did not come from God through a mediator ſo as this did, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is permanent and the other is not. But of that I ſpake before, only we bring it in now, as a further mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to make us ſeek for holineſs in Jeſus Chriſt, this reſt of ſanctification.</p>
               <p>Some rules I wil briefly propound by way of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as helps in ſeeking of grace and ſanctification in Chriſt. As,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:44661:186"/>Firſt, Labor to get a ſence of your want of holineſs and of your need of Chriſt for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the exerciſing of your ſelves in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, be not ſatisfied with the ordinances, any further then you meet with Chriſt, be not ſatisfied with a prayer, or with hearing, but think with your ſelves, what have I of Chriſt here, that I told you in the opening of the point, how Chriſt was the ſanctification of the heart, becauſe the bleſſing of al the ordinances is by having Chriſt there. There are two or three things more that I would commend unto you.</p>
               <p>The Firſt, Is this, in ſeeking Chriſt do not come ſo much for enlargement, for comfort, for peace, as for ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, you ſeek your peace for holineſs, rather then ſeek holineſs for peace, this is a ſpecial rule of direction to thrive in ſeeking for ſanctification by Chriſt. Many Chriſtians, they ſeek to have Chriſt, but why? that they might have peace, that they might have comfort, and they make their holineſs but ſubſervient to their peace and comfort, They think thus, except I be holy, I cannot have peace, therefore I wil labor for holineſs that I might have peace. But a true gracious heart wil rather ſay thus, the more holineſs I have, the more peace I have, and therefore, I wil labor for peace, that I might have holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, One labors for holineſs, that he might have peace, and the other labors for peace, that he might have holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Now thoſe Chriſtians that labor rather for peace, that they might have holineſs, wil more thrive then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that labors for holineſs, that they might have peace. It is true indeed, it is one good motion to labor for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe it wil bring peace, I but it is a ſtronger mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to labor for peace that we might have holineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we ſeeke to Chriſt, we ſhould ſeeke rather for holineſs and ſanctification from Chriſt, then that we might have peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:44661:186"/>Would you know the reaſons you ſay, you tel us that Chriſt is our ſanctification, but we have not found ſuch ſanctification from Chriſt to increaſe holineſs; but what is the Reaſon? you have exerciſed your faith upon Chriſt mainly that you might have peace, that you might have enlargement and comfort as others have, and that is the reaſon that your holineſs is ſcant, if you had exerciſed your faith in Chriſt that you might have holineſs, then you might have had more peace. Saith Chriſt, be it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee according to thy faith, ſo in this caſe, Chriſt ſaith to every beleever, be it according to thy faith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what you exerciſe your faith, ſo be it unto you. As, do you exerciſe your faith for peace and comfort, and mainly for that? you have ſome peace and comfort, but you ſhal not have ſo much holineſs: but do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe your faith for holineſs moſt? then you ſhal have moſt holineſs. Now certainly a true chriſtian prizeth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs rather than peace, and I know no ſurer argument for the truth of grace, and the difference between an hipocrite, and one that hath true grace, than this, the hipocrite would have holineſs that he might have peace, I but the true beleever would have peace, that his peace might increaſe his holineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another rule is this, Though Chriſt doth give in grace, increaſe of ſanctification and holineſs, yet do not depend upon what Chriſt gives in for the preſent, but ſtil keep thy heart ſenſible of the need of new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. There is many Chriſtians, when they have been at duty, and have exerciſed faith upon Chriſt for this reſt of ſanctification, and have got ſomewhat, ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, and ſome quickening of ſpirit, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in the way of God, here they reſt, and now they think they are wel, they think to live upon this ſtock a great while. But now we are to pray for our daily bread, and to depend upon Chriſt for new ſupplies of grace and holineſs, every day, every moment, according to every worke that we are ſet about, to go to Chriſt for new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:44661:187"/>
as if we had nothing at al given us before, and Chriſt wil be wel pleaſed with this, that though we have never ſo much Grace, yet to go to him to renew our faith, as if we had none at all, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as ſtrongly; I do not mean that we ſhould apprehend that we have none at all, but as ſtrongly and eagerly to exerciſe faith upon Chriſt for new ſupply of holineſs, as if we had none at all, and indeed thoſe that ſeem to have none, exerciſe Faith in Chriſt moſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For Concluſion of all, take this as a Rule, Thoſe Chriſtians that do moſt converſe with Jeſus Chriſt in the bleſſed way of the Goſpel, thoſe will increaſe moſt in Grace, and they have this by way of Sanctification: I wil give you but only that one Scripture, in way of alluſion to apply it to this, in <hi>Acts,</hi> 4 13. <hi>Now when they ſaw the boldneſs of</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>and perceived they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledg of them that they had been with Jeſus. Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> had much boldneſs, they had ſtrength of Grace, they had much boldneſs notwithſtanding all their oppoſition. But how came they by it, they were unlearned men, ignorant men, poor weak men in regard of their naturals, and yet they had got aboundance of Grace, ſo as to make their profeſſion of Chriſt with boldneſs, notwithſtanding all the rage of their potent adverſaries, and the people wondred how they could get ſuch ſtrength as they had, but ſaith the text, they took knowledg of them, that they had been with Jeſus. It was that that did ſo raiſe their ſpirits, it was that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, and inlarged their Hearts ſo much with Grace that they had been with Jeſus, that they had converſed boldly with Chriſt. Now I would apply this in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſence, that as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did grow to that height and ſtrength of Grace by converſing bodily with Chriſt, much more may Chriſtians grow to a height, ſtrength and fulneſs of Grace by much converſe with
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:44661:187"/>
Jeſus Chriſt. Converſe with Chriſt in a way of Faith, and that will mightily enlarge thy Heart in Grace. And the truth is, when you ſee any Chriſtian, that perhaps his natural parts may be but weak, but yet you ſee him grow in Grace mightily, he hath a mighty large Heart for God, and hath much ſpirit in prayer, and his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very holy and convincing, you may conclude this man and this woman to have been with Jeſus Chriſt, that is, converſt much with Jeſus Chriſt. Would you know whence it is that you ſee many poor Chriſtians not long ſince, how they have grown in holineſs, and you think they have got a great deal more than you have got, they can depend upon God more, and can rejoyce in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, and they have more ſpiritualneſs, and more Savor in their converſation, and find a great deal more ſweetneſs in the waies of God than you, whence is it? Their means perhaps is not more, their outward means, their parts in Nature is not more, whence grows it then? Would you know whence? They have been with Jeſus, they converſe much with Chriſt, and you may have it too.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon why you have been a profeſſor perhaps twenty or thirty years, and you now grow old, and yet perhaps weak ſtill, and it is as much as can be ſaid of you that there is ſome hope that there is ſome good in you, but for the ſeeds and ſparks of divine Nature that are in others ſpirits, there is no ſuch matter at all, what is the Reaſon? becauſe they are not acquainted with this drawing of Sanctification from Chriſt by the exerciſe of Faith. Wel, thus much ſhal ſuffice for this Reſt, the reſt of Sanctification, the Reſt of holineſs, that brings abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Reſt unto the Heart, according as that encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo doth holineſs encreaſe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Sheweth that a beleever hath Reſt in Chriſt in all troubles he can meet with in the world, which is laid out in four Particulars, <hi>1.</hi> All afflictions are at his diſpoſal. <hi>2.</hi> In him the curſe is taken away. <hi>3.</hi> They ſtand with Gods love. <hi>4.</hi> They are meaſured by God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw we come to the fifth Burden: you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the fifth Burden was, The Burden of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction, come to me, ſaith Chriſt, you that are burdened with the guilt of your ſins, you that are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with Legal performances, you that are burdened with remaining corruption that is in you, come to me and I will give you Reſt; Now what Reſt have been from all thoſe you have heard. Now Laſtly, come to me, you that are under the burden of afflictions, for that is a Yoak as we opened when we handled the point of being Laden, the Burden of affliction, bodily afflictions, or ſpiritual afflictions: come to me, and you ſhal have Reſt. Now the ſpiritual afflictions have been ſpake of much in the handling of the former burden, and yet may be ſomwhat more afterwards when I ſhal come to ſpeak about ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual deſertions, thoſe kind of afflictions, that many times are upon Chriſtians, and there is Reſt unto their Souls in regard of them. But for the preſent all that I ſhall ſay now is, about outward afflictions, come to me, and you ſhall have Reſt, The afflictions of ſickneſs and poverty, and perſecution, and diſhonor, and trouble here in this world. For we are to know, that there is Reſt in Chriſt even in regard of this, and abundance of Reſt. Thoſe that are acquainted with the myſtery of godlineſs, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:44661:188"/>
the way of Gods Grace in Chriſt, though they may meet with much trouble in this world, yet they find abundance of Reſt of ſpirit in Chriſt, in regard of thoſe troubles.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Chriſt did not ſay, come to me, and I will preſently free you from all trouble, that you cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but come to me, and this I will promiſe you, that you ſhall have Reſt in your ſpirits, your condition may be as troubleſome in regard of outward things here in this world as any, but this I wil promiſe, I will ingage my ſelf for, that you ſhall have Reſt unto your ſouls in all conditions whatſoever that you ſhall be put into. And is not this a bleſſed Reſt? Eſpecially in regard of theſe times, ſuch times as theſe, ſo ful of diſtractions when men are ſpoiled of their goods, and perſecuted, and ſtill we are afraid every day when all theſe outward comforts may be wreſted from us. This point, perhaps, may be to ſome more ſeaſonable than to others, what, to tel ſome of the burden of the Law, this is a ſpiritual thing, and they have no Skil of it, to have Reſt from the trouble of the Guilt of ſin, this is ſpiritual, and they have little Skil of that, to have Reſt from the remaining corruption in their hearts this is ſpiritual ſtill, and they have no skil of that neither. I but now I come to ſpeak of that which all of you will be ſenſible of, in regard of outward afflictions, I, that is ſomwhat, that the Hearts of all men wil ſay, it were a good thing to be in Chriſt, to have Reſt in regard of outward afflictions. Now it is the way of God to draw men to his Son in their own way, to ſhew the good that is in his Son in that way which themſelves are ſenſible of, and thoſe that are ſtrangers to Chriſt may be ſenſible of this, as to think, that if that be made out, that is here promiſed, that indeed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a bleſſed thing to be in Chriſt, now that I ſhal open to you, only I will give you one Scripture more for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and then proceed to the opening of it. It is in the 16. of <hi>John</hi> and the 33. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you, that in
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:44661:189"/>
me ye might have peace, in the world you ſhal have tribulation, but be of good chear I have overcome the world.</hi> This is a ful text, Chriſt foreſaw that his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould have a great deal of affliction in this world, and this is ſpoken to them but a little before Chriſts death, a little before Chriſt was to die and go from them, he tels them of a great deal of affliction they ſhould have in the world. But ſaith Chriſt theſe things have I ſpoken, in me ye ſhal have peace, though ye have trouble in the world, I will not free you from trouble, but I wil give you peace to your Souls in thoſe troubles, in me ye ſhal have peace, though in the world you have trouble, and be of good chear I have overcome the world, though you ſhall have troubles in the world, yet I will give you Reſt, for I have overcome the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be of good chear, for all the troubles that you ſhal meet withal, ſhall not take away the peace of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Reſt of your Souls.</p>
               <p>So that then here the point that now we are to enter upon, is, That in Chriſt there is Reſt in the midſt of all afflictions, of all troubles that we can meet withal in this world. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, A beleever coming to Chriſt, muſt needs have Reſt whatſoever afflictions he meets withal, for when he is come to Chriſt, he may in him come to know that there is no affliction either doth or can befal him, but is at the diſpoſe of him that is his Father, and the Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and is not this a great deal of Reſt? To know that what comes unto me, though there be ſuch and ſuch inſtruments, evil inſtruments to bring trouble upon my eſtate, or name, or otherwiſe, yet I know that all this is by the wiſe ordering and diſpoſing of that God that is the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, and in him is now my Father. Were it that you could be all aſſured of this now, that you ſhould never hence forward, have any loſs in your eſtate, any ſickneſs in your body, any trouble
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:44661:189"/>
in your family any way, or ſhould have no affliction ever befal you, but it ſhould be at the diſpoſe of your owne father, he ſhould diſpoſe of it, and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wiſe, and Loving Father; or take the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reſt Friend that ever was in the world, and if I ſay, you ſhould be made ſure of this from heaven that you ſhal never have any affliction in this world, but it ſhal be by his diſpoſe, would not this bring reſt into your hearts, though you had a diſquiet heart before? Would there not be a great deal of calme, quiet, and reſt upon your ſpirits? I make no queſtion, but if ſuch a voice ſhould come from heaven, and you ſhould know it were a voice from heaven, and not a deluſion, ſaying, be of good comfort, you that are ſo troubled, for feare of loſſe and outward afflictions, be of good comfort, thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any one minute of an hour of trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction more than thy tender father or mother ſhal be willing unto, would not this give reſt and quiet unto thy ſpirit? Certainly, hadſt thou faith to know, that al comes from thy father in Chriſt, for when we are come to him he is our father in Chriſt, and al that comes to us is from him through Chriſt, thou couldſt not but have reſt and peace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By comming to Chriſt, there is reſt from outward afflictions, for in him there is the taking away of the curſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is Chriſt that hath taken away the curſe of al afflictions, and therefore there muſt needs be reſt unto the ſoul t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eacheth beleevers to worme afflictions (as I may ſo ſay) to worm them, that is to get out the worm that is there. The trouble that eates the heart in affliction, it is the worm of the Curſe, for al afflictions are part of the curſe in themſelves, in their owne nature, as they come unto us, if out of Chriſt, I ſay, they are part of the curſe. Now the main trouble and burden of an affliction, it is the curſe
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:44661:190"/>
the ſecret curſe that is in them, but now, when thou art come to Chriſt, though the outward bulk of affliction may be as big as it was before, yet the curſe ſhal be taken away, the worm, the trouble that did eat thy heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhal be taken away, and therefore there muſt be reſt in that way. Suppoſe there were a Snake that ſhould wind about thine arm, that would affright thee; but if thou didſt come to know certainly, that the ſting were taken out, thou wouldeſt be quiet if thou wert a wiſe man, though perhaps a child, or a weak woman, might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, but a wiſe man, that underſtands what he doth if he knew that the ſting is out, would not be affraid, now know O thou beleever, that upon thy comming to Chriſt the ſting of al affliction is taken out, there is nothing of the ſting in it. Affliction may make a noiſe, as the Bee doth when the ſting is out, though there were never ſo many bees about your eares, if you knew the ſtings were out, you might be quiet. The core of affliction is taken out as ſoon as thou art come to Chriſt. As ſome ſoares in the body do put the body to a great deal of pain, there is ſome core in a wound, ſome malignant humor that runs in a wound, that puts a man or woman to a great deal of pain: But now if this core, this malignant humor, be taken out by the Chyrurgeon, there wil be eaſe and reſt. So I ſay by thy coming to Chriſt, the core, the malignant humor of affliction is taken out, the ſting, the curſe is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and thou muſt exerciſe faith for the taking away of this, and the way to exerciſe faith to take away the ſting and core of every affliction is this, to look upon Chriſt under al his afflictions, as being made a curſe for thee, for that indeed may trouble, thoſe paines that were upon Chriſt, that were in his body, and the poverty that he endured, and the diſhonor that he ſuffered, there was a curſe in them, and Chriſt he takes away the curſe by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curſe. As you know, when a Bee ſtings, many times it leaves its ſting behind it, ſo the curſes of the Law, the Law came to ſting Chriſt, as it were, and left the curſe
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:44661:190"/>
behind it upon him, ſo that now the curſe is removed from beleevers. It is a good obſervation that one hath about the burnt offering in the Law, we read of the burnt offering, that it was to continue burning al night. So now beleevers in the night of their affliction, they ſhould exerciſe their faith upon Chriſt for burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Oh conſider, though thou haſt ſad nights, ſad and very greivous nights, and thou lieſt toſſing and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, canſt not ſleep, art in pain and trouble, what ſhal give thee reſt? Now if thou couldſt but exerciſe faith in Chriſt, who typified out the burnt offering that was to burn al night, I ſay, this was typified, that Chriſt is to be looked upon as burning under the wrath of God al the night of thy affliction, to take away Gods wrath in thy afflictions, and there's no ſuch reſt as this.</p>
               <p>Perhaps in the time of affliction, ſickneſs, loſſe of eſtate, and ſpoil of goods, there comes one friend, and another, and ſaith, you muſt be content, and it is the hand of God, and others are afflicted as wel as you, and it is the portion of Gods children, theſe are ſome things to quiet the heart. I but theſe are but poor, cold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, to tel them they muſt be content, and it muſt be ſo, and they muſt endure it, theſe can never give reſt to the ſoul, except you can put your friend upon exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of faith in Jeſus Chriſt, here is the way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your friends when you go to viſit them in ſickneſs, loſs of eſtate, or ſpoiling of goods, to put them upon this, to exerciſe faith upon Chriſt, that hath born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and by his death hath taken away the curſe of al afflictions. It is true, there is a night of affliction now upon you, I but there is Chriſt that is the burnt offering that burnes al night to take away the wrath of God in thy afflictions. There is no ſuch way to worm your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to take away the ſting of affliction, as to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:44661:191"/>
faith upon Chriſt, in whom the curſe of affliction is taken away, and when that is gone, now there is reſt to the ſoul. A ſick man that lies toſſing and tambling and cannot Reſt, and is in ſuch diſtemper in his fleſh, and hath ſuch a Malignant humor in his body, when the Chyru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>geon comes and applies any ſalve to take away that malignant humor, he ſayes, when the Chyrurgeon comes again, Oh Sir, now I can Reſt: And ſo ſaith a Chriſtian, when he hath been vexed with ſuch and ſuch afflictions, and he hath gone and excerciſed faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, for he ſees he was under the curſe of the Law, and Chriſt hath taken away the curſe of al afflictions, when he hath thus acted faith upon Chriſt, now he can be at reſt, and he can ſay, now I ſee the ſting taken away. As I ſaid in the reſt of ſanctification, Chriſt was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the Braſen ſerpent was, the great ordinance of God for the healing of them that were ſtung by the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerpents, that if they did but look upon it, they were healed, thoſe that were ſtung with the fiery ſerpents, the very looking upon the Braſen Serpent were healed, it being the ordinante of God appointed for that end. So I may apply it here, thoſe that are ſtung with affliction, Chriſt is ſet up as the ordinance, as the Braſen ſerpent to take away the venom of the ſting of thy affliction. No queſtion but thoſe that were ſtung with the fiery ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, they felt an intolerable pain, and when they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon the braſen ſerpent, they had reſt, and they could ſay, now I have eaſe, now I have reſt; So the curſe of God in affliction is the venom, and thoſe that are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to rave, and are almoſt mad in affliction, and are ſo extreamly diſcontented, it is to be ſuſpected concerning them, that the curſe of God is upon them.</p>
               <p>But now another that is under as great an affliction as thou art, can lie ſweetly, and contentfully, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God under any affliction, thou wonderſt at it that he can lie ſo joyfull, bleſſing of God under ſo much
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:44661:191"/>
affliction, the Lord hath taught him a way to worm his affliction, the Lord hath taught him a way to deliver his ſoul from the curſe of the affliction, the curſe is gone and he by exerciſing faith upon Chriſt hath comfort in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the curſe, and this gives him Reſt in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Come to Chriſt and thou ſhalt have Reſt in thy affliction, becauſe that then not only the curſe ſhal be removed, but there ſhal be this bleſſing upon it, that there is no affliction ſhal befal thee; but ſuch as may ſtand with Gods love, yea, ſuch as ſhal come out of Gods love, and from Gods love, love ſhal be the great principle, not only of thy affliction, but from thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to know this, that though there are theſe and theſe afflictions upon me, yet I thank God there is no want of Gods love upon me, for I would not know any thing of Gods love then, if any ſpiritual judgment were upon me, but theſe are no other but what may ſtand with the love of God. Yea, but that is not ſo much, that they may poſsibly ſtand with the love of God, but this, that they come out of Gods love, and come from Gods love, they come as really from the love of God, as any thing that thou doſt injoy in this world. Thou thinkeſt, if thou haſt a proſperous voyage, that God loves thee, if thou beeſt recovered out of an affliction that God loves thee, but I ſay, that the Lords bringing thee into affliction, may ſtand with greater love to thee than deliverance out of affliction to another. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that are upon the Saints now, they do not come out of revenge, as they do upon the wicked, the ſame, affliction that comes from the principle of love to thee, may come from the principle of hatred to another, and although therfore in the outward view they be the ſame yet they are infinitely different in the principle. It is not ſo much what we ſee, or what wee feel, but from whence that comes that we ſee or feel, and indeed, a gracious heart is ever ſollicitous about the principles of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:44661:192"/>
thoſe things that do befal it, if it be an outward mercy, I but, what is the root of it? is the root of it the love of Chriſt to my ſoul? there is an affliction upon me, but what is the root of it? is the root of it Gods diſpleaſure, Gods wrath, Gods hatred? Oh that were dreadful. Although the affliction were vaſt, if there were a hundred tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if the root of it were Gods diſpleaſure, Oh that were terrible: I but then when he ſhal come to know that the root of it were not from Gods wrath, but his love, that is joyful.</p>
               <p>You wil ſay, doth not God ſometimes chaſtiſe his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for their ſins? what if the affliction comes to me for my ſin, can I have reſt then? It is true, if the affliction come to me for my tryal, then the root may be from his love, but I have ſinned againſt God, I have abuſed my eſtate, my conſcience tels me, I have not honored God with my eſtate and therefore the Lord hath taken it from me, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me of al, and can I look upon this as the root of Gods love?</p>
               <p>Now to that I anſwer, though this be a certain thing, and will and muſt hold, notwithſtanding all the late, wanton conceits of men, and all the vanities of their thoughts which ſhal come to nothing, yet this ſhal hold, that God doth chaſtiſe his people for ſins and offences, that is not a part for me to enter upon, yet ſtil it holds forth this, That at that time when God chaſtiſeth for ſin, at that time their afflictions come out of love, from a principle of Love, even when God chaſtiſeth them for their ſins.</p>
               <p>But you wil ſay, hath not Chriſt ſuffered? This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from the ſufferings of Chriſt, when he hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
               <p>For this, it is true, Chriſt hath ſuffered, and ſo hath ſwallowed up al Gods revenging wrath, and the curſe, I but, doth Gods wrath hinder me from having the fruit of Gods Love. You wil ſay, it comes from Love, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:44661:192"/>
God chaſtiſeth not for ſin, No? Why all Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging wrath may be gone, and yet God may chaſtiſe for ſin and chaſtiſe out of Love too, at the ſame inſtant. You know it is ſaid of <hi>Zachary,</hi> becauſe he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, the Scripture ſaith in <hi>Luke,</hi> 1. <hi>For this Cauſe thou ſhalt be Dumb,</hi> For this Cauſe, becauſe thou didſt not beleeve: And ſo, therefore, becauſe of their ſin they may be chaſtiſed. Cannot a Father chaſtiſe his Child and yet do it out of Love? not only it may ſtand with his Love, but becauſe of Love; he would not meddle with him, but let him go, if he did not love him. Certainly, affliction may come out of Love, though for ſin, but for God not at all to chaſtiſe them, would be an argument of hatred, therefore for him to chaſtiſe is an argument of Love rather than hatred.</p>
               <p>If ye be not chaſtiſed, you are baſtards and not Sons, ſo that you are to look upon him, though God be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, yet ſtil it is out of love. Theſe two may ſtand together, he may be diſpleaſed with thy ſin and with thee, and yet he may love thee in the very act wherein he manifeſts his diſpleaſure againſt thy ſin, and he may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his diſpleaſure againſt thee and againſt thy ſin out of love to thee. And therefore the people of God may have Reſt in all their afflictions, becauſe it is out of Love. Here is an affliction, but from whence doth it come? It comes from Love, now I am at Reſt. If thou canſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Faith in Chriſt in thy affliction, that I know that through Chriſt God Loves me, and this is the efficacy of the merit of Chriſt, that in al thy afflictions thou ſhouldſt injoy the Love of God, this wil give Reſt unto thy Soul, and until this be, al the arguments in the world will never do it. Come to thoſe that are afflicted and ſeek to pacifie and quiet them with any argument in the world, it will not do it, until they exerciſe Faith upon Chriſt, and that makes them to know, here is the love of God to my Soul in this affliction, and then it is no matter whether I
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:44661:193"/>
be in proſperity or adverſity. If God give me an eſtate there is love in that, if he take it away, there is Love in that, if he give me health, there is Love in that, if he caſt me into ſickneſs, there is Love in that, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the great myſtery of godlineſs, that the heathens were not acquainted with this Myſtery of godlineſs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We have Reſt in all afflictions through Chriſt, becauſe in his merit it is that al afflictions are proportioned both for the time of coming, and the time of continuing, and the meaſure and the manner of them, they are proportioned by the infinite wiſdome of God for the good of a beleever, God proportions all ſo as ſhal be ſuitable to the condition that thou art in. As a wiſe Phyſitian knows the ful condition of thee that art his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient at all times, therefore he doth weigh every dram, and take care that there be not one drop put into thy cup that he gives thee to drink, more than ſhal ſuit with thy condition, for thy good, and takes care it ſhal be given at a ſeaſonable time, and that it ſhall not abide one moment longer than it hath wrought out the Corruption, wrought out evil, and brought good unto thee, now this is a mighty Reſt unto thy ſpirit. If ſo be a patient is to deal with a Phyſitian that is learned, and wiſe, and experienced, that I know he underſtands the ſtate of my body, to the ful, to a hair in every thing, and I know that what he gives he is very careful about, and what he gives he doth it himſelf, doth not truſt the Apothecary, but goes himſelf and ſees how many drams is put into it, and hath it weighed before his Face, truſts not others but weighs it himſelf, and ſo obſerves every circumſtance that is ſuitable to his patient; now would not this be quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto thee? Perhaps the potion may be bitter, but if thou knoweſt that it comes from the hand of ſuch a Phyſitian, that is thus careful, and thus skilful, and thus experienced, this cauſeth Reſt and quietneſs in thy Spirit. So truly, by the Eye of Faith thou mayſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:44661:193"/>
God; though God uſeth creatures as inſtruments, yet the Lord will not truſt them, but ſtands by and looks upon every dram that is put into the cup. If a man ſhould give that which is Poyſonous or ratsbane to a dog, he cares not how he gives it: but now if there ſhould any venemous thing be put into Phyſick, then the Phyſitian needs to look to every dram, that it be proportionable to the ſtate of the Body. So I ſay, when God diſtributes his afflictions to the wicked he cares not for any proportion, he cares not for doing them good by it. But now when he comes to beleevers in Chriſt, God is careful to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every dram, for the time of it, that it ſhal come but juſt when God would have it, and continue not one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment longer than God would have it. That Scripture is enough to quiet the ſoul in regard of any affliction, Which you have in <hi>Peter</hi> 1.6. <hi>Wherein ye rejoyce, though now for a ſeaſon, if need require, ye are in heavineſs through manifold temptations.</hi> Though now for a ſeaſon, for a little time now, ſo the words are, though for a little time now, it is but now and it is but a little time, and then too if need be, Mark what a bleſſed parentheſis this is, it is worth Gold, this very Parentheſis is, wherein ye greatly rejoyce, though now for a ſeaſon you are in heavineſs, it will not be much it ſhal be but for a little time, and that if need be, as if God ſhould ſay, were there not need, you ſhould not be for one inſtant of time in heavineſs, this is that you muſt learn from this Scripture. Would it not be Reſt to your Soul if you could hear God out of his word this day, ſpeak to every one of you, and ſay, did not I ſee th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re was need, you ſhould never have any minute of ſickneſs in all your life, this were enough to give Reſt unto the Soul, and though there be need, it is but for now, for a little time. I do not find in the original that the word ſignifies ſeaſon, but a little now, and if need be, ſo that you ſhall not be in heavineſs, no not for a little now, unleſs there be need, this is a great deal of Reſt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Reſt beleevers have from Chriſt in outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions diſcovered in four Particulars more. <hi>1.</hi> They ſhall be to good ends. <hi>2.</hi> They ſhal be ſanctified to the good of beleevers. <hi>3.</hi> God is preſent with his people in Chriſt. <hi>4.</hi> There is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of preſent good in affliction.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIfthly, Come to me, ſaith Chriſt, and you ſhal have Reſt in your affliction, for your afflictions ſhall have very good ends, God will never bring affliction upon you, but he wil have gracious ends that he will aim at in your affliction. God hath ſomwhat in his Eye that he aimes at more than you imagine, and the thoughts of this may bring a great deal of Reſt unto the Soul, we cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies underſtand what thoſe Particular ends are that God hath in the tryal of his people, but we muſt ſatisfie our ſpirits in this, certainly God hath very gracious ends, what a great deal of trouble is there now in the nation, how many godly people are ſpoiled of their goods, and wounded and made havock of, we think it is nothing but the rage of wicked men, certainly, God hath gracious ends in it, and God is about to bring to paſs ſome glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing, though we cannot underſtand it now, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one that is acquainted with the mind of Chriſt that can be ſatisfied with this that when God brings tryalls he hath glorious ends to bring about, and why ſhould not I be willing to be ſerviceable to Gods ends, to thoſe great ends that God hath to bring about? Wherefore was I made and brought into the world, but only that God may ſerve himſelf of me, and therefore if God hath need of my affliction as I may ſo ſpeak, why may not I be quiet
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:44661:194"/>
in my affliction, for my affliction may be ſerviceable to God. Now this is that I profeſs, that I may be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God and his ends, now if thy heart be right in this, that thou wouldſt be ſerviceable to God and his e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds, then thou muſt not chooſe the way how God ſhal fetch about his waies and ends upon thee.</p>
               <p>Somtimes God may ſerve his own ends in thy proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I but at other times he wil ſerve himſelf in thy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: now if thy Heart be gracious indeed, thou wilt be as willing that God may fetch about his praiſe in thy affliction, as in thy proſperity, in this a gracious heart rejoyceth. Now if thy heart be right in this, then if God take away thy eſtate and bring thee into affliction thou mayſt be quiet in this that God wil be ſerved by my wants, and bring about his ends that way, though thou mayſt think that God may be better ſerved by thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity then by thy affliction, I but know this, that God hath glorious ends to bring about, and muſt have his people ſuffer to bring about thoſe ends, and therefore this may Cauſe Reſt and quiet of Spirit.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Come to me, ſaith Chriſt, you ſhal have Reſt in trouble and affliction, for not only you ſhal be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to God for his ends, but al your afflictions ſhal be Sanctified for your own good to you, God intends it and you ſhal have a Sanctified uſe in them and this is more then removing the curſe, the Sanctified uſe notes a mighty operation of God in the affliction to fetch out good unto thy Soul.</p>
               <p>Now this were a large thing, to ſhew what is the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied uſe of affliction, the purging out of Corruption, the quickening of Grace, yea, if it were but the tryal of Grace, it were enough to bring quiet to the Soul, for the Scripture ſaith, the tryal of Faith is more precious then Gold, the tryal of Grace, the exerciſe of Grace, if
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:44661:195"/>
it were but the exerciſe of the Grace of Faith that thou art put upon in thy affliction, there may be more good to thee in that then thou canſt imagine. There is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the exerciſe of any one Grace, but eſpecially in the exerciſe of Faith, then in all proſperity in the World, if God ſhould give thee a kingdome it may be thou haſt loſt thy land, thy Houſe, and goods, I but God hath put thee upon the exerciſe of Faith now more then ever. Now know that the exerciſe of one Grace is more then a kingdome to thee, better then all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity in the world, thy friends may come and tell thee this and that, I but doſt thou feel thy affliction Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to thy Soul? Doſt thou feel thy Heart drawn nearer to God? Doſt thou find the diſcovering of thy Heart more, and the purging out thy Corruption more, and thy Heart quickned in the waies of God more? This wil bring Reſt unto thy Soul, for you have heard, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is Reſt unto the Soul, therefore Sanctification of afflictions unto the Soul, muſt needs bring Reſt unto it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, God is with his people in time of affliction by Chriſt, thou haſt the preſence I ſay of God in thy affliction, Gods gracious preſence is only in his Son, no man comes unto the Father but by the ſon, it is true both waies, as no man comes to the Father but by Chriſt, ſo the Father comes to no man in a gracious way but by Chriſt, now Gods gracious preſence wil be with them in his Son. I will be with thee in the fire and in the Water, that is enough for the Soul to Reſt upon, that God wil be with them in the Fire and in the Water, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the Water I wil be with thee, and through the flouds they ſhal not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt through the Fire thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhal the flame kindle upon thee, for I am the Lord thy God the Holy one of Iſrael thy Savior.</hi> I wil be with thee ſaith God, ſo that there is Gods preſence to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:44661:195"/>
ſupport them, now as ye heard al the promiſes are yea and amen in Chriſt, in Chriſt they are al made good, ſo that Reſt in affliction comes by Chriſt. As now in ſickneſs, art thou in ſickneſs, ſee what Reſt there is in Chriſt in time of ſickneſs, in <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 41.3. <hi>The Lord, wil ſtrengthen him upon his Bed of ſorrow, thou haſt made all his Bed in his ſickneſs,</hi> Surely then thou wilt lie ſoft, thou ſhalt have Reſt there. Many poor ſick people complain they cannot Reſt, they cannot lie ſoft, their Bed is not made well, their Bed is not made eaſie, high in one place, and low in another, now here is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that God wil make the Bed of his people in the day of their ſickneſs, in the day of their trouble, what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is here of Gods love; that we may know how God tenders his people? And though it be but a hard bed, a flock bed, a bed of ſtraw, you may lie eaſie if God make it. And here you ſee in this pſalme God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to make the bed of his people, now if you have not Reſt, it is becauſe you have not been acquainted with the promiſes, nor not exerciſed Faith upon the promiſes, ſuch a promiſe will bring Reſt unto the Soul, when you cannot Reſt otherwiſe. And ſo I might give you Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures likewiſe for poverty, the many ſweet expreſſions that we have in Scripture for the quieting of the Heart in poverty the ſpecial regard that God hath to poor people, eſpecially ſuch as are godly who are in poverty. I might name abundance of Scriptures, as that, <hi>The Lord hath choſen the poor to be Rich in Faith,</hi> And the Goſpel is preached unto the poor. And not many mighty, and noble, but the poor receive the Goſpel. And in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>I will leave in the midſt of thee, an afflicted and poor people and they ſhall truſt in the Name of the Lord,</hi> The Lord hath reſpect to them, and if thou be godly and poor, thou maiſt ſearch into Scripture and find abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of expreſſions to give thee Reſt. Chriſt was made poor that he might make us Rich, doth therefore poverty trouble thee? Conſider that Chriſt he was poor, and the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:44661:196"/>
poverty of Chriſt it was to make me Rich, and all the evil of my poverty is taken away by Jeſus Chriſt, If poor people would exerciſe their Faith upon the poverty of Chriſt, that he was made poor, for ſo he ſaith, though he was the Lord of all, yet the foxes had holes and the Birds had neſts, but he had not whereon to lay his Head. Chriſt had not ſo good a Houſe as any of you, Chriſt had not a cottage to dwel in, but went abroad from one place to another, therefore exerciſe but thy Faith upon the poverty of Chriſt, and that will help thee in thy poverty. And ſo for diſhonor, the Scripture is very ful that way too. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall ſpeak all manner of Evil againſt you for my names ſake.</hi> And that in <hi>Peter, Bleſſed are ye when ye ſuffer reproach, for the Spirit of Glory ſhall Reſt upon you.</hi> Now all theſe promiſes in time of affliction is made to us in Chriſt, and therefore come to me, ſaith Chriſt, you ſhal have the vertue and efficacy of al theſe promiſes.</p>
               <p>Indeed carnal Hearts, they do not think the promiſes of the Goſpel worth any thing, and they think that if they can have no more comfort but that, this is poor comfort, but thoſe that are godly, they know that there is abundance of comfort and ſweetneſs to be had in the promiſes of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Eightly, The abundance of preſent good that Chriſt will bring unto the Hearts of the Saints that ſhal ſwallow up all the trouble of affliction, the abundance of preſent good ſhall ſwallow up al the bitter of affliction. As thus, now ſuppoſe you have a little Vinegar, one drop of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar if there were a pinte or quart of the ſweeteſt liquor in the world put into it, could you taſt the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar? the taſt would be taken away: So now the Soul that comes to Chriſt, and exerciſeth Faith upon him, Chriſt brings in the preſent good, beſides that that it ſhal have hereafter, the preſent good that is enough to ſweeten all
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:44661:196"/>
things, and to ſatisfie the Soule. Chriſt ſets up ſuch a light in the Heart, that ſuch a one hath light in the midſt of darkneſs, though there be darkneſs round about, yet there is ſuch ſatisfying Contentments in Chriſt, that is enough to overcome all the bitterneſs that is in the world, ſuch a one though never ſo afflicted, yet is able to ſay with David, as before, <hi>My Soul return unto thy Reſt.</hi> And indeed all afflictions, to thoſe that are beleevers, and have the exerciſe of Faith, I do not ſpeak of all beleevers, one may be a beleever and yet not have Reſt in affliction, but if he be a beleever and have the exerciſe of Faith, then all afflictions wil be no more, but as if a poor Woman were married to a great prince, and had all the nobles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and all kind of dainties upon his table, and he ſhould hear the Rain rattling upon the tiles, that is in the windy wether abroad, what would this be to hinder the Reſt of ſuch a ones ſpirit? The truth is, had we but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Faith, all outward troubles in the world would be no more to us, no more trouble then this is. If thou wert come to Chriſt, and married to him, and come to ſup with him, there would be that ſatisfaction unto thy Soul in Chriſt, that al outward troubles would be no more at all, then the rattling of the Rain upon the Tiles to ſuch a one that hath al content within dores. You are not yet acquainted with ſuch bleſſed things that are in Chriſt who are troubled at any thing in the world, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the ſoul that is acquainted with that, will ſay, it hath enough, let what will become of my eſtate, of my body, of my Houſe, of my Lands, yet I have enough in Chriſt, how have the bleſſed Martyrs cryed out of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reſt in Chriſt? I remember one German Martyr, that ſuffered much from his enemies, he ſaid, I verely beleeve that there is not a merrier Heart in this world then my ſelf. As <hi>Jacob</hi> had more bleſſed viſions when he lay abroad in the night, and laid his Head upon the ſtone; So the Children of God have more viſions many times of God in the times of their affliction, their Veins are filled
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:44661:197"/>
with blood, and bones with marrow, al the capacities of their ſoul is filled with ſpiritual joy, and that keeps out affliction. As if a man have filled his belly with good chear, and eſpecially if his veines be ful of blood and bones ful of marrow, he can bare hardneſs the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So when the ſoule comes to Chriſt, he fils the veins ful of blood, and bones ful of marrow, I mean thus, he fils al the capacities of the ſoul with heavenly conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that bares out any trouble or afflictions whatſoever, and thus there is peace and reſt unto the ſoul.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containeth the concluſion of the laſt doctrine in the two former Chapters, ſhewing how unbeſeeming a thing it is, for a beleever to be troubled in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere might be divers other things named, as by coming to Chriſt there is the ſpirit of prayer, and ſo the ſoul hath reſt when it can go and power forth it ſelfe to God in prayer. But to conclude this.</p>
               <p>You ſee by al this, how infinitely unbeſeeming it is for a beleever, one that profeſſeth himſelfe come to Chriſt, to be troubled in affliction, Chriſt makes this promiſe, that if he comes to him he ſhal have reſt. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely either thou art not come to Chriſt, or thou haſt not exerciſed faith in Chriſt, Either thus, thou chargeſt thy ſelf for one not come to Chriſt, or one that hath not exerciſed faith upon Chriſt, or elſe thou chargeſt Chriſt with unfaithfulneſs by thy diſcontentment. For Chriſt here profeſſeth to the wotld that al that come to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:44661:197"/>
him ſhal have reſt, that thou haſt not reſt, but that a little trouble doth diſquiet thee, thou either art not come to Chriſt, or doſt not exerciſe faith, or elſe thou chargeſt Chriſt with unfaithfulneſs, now if thou haſt not reſt, which way wilt thou have it fal? Oh let it fal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy unbeleeving heart, let it fal upon this, that thou doſt not renew thy act in comming to Chriſt, for it is not meant of coming to Chriſt at the firſt, but of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the act of coming to Chriſt, and this exhortation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Godly men and women, that have already come to Chriſt by faith, I ſay, it belongs to them to come to Chriſt, come you to Chriſt again and again. Now thy diſquiet and trouble in time of affliction doth argue, that thou art either no beleever at al, or haſt not renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the act of faith. My brethren, the wayes of many, that we hope are beleevers, are ſuch, as if ſo be they had no uſe of faith at al in time of affliction, or as if faith were only of uſe to ſave their ſoules, and not to give reſt unto the ſoul here in this world, or as if it were of no other uſe, but as a ſun dial in a garden, to ſhew the time of the day when the ſun ſhines, but in ſtormy clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy weather, there is no uſe of it. And doſt thou make no more uſe of thy faith, then of the ſun dyal in thy garden, to ſhew thee how it is with thee in the day of proſperity, but the truth of thy faith ſhould be a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, to make thee know how it is between God and thy ſoul in a cloudy day. And therefore you having now heard, where the reſt in regard of outward affliction lies Oh, do you repair hither for reſt, you vex, and fret, and trouble your ſelves, Why? becauſe you have not as others, others can have rich tables, fine houſes, and accomodations, and al things for their content in this world, but know that now the Lord hath preſented to you a way how to have reſt to your ſouls in time of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Labor to know Jeſus Chriſt that was made poor for you. There is as plain a way for you to come to Chriſt
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:44661:198"/>
as for the richeſt in the world, and Chriſt wil be as ready to entertain you as the richeſt. It is likely that al your endeavours may come to help you ſo forward as to make you rich in this world, I but, to give reſt in this world, nothing can do it but your coming to Chriſt. And above al, this may ſerve to help us to lay up againſt the time of trouble, that however things go in this world yet you may have reſt to your ſoules in Chriſt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Sheweth that beleevers are often under inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and ſpiritual deſertions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Shal now ſpeak of the reſt that Chriſt gives unto the ſoul in regard of inward afflictions, thoſe inward afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſpiritual deſertions, that is, when the Lord ſhal be pleaſed to abſent himſelf from the ſouls of his people, and leave them in ſuch darkneſs of ſpirit, though they be beleevers, &amp; have intereſt in Chriſt, yet they may be left for a time by God, ſo as their ſpirits wil be extreamly afflicted with ſorrow, and feare, and trouble, becauſe of Gods abſence from them, and indeed, there is no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction like to this affliction, there is no condition ſo reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as this condition is. Now this is that that every one is not acquainted withal, carnal people think that theſe afflictions are only conceits, imaginations, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, but the ſaints know what theſe afflictions are, that they are the moſt real afflictions in the world, theſe ſpiritual deſertions, for God to withdraw himſelf from his people. We read of ſuch an affliction that a godly man was much exerciſed withal, and that was <hi>Heman</hi> that was the penman of the 88. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> you read it in the title, it was a ſong or <hi>Pſalme</hi> for the ſons of <hi>Korah
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:44661:198"/>
To the cheif muſician upon</hi> Mahalath Leannoth, Maſchil <hi>of</hi> Heman <hi>the</hi> Ezrahite <hi>a Pſalm of</hi> Heman. Now this <hi>Heman</hi> was one of the greateſt men exerciſed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions upon the face of the earth. If you read this Pſalm at your leiſure, you ſhal find; that though he was a man very Godly yet exceedingly exerciſed with ſpiritual deſertions and afflictions, the Lord withdrew the comforts of his ſpirit from verſe the firſt, ſaith he, <hi>Oh Lord God of my ſalvation I have cryed day and night before thee.</hi> verſe the 3. <hi>My ſoul is ful of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.</hi> verſe the 4. <hi>I am counted with them that go downe into the Pit. I am as a man that hath no ſtrength, free among the dead, &amp;c.</hi> verſe the 7. <hi>Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou haſt afflicted me with al thy waves.</hi> What a ſtrange expreſſion is this of a godly man? And then there is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions mingled with ſpirituall afflictions, verſe the 8. <hi>Thou haſt put my acquaintance far from me, thou haſt made me an abomination unto them, I am ſhut up and I cannot come forth.</hi> verſe the 9. <hi>My eye mourneth by reaſon of affliction</hi> verſe the 13. <hi>But unto thee have</hi> I <hi>cryed Oh Lord, and in the morning ſhal my prayer prevent thee. Lord why caſteſt thou off my ſoul, why hideſt thou thy face from mee?</hi> God had hid his face from him verſe the 15. <hi>I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up, while I ſuffer thy terrors I am diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> He was acquainted with theſe ſpiritual afflictions from his youth up verſe the 16. <hi>Thy fierce wrath goeth over mee, thy terrors have cut me off.</hi> What expreſſions are here for a godly man? and when we read this Pſalme and know it is the Pſalme of a Godly man ſpeaking how greatly he was afflicted, we may be put in mind of that ſcripture. <hi>If the righteous ſcareſely be ſaved, where ſhal the ungodly and the ſinner appeare.</hi> Where ſhal the ſinner appeare, if ſuch a man that was wiſe, that the ſpirit of God ſaith of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was one of the wiſeſt

men that lived upon the face of the earth, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, excerciſed with inward afflictions, the Lord hiding his face from him. In 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 4.31. There the Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes of this <hi>Heman</hi> that was thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, ſpeaking of the wiſdom of Solomon, it is ſaid, <hi>He was wiſer then al men, then</hi> Ethan <hi>and</hi> Heman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that it appeares by that, that <hi>Heman</hi> was one of the wiſeſt, for elſe it could not be an argument of <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdom that he was wiſer then al men, and that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in wiſdom above any other, And yet this man had the terrors of God upon his ſpirit. Therefore let none of you, when God ſeemes to withdraw himſelf, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict you, ſay, that your condition is worſer then ever any ones was, when any of you have ſuch thoughts as theſe are, remember the 88. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and when you think of the great greif, ſorrow, and trouble that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and are ready to think that it is greater then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then go and read the 88. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> As <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay when they were in any trouble, go and ſing the 46. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> So when you are in trouble, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and greif, then ſay, come let us go and read the 88. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and remember who was the penner of that <hi>Pſalm, Heman,</hi> a godly man, and what his condition was, and then thou ſhalt ſee that thy condition is not ſo ſad as his was.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containeth Seven Directions how a beleever may get Reſt from Chriſt in ſpiritual Deſertions. Firſt, Look upon Chriſt as once in the ſame condition. Secondly. Look to Chriſt as ful of Grace and Goodneſs. Thirdly, Look to Chriſt as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate at the right hand of God. Fourthly, Look to Chriſt for fulfilling the promiſe of ſending the Comforter. Fifthly, Go to Chriſt as at firſt in thy Converſion. Sixthly, Keep good thoughts of God. Seventhly, Reſolve never to take Reſt in any thing elſe beſide Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WELL but now though thy condition be as bad as his, yet there is Reſt in Chriſt to be had for thee, and Chriſt cals thee to come to him that he may give thee Reſt. I ſhal not need to ſpend time in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening what this reſt is in Chriſt in this particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contained in what was ſaid before, as in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the guilt of ſin, the burden of the Law, and the remainer of corruption, and the like, thoſe things if they were made good to the ſoul they might give reſt. But now al that I intend to ſhew ſhal be, what courſe the laden ſinner muſt take in this caſe to have reſt in Chriſt, for the ſoul it is delivered from the guilt of ſin, and the wrath of God, though it cannot apprehend the love of God, and the pardon of the guilt of ſin, yet it hath it already, but now to help ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted ſoul in this caſe, that it might begin to have the uſe of the good that there is to be had in Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by way of direction to have eaſe in that greivous condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:44661:200"/>Firſt, Labor to exerciſe thy faith upon Chriſt, as one that was once in the ſame condition in ſome degree and ſome meaſure as thou thy ſelf art in, that is a good way for one that hath ſpiritual deſertions. I ſay, to look upon Chriſt as one that for the preſent was in this afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Chriſt was deſerted, and this breeds a great deale of reſt to the ſoul in outward afflictions. If one that is in poverty exerciſe faith upon Chriſt who was poor, as I told you before, <hi>The Foxes have holes and the birds have neſts but the ſon of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> To exerciſe faith upon Chriſt as poor, doth help to give eaſe and reſt unto the ſoul, under the burden of the affliction of poverty? ſo when a ſoul feels the burden and trouble of ſpiritual deſertions the ſoul ſhould look up to Chriſt as one that was under ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, as when he was in the garden, and profeſſeth that his ſoul was heavy to the very death, and that he began to be amazed with the apprehenſion of the wrath of God. Now when thou art in a combate and ſtrife in thy ſpirit with temptation, know that Chriſt was in ſuch a combate and ſtrife, he ſweat drops of blood. It may be the ſoul is in combate, and in trouble and gets to prayer, and the ſoul is in a ſweat, remember what a ſweat Chriſt was in when God withdrew himſelf from him, and eſpecially, when he was upon the croſs, there he tels you plainly that he was forſaken <hi>My God My God why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> Thou thinkeſt that God hath withdrawn himſelf from thee, no he wil not withdraw himſelf from thee ſo much as from his ſon in one regard, that is, thou haſt not ſuch a dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods withdrawing from thee as Chriſt had, for Chriſt would never have cryed out elſe. My God My God why haſt thou forſaken mee? This was a real thing, Chriſt did not ſpeak at uncertainties, he did feel a withdrawing of the influence, ſweetneſs, and comfort of the Lord; though ſtil he had union with
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:44661:200"/>
him by Nature and he was his Father as before, but the Human Nature did not feel the influence of the Grace, and ſweetneſs, and the ſhine of the Favor of God as at other times, and therefore he cries out, My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Exerciſe thy Faith upon Chriſt as one that was in ſpiritual deſertions. It is true, perhaps that Chriſt did not come to determin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he was utterly forſaken as thou doſt, but Chriſt was apprehenſive of Gods withdrawing himſelf, and therefore this may bring eaſe and Reſt unto thy Soul, and the rather becauſe that his being ſo forſaken it was to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie thy being forſaken, it was to take away the curſe of thoſe deſertions that thou haſt in thy ſelf. Such deſertions as are in any afflictions materially, they are a curſe, they are ſuch things as in their own Nature are a curſe, Chriſt being ſo forſaken by the Father doth take away the curſe, that is in ſpiritual deſertions, and there is no ſuch way for the ſoul that is in ſpiritual deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to look up to Chriſt, and to conſider that Chriſt was forſaken for my ſake, Chriſt was forſaken for mee, that I might not be eternally forſaken. So there is theſe three things in looking up to Chriſt as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken. Firſt thou ſeeſt that the Lord that is the beloved ſon of God was forſaken, forſaken by God. Secondly, here thou maiſt ſee the merit of this that it was to ſanctifie thy forſaking, that thy forſaking might not be a curſe to thee. Thirdly, It was that thou mighteſt not be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally forſaken by God, ſo that by exerciſing of thy Faith thus upon him thou maiſt get a great deal of Reſt and eaſe unto thy ſoul. A carnal Heart when he finds this terror of ſpirit he runs to his company, Muſick, good chear, and buſineſs of the world, but a gracious Heart runs to Chriſt, and goes to him that was thus forſaken of the Lord for him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If thou beeſt under the burden of ſpiritual deſertions, then look up to Chriſt as being ſuch a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:44661:201"/>
as is ful of Grace and goodneſs, there being ſuch a fulneſs of the Grace of God in him, as makes him a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient object for the Faith of adherence, when he cannot be unto me an object of the Faith of evidence. I ſay, we are to exerciſe Faith upon Chriſt when we are under this Burden of ſpiritual deſertions, thus, we are to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt as being the fulneſs of the Godhead, of all the treaſure of Grace and goodneſs, having ſo much of the Grace and mercy of God in him, as ſhal make him a fit object of the Faith of adherence, though he is not now to me an object of the Faith of evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>What is the meaning of that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I mean by the Faith of evidence, that I am able to ſay that Chriſt is mine and I have an argument to perſwade my conſcience, that he is mine, that is the Faith of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but yet there is enough in Chriſt to draw forth the Soul to Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t upon him from the Faith of adherence, that is thus: Though I cannot draw arguments to rely upon Chriſt as mine, yet I wil cleave to him, and adhere to him, I know there is no help but here, and therefore here I will cleave and cling, here now is the Faith of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence. Now becauſe there is ſo much Grace in it therefore Chriſt may be a great object of thy Faith of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, when thou canſt not ſee him to be an object of the Faith of evidence, and that is a way to help the Soul in time of ſpiritual deſertion. When many poor ſouls are under ſpiritual afflictions and deſertions, they think of no other Faith to reſt upon Chriſt, but barely upon the faith of evidence and when they have evidence to their Souls, that Chriſt is theirs, and that from ſome fruits of Grace in them, then they rely upon him, but now learn that there is ſuch a Faith, the Faith of adherence, and Chriſt may appear to a Soul as a fit object to the Soul for the Faith of adherence, when he cannot be to it an object of the Faith of evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:44661:201"/>Thirdly, Another help to the Soul that is under ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual deſertions is this, the ſoul in this caſe is to exerciſe Faith upon Chriſt, as an advocate, that is at the right hand of the Father to plead the cauſe of his people. That Scripture you have often named to you, in 1 <hi>John,</hi> 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Chriſt is at the right hand of the Father as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for you, as we ſhewed when we ſpake of the Reſt of the ſoul from the guilt of ſin: So now when thou haſt not the ſenſe of the Love of God to thee, exerciſe thy Faith upon Chriſt, that he is at the right Hand of the Father to plead for poor ſinners. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.34. Saith the Text there. <hi>Their Redeemer is ſtrong, the Lord of Hoſtes is his name, he ſhall throughly plead their cauſe, that he may give Reſt to the Land.</hi> It is true, this is meant literally, of an outward Reſt unto the people of God, to deliver them from the Captivity of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and here is a promiſe, that the redeemer is ſtrong, and the Lord of hoſts, that he ſhall throughly plead their cauſe; they were carried into <hi>Babilon,</hi> and they were ſcorned, and contemned, and deſpiſed, and they ſaid, where is their Lord of hoſts? Now here is a promiſe, that their redeemer will come, and that he ſhal throughly plead their cauſe, and give them reſt in their land, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the inhabitants of <hi>Babilon.</hi> This promiſe we are to make uſe of in regard of our outward troubles at this day, in regard of our adverſaries, and though the Lord let them prevaile ſomtimes, yet the Lord hath ſhewed himſelf at hand to plead his cauſe and no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath throughly pleaded the cauſe of his people, when the adverſaries began to lift up their hands againſt them, when they inſulted in regard of the late blow that God gave us, the Lord hath begun already to give them a blow, and I hope we ſhal hear further of it. But now that which is true here literally, is true ſpiritually, the Lord wil redeem them from ſpiritual captivity, and this redeemer is the Lord of hoſts, he will give them reſt, he
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:44661:202"/>
is at the right hand of the Father throughly to plead the cauſe of his poor Servants; when accuſation comes up to the Father againſt the Soul, then the Lord Chriſt ſtands at the right hand of the Father, and throughly pleads their cauſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In thy ſpiritual deſertion, thou muſt look up to Chriſt, to ſeek the fulfilling of that promiſe of his, that he makes to his diſciples, to ſend to them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, When Chriſt was to leave his diſciples (he ſaith) Be of good cheer; I will ſend the comforter to you, and therefore be of good cheer. Chriſt doth comfort his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples againſt his abſence, he was to go from them, and leave them in regard of his bodily preſence. Now Chriſt was ſo careful of his poor Servants, that when he was to leave them in regard of his bodily preſence he tels them he wil ſend the comforter to them, that is, the Holy Ghoſt ſhal come ſo much the more fully, and he ſhal manifeſt me unto you. Now plead this promiſe of the Lord Chriſt, in the times of ſpiritual deſertion, and ſay, Oh bleſſed Redeemer, wert thou careful of thy diſciples, that when thou wert to leave them in regard of bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that thou wouldſt ſend the Holy Ghoſt, that ſhould come to teſtifie of thee, and reveal thee to them, and bring things to remembrance, Oh, much more wilt thou have compaſſion of a poor Soul, from whom thou art abſent in a ſpiritual way, it is a greater affliction to want thee, O bleſſed Redeemer, in a ſpiritual way, then to want thy bodily preſence, and therefore there is a great deal more need that the comforter ſhould come in now, to ſupply the want of ſpiritual preſence, then bodily preſence.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In the time of ſpiritual deſertion, if thou canſt find no evidence at all, nothing at all to ſatisfie thy Soul, then go to Chriſt in the very ſame way that thou wenteſt to him at firſt, better to do ſo then to lie groveling
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:44661:202"/>
and ſinking under thy Burden. If thou thinkeſt that yet thou haſt nothing, that all is nothing, all is loſt, and the like, go again in the ſame way that thou wenteſt at firſt unto Chriſt, thou art not in a worſe condition then thou waſt then, when thou wert an enemy, and thou foundeſt eaſe and reſt in him at firſt, now renew that work that there was in thy Soul at the very firſt. There are many people, in the time of ſpiritual afflictions and deſertions, they ſpend ſo much time in looking after old evidences, whereas the truth is they might get new ones ſooner then the old ones. As ſomtimes a man may ſpend a great deal more time in looking after an old Key of a Box then in making a new one, he might make a new Key with a great deal leſs trouble, and it would not be ſo much prejudice to him to have a new Key made, as to look the old one. He may look up and down, and ſpend a great deal of time, that may be more worth then to make a new one. So it is with the Soul in time of trouble, and under ſpiritual deſertion, it is looking about for its old evidence, and to ſuch and ſuch works of Grace and cannot find them, and is poring and cannot be at quiet til it can find thoſe former ſigns and marks that he had before, I ſay, ſuch and ſuch may ſooner get new ones, then find the old ones. If a man have writings, perhaps he cannot find ſuch a writing, he may be at leſs charge to have new ones writ over again, then to look the old ones: ſo thou wanteſt the evidences of thy Grace, and canſt not find them, I ſay, renew thy Grace upon Chriſt again, and thou maiſt get thy evidence new writ over again, and have it with leſs coſt, then to look after the old ones.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Be ſure in time of thy deſertion to keep good thoughts of God, though thou haſt no comfort in them for the preſent, yet beleeve it there is comfort in Chriſt, and whatever becomes of thee, acknowledg Chriſt to be faithful, Chriſt is to be thy Lord, and thy king and let
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:44661:203"/>
thy Heart Love him, and ſtrive (at the leaſt) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o do ſo. It is true, the ſence of his Love wil inflame Love again, yet at that time when thou canſt not have the ſence of his Love, yet reſolve to Love him, and Love his waies. You know Chriſt, when God ſeemed to forſake him, yet at that time, when he was upon the Croſs, when human Nature could not but ſee he had need of Gods preſence, but then he cryed out, My God, My God. And ſo in <hi>Pſalme,</hi> 88. The example of <hi>Heman. O God of my Salvation.</hi> He ſpeaks yet ſtil wel of God, and cals God the God of his Salvation· O God of my Salvation, he ſpeaks yet ſtil wel of God, and cals God the God of his Salvation. O God of my Salvation, ſtil keeps good thoughts of God. And ſo the Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> when Chriſt had withdrawn himſelf from her, yet ſhe would cal him her beloved, and go up and down asking for her beloved, and where her beloved was, ſo let the ſoul in time of deſertion. Keep good thoughts of God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, And Laſtly, If thou canſt not have Reſt in Chriſt reſolve thou wilt never find reſt in nothing elſe, that thy Heart ſhal be reſtleſs til thou haſt reſt in Chriſt. Perhaps in the time of deſertion there comes one to thee, and ſaith, Chriſt hath forſaken thee, go and have comfort elſwhere, look for it other where; or may be, the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wil come, to a poor deſerted Soul, as he did to Chriſt, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. When Chriſt was a hungry, then comes the tempter to him; and ſaies, <hi>Command that theſe ſtones be made Bread,</hi> As if the tempter ſhould ſay thus, do do not you ſee how your Father hath forſaken you, that he will not afford you bread take a courſe for your ſelf. So here, juſt thus it is for all the world with a troubled Soul, the Soul is troubled, the Lord is withdrawn from the Soul, and now comes the tempter, and ſaith, you ſee you cannot have comfort, you have praied all this while and you cannot get comfort, Peace, and Reſt, now therefore ſeek for Reſt elſwhere. Oh take heed of

this, a deſerted Soul ſhould abandon ſuch temptations, and reſolve that it wil be content to be in a reſtleſs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to al eternity, if it cannot have Reſt here. As it is with thoſe that do ill offices, if there be any breaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Father and Child, or one freind and another, they take the advantage of that and ſay, do not you ſee your Father regards you not, though you be in ſuch need, he wil not regard you, nor help you, come therefore and take my counſel, I will ſhew you how you ſhal live a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life; and ſo when they would withdraw one friend from another, thoſe that would do ill offices, they go and take advantage of the breach; ſo doth the Devil, when the Lord is withdrawn from the ſoul, and the ſoul is in a deſerted condition, then comes the Devil to draw the ſoul to unlawful waies, he wil be ſure to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to do al ill offices between God and the ſoul, and therefore let ſuch as are in ſuch a condition take heed of ſuch temptations. And theſe now are the helps to thoſe that are under the burden of ſpiritual deſertions, there is enough in Chriſt to help them, and theſe being obſerved, they may come to have reſt in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>BUt now further, beſides all this Reſt you have heard of, there is a time when the Lord ſhal not only give the ſoul reſt IN Afflictions, but ſhal give the ſoul reſt FROM Affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, it may be in this world. He ſpeaks as if there were a reſt to the people of God to be delivered from affliction, not only <hi>in</hi> Affliction, but delivered <hi>from</hi> Affliction. That place that we have

                  </gap>cted condition, toſſed with tempeſt, and not comforted, not according to what is expreſſed, but here is a promiſe of a glorious time, when there ſhal be a ſure Foundation laid, and that Foundation of precious ſtones, and reſt there ſhal be. And if you compare this ſcripture with that in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. You ſhall ſee it aims at a glorious time, when Chriſt ſhal give Reſt unto the Soul, at verſ. 4. <hi>And God ſhal wipe away all tears from their Eyes, and there ſhal be no more death, neither ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor crying, neither ſhal there be any more pain, for the former things are paſſed away.</hi> And if you read after, you ſhal find, that he doth ſeem to allude unto this <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54. And there tels what thoſe precious ſtones ſhal be, that ſhal be the foundation of the happy eſtate of Gods Saints, and that it is not to be in Heaven, but here, before the great and generall day of judgment. It appeares plainly by this, that the Text ſaith, That the Kings of the Earth ſhal bring their glory and honor unto it, at the 24. verſe, <hi>The Nations of them which are ſaved ſhal walk in the light of it, and the Kings of the Earth do bring their Glory and Honor unto it.</hi> It is ſuch a time of the Church, as the Kings of the Earth ſhal bring their glory and their Honor unto it, Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day of judgment in Heaven, the Kings of the Earth do not bring their glory and their Honor to the Saints in Heaven, but they ſhal bring their glory and their Honor to the Saints here. It is a propheſie of ſuch a happy condition that the Saints ſhal be in, that the Kings of the Earth ſhal bring their Glory and their honor
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:44661:204"/>
to them, and therefore here it is upon this Earth, this promiſe is made of a glorious time that the Saints ſhall have, that all tears ſhal be wiped away from their Eyes here in this world, and it ſeems to be ſpoken of the ſame time that was ſpoken of in the Chapter before, in the 20. Chapter, of the firſt Reſurrection. Now after that time it appeares, that the Devil ſhal be looſned, and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſhal gather themſelves together againſt Gods people after that time. But there is ſuch a world here for the people of God, a reſt to be had from all affliction, even here upon the Earth to be hoped for, when the ſaints of God ſhal be honored before all the world; and all wicked and ungodly men ſhal be ſubdued before them. But further, there is certainly a reſt of Glory in the world to come, and that is to be added to al the reſt, when the ſaints ſhal keep an eternal Sabboth before the Lord, and ſhal there be alwaies exerciſed in praiſing, Magnifying, and bleſſing of the great God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay,</hi> Shall that be ſuch a Reſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of Holy Duties?</p>
               <p>I, that ſhall be a reſt indeed, for there ſhal be no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs of the fleſh but the Soul ſhal be in a ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the fleſh ſhal be ſubſervient to the ſoul, that there ſhal be no weariſomneſs to the fleſh, that it ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy communion with God, and be in bleſſed viſions with God, and be in his Fathers Houſe above al enemies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſin, they ſhal neither ſin more, nor ſorrow more, nor fear more nor doubt more, nor be troubled more, this is the reſt that the ſoul ſhal have in Chriſt. And I make no queſtion but Chriſt means this among the reſt, when he ſaith, come to me. But to ſpeak of this glorious reſt is a large point, &amp; elſwhere I have opened it at large, what the glory of the Saints ſhal be in Heaven, and therefore I ſhal ſpeak no more in this.</p>
               <p>Now then put al together that I have ſaid, concerning
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:44661:205"/>
the Reſt that I have ſpoken of, and may we not conclude of this reſt, and wel may it have that epithite which is ſpoken in <hi>Iſay</hi> 11.10. <hi>In that day, there ſhal be a root of Jeſſe, which ſhal ſtand for an enſigne of the people, to it ſhal the Gentiles ſeek, and his Reſt ſhal be glorious.</hi> Here it is ſpoke of the Reſt of Chriſt, his Reſt ſhal be glorious. We may wel apply it to the Reſt of the Saints, the ſaints ſhal have a glorious reſt, and it hath been ſhewed unto you in many particulars, wherein I have opened this reſt unto you, that you may ſee it is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſt.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>YOU Wil ſay, Oh, that we did but know, that this was our reſt, that we did not preſume, but that we were ſure that the reſt that we have in Chriſt was a true reſt. Now I told you before, that there was a faith of adherence, that might bring reſt, though there were not a faith of evidence. But now, you wil ſay, if we might have both, a faith of evidence, as wel as a faith of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, it would ad much to our Reſt.</p>
               <p>Now I wil help you to ſome notes, whereby you may come to examin, whether the Reſt you have is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reſt here ſpoken of, and two things I ſhal doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe notwithſtanding al this glorious Reſt, many of Gods ſervants here in this world are under much trouble of ſpirit, I ſhal give further rules how to make uſe of the reſt that is to be had in Chriſt, and ſome rules like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:44661:205"/>
how to keep the reſt, when the Lord Chriſt gives you Reſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the evidences to know whether your Reſt be indeed the right Reſt that is in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This Reſt in Chriſt, it can never be but upon great diſcovery of glorious things that the ſoul was not acquainted with before, many men go on and are quiet in their way and think that their reſt is Chriſts reſt, how wil that appeare that it is Chriſts Reſt? It wil appeare that they have had poor weake grounds to ſtand upon, only that which they have in a natural way, they live quietly among men, and the creatures doth not trouble them, and in a prudential way they are loath to trouble themſelves in their owne thoughts. But now, I appeal to thy ſoul, what diſcoveries haſt thou had of the glorious things of the covenant of Grace, and the covenant of life, in thoſe waies that God hath had in his eternal counſels to reconcile God and thy ſoul? What diſcoveries of Gods waies haſt thou had, to draw thy heart to Chriſt? Thy Reſt muſt come from theſe, theſe muſt be the meanes to bring thy ſoul to reſt, if thy Reſt come from blindneſs, Ignorance, and deadneſs of ſpirit, it is far from the true Reſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Reſt that the ſoul hath in Chriſt, it is that that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 14, It comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoules ceaſing from its owne worke, as God ceaſed from his, verſe the 10. <hi>For he that is entred into his Reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his owne workes, as God did from his.</hi> As God did Reſt the ſeventh day from al his workes, he gives that note of the reſt in Chriſt. There remaines therefore a reſt to the people of God, for he that is entred into his reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his owne workes, as God ceaſed from his. He comepares the reſt that the ſoul hath in Chriſt, to Gods reſt upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day. Now ſaith he, as God ſeaſed from his work that he wrougt upon the ſixth day, &amp; the ſeventh day he reſted, ſo whatſoever enters upon this reſt, he muſt ceaſe from his
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:44661:206"/>
owne workes what is that? The work that a man workes for himſelf, as in his natural eſtate, every man in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural eſtate doth not Gods work at al, but works his owne work. Now, ſaith he, look as God ceaſeth from his owne work, and then reſts, they that enter into this reſt muſt ceaſe from their owne workes, thoſe workes of ſin that they lived in, and wrought for themſelves, for their own endes, while they were in their natural eſtates; ſo that then examin this, haſt thou cea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed from thy own works? doſt not thou work for thy ſelf in al thy waies? Art thou taken off from thy ſelf and al the creatures? It may be thou doſt ſome work, but materially it is nothing of Gods, thou prayeſt and makeſt profeſſion of religion, I but it is thy owne worke ſtil. But if thou beeſt entered into this reſt, thou muſt ceaſe from thine owne workes, not only from thoſe workes that are ſinful in themſelves, but thou muſt not worke for thy ſelf in the beſt things, thou muſt be taken off from thy ſelf in the beſt things, thou muſt work the works of God, and be emptied of thy ſelf, and then thy ſoul ſhal have reſt, That is both an evidence that thy reſt is true, and a meanes to bring reſt unto thy ſoul. Take heed that thy work be not thine owne work, when thou doſt any work, I am about ſuch and ſuch a work, I but is it my owne work or Gods work It is true, there was a time that al the work I did was for my ſelf, and then if there were any argument, whereby I could ſee that it was for my ſelf I could work, if it was for ſelf ends, if I had ſelf to be promoted I could work, this is the way of men in themſelves. But now when the ſoul hath entred into the reſt of Chriſt, he hath ceaſed from his owne workes, and therefore now though there be not ſtrong arguments and ends to perſwade me to doe a work, yet it is enough that it is the work of God, and God ſhal have praiſe in it, and I can work as earneſtly and and ſtrongly in the work as ever I did any worke for my ſelf,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another note of the true reſt of the ſoul in
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:44661:206"/>
Chriſt is this, The more reſt thou haſt in Chriſt, the more active thou art for God; the falſe reſt that the ſoul hath makes it dul, ſecure, ſluggiſh, and negligent: but now the true reſt that is in Chriſt, makes the ſoul migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty active, and ſtirring, maks it to do great things for God; never had that ability to do for God, as now when it hath had reſt from Chriſt, as now we know that many people are very active &amp; ſtirring, when their conſcience is ſtirred, then they wil riſe early in the morning, and hear, and read, and pray, and mightily ſtir, when their conſcience is ſtirred, but if they have got any quiet and reſt to their ſpirits, they grow lazy, dul, and ſecure, and are leſs active in the places God hath ſet them in then before; but the ſoul that hath true reſt from Chriſt, is more active and lively in the work of God then before. As <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> ſaid, give me a place where I could reſt my ſelf on, and he thought then he could move the earth, ſo let the ſoul get but once the foot ſtopt upon Chriſt, ſo as he can have reſt in Chriſt, he can do more for God then ever he could before. And therefore I remember (and you may afterward by comparing find this note to be true) that whereas God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> while they were going up and down in the wilderneſs and had no reſt, to make an altar for ſacrifice of ſuch a bigneſs, ſo many foot, in the ſtory you ſhal find that when <hi>Solomon</hi> came to make an Altar to God, he made it twice as big as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the time of their being in the wilderneſs. The two ſeveral places I cannot ſtand to look to, but you ſhal find this note to be true, that the altar of <hi>Solomon,</hi> was as big a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as the altar of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Why? for they were then in a reſtleſs condition, went up and down, and were not at reſt, But now when they came to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> there they had reſt, and there the altar is as big again; noting, that they ſhould offer as much ſacrifice again as they did before in the time when they were in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, in their reſtleſs condition. So, thy ſoul was
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:44661:207"/>
once in the wilderneſs, hurried up and down, and then the altar for thy ſacrifice was bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> little, but when once God brings reſt to thy ſoul in Chriſt, thy altar ſhal be as big again, and thou ſhalt do as much more for God as thou didſt before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another note of the true reſt in Chriſt is this, if ſo be that thou haſt this reſt, then that which is Chriſts reſt is thine, as thus. If thou haſt reſt in Chriſt then look what Chriſt hath reſt in, that is thy reſt too, as now. what is the reſt of Chriſt? Chriſt hath reſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in three things, there are three things that are the reſt of Chriſt. Gods reſt in his Saints. His reſt in his Ordinances. And his reſt in his Sabbaths. Now thoſe that are partakers of true reſt for their Soules in Chriſt, look what Gods reſt is, thy reſt is. As now for the Saints the ſoul hath reſt in them, that is, thy ſoul hath content and reſt in them, in their company. Marke what is ſaid of them in <hi>Zepha.</hi> 3.17. Saith the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty, he wil ſave, he wil rejoyce over thee with joy, he wil reſt in his Love, he wil joy over thee with ſinging.</hi> Is the ſociety and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the ſaints a reſt to the, or rather a trouble to thee? Oh, to many, the company of the ſaints it is a trouble to them but when they get into their own company, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt their own Companions, then they have ſome Reſt,</p>
               <p>And then for the ordinances, for that you have a text in the 132. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> and 14. Speaking of <hi>Zion. For the Lord hath Choſen</hi> Zion, <hi>he hath deſired it for his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, this is my reſt for ever, here wil I dwel, for I have deſired it.</hi> Oh, in <hi>Zion,</hi> in ordinances, in duties, in the worſhip that is tendered up to thee, here is my reſt for ever, and here is my delight, Lord let me have reſt this way, my ſpirit is never ſo much at reſt, as when I am in the duties of Gods worſhip, when I am exerciſed in Gods ordinances, here my ſoul is at reſt, what ever
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:44661:207"/>
I have elſe, If I ſhould have peace again, and enjoy eſtate quietly, yet except I have Gods ordinances I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have reſt. Now doth thy ſoul enjoy more reſt in the ordinances then in any other way? then thy reſt is Chriſts reſt. And then for the ſabboth, you know what the ſcripture ſaith, what a ſabboth is, it is nothing but reſt, and is the ſaboth a day of Reſt unto thy ſoul? do not many people think the ſabboth day moſt troubleſome to them, eſpecially, if they be kept to holy duties, prayer, hearing the word, &amp; the like: Suppoſe you be put to pray in your cloſet, &amp; then to pray in your family, and to aske ſome queſtions to your ſervants &amp; children, and then come to the publick, and there to ſanctifie the name of God, and then when you come home again, to examin your family, over what they have learned, and ſo prepare your ſelves again to the ordinance and ſo to ſpend your ſelf in prayer, and hearing, and excerciſing al the day, would not this be a wearineſs to many of you? And would not many of you ſay, as thoſe in Malachy, <hi>When wil the ſabboth be over</hi>? Men indeed count the ſabboth a reſt, Why? becauſe they ceaſe from working, and they put on fine cloths, and go abroad, and walk in the feilds and upon this they count the ſabboth a reſt, ſurely ſuch are not acquainted with the reſt that is in Chriſt; but if thy ſoul be acquainted with this reſt, then the ſabboth is but a tipe of that reſt, that thou ſhalt keep in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heavens, it is but a tipe unto thee, and a forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that Glorious Reſt that thou ſhalt enjoy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If thy ſoul have true reſt, it is ſuch reſt as wil abide examination of the word of God, though it doth touch to the quick, and the more the word doth touch to the quick, the more it comes to thy ſoul, the more reſt thy ſoul hath. In <hi>Heb.</hi> after the Holy Ghoſt had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the reſt that is to the people of God, in 12. ſaith he. <hi>The word is quick, and powerful, and ſharper then any two edged ſword, peircing to the dividing a
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:44661:208"/>
ſunder of Soul and ſpirit, and of the Joynts and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the Heart.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, if you enter into the Reſt of Gods people, you ſhal have ſuch a reſt as wil abide the moſt narrow, and quickening ſearchings of the word of God, the word of God will ſearch you through and through, and your reſt ſhal be ſuch a reſt as wil abide the ſearch A reſt that comes by the word, the more the word ſearcheth, the more it increaſeth quickning, it ſearcheth between the marrow and the bones, and the more reſt a true gracious Heart finds.</p>

               <head>OBJECT.</head>
               <p>BUt you wil ſay, notwithſtanding al this you have ſpoken, yet many of the Saints of God, though they have been careful to do what you have ſaid, yet they do not find this Reſt you ſpeak of in Chriſt.</p>

for one may be a beleever, and yet not have the evidence of the Graces in Chriſt, ſo as to have Reſt unto his Soul. You will ſay what ſhould we do then?</p>
               <p>Firſt, Take heed that there be no ſecret ſin abide in your ſpirits, you had need examine and look to that, for that wil be a thorne in the fleſh, that wil trouble you, if there be any ſecret ſin thou liveſt in, it wil be as a thorne in the fleſh! that thou canſt not be quiet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another thing that will hinder the reſt of beleevers is, That becauſe they have not ſo much as they deſire, they wil not take notice of what good God hath granted to them; becauſe they have not al they would have, they think they have nothing at al. Now take heed of that, though thou haſt not all, yet take notice of what God hath done for thee, and be thankful for that. We read of the Women in the Goſpel that went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſeek Chriſt, they found the Angels, and heard news of him, though they found him not at firſt: So, though thy ſoul find not Chriſt for the preſent, and the reſt thou deſireſt, yet if thou haſt any news of him, any beginning of Gods work in thy Soul, take notice of that. Should the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have ſaid, what is that to us, that we find the Angels, and that we hear news of him, it is Chriſt that we ſeek; No, they ſaid not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore, I ſay, bleſs God for what ever thou haſt, it is more then others have, bleſs God for it, and that is the way to have more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Never judg of thy ſelf as thou feeleſt thy ſelf in a time of temptation, it may be thou art under a temptation, or ſpiritual deſertion, now do not judg of thy ſelf as thou findeſt thy ſelf at that time. As now, if ſo be a man when he hath been long in a Quartan Feaver, or one that hath layen long in the Diſeaſe of the Pox, if he ſhal at laſt look upon his viſage, and judg of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his body, according to his countenance this
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:44661:209"/>
would diſcourage him, but he muſt judg of his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution at that time, when the diſtemper is not upon him: So many poor Chriſtians, they judg of their condition then, when they are under the greateſt temptation, No, you ſhould rather judg of your eſtates as you are when you injoy your ſelves moſt, when God and your ſouls are together, and moſt free from temptation. If a man would weigh Gold, perhaps the Gold hath one grain more then the weight, yet if you come to weigh it and hold it in the wind, the wind may toſs up the ſcale and make the Gold ſeem to be too light, and you wil ſay, the Gold is not weight, Why? Becauſe the wind toſſeth up the ſcale the other way. But now, if you would ſee whether the Gold be weight indeed, hold it ſteady where the wind comes not; So, if you would weigh your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition aright, do it at that time when your ſpirit is moſt ſetled and ſtaied, and do not do it when temptation toſſeth you up and down.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another help to beleevers to prevent ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinderance of their reſt is this, That their ſpirits becauſe they have not what reſt they would have, many times grow impatient, and trouble themſelves more then God would have them. Now this is a Rule, labor to quiet your hearts by waiting upon God in the want of comfort, and Labor in the uſe of what means God ſhal give you for a waiting frame.

ſhal not be a tumultuous, hurrying, haſty Spirit. You wil ſay, can a man make too much haſt to get aſſurance of Gods Love in Chriſt? The truth is, you make the beſt ſpeed, when you can in the quiet and calme of your ſpirits waite upon God, while he wil pleaſe to ſpeak to your Souls, when we can go on in the uſe of means, til God ſeal up by his ſpirit of aſſurance to your Souls. Many Reaſons might be given, to put on the Soul to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, but I paſs on.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Another Rule is this, be much in Meditation upon the promiſes, ſwallow down promiſes, do not let them role upon your Tongues. Wicked men, they role the promiſes upon their Tongues, but they do not take them down. But now, as when we take bitter Pils, the way is to ſwallow them down whole, when we take ſweet things the way is to chew them, if a man ſhould chew his Pills, he would ſuddenly throw them out of his Mouth. So a Godly man ſhould not chew the Pills, that is, by Meditating upon the threatnings of the Law, this is not the way, rather ſwallow down the Pills, by Meditating upon the Goſpel, and the Covenant of Grace, and ſo thy ſoul may come to find reſt in Chriſt this way. And when thou haſt done al that thou canſt, yet ſtil the only way is for thee to depend upon God in his ordinances, and to pray for the ſpirit, no evidence that can be given, can quiet the Heart till that comes to paſs. But now if ſo be the ſoul hath gained this, what a thing is it for the ſoul to looſe it again. In <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 26.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is now to ſhut the dore againſt temptation, reſolve here will I venture, here is the word of God, which is ſure and certain, and for temptation, the Devil will trouble me with the Rapping and knocking at the dore, but let him Knock as long as he will, I have got a promiſe here, and I will venture my Soul upon this promiſe: And for want of this, though thou haſt gotten the promiſe, yet upon every temptation thou openeſt the dore. You know in time of danger, when any come and rap at the dore, wil you open the dore preſently? No, you bid your Servant ask who it is, and they muſt give a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what they would have, and from whence they come, before you wil open the dore; So, when any temptation raps at thy ſoul, inquire what it would have, and whence it comes, doth it come from God or no, or from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? Many people, they think the word to be a rule for their Faith, but they think the word is not a rule for their fear, you muſt have as good a warrant for refuſing any comfort that is tendred to you, as wel as for the taking of any comfort, and if you would obſerve that rule, that you wil never refuſe comfort, but you wil have a word to warrant you. If the Lord come to you and ſay, why did you refuſe ſuch comforts, and you ſay, I was in fear and Jealouſies, I but if God ſhould ſay, what word have you for it? What were you able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? Oh, This is that that God wil require of you, for it is a diſhonor to the truth of God, that whenas there is a word to ground thy Faith upon, and nothing but Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies to ground thy fears, yet thou wilt make thy Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and thy fears to weigh down the word.</p>
