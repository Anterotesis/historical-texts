            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THREE SERMONS Concerning the Sacred Trinity.</p>
            <p>By <hi>JOHN WALLIS,</hi> D. D. Professor of Geometry, in the University of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE first of the three Sermons here following, is Printed according as it was Preached in <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the Year <hi>1664.</hi> (accommodated to that time and place;) but it was, for the Substance of it, Preached in <hi>London</hi> Twenty Years before that time. Which I mention to shew, that the Construction which I give of the Words, is not a new forced Notion, just now taken up to serve a turn; or (as somebody is pleased to call it) <hi>Equally New and Cautious:</hi> But, what I did, so long ago, take to be a then received Truth. And, I since find, it is at least as old as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>'s <hi>Epist. 174.</hi> The other Two are lately added, in pursuance of some other


<pb facs="tcp:56317:3"/>
Discourses lately made publick, concerning the <hi>Sacred Trinity.</hi> Wherein much of what was said before, scatteringly, (as those who wrote against it gave occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;) is now inlarged and put into a little better Order. If what I have done may be serviceable to the Truth, and to the Church of God: I have what I did desire, and shall not think the Labour ill bestowed.</p>

            <p>I Need not apologize for the seasonableness of this Text; by telling you, that the Subject Matter of it, suites well with the great Solemnity, which at this time we celebrate;


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56317:4"/>
and the Pen-man, with that of the day: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Discourse on such a Subject, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be unseasonable to a Christian Auditory. Especially to such as, whose profession being to seek after Knowledge, should not decline that of God and Christ, the chief of all.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be any Exception hereunto:</p>
            <p>That it is no news, but well known alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Not only because That there be many who pretend to know what they do not, or do in effect deny; and That there be many things, which, though we know well, we have need enough to be minded of: But even because I do not find that many persons are wont to be displeased with being often minded of those things wherein they think that either their Interest or Excellency lies; more than a good Wit when commended, or a fair Lady with being told she is handsome; even though sometimes (as we are wont to say) they know it but too well already. And therefore, since to know God and Christ is both our Interest and our Commendation; it will not, I hope, seem grievous to any to hear it discoursed of; to the end that those who know it not may be incited to learn it, and those who know it, may take content in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56317:4"/>And I shall as little apologize for a plain Discourse on this Subject: Since it is both my Profession and Practice, to Demonstrate or make things as plain as I can; not to perplex or make them intricate; which may amuse the Auditors, or sometimes please or tickle them; but is not wont either to Teach, or Perswade: like too much of Ornament, which doth but disguise the native Beauty; or too much Trimming, which hides the Cloth.</p>
            <p>The words read, are our Saviour's Words; addressed to his Father in the behalf of his Disciples: And are a part of that Prayer with which he closeth his large Exhortation, or Farewel-Sermon to his Disciples, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was to suffer; of which we have a large rehearsal in the three foregoing Chapters, the 14<hi>th,</hi> 15<hi>th,</hi> and 16<hi>th:</hi> which this 17<hi>th.</hi> clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with a Prayer.</p>
            <p>He begins his Prayer, with a Petition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> which he was to bestow (according to the Power his Father had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him) to as many as He had given him; that is, to as many as should effectually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him. To which Petition he subjoins this Exegetical <hi>Epiphonema, And this is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56317:5"/>We may consider the words either accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>Synthetic</hi> or an <hi>Analytic</hi> method, as the Schools speak: The former of which they commonly follow in Sciences <hi>Theoretical</hi>; the latter in <hi>Practical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If considered <hi>Synthetically</hi>; they present us with, <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Cause,</hi> or Principle; <hi>The Knowledge of God and Christ</hi>: and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Effect,</hi> or Consequent resulting from it; <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Analytically;</hi> we have in them, <hi>First,</hi> A glorious <hi>End</hi> proposed; <hi>Eternal Life</hi>: and, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> The <hi>Means</hi> proportionate thereunto; <hi>The Knowledge of God and Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the former way, the Result of them is to this purpose; <hi>That the excellent Knowledge of God and Christ, is attended with this most glorious Consequent, Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter way, it amounts to thus much: <hi>That the way or means to Eternal Life, is the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it much material, whether of the two ways we take them; <hi>Synthetically,</hi> or <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytically</hi>: whether we take them as a <hi>Theorem;</hi> affirming this Effect, of that Cause: or as a <hi>Problem</hi>; directing to these Means for such an End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56317:5"/>Yet I chuse rather to take them in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consideration, (though not exclusive of the former;) Because, this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> taking its rise from the mention made of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> in the former verse; (not from a former men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Knowledge of God and Christ</hi>;) it seems to be rather intended as a <hi>Direction</hi> how to <hi>attain Eternal Life</hi>; than, an account of the <hi>Effect</hi> of such a <hi>Knowledge.</hi> But, in doing the one, it doth the other also.</p>
            <p>I shall begin, <hi>first,</hi> with that which lies first in the order of the word; The <hi>End</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; or the <hi>Effect,</hi> or Consequent of this Knowledge; the <hi>Happiness</hi> which doth attend it: which, for its Excellency, is called <hi>Life,</hi> and, for its Duration, <hi>Eternal. This is life eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>Life</hi> I take to be here used in a figurative sense; and to import <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>: like as, its contrary, <hi>Death,</hi> especially <hi>Death Eternal,</hi> to import <hi>Misery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is indeed, at least, a threefold <hi>Life</hi> commonly mentioned; and, in proportion thereunto, a threefold <hi>Death</hi>: Natural, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and Eternal.</p>
            <p>Life <hi>Natural,</hi> (which is indeed the proper acceptation of the word <hi>Life,</hi> or the first sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of it,) is more easily apprehended,


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56317:6"/>
than expressed. It imports that active state or condition which ariseth from the <hi>Union of the Soul and Body,</hi> as well in <hi>Man,</hi> as in other <hi>Animals</hi>; (not to mention that of Plants:) the destruction or want of which, upon the Soul's departure, we call <hi>Death.</hi> 'Tis that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which, in common speech, a Man or Beast is said to be alive or dead.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Life,</hi> is, of all <hi>natural Goods,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the chiefest; and consequently <hi>Death</hi> the greatest of <hi>natural Evils</hi>: Because Life is that foundation or first good, which makes us capable of what else is so: and with our Life, we lose all the rest. Hence that in <hi>Job</hi> 2.4. <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life.</hi> And that of <hi>Solomon; A li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Dog is better than a dead Lion,</hi> Eccles. 9.4. For, when Life is gone, there succeeds an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, not only of Doing, but also of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good.</p>
            <p>From this consideration it is, that the other significations of the word have their Original. For Life being looked upon as the greatest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Good, and Death as the greatest natural Evil; The one (by a <hi>Synechdoche speciei</hi>) is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently used (both in sacred and profane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours) to signify <hi>Good</hi> indefinitely, especially


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56317:6"/>
the <hi>greatest Good</hi>; and the other, in like manner, to signifie <hi>Evil,</hi> especially the <hi>greatest Evil.</hi> The one is put for <hi>Happiness,</hi> and the other for <hi>Misery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, again, (by a <hi>Synechdoche generis</hi>) this general notion of Good or Evil, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Misery, implied in the words Life and Death, becomes applicable to this or that particular Good and Evil, as occasion serves. Suppose the Spiritual Life of <hi>Grace,</hi> or <hi>Death</hi> in <hi>Sin</hi>: And the Eternal Life of <hi>Glory</hi> in Heaven, or the Eternal Death of <hi>Torment</hi> in Hell. Thus, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. <hi>I have set before you</hi> (saith <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Israel) life and death, blessing and cursing</hi>: (where Life and Death, are made equivalent to Blessing and Cursing;) <hi>therefore chuse life</hi> (saith he) <hi>that thou and thy seed may Live</hi>; that is, that you may be Happy. So at <hi>ver.</hi> 15. of the same Chapter; <hi>I have set before you</hi> (saith he) <hi>life and good, death and evil.</hi> Where Life and Good are put exegetical each of other, and so Death and Evil. And in the same sense it is the Poet tells us, <hi>Non est Vivere, sed Valere, vita.</hi> Thus God to <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise (for 'tis no new Trope, nor of yesterday) <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt die the death</hi>; that is, thou shalt become miserable: For we know that <hi>Adam</hi> did not the same day


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56317:7"/>
die a natural Death; but some hundreds of years after: but he did that day begin to be in a state of Misery, whereof his natural Death was but a part. So, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of sin is death</hi>; where the comprehension of all the Evils or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery which sin deserves, or God inflicteth for it, is called <hi>Death</hi>: like as on the contrary, all the Happiness, which the Saints enjoy, is, on the same account, called <hi>Life; The gift of God is eternal Life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> So here: By <hi>Life</hi> we understand <hi>Happiness</hi>; contrary to which is the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Misery</hi>: and then (by a <hi>Metalepsis,</hi> or double Trope,) that <hi>Happiness</hi> in special, which the Saints enjoy in <hi>Glory</hi> (though not exclusive of what they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;) and that <hi>Misery</hi> which in <hi>Hell</hi> attends the wicked.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that the condition of the Saints in Glory, after the Resurrection, may, even in a proper sense, be called Life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of that Union, which shall then be, of Soul and Body; and the exercise of (at least the most noble) faculties of Life. Yet do not I take that to be the true import of the Word here. For though it be true, that the Saints in Glory, have not only an <hi>Union of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> but likewise a <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>sense</hi> of that estate


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56317:7"/>
wherein they are, (which may import not only a Life, but even a Rational Life:) yet as true it is, that the Damned in Hell have so too; (for their Souls and Bodies shall not be less <hi>United</hi>; nor shall they be <hi>Insensible</hi> of their Woful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:) yet is not that estate of theirs called a <hi>Life</hi> (though naturally it be so, and it is their misery that it is so,) but <hi>Eternal Death</hi>; because a Life of Wo and Misery; not of Bliss and Happiness: A <hi>Living Misery,</hi> being, in this sense, the truest <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is called <hi>Life</hi> for its Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, so, for its Duration, it is called <hi>Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very usual in Scripture, in the use of Allegories, or Figurative expressions, to add some kind of <hi>Epithet</hi> to distinguish the word so used from the same in its native signification: And, when the word is used so as to express figuratively somewhat <hi>more excellent</hi> than it self, the <hi>Epithet</hi> hath somewhat of additional <hi>exel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> in it. Thus Christ is said to be the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual rock,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. the <hi>Living Bread, or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na that came down from Heaven,</hi> Joh. 6.50. to distinguish the words, so metaphorically used, from the Rock and Manna literally spoken of, in the story of their travails in the Wilderness. And the Church of Christ, as <hi>Living stones,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56317:8"/>
a <hi>Spiritual house,</hi> and a <hi>Holy priesthood,</hi> to offer up <hi>Spiritual sacrifices</hi> to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Where the Epithets serve both for distinction from the material Stones and Temple, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Priesthood, and corporeal Sacrifices; and for the commendation or preheminence of those before these. So the <hi>new heaven,</hi> and the <hi>new earth,</hi> and the <hi>new Jerusalem,</hi> Rev. 21.1, 2. <hi>Jerusalem that is above,</hi> Gal. 4.26. And Matth. 26.29. <hi>I will drink no more</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>of the fruit of the vine, till I drink it New with you in my Father's kingdom</hi>: Not that Christ did intend anew to drink of such wine in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Kingdom; but of a <hi>New wine,</hi> another sort of wine than that commonly so call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d; to wit, those spiritual Joys in his Father's Kingdom, which should more refresh their Hearts and Souls, than this wine did their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. So; <hi>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,</hi> Joh. 15.1. <hi>I am the good shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> Joh. 10.11. Not that Christ was more truly a <hi>Vine,</hi> in propriety of speech, than that which we so call; or indeed a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who took the care of Sheep: But that there was in Christ somewhat of another kind much more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, than that of the <hi>Vine,</hi> which did yet in some measure resemble it; and, a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56317:8"/>
Care, but of another nature, of those he calls his Flock, than a <hi>Shepherd</hi> hath of his Sheep. So here; <hi>This is life eternal:</hi> Not a natural Life, (such as is commonly meant by the word <hi>Life,</hi>) a life of the Body, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a short time is to be exchanged for Death; but a Life, a Happiness, of another nature; a far more excellent Good than what we call Life, which doth but very imperfectly express it; An <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Eternity,</hi> as it serves, in general, to distinguish this word <hi>Life</hi> from the ordinary acceptation; and doth import, for the kind of it, somewhat much more excellent: So it doth particularly point out that <hi>Everlasting Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of this so great a Happiness. 'Tis that which, though indeed it have a Beginning, shall never have an End. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that it is so often called <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> and <hi>Life Everlasting</hi>; that it were endless to enumerate the places where it is so called. <hi>An eternal inheritance</hi>;<note place="margin">Heb. 9.15. 2 Cor. 5.1. 1 Pet. 1.4.

eternal,</hi> that is, <hi>This is is the way</hi> or <hi>means, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> eternal Life.</p>
            <p>The former of these is very agreeable to the doctrine of the Schoolmen; who general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place the Happiness of Heaven in the <hi>Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Vision</hi>; in the seeing or knowing of God. Grounded on such places as that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi> 1 Cor. 13.9, 10, 12. <hi>We know but in part, and we prophesie but in part; but when that which is perfect shall come, then that which is in part shall be done away: We now see through a glass darkely, but then face to face: Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know, that when he shall appear,</hi> (or, <hi>when it shall appear) we shall be like him: for we shall see him as he is.</hi> With others of the like import. And certainly that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Knowledge, shall be at least a great part of that Happiness, which we expect in Heaven; as from these and other the like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is well collected. So that it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly said, that <hi>Eternal Life</hi> doth, at least in part, <hi>consist</hi> in such a knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56317:10"/>Nor is it any sufficient Objection hereunto, to say, That, it is not by knowledge only, as an Act of the Understanding, that we enjoy God, wherein our Happiness consists; but by an Act of the Will also, chusing and closing with, and delighting in him.</p>
            <p>For though this be true; yet neither is the Knowledge here spoken of, a bare <hi>Speculative,</hi> or Notional Knowledge, wherein the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is alone concerned: But an <hi>Active,</hi> Operative Knowledge; such as brings the Will, Affections, and all the Faculties into a proportionate Conformity thereunto. And in such a Knowledge of God in the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, attended with such a Conformity in the Will and other Faculties, it is not to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that our Happiness doth consist; even that of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Yet (without excluding this sense) I take the words here to be rather a <hi>Causal</hi> Predication: assigning the way or Means whereby Eternal Life is attained. <hi>This is life eternal,</hi> that is, this is the Way to attain Eternal Life; <hi>To know thee the only true God,</hi> &amp;c. The knowledge of God and Christ, being the direct way to attain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life. Parallel to which, is that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.50. <hi>His commandment is life


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56317:10"/>
everlasting.</hi> And very frequent elsewhere are such <hi>Metonymies</hi> of the <hi>Effect</hi> for the Cause. <hi>I am the resurrection, and the life,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25. that is, The Authour of it. So <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth</hi>; that is, it doth not depend upon it; it is not secured by it: or a Christ elsewhere, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.4. (out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3.) <hi>Man liveth not by bread alone,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Moses,</hi> speaking of their diligent obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Commands of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.47. <hi>This is your life,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and through this thing you shall prolong your days</hi>: (where the latter Clause is enegetical of the former:) just in the same form with the words here, <hi>This is life eternal</hi>; that is, hereby they shall attain eternal Life.</p>
            <p>This therefore being the most plain and simple Interpretation of the Words: We are now to enquire particularly, what that is that Christ here says to be Eternal Life, or rather the Way thereunto. <hi>That they may know thee the only true God; and, whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which contains in brief the Doctrine of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or <hi>Christian Religion</hi>: Distinguished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts, <hi>The Knowledge of God,</hi> and <hi>The


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56317:11"/>
Knowledge of Jesus Christ.</hi> Both which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to bring us to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>I shall speak, <hi>first,</hi> to the former of these two; the Knowledge of God; that is, of <hi>God the Creatour</hi> and <hi>Lord of all</hi>; as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished to that of <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Redeemer. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, That they might know thee the only true God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Thee,</hi> or the Person here spoken to, we are to understand <hi>God,</hi> the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; (For to him it is manifest, that Christ doth here direct his Prayer:) Yet not so much in his <hi>Personal</hi> as in his <hi>Essential</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. For it is not the <hi>Personality,</hi> but the <hi>Essence</hi> of the Father, that determines him to be <hi>the only true God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have therefore, in the Object of this Knowledge, at least, these Three Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</p>
            <p>I. That there is a God. II. That there is but One (True) God. III. That God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is this God.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The First of these strikes at <hi>Atheism,</hi> or those that deny a God. And that we know thus much is necessary from that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that cometh unto God, must believe that God


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56317:11"/>
is, and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He must believe, <hi>That there is a God.</hi> Nay, he must believe also somewhat of <hi>What he is</hi>: Not fansie to himself somewhat under the name of God, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not a God; or notions inconsistent with that of a Deity; as those, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thy self</hi>: or the like. For to believe such a false notion of God, is not to believe a God, but to believe an Idol.</p>
            <p>We are next to know, as that there is a God; so, That there is but One God. I mean; But One True God. For <hi>there are indeed,</hi> as the Apostle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4, 5, 6. <hi>Gods many, and Lords many</hi>; that is, there are <hi>that are called Gods,</hi> (for so he explains himself) <hi>but to us there is but One God; We know,</hi> (saith he) <hi>that there is no other God but One.</hi> And this indeed depends upon the former. For he that doth, according to a true notion of God, know That there is a God; must needs know also that there is <hi>but One.</hi> For the true notion of God, including Infinite, Absolute, Perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must needs also include Unity; for it is inconsistent that there should be many such. So that, in a manner, Polytheism includes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism.


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56317:12"/>
He that believes many Gods, doth, in effect, not believe any: that is, not any such Being as of which it is impossible there should be more than One.</p>
            <p>We are, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to know, that <hi>This</hi> God, is that onely True God. I say, This God; whom we have variously designed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by several Characters. <hi>The God that made Heaven and Earth: The living God: The God of Israel: The God whose name is Jehovah:</hi> And (as here, and elsewhere frequently in the New Testament) <hi>the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> By which and other the like Characters, he is distinguished from all false Gods, from all pretended Deities. This God we are to know to be the onely True God.</p>
            <p>But, when I say, That the <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</hi> is this <hi>onely True God</hi>; I add, That this appertains not so much to his <hi>Personality</hi> as to his <hi>Essence.</hi> For though the three Persons in the Sacred Trinity, be distinguished each from other by their <hi>Personalities,</hi> (the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet they all communicate in the common <hi>Essence</hi>; whereby the Son as well as the Father, and the Holy Ghost as either, is this <hi>Onely True God.</hi> The Person of the <hi>Father</hi> is indeed <hi>True


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56317:12"/>
God,</hi> but not according to his Personality, but according to his Essence. And the Person of the <hi>Son</hi> is God also, and the True God; yet not another, but <hi>the same</hi> True God. And the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> likewise. According to that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are One</hi>: That is, <hi>One mod,</hi> though not <hi>One Person.</hi> And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are Three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these Three are One.</hi> Three, and yet One. Three Persons, yet but One God. They are all this One, this Onely True God; beside whom there is no God.</p>
            <p>I know there are some who would be glad to take advantage of this place, to the Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Divinity of Christ, and of the Holy Ghost. As if it were here affirmed, That <hi>the Father onely</hi> were <hi>True God</hi>: and therefore, not the Son, nor the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>But the Cavil is obvious, and the Answer easie. It is not said that the <hi>Father Onely</hi> is True God; but that the Father is <hi>the onely True God</hi>; he is that God beside whom there is no other True God: which may well enough be said, though the Son also (as indeed he is) be <hi>that same True God;</hi> and the Holy Ghost likewise. Indeed should we say, That the


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56317:13"/>
Son were also <hi>True God,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> God; the Father could not then be said to be the <hi>Onely</hi> True God, since that there would be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther True God beside this. (And the like of the Holy Ghost.) But to say that the Son is <hi>the Same</hi> True God, is well consistent with it. For though another Person than the Father be True God, yet, because not Another God, this One God remains still the Onely True God. And the original words are to this purpose very clear; <gap reason="foreign">

It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes only a Plurality of Gods, not a Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Persons in the same God-head. 'Tis true indeed, That this Divinity, is not, in this place, so directly Affirmed, either of the Son, or the Holy Ghost: But, neither is it Denyed:


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56317:13"/>
And therefore it is to receive its decision from other places where it is affirmed clearly.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning the first branch of this Knowledge, the Knowledge of God. <hi>To know Thee, the only True God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another piece of Knowledge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the attainment of Eternal Life; the Knowledge of Christ. For so it follows, <hi>And Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, that had we continued in that Estate wherein Man was at first Created, there had been no necessity of this second branch of Knowledge. For, had there been no Sin, there had been no need of a Saviour: and consequently, not of this knowledge of Jesus Christ. A knowledge of God, the onely True God, with an Obedience conformable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, had then been enough to make us Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. But Man, by his Fall, having contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Estate of Misery; there is now no Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to our lost Happiness, but by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and there is no Redemption, but by Jesus Christ. For as <hi>there is but One God</hi>; so, <hi>but One Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>Neither is there any other name given to men, whereby we must be saved, but that of Jesus Christ of Nazareth; whom


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56317:14"/>
they Crucified, and God raised from the dead</hi>: (Act. 4.10, 12.) <hi>There is no Salvation in any other.</hi> It is necessary therefore, to the attainment of Eternal Life, that we know Him, in this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
            <p>What we are to know concerning him, though we cannot expect, in so few words, to have clearly set down, without a Comment from other places to give light to them: Yet at least three things seem in these words to be pointed at; His Divinity, His Incarnation, and His Mediatory Office.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Divinity</hi>; in that he is the <hi>Son of God.</hi> For he calls him <hi>Father,</hi> whom he says we must know to be the <hi>onely True God.</hi> Indeed, were he onely the Son of God in such a sense as <hi>Adam</hi> is so called, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.38. or the <hi>Angels</hi> thought to be, <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. that is, by <hi>Creation</hi>; for as <hi>Saints</hi> are so called <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,) that is, by <hi>Adoption</hi>; it would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a Divinity. But to be (as Christ is) the <hi>Son</hi> of God by <hi>Eternal Generation,</hi> argues a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in the <hi>same Nature.</hi> As the Apostle infers, Heb. 1.5. <hi>For to which of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi> This <hi>onely begotten of the Father,</hi> must needs be also of the <hi>same nature</hi> with the


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56317:14"/>
Father; and therefore, God, as he is.</p>
            <p>And this Argument, (however now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there are who endeavour to elude it) the Jews, his Enemies, thought to be conclusive. For when they observed him to call <hi>God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or pretend himself to be <hi>the Son of God</hi>; especially, <hi>the Christ the Son of God</hi>; they did not understand him to speak in such a sense as when themselves were commonly wont so to speak (as Joh. 8.41. <hi>We are not born of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we have one Father, even God</hi>;) but in such a sense as they judged Blasphemous, (and had been so indeed, had it not been true;) who <hi>therefore sought the more to kill him,</hi> (Joh. 5.18.) <hi>because he said, That God was his Father; making himself Equal with God.</hi> And the <hi>High Priest</hi> (Matth. 26.65.) <hi>rent his Cloths, saying, He speaketh Blasphemy,</hi> when our Saviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before him, That <hi>he was the Christ, the Son of God.</hi> 'Twas manifest therefore, that he so spake, and they so understood him, of such a <hi>Son-ship</hi> as argued a <hi>Divinity,</hi> a being <hi>equal with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>Humanity,</hi> or Incarnation, is pointed at, in these words, <hi>whom thou hast sent.</hi> For by the Fathers <hi>sending him,</hi> or his <hi>coming into the World,</hi> is clearly meant his being <hi>Incarnate,</hi> or


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56317:15"/>
               <hi>made Man.</hi> As Gal. 4.4. <hi>God sent his Son made of a Woman.</hi> And Joh. 1.14. <hi>The Word was made Flesh, and dwelt amongst us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. His <hi>Mediatory Office,</hi> is implyed as well in the Title <hi>Christ,</hi> added to his Name <hi>Jesus</hi>; as in that of his being <hi>sent by God. Jesus the Christ,</hi> or <hi>Jesus the Messiah, whom thou hast sent.</hi> For as his Name <hi>Jesus</hi> doth design the Person; so the Title <hi>Christ,</hi> that is <hi>Messiah,</hi> (that in Greek, answering to this in Hebrew, and both signifying the <hi>Anointed</hi>) doth import the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to which he was designed, and for which he was sent. For God did not send him, to no purpose; but sent him for this end, for this Work,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5. Col. 10.20, 21. Rom. 5.10, 11. <hi>&amp; alibi.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>To be the Mediator between God and Man; To reconcile us to the Father; To make an Atonement or Propitiation for us. To take away the sins of the World</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.2. Joh. 1.29. Heb. 9.12, 15.</note> 
               <hi>To obtain Eternal Redemption; To procure an Everlasting Inheritance; a purchased Possession; To make Intercession for us; To save to the uttermost those that come unto God by him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1.14. Heb. 7.25.</note> Or, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17. (where all the three Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are likewise intimated) <hi>God therefore sent his onely begotten Son into the World, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56317:15"/>And now, having gone through the whole Text, we might, if time would suffer, look back upon it to take a new Survey thereof, and collect from thence some of those particular deductions which might concern our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. For certainly, the Knowledge which Christ here declares <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> conducing thereunto, is not a bare <hi>Notional knowledge,</hi> or a pure <hi>speculative Belief,</hi> (such as <hi>the Devils</hi> may have as well as we;<note place="margin">Jam. 2 19.</note>) but an <hi>operative Knowledge,</hi> a <hi>practical Faith,</hi> a Faith <hi>fruitful in good Works</hi>; without which those speculative notions will never bring us to Heaven. And therefore, without ingaging in the nice Disputes, of Justification by Faith alone, or Works concurring thereunto; this is on all hands agreed without dispute, That <hi>Faith without good Works</hi> will never justify us. Whatever their influence be, in Justification; their Presence at least is necessary. Without <hi>Doing,</hi> we cannot, in God's account, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted either to <hi>Believe</hi> or <hi>Know.</hi> Those that <hi>obey him not,</hi> are reckoned, in God's account, amongst those that <hi>Know not God</hi>:<note place="margin">2 Thes. 1.8.</note> at least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those <hi>who profess they know God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1.16.</note> 
               <hi>but do in their works deny him.</hi> Who shall be so far, by such a Knowledge, from obtaining <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56317:16"/>
Life,</hi> that <hi>Christ shall come in flaming fire to take vengeance on them, and to punish them with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In particular: <hi>If we know God, to be the onely True God</hi>; Then must we <hi>Love</hi> him, <hi>Fear</hi> him, <hi>Worship</hi> him, and <hi>Obey</hi> him. Nor doth the knowledge of Christ, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> abate any thing of this <hi>Duty.</hi> For though he came to <hi>take away the Curse of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>by being made a Curse for us</hi>; yet not our <hi>Obligation</hi> thereunto. <hi>He came not to destroy the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.17.</note> or make it less obligatory to duty, <hi>but to fulfill it.</hi> I may add; That, those, who will not <hi>acknowledge</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under the <hi>Obligation</hi> of it, have reason to fear, they be yet under the <hi>Curse</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>If we know Christ whom he hath sent</hi>; It will be our duty then to <hi>Believe in him</hi>; (For 'tis,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.2.</note> 
               <hi>to those onely,</hi> that <hi>Christ doth give eternal life.</hi>) And, so to <hi>Believe</hi> in him, as to <hi>Obey</hi> him;<note place="margin">2 Thes. 1.8.</note> For, <hi>to those who obey not the Gospel of his Son,</hi> it is, that <hi>Christ shall render vengeance in flaming fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore: If in this Christ we hope to have <hi>Eternal Life</hi>; how should this excite our <hi>Rejoicing</hi> and <hi>Thankfulness</hi> for so <hi>great Salvation!</hi> Not by Rioting and Drunkenness; by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56317:16"/>
and Debauchery; (which is the Abuse, not the Celebration, of this Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in memory of Christ's Incarnation;) But by a <hi>pious</hi> Remembrance and Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Redemption obtained for us: such as may be to the <hi>Honour,</hi> not the Reproach, of him that came to <hi>Redeem us from our vain Conversation: That,</hi>

            <p>IT is now a great many years since, in this Place (if not to this Auditory) I did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of these Words. I shall repeat very little of that Discourse: But think fit to add somewhat to what was then said.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56317:18"/>Our Saviour, in the three Chapters next foregoing (the 14<hi>th,</hi> 15<hi>th,</hi> and 16<hi>th.</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel) had made a large Discourse to his Disciples (after his Institution of the Lord's Supper) the night before he was to Die; which (in this 17<hi>th.</hi> Chapter) he clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with a Prayer, to his Father, in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Where, by <hi>Knowledge,</hi> I do not understand a meer <hi>Notional</hi> or <hi>Speculative</hi> Knowledge;

(For such I presume the Devils may have in as large a proportion as any of us, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain <hi>Eternal Life</hi>:) But an <hi>Active, Practical</hi> Knowledge: Such a Knowledge as is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Faith</hi> and with <hi>Practice</hi> suitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. As in that of <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>By his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> (that is, by the Knowledge of Him) <hi>shall my righteous Servant justifie many</hi>: That is, by <hi>Faith</hi> in him, attended with a suitable <hi>Practice</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Object</hi> of this Knowledge is declared to be twofold. 1. The Knowledge of <hi>God</hi>; and 2. The Knowledge of <hi>Christ. To know Thee the onely True God</hi>; that's one part: <hi>And (whom thou hast sent) Jesus Christ;</hi> that's the other.</p>
            <p>And each of these contains several Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>The former of them contains at least these Three. 1. That there is a <hi>God.</hi> 2. That there is <hi>but One</hi> (True) <hi>God.</hi> 3. That the <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> is this <hi>Onely True God.</hi> He is <hi>that God,</hi> besides <hi>which God,</hi> there is <hi>no other</hi> True God. And, though <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> be <hi>God</hi> also; yet not <hi>another</hi> God, but <hi>the same</hi> True God. For <hi>He and the Father are One.</hi> Joh. 10.30.</p>
            <p>In the latter of them (the Knowledge of Christ) are Three things also. 1. His <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>


               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56317:19"/>
2. His <hi>Humanity.</hi> And 3. His <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Office.</hi> Which are here briefly insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and are elsewhere more fully expressed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Divinity,</hi> in that he is the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> who is the <hi>Onely True God</hi>: Not by <hi>Creation,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> are called the Sons of God: nor by <hi>Adoption,</hi> as are the <hi>Righteous,</hi> who truly believe in Christ: But by <hi>Generation,</hi> as the <hi>Onely Begotten of the Father, (Joh.</hi> 1.14.) and therefore of the <hi>same Nature</hi> with the Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>Humanity</hi>; implyed in these words, <hi>Whom Thou hast sent.</hi> That is, <hi>So</hi> sent as to be <hi>made of a Woman:</hi> so sent as to be <hi>made Flesh.</hi> Gal. 4.4. Joh. 1.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His <hi>Mediatory Office</hi>: implyed in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Christ,</hi> added to the Name <hi>Jesus, (And, whom Thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.</hi>) He was <hi>so sent,</hi> as to be <hi>the Christ,</hi> the <hi>Messias.</hi> So sent, as that <hi>the World through him might be Saved</hi>: So, as that <hi>whosoever Believes in him should not Perish, but have Everlasting Life.</hi> Joh. 3.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Of all which Points I did then Discourse more largely; and therefore do now but name them.</p>
            <p>But I did then further observe, from the <hi>Order</hi> of the Words, (to obviate a Cavil of

               <head>Objection I.</head>
               <p>The first and great <hi>Objection</hi> of the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> from this place, against the <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi> and the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> is this If the <hi>Father</hi> be the <hi>onely true God</hi>; then the <hi>Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> is <hi>not God,</hi> or <hi>not the True God</hi>; but <hi>the Father onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I shall give Three things in Answer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Argument is a plain <hi>Fallacy</hi>; which they put upon us, by a willful perverting the Order of the Words. For it is not said <hi>Thee Onely</hi> to be the <hi>True God,</hi> (as if not the <hi>Son</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, or the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> were the <hi>True God,</hi> but <hi>the Father onely</hi>:) But, <hi>to Know Thee</hi> (not <hi>Thee onely,</hi> or <hi>Onely Thee,</hi>) to be the <hi>Onely true God.</hi> Nor is it so in our <hi>Englis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Just as, in our English, the Article <hi>The,</hi> coming between <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Onely,</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the word <hi>Onely,</hi> not to <hi>Thee</hi> (that went before,) but to <hi>True God,</hi> which follows. <hi>To know Thee</hi> (not <hi>onely Thee,) the onely true God.</hi> That is, to know <hi>Thee</hi> to be <hi>that God,</hi> beside <hi>which God,</hi> there is <hi>no other</hi> true God. Which we readily Acknowledge, and Profess.</p>
               <p>And then the <hi>Socinians</hi> Argument will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear just in this Form: The <hi>God of Abraham</hi> is the <hi>Onely true God</hi>; And therefore not the <hi>God of Isaac,</hi> nor the <hi>God of Jacob.</hi> Yes, say I; the God of <hi>Isaac</hi> is <hi>the same</hi> God with the God of <hi>Abraham</hi>; And therefore <hi>the True God</hi> as he is. And the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> likewise.</p>
               <p>And this one Answer doth fully satisfy the Objection, and there needs no more. Yet I shall add Two other things (though they might here be spared) because they may be of use elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I say further: If it had been said (as it is not) <hi>Thee Onely</hi>; yet even this would not exclude any who is <hi>the same with Him.</hi> And therefore, not the <hi>Son,</hi> nor the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi>; since they are <hi>One and the same God with Him. (I

and the Father are One,</hi> Joh. 10.30. <hi>These Three are One,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.7.)</p>
               <p>To which purpose, consider we what we have <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.14, 15. and again <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.7, 8. <hi>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be said, The Lord liveth that brought up the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; But, The Lord liveth that brought up the Children of Israel from the land of the North,</hi> or <hi>out of the North Country.</hi> Now we are told by God himself, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2, 3. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, — Thou shalt have no other God but ME.</hi> Shall we therefore argue thus; The God who <hi>brought Israel out of Egypt,</hi> is the <hi>onely true God</hi>; and we must <hi>have no other God but HIM.</hi> Therefore, not him <hi>who brought Israel out of the North-Country?</hi> Yes, say I, <hi>Him</hi> also. For the God <hi>who brought them out of the North-Country,</hi> is the <hi>same God,</hi> with him <hi>who brought them out of Egypt,</hi> (not <hi>another God,</hi> though designed by <hi>another Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,)</hi> and therefore, in having <hi>Him,</hi> we have not <hi>another</hi> God. So here; <hi>To Know thee onely</hi> (if it had been so said, as it is not;) it had implied no more but thus, <hi>Not any who is not the same God with Thee.</hi> To Know <hi>Thee Onely</hi> (and not any other, who is not the same God with


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56317:21"/>
Thee) to be <hi>the true God.</hi> Which therefore would not exclude the <hi>Son</hi> nor <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who are the <hi>same God</hi> with the <hi>Father.</hi> But of this Answer, there is no need in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not said <hi>Thee Onely,</hi> or <hi>onely Thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I say further; If it had been said (as it is not) <hi>Thee Onely,</hi> (as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it to be understood;) I would then say, This were an <hi>Essential</hi> Predication, rather than a <hi>Personal.</hi> That is, That the Predicate <hi>True God,</hi> is affirmed of him in regard of his <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> rather than of his <hi>Personality.</hi> As belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Essence,</hi> which is common to the <hi>Three Persons,</hi> not as peculiar to the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Father.</hi> Like as if it were said, <hi>David the King of Israel,</hi> or <hi>David the Father of Solomon,</hi> is a <hi>Reasonable Creature,</hi> or <hi>endued with Reason</hi>; this <hi>being endued with Reason,</hi> doth not belong to him as <hi>King of Israel,</hi> nor as <hi>Father of Solomon</hi>; but, as he is a <hi>Man</hi> (though denominated by these Relations,) and is equivalent to this, <hi>The Man</hi> (who is Father of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and King of <hi>Israel</hi>) is <hi>endued with Reason.</hi> So if it be said, that <hi>David King of Israel,</hi> and He <hi>onely,</hi> was <hi>Father of Solomon</hi>: it is not intended, that he was so <hi>as King of Israel</hi> (much less, in that capacity <hi>Onely,</hi>) but rather, as the <hi>Man</hi> who


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56317:21"/>
                  <hi>begot</hi> him; though designed by that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. So here; God the <hi>Creator</hi> is <hi>the Onely True God</hi>: and God the <hi>Redeemer</hi> likewise; (<hi>Thus saith the Lord thy Redeémer the Holy One of Israel, the Lord of Hosts, I am the First and I am the Last, and beside ME there is no God, Isa.</hi> 41.14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.6. applyed to Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.13, 16.) Shall we therefore argue, That <hi>God the Redeémer</hi> is the Onely True God, and <hi>beside Him</hi> there is <hi>no God,</hi> therefore not God the <hi>Creator</hi>? No, we must not so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue. For it is not <hi>as Redeemer,</hi> or <hi>as Creator,</hi> that he is the <hi>Onely True God,</hi> but <hi>as God.</hi> (It may be <hi>praedicatio</hi>

               <p>And this both the <hi>Arian,</hi> and the <hi>Socinian,</hi> must needs acknowledge as to the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. For when Christ saith, <hi>To know Thee (Father) the Onely True God</hi>; it cannot (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Principles) be said of him as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> but as <hi>God.</hi> For if Christ be onely a <hi>Titular</hi> God, or a <hi>Creature</hi>-God, (as they would have it,) there was a time, or moment, when he <hi>was not,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) and therefore, when God was not <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>


                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56317:22"/>
But he was <hi>the Onely True God</hi> from all <hi>Eternity</hi>; and therefore must be here so called, not as <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> but as <hi>God.</hi> Not according to his <hi>Personality,</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Essence</hi>; which, we say, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the <hi>Three Persons</hi>: Who are the <hi>same God,</hi> though under different <hi>Denominations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these two latter Answers, (though they be True and Solid,) are not necessary to this place; because it is not said <hi>Thee Onely.</hi> Yet I here name them, because they may be of use to answer some like Objection raised from some other place.</p>
               <p>The full import of the words, is this, <hi>That the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is that God, beside which God, there is no other True God.</hi> Or, <hi>There is no other True God, beside that God, which is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> And this we do fully agree with, when we say, That the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> are not <hi>another</hi> God, but <hi>the same</hi> True God with the <hi>Father.</hi>

               <p>It may perhaps be next Objected, That though this place do not <hi>Deny</hi> the Son and Holy Ghost to be the True God, (meaning thereby, the same God with the Father:) Yet neither doth it <hi>Prove</hi> them so to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56317:22"/>I answer. 'Tis true: This place alone, (without the concurrence of others) doth not <hi>Prove</hi> the <hi>Trinity.</hi> (And it is much if it should, where there are but <hi>Two</hi> mentioned.) Nor is it brought by us to that purpose. We only Answer the Objections brought against it by others, from this place: And leave the Proof of it to be fetched from other places in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with this.</p>
               <p>I have observed elsewhere (<hi>Lett.</hi> 3.) that if we should read it thus, <hi>To know Thee to be the Onely True God; and him also whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ,</hi> (as implying him also to be <hi>the same</hi> True God:) Or thus, <hi>To know Thee, and (whom thou hast sent) Jesus Christ, the Only True God:</hi> The words will well bear it, without any force put upon them.</p>
               <p>Nor is this only a new Notion of my own. For I (since) find, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> had said the same long ago, in his <hi>Epist.</hi> 174. (speaking to <hi>Pascentius,</hi> an <hi>Arian,</hi> concerning this place) <hi>De Patre tantummodo vos vultis intelligi, quod ait, Ut cognoscant Te unum verum Deum, &amp;, quem misi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti Jesum Christum; Ubi nos subaudimus, etiam Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum Christum verum Deum: Ut haec sit sententia, Te, &amp;, quem misisti, Jesum Christum, cognoscant unum verum Deum. Ne illa consequatur absurditas,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56317:23"/>
ut, si propterea non est verus Deus Jesus Christus, quia dictum est Patri, Te unum verum Deum: prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea non sit Dominus Pater, quia dictum est de Christo, Unus Dominus.</hi> Where he takes the meaning to be this, <hi>To know Thee, and, whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ, the Onely True God</hi>; which he backs with this Argument; Because if we should here on this account exclude the <hi>Son</hi> from being the <hi>True God</hi>; we might, for the same reason, exclude the <hi>Father</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Lord,</hi> because it is said (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6.) <hi>One Lord, Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet even this, though it might prove it, as to the <hi>Son,</hi> it would not hence conclude it, as to the <hi>Holy-Ghost.</hi> But the concurrence of other places, will prove it more clearly as to both. I shall shew it of each.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Son,</hi> we have it clearly affirmed, by the same S. <hi>John,</hi> (who best understood the import of his own words) that he is also <hi>the True God</hi>; (so that it was not intended here to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him.) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. <hi>We are in him that is True, even in his Son Jesus Christ: This is the True God</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (And therefore not <hi>onely</hi> the Father.) And he had before told us (from Christ's own words) <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it here meant of <hi>one in Testimony,</hi> as

the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it understood else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, (there being in the Context here no mention of <hi>Testimony</hi> at all:) But it must be meant of <hi>One God.</hi> And this is manifest from the Inference which the <hi>Jews</hi> made from it. For they did thereupon <hi>take up stones to stone him,</hi> as for (what they call) <hi>Blasphemy: Because thou</hi> (say they) <hi>being a Man, makest thy self God,</hi> ver. 31, 32, 33.

               <head>Objection III.</head>
               <p>It is Objected, that these words, last cited, are said to have been wanting in some Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or some ancient Copies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Be it so. And so are some whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles wanting in some Translations. And considerable parts of some other Chapters. But we are not therefore to cast them away as not Genuine. The II<hi>d.</hi> and III<hi>d.</hi> Epistles of St. <hi>John,</hi> and that of <hi>Jude,</hi> are said to have been wanting in the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Translations: And the Story of the <hi>Woman taken in Adultery, Joh.</hi> 8. wanting in the <hi>Gothick</hi> Gospels: And part of the last Chapter of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Gospel, is said to be wanting in some Books: And the <hi>Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> in the close of the Lord's Prayer: And the like in divers others. But we must not thence conclude them not to be Genuine, and put them out of our Bibles, because they have chanced to be omitted in some Books.</p>
               <p>And it is so far from being strange, that such Omissions should sometimes happen; that it is very strange (if there were not a great Providence of God to preserve the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures pure and entire) that there should be no more such mistakes than what are found. For


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56317:24"/>
(before the convenience of Printing was found out) when Copies were to be singly transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed one from another, and even those but in a few hands: 'Twas very possible, (and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoidable,) even for a diligent Transcriber, sometime to skip a line. Especially, (which is the case here) when some of the same words do again recur after a line or two; Men are very subject, both in Writing and Printing, (as those well know who are versed in either,) to leap from one word, to the same recurring soon after. Nor is such Omission (when it happens) readily discerned, if (as here) the sense be not manifestly disturbed by it.</p>
               <p>Now when such variety of Copies happens (that words be found in some, which are wanting in others,) this must either happen by a Casual mis-take, (without any design of Fraud:) or by a willful Falsification; as to serve a particular turn; (which I take to be the case of the Papists, <hi>Indices Expurgatorii.</hi>)</p>
               <p>And, as to the words in question; If the difference of Copies happened at first by a Casual mistake, (as I am apt to think,) 'tis very easy for a Transcriber (unawares) to <hi>leave out</hi> a Line which was in his Copy (especially where such omission doth not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56317:25"/>
disturb the sense;) but not to <hi>put in</hi> a line which was not there. And, in such case, the Fuller Copy is likelyest to be True, and the Omission to be a Fault. Which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it seems it did) some hundreds of years ago, in some one Copy; it might easily pass (unobserved) into many others transcribed thence (and so to others derived from those Transcripts.) But an <hi>Insertion</hi> (of what was not in their Copy) must needs be willful, and not casual.</p>
               <p>On the other side; If this variety of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were at first from a <hi>willful Falsification</hi>; It is much more likely to be a willful <hi>Omission</hi> of the <hi>Arians,</hi> in some of their Copies, (which might be done silently, and unobserved;) than by a willful <hi>Insertion</hi> of the <hi>Orthodox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Insertion of such a clause, if wholly New, and which had never before been Heard of; would have been presently dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the <hi>Arians,</hi> as soon as ever it should be urged against them.</p>
               <p>Nor was any advantage to be made of it by the Orthodox, since the <hi>Divinity of Christ</hi> (which was the Point then in question) might be as strongly urged from that in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel, <hi>I and the Father are One,</hi> as from this


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56317:25"/>
in his Epistle, <hi>These Three are One.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not likely that the Orthodox should willfully make any such Falsification, from whence they could promise themselves no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Nor do I find, it was ever charged upon them by the ancient <hi>Arians</hi> in those days: though <hi>Athanasius</hi> and others urged it against them. And in very ancient Copies, in which it had been left out, it is found supplied in the Margin, as having been faultily omitted.</p>
               <p>And it is the more likely to be Genuine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this clause (<hi>The Father, the Word, and the Holy-Ghost</hi>) the <hi>second Person</hi> is called <hi>sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Word</hi>; which is St. <hi>John</hi>'s Language, both here, and in his Gospel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. And is (I think) peculiar to him; and not so used by any other of the Holy Writers of the New Testament.</p>
               <p>I do not deny but that this <hi>second Person</hi> may be called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>By Faith we understand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God.</hi> And 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5, 7. <hi>By the Word of God were the Heavens of old, and the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and by the same Word they are kept in store.</hi> As he is by the same St. <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 19.13. <hi>His name is called, the Word of God.</hi> But to call him <hi>the Word</hi> absolutely (without other addition) I


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56317:26"/>
think is peculiar to St. <hi>John.</hi> And therefore much more likely in this place, to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the same <hi>Pen,</hi> and not to have been inserted by an Interpolater some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years after. And that clause <hi>These Three are One,</hi> in the Epistle, agreeing so well with <hi>I and the Father are one</hi> in the Gospel, is a further confirmation of their being both from the same Pen.</p>
               <p>Add to this, That the <hi>Antithesis</hi> which we find in the 7<hi>th</hi> and 8<hi>th Verses,</hi> is so very <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>; that it is a great Presumption to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine. <hi>There are Three that bear record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, The Father, the Word, and the Holy-Ghost, and these Three are One: And there are Three that bear witness in Earth, The Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood, and these Three agree in One.</hi> Which as it stands, is very Natural; but the latter clause would seem lame without the former: and the words <hi>in Earth</hi> wholly redundant in the latter, if not by <hi>Antithesis</hi> to answer to the words <hi>in Heaven,</hi> in the former Verse.</p>
               <p>And that it was anciently so read, appears from St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> by whom it is twice cited (in his Book <hi>De Unitate Ecclesiae,</hi> and in his <hi>Epistle ad Jubaianum</hi>) before the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversy was on foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56317:26"/>In the former place, (arguing for the Church's <hi>Unity,</hi> not to be broken by <hi>Schisms</hi>) he speaks thus. <hi>Dicit Dominus, Ego &amp; Pater unum sumus. Et iterum de Patre &amp; Filio &amp; Spiritu Sancto, scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum est, Et hi tres unum sunt. Et quisquam credit hanc Unitatem de divina firmitate venientem, sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis coelestibus cohaerentem, scindi in Ecclesia posse?</hi> That is, <hi>Our Lord saith, I and the Father are One: And again, of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, It is Written, These Three are One. And who can believe, that this Unity of the Church, proceeding from this Firm Union in God, and united by the Heavenly Sacraments, can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the Church</hi>? Where he argues for the <hi>Unity of the Church</hi> (not to be divided by Schism) by two Arguments from this place. One from the <hi>firm Unity of God</hi>; noted in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are One</hi>; from whom this Church proceeds, (<hi>de divina firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate venientem.</hi>) The other, from their being United by the same <hi>Sacraments (sacramentis coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestibus cohaerentem</hi>) which relates to <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>The Spirit, the Water, and the Bloud agree in One.</hi> Which double Argument, from the two Verses, shew that, <hi>then,</hi> they were both read.</p>
               <p>And, as to the former of them (which is that in question) He cites it again, in his

               <p>'Tis manifest therefore that, <hi>These Three are One,</hi> was thus read in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time; as being by him twice cited, before the <hi>Arian</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie was on foot.</p>
               <p>And (before him) it is cited by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56317:27"/>
his Book <hi>adversus Praxeam,</hi> cap. 25. <hi>Connexus Patris in Filio, &amp; Filii in Paracleto, tres efficit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerentes, alterum ex altero</hi>: qui Tres Unum sunt, (<hi>non</hi> Unus:) <hi>quomodo dictum est,</hi> Ego &amp; Pater Unum sumus; <hi>ad Substantiae Unitatem, non ad Numeri Singularitatem.</hi> Where he doth not only cite the place, but doth likewise Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel and Compare, <hi>These Three are One,</hi> (in this place) with <hi>I and the Father are One,</hi> (in the other place) as being of a like import. That is, The Connexion of the Father with the Son, and of the Son with the Paraclete or Holy Ghost, makes these coherent one with the other: <hi>Which Three are ONE, (Unum</hi> not <hi>Unus,</hi> One <hi>Thing,</hi> not One <hi>Person</hi>;) like as it is said, <hi>I and the Father are One,</hi> (one <hi>Thing)</hi> as to the <hi>Unity of Substance,</hi> though not as to <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of Number.</hi> They are One <hi>Being,</hi> One <hi>Substance,</hi> though otherwise they may be <hi>Three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis therefore no New Interpolation; but was anciently so read by <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> (the two most ancient of the Latin Fathers) long before the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversie was on foot.

it, save that some of the <hi>Fathers</hi> (it is said) have omitted to Urge it against the <hi>Arians,</hi> when there hath been occasion of so doing.</p>
               <p>But this (beside that it is onely a Negative Argument, and I know not how well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) might very well happen, if it chanced to be wanting in that particular Copy which such Father used. (For we are not to suppose they had then such plenty of Bibles as are now in our hands; but some one Manuscript Copy was to serve many.) And because that in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel, <hi>I and the Father are One,</hi> did fit their purpose as well, or rather better, than this in his Epistle, <hi>These Three are One.</hi> For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, then on foot, was not so much that of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as that of the <hi>Divinity of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To return, therefore, to the place which is before us; From what hath been said, it is manifest enough, that St. <hi>John,</hi> in calling the Father, <hi>the Onely True God,</hi> did not intend to exclude <hi>the Son,</hi> from being <hi>the same</hi> True God; whom himself doth elsewhere call <hi>the True God</hi> also, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20.</p>
               <p>No more (I say) than what is said, by name, of <hi>God the Redeemer</hi> (Isa. 44.6, 8.) is to be thought exclusive of <hi>God the Creator,</hi> or <hi>God the Father; Thus saith the Lord, the REDEEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER,

               <p>And the reason of using the word <hi>Person</hi> in this abusive or improper sense; is, for want of an <hi>English</hi> word to answer the <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>Homo,</hi> or the <hi>Greek</hi>

make use of <hi>Person</hi> in a borrowed sense, rather than to use a <hi>Circumlocution</hi> of <hi>Man and Woman,</hi> by naming both Sexes.</p>
               <p>And if we should use such Circumlocution of <hi>Man and Woman</hi>; yet even this would not reach the whole <hi>Species.</hi> For we do not use to call them <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> till they be of a considerable <hi>Age</hi>; before which time they are called <hi>Children</hi>; and therefore to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the whole <hi>Species,</hi> we say, <hi>Man, Woman, and Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do indeed, sometimes, to that purpose, make use of the word <hi>Mankind,</hi> (adding the word <hi>kind</hi> to that of <hi>Man,</hi> to Ampliate the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it.)

               <p>For what in <hi>English</hi> we sometimes mean by <hi>Three Persons</hi> (taken indifferently for <hi>Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children,</hi>) the <hi>Latins</hi> would not have

               </p>
               <p>Nor do I find that in approved <hi>Latin</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, the word <hi>Persona</hi> was wont to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by them (as by the Schoolmen it hath since been) to <hi>Angels</hi>; nor to their <hi>Genii,</hi> or <hi>Heathen Gods.</hi>

               <p>But, 5.

And he that is this Year, a <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> may be, next Year, but an <hi>Alderman,</hi> or not so much.</p>
               <p>Hence are those <hi>Latin</hi> Phrases, frequent in approved Authours; <hi>Personam imponere</hi> (to put a Man into an <hi>Office,</hi> or confer a <hi>Dignity</hi> upon him;) <hi>Induere personam</hi> (to take upon him the Office;) <hi>Sustinere personam</hi> (to Bear an Office,

               <p>And this takes away the very Foundation of their Objection; Which proceeds upon this Mistake, as if <hi>Three Persons</hi> (in a proper sense) must needs imply <hi>Three Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:56317:33"/>6. Now if <hi>Three Persons</hi> (in the proper sense of the word Person) may be <hi>One Man</hi>; what hinders but that <hi>Three Divine Persons</hi> (in a sense Metaphorical) may be <hi>One God</hi>? What hinders but that <hi>the same God,</hi> considered as the Maker and Sovereign of all the World, may be God the <hi>Creator,</hi> or God the <hi>Father</hi>; and the same God considered, as to his special Care of Mankind, as the Ruthour of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be God the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> or God the <hi>Son</hi>; and the same God, as working effectually on the Hearts of his Elect, be God the <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> or God the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi>?</p>
               <p>And what hinders but that the <hi>same God,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished according to these <hi>three Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> may fitly be said to be <hi>Three Persons</hi>? Or (if the word <hi>Person</hi> do not please) <hi>Three Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whats</hi> that are but <hi>One God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this seems to me a Full and Clear So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of that Objection, which they would have to be thought Insuperable.</p>

            <div type="objection">
               <head>Objection V.</head>
               <p>It may perhaps be Objected further, Why must we needs make use of the word <hi>Person</hi>; and call them <hi>Three Persons,</hi> if Three <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whats</hi> will serve as well?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56317:34"/>I answer, <hi>First,</hi> We have no such need of the word <hi>Person,</hi> but that we can spare it. <hi>Hypostasis</hi> will serve our turn as well. And if they think the <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>Persona,</hi> be not a good Translation of the <hi>Greek Hypostasis</hi>; Let them retain the <hi>Greek</hi> word. (We mean the same by both.) And then perhaps they will find themselves at a loss, to fasten some of their Objections upon the word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> which they would fasten upon <hi>Persona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the <hi>Thing</hi> be thus far agreed, That these <hi>Three Somewhats</hi> (thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) may be <hi>One God</hi>: I see not why they should contend with us about the <hi>Name Person.</hi> For this is only to quarrel about a <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Name,</hi> when the <hi>Notion</hi> is agreed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it were admitted (which I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for) that the word <hi>Person</hi> doth not fitly express that <hi>Notion</hi> which it is intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; the most that can be inferred from it, is but, That we have not given it so fit a <hi>Name</hi>: And, to cavil at that, when the Notion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it is understood; were just as if one should argue, There never was such a <hi>Man,</hi> as whom they called <hi>Pope Pius</hi>; because the <hi>Man,</hi> who was so called, was not a <hi>Pious</hi> Man.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:56317:34"/>4. But I see not why the word <hi>Person</hi> should not be thought a very fit word for this purpose.</p>
               <p>For Two of these Three are represented to us in Scripture under the Names of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi>; and this Son as <hi>Begotten</hi> of the Father; (and therefore <hi>these</hi> Names are not to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with:) But all this in a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> sense; (For no Man can suppose, that this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> doth so <hi>Beget</hi> this <hi>Son,</hi> as these words do <hi>properly</hi> signifie amongst Men).</p>
               <p>Now the Relations of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> in a <hi>proper</hi> sense, are such as are properly denoted by the word <hi>Persona,</hi> in its proper Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And consequently the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> in a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> sense, may (by a Continuation of the same Metaphor) be fitly called <hi>Persons,</hi> in that Metaphorical sense. And in what sense they be <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> in a like sense they be <hi>Persons,</hi> according to the Propriety of the <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>Persona.</hi> For such <hi>Relatives</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Personas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> may fitly be so called; no doubt but the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> may be so called also, as One <hi>Proceeding</hi> or <hi>Coming forth</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) from them. As in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26.


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56317:35"/>
                  <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, he will teach you all things.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. <hi>The Comforter, whom I will send you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testifie of Me.</hi> Where it is manifest, that, in what sense the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> are to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Persons</hi>; the <hi>Comforter</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> is, in the same sense, <hi>so</hi> to be reputed.</p>
               <p>So that (I think) I have clearly Vindicated, not only the <hi>Notion,</hi> That these Three <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whats</hi> may be <hi>One God</hi>; But the <hi>Name</hi> also, That these <hi>Somewhats,</hi> may fitly be called <hi>Persons.</hi>

               <p>That 6<hi>th.</hi> Objection (and 'tis but a weak one) is this. The <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do not all agree, but differ among themselves, in expressing their Notions in this Matter.</p>
               <p>Very well. And do not the <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> differ much more? Doth not the <hi>Arian</hi> and the <hi>Socinian</hi> differ as much from one another, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them do from us; (and <hi>declare</hi> that they so do?) And do not the <hi>Arians</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56317:35"/>
and the <hi>Socinians</hi> amongst themselves, differ more than do the <hi>Trinitarians?</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they do.</p>
               <p>It must be confessed, that different Men, as well in the same as in different Ages, have very differently expressed themselves, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different Sentiments of <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality</hi>; and of the particular <hi>Distinctions</hi> of the three Persons among themselves.</p>
               <p>But so it is in all the most obvious things in the world. As, in <hi>Time, Place, Space, Motion,</hi> and the like. We are all apt to think, that we all know well enough, what we mean by those Words, till we be asked.

               <p>What a folly then is it to require that, in the things of God, we should all <hi>so</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to express our thoughts <hi>just in the same manner</hi>; as is not possible to do in the most obvious things we meet with?</p>
               <p>And, in such a case as wherein to express our Notions, we have no Words but <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative,</hi> it is not to be thought strange, that one man should make use of <hi>one Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,</hi> and another of <hi>another,</hi> according as their several Fansies serve.</p>
               <p>But thus far, I think, the Orthodox are all agreed; That between these <hi>Three,</hi> which the Scripture calls <hi>The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,</hi> or <hi>the Father, the Word, and the Spirit,</hi> there is a <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they have thought fit to denote by the Word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> or <hi>Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are also all agreed; that one of these Persons (namely the <hi>Son</hi> or the <hi>Word</hi>) was <hi>Incarnate,</hi> or <hi>Made Flesh,</hi> and did take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self our <hi>Humane Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to the particular <hi>Modes,</hi> or <hi>Manner How</hi>; either how these two <hi>Natures</hi> are <hi>United,</hi> or how these three <hi>Persons</hi> are <hi>Distinguished</hi> each from other: we may be content to be <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi> farther than God hath been pleased to Reveal to us.</p>
               <p>We know that our <hi>Immortal Soul</hi> is join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an <hi>Humane Body,</hi> so as to make <hi>One Man</hi> (without ceasing, <hi>that</hi> to be a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> to be a <hi>Body</hi>:) But 'tis hard for us to say <hi>How.</hi> And accordingly we say, that <hi>the Man Christ Jesus,</hi> (without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be <hi>Man,</hi>) and <hi>God manifested in the Flesh,</hi> (without ceasing to be <hi>God,</hi>) are <hi>One Christ</hi>: But what kind of <hi>Union</hi> this is, which we call <hi>Hypostatical,</hi> we do not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand.

            <p>I Have, in a former Discourse from this Verse, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi>; not so much, as being contained in it, as occasioned by it.</p>
            <p>I have shewed that the word <hi>Onely</hi> is here restrictive, not of the Subject <hi>Thee,</hi> but of the Predicate <hi>True God.</hi> Affirming <hi>the Father</hi> to be <hi>the Onely True God,</hi> though not <hi>the Father Onely.</hi> Nor is it exclusive of <hi>the Son,</hi> who is also the same <hi>True God</hi>; and is so expresly called, by this same Writer, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. where (speaking of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

Christ</hi>) he says, <hi>This is the True God, and Eternal Life</hi>; as if it were spoken with a direct aspect to the words before us.</p>

                  <head>CHARACTER I.</head>
                  <p>The first Character, which we meet with, of this God, is that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth.</hi> Which I think no man doubts but to be meant of the <hi>True</hi> God, the <hi>Supreme</hi> God. And by virtue of this, he claims the Sovereignty thereof; <hi>The Earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof,</hi> Psal. 24.1. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, the Lord of all the Earth,</hi> Josh. 3.11, 13. <hi>The God of the Heaven, and the God of the Earth,</hi> Gen. 24.3. <hi>The Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my Footstool,</hi> Isa. 66.1. <hi>Behold the Heaven, and the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, is the Lord's, the Earth also, and all that is therein,</hi> Deut. 10.14.</p>
                  <p>The same Character is applied to God very often, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.5, 8. <hi>Thus saith God the Lord</hi> (Jehovah) <hi>he that created the Heavens and stretched them out; he that spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. I am the Lord</hi> (Jehovah) <hi>that is my name, and my Glory will I not give unto another.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 48.13. <hi>Mine hand hath laid the foundation of the Earth, and my right hand hath spanned</hi> (or <hi>spread out) the Heavens.</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.3. <hi>When I consider the Heavens, the work of Thy fingers; the Moon and the Stars which thou hast ordained.</hi> Psal. 146.6. <hi>Which made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is.</hi> And many other places, not only in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; but in the New Testament likewise; as <hi>Acts</hi> 14.15. <hi>That ye should turn from these vanities unto the Living God, who made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea and all things that are therein.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24. <hi>God that made the World, and all things therein.</hi> So <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thou hast created all things.</hi> Chap. 14.7. <hi>Him that made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and the Sea, and the Fountains of Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is the distinctive Character, whereby he doth


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56317:39"/>
distinguish himself from all other pretended Gods, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. Where he who at <hi>ver.</hi> 10. is called <hi>The Lord, the true God, the living God, an everlasting King, at who's wrath the Earth shall tremble, and the Nations shall not abide his indignation</hi>; doth at <hi>ver.</hi> 11. give this defiance to all other Gods, <hi>Thus shall ye say to them; The Gods which have not made the Heavens and the Earth, they shall perish from the Earth, and from under these Heavens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Character we find ascribed to Christ. Not only, where it is spoken as of God indefinitely, but to be understood of Christ; (as are some of the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned:) But even where it is particularly applied to him.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin with that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2. where we have a large Discourse of him, <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> Where, by the <hi>Word</hi> is meant <hi>Christ,</hi> as is evident from the further descriptions of him in the following verses; 'Tis he of whom <hi>John the Baptist</hi> came to <hi>bear witness, ver.</hi> 7, 8. He who <hi>came into the World, but the World knew him not. ver.</hi> 10. Who <hi>came to his own, but his own received him not; but to as many as received him, he gave power to become the Sons of God. ver.</hi> 11.12. Who <hi>was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us, and we beheld his glory; the glory as of the onely begotten of the Father. ver.</hi> 14.

And at ver. 24, 25, 26, 27. he speaks thus, <hi>O my God, thy years are throughout all Generations; Thou of old hast laid the Foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thy hands</hi>; (who is the <hi>same God</hi> therefore of whom <hi>Moses</hi> had before said, <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> Gen. 1.1.) <hi>They shall perish</hi> (as the Psalmist proceeds) <hi>but thou shalt endure: Yea all of them shall wax old as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.</hi> And doubtless the Psalmist, when he made this long Prayer, thought not of addressing himself to any other than the <hi>Supreme God.</hi> (Not to a God who had not, <hi>then,</hi> a Being, nor was to have till a <hi>Thousand Years</hi> after, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have us think of Christ.)

It begins thus, <hi>Hear my prayer O LORD</hi> (Jehovah) <hi>and let my cry come unto thee.</hi> And he to whom this prayer is made, is eight or nine times called <hi>the LORD</hi> (Jehovah.)

                  <p>The last Character (which I shall insist upon) of the <hi>True</hi> God, the <hi>Only</hi> God; is that of the <hi>Lord God of Israel; Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.

And <hi>the Lord thy God,</hi> is almost the constant Language of <hi>Moses</hi> to the Children of <hi>Israel:</hi> And it is the Character which God directs him to use; <hi>Thus shalt thou say unto the Children of Israel, The Lord God of your Fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me; this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all Generations,</hi> Exod. 3.15. and <hi>the Lord God of the Hebrews,</hi> ver. 18. And elsewhere very often throughout the Bible. And doubtless, he that was the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> is the true God, the only God.</p>
                  <p>'Tis <hi>He</hi> who tells us, <hi>I am the Lord thy God— Thou shalt have no other God but Me,</hi> Exod. 20.3. And, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Me, there is no other God,</hi> Isai. 44.6. and so often elsewhere, that it is needless to name the places.</p>
                  <p>And this Character, as well as the rest, is expresly given to Christ also, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.16, 17. where we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly told of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> that <hi>many of the Children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord Their God</hi> (to the Lord God of <hi>Israel:) for he shall go before Him in the spirit and

                  </p>
                  <p>I might add many other Characters given to Christ, proving him to be the True God; as that <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. <hi>I am he which searcheth the Reins and Hearts, and I will give unto every one according to his Works,</hi> (and to the same purpose, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12. and elsewhere:) which God (the True God) claims as his peculiar Prerogative, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, 10. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, Who can know it?

               <head>OBJECTION VIII.</head>
               <p>The last Objection which I shall now take notice of, is this; That the Doctrine of the Trinity was not known to the Jewish Church before Christ.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, 1. If it were not made known to them, it was not necessary for them to know. For mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of pure Revelation, are not necessary to be known, before they are revealed, (nor farther than they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed:) But may be so to us, to whom they <hi>are</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
               <p>The whole Doctrine of our Redemption by Christ, was (doubtless) unknown to <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall;


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56317:47"/>
And, had he not fallen, it would have been no fault in him not to have known it at all.</p>
               <p>And when (after his fall) it was first made known to him, (in that first promise, that <hi>the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should break the Serpents head,</hi> Gen. 3.15.) it was yet so dark, that he could know very little (as to the particulars of it) of what is now known to us. And as God by <hi>parcels (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) at sundry times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners,</hi> declared more of it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> so were they obliged to know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more of it: and when <hi>in the last days</hi> he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the whole of it <hi>by his Son</hi>; Heb. 1.1, 2. it is now necessary for us to believe much more; of which they might be safely ignorant. And, of the Trinity likewise, if it were not then revealed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But Secondly, There were many things, which though not fully revealed, so as to be clearly understood by All; were yet so insinuated, as to be in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure understood by some; and would more be so, when <hi>the Veil should be taken off from Moses</hi>'s <hi>face,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.13, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ, were not understood, even by his own <hi>Disciples,</hi> till after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Yet we must not say that these things were not before intimated in the Scriptures (though covertly;) for when <hi>their understandings were opened, to understand the Scriptures,</hi> and what had been <hi>written of him in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms</hi>; they then perceived that <hi>it was so written,</hi> and that <hi>it behooved Christ to Suffer and to Rise from the dead the Third day.</hi> Yet this was therein so covertly contained, that they seem no more to have understood it, than that of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> declares a great deal to have been covered under <hi>the Jewish Rites


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56317:47"/>
and Ceremonies;</hi> which, certainly, most of the Jewish Church did not understand; though, in good measure, it might be understood by some.</p>
               <p>I might say the like of the <hi>Resurrection</hi>; which was but darkly discovered till <hi>Immortality was brought to light through the Gospel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10. We must not yet say, it was wholly <hi>unknown</hi> to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, (of whom many, no doubt, did believe it:) Yet neither can we say, it was generally received; For we know the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> and the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were divided upon that point, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.6, 7, 8. And so little is said of it in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, that those who had a mind to be captious, might have found much more specious pretence of cavilling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it <hi>then,</hi> than our Adversaries <hi>now</hi> have against the Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I say Thirdly, as of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> there were then divers intimations, which are now better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood (in a clearer light) than at that time they were: So I think there were also of the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> I shall instance in some of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was, in the Unity of the God-head, a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Somewhat (which now we call Persons) seems fairly to be insinuated, even in that of <hi>Elohim-bara,</hi> Gen. 1.1. <hi>(In the beginning God created,)</hi> where <hi>Elohim</hi> (God) a Nominative Case Plural, is joined with <hi>Bara,</hi> a Verb Singular; (which is as if we should say in English, <hi>We Am,</hi> or <hi>They Doth</hi>; which would to us sound odly, if somewhat of Mystery be not intended in it.) Nor is it here only, but very frequently, that God is called <hi>Elohim</hi> in the Plural Number, (and much oftner than in the Singular Number <hi>Eloah,</hi>) as if, though <hi>Jehovah</hi> be but <hi>One,</hi> yet <hi>Elohim</hi> may be <hi>Three</hi>: Not Three <hi>Gods,</hi> but Three <hi>Somewhats</hi> in that One God. (For though it be <hi>Elohim,</hi> yet it is <hi>Bara:</hi> It is <hi>So</hi> Three, as yet to be <hi>One.</hi>) Nor is it <hi>Elohajim</hi> (in the Dual Number) as spoken of


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56317:48"/>
                  <hi>Two,</hi> or a <hi>Couple</hi>; but <hi>Elohim</hi> (in the Plural Number) as of <hi>more than Two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may perhaps be called a <hi>Criticism,</hi> (and it is so.) But I am loth to say, it is purely <hi>Casual,</hi> and not designed. For many times little Circumstances, and unheeded Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions (as at first they may seem to be,) may (by the Divine Wisdom) be fore-designed to some considerable purpose. As, that of, <hi>Not a bone of it shall be broken, Exod.</hi> 12.46. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.20. And that of, <hi>they pierced my hands and my feet,</hi> Psal. 22.16. And, <hi>they shall look upon him whom they have pierced,</hi> Zach. 12.10. And that, <hi>they part my garment among them, and on my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture they cast lots,</hi> Psal. 22.18. And, <hi>they gave me gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink,</hi> Psal. 69.21. Which are most of them, but Poetical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; and seemingly casual, and undesigned, as to their Literal Sense; but were providentially ordered, as being literally to be fulfilled; as we find in <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.23, 24, 28, 29, 36, 37. and in the places parallel of the other Gospels.</p>
               <p>I might instance in a great many such, which at first might seem Casual, but were Providentially designed. I shall content my self at present with one more; which is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (which perhaps may be thought to look as like a <hi>Criticism</hi> as what I mention) <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to Seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy Seed which is Christ.</hi> Now the <hi>promises</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which he refers, are those <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16, 17, 18. (which, I think, is the only place, where, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> such mention is made of <hi>his Seed.) By my self have I sworn, saith the Lord; For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy Son, thine onely Son; That in blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thy Seed, as the stars of the heaven,


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56317:48"/>
and as the sand which is upon the sea-shoar, and thy Seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Abraham's Seed,</hi> here, is manifestly meant <hi>his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> whom God promiseth to <hi>multiply.</hi> And it might seem to be very indifferent whether to say, <hi>thy Seed,</hi> or <hi>thy Children.</hi> But St. <hi>Paul</hi> was so nice a <hi>Critick,</hi> as to take advantage of his saying <hi>Seed</hi> (in the Singular Number) and not <hi>Seeds</hi> or <hi>Children</hi> (in the Plural) as thereby signally denoting (as principally intended) that <hi>One Seed,</hi> which is <hi>Christ.</hi> Yet are not the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> to be quite excluded (even in that last Clause of it, <hi>In thy Seed shall all the Nations of the earth be blessed,)</hi> as appears by <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. <hi>And ye (men of Israel,</hi> ver. 12.) <hi>are the Children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy Seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</hi> Whence 'tis evident, that seemingly unheeded Criticisms are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Providentially designed. And such I take this of <hi>Bara Elohim,</hi> to be. And it is taken notice of to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, both by <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> writers.</p>
               <p>The like <hi>Plurality</hi> seems plainly intimated in the same Chapter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Let VS make man in OVR image and after OVR likeness.</hi> Yet even this <hi>Plurality</hi> is no other than what in another consideration, is an <hi>Vnity</hi>; for so it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>So God created man in HIS own image.</hi> These <hi>Plural Somewhats,</hi> therefore, are but <hi>One God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 'tis but a childish excuse to say, It is the <hi>Stile of Princes</hi> to speak in the Plural, <hi>We</hi> and <hi>Vs</hi> instead of <hi>I</hi> and <hi>Me.</hi> 'Tis indeed a piece of Courtship at this day, (and perhaps hath been for some Ages:) But how long hath it been so? 'Tis not so old as <hi>Moses</hi>; much less so old as the <hi>Creation.</hi> King <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and <hi>Senacharib,</hi> and


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56317:49"/>
                  <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> were wont to say <hi>I, Me, Mine,</hi> (not <hi>We, Vs, Ours.</hi>) And <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> even in the <hi>Height</hi> of his <hi>Pride,</hi> Dan. 4.30. <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built, by the might of MY Power, and for the honour of MY Majesty.</hi> Here's nothing of <hi>We</hi> and <hi>Our.</hi> This was not <hi>Stilus Regius</hi> in those days. And if we should here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it by such an equivalence; <hi>And God said, Let Me make man in My image</hi>; it would scarce sound like good Sense. (For 'tis not usual to speak <hi>Imperatively</hi> in the <hi>First person Singular.)</hi> It seems therefore to imply a <hi>Plurality,</hi> though not a Plurality of <hi>Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like we have <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Behold, the man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like One of Vs.</hi> Is this also <hi>Stilo Regio,</hi> instead of, <hi>The man is become like one of Me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.6, 7. <hi>And the LORD</hi> (Jehovah) <hi>said, Let VS go down, and confound their Language.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And as these places intimate a <hi>Plurality,</hi> so I know not but that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. may intimate this <hi>Plurality,</hi> to be a <hi>Trinity.</hi> That the appearance there of <hi>three Men</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was a <hi>Divine Apparition</hi> (though <hi>Abraham</hi> did not at first apprehend it so to be) is evident. For it is expresly said by <hi>Moses,</hi> ver 1. <hi>The LORD</hi> (Jehovah) <hi>appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre; and he lift up his eyes, and lo Three Men stood by him.</hi> So that this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Three Men,</hi> was an appearance of the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi> And though we do not find that <hi>Abraham</hi> doth any where use the word <hi>Jehovah</hi> in that discourse, (but <hi>Adonai</hi> all along:) Yet <hi>Moses</hi> the Relater (where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self speaks) says every where <hi>Jehovah</hi>; though when he recites <hi>Abraham</hi>'s words, it is <hi>Adonai:</hi> But even <hi>Adonai</hi> is a word Plural (as well as <hi>Elohim)</hi> that is, <hi>my Lords,</hi> (the Singular is <hi>Adoni, my Lord</hi>; but seldom said of God.)</p>
               <p>Whether it were, that the name <hi>JEHOVAH</hi> were not then <hi>known</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> (according to that of


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56317:49"/>
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3.) or that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not at first aware who it was with whom he was then discoursing; or for what other reason he did avoid using the name <hi>Jehovah</hi>; I shall not trouble my self curiously to enquire: But sure we are that <hi>Moses</hi> tells us, This Apparition of <hi>Three Men</hi> (as at first they seemed to be) was an Apparition of the Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We need not doubt therefore, but that <hi>God</hi> appeared there, in this Apparition of <hi>Three Men</hi>; which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fair intimation of a <hi>Trinity of Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might perhaps be cavill'd at, if this were all: And so might that of <hi>Jonah</hi>'s being <hi>three days and three nights in the Whale's belly,</hi> when brought as an Argument to prove our Saviour ought <hi>so long</hi> to lie in the Grave. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, 4. that Christ died for our sins <hi>according to the Scriptures</hi>; and that he rose again the <hi>Third day, according to the Scriptures.</hi> (And Christ in like manner, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.46.) Yet I know not any thing more clear to that purpose <hi>in the Scriptures</hi> (of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament) than either this of <hi>Jonah</hi>'s being so long in the <hi>Whale's belly</hi> (to which Christ himself alludes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.40.) or that of <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.2. <hi>After two days he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive us, and the third day he will raise us up.</hi> Which seems not to be more express (for the Resurrection of Christ on the <hi>Third day)</hi> than this of <hi>Jonah.</hi> But such covert Intimations there are in the Old Testament; of things afterward more clearly discovered in the New.</p>
               <p>Nor was this unknown to the ancient Jewish Doctors, as appears by what <hi>Ainsworth</hi> (in his Notes on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.) cites from thence, (out of <hi>R. Simeon, Ben Jochai</hi> in <hi>Zoar;) Come see the Mystery of the word</hi> Elohim: <hi>there are three Degrees, and every Degree by it self Distinct; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they are all one, and joined together in One, and are not divided one from another,</hi> (only, there he calls <hi>Degrees</hi> what we now call <hi>Persons.</hi>) So that it was


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56317:50"/>
not unknown to the Jews of old, whatever the present Jews think of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What these <hi>Three</hi> are, (the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi>) seems to be likewise intimated in the Story of the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. where they seem to be distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the beginning</hi> (Elohim) <hi>God created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> ver. 1. where no man doubts but God the <hi>Father</hi> is implied, though perhaps not He only.</p>
               <p>And <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters.</hi> Where <hi>Ainsworth</hi> tells us from the ancient <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> whom he cites, they call him, <hi>The Spirit of Mercies from before the Lord: The Spirit of Wisdom, called, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Living God:</hi> And, <hi>The Spirit of the Messias.</hi> Of the same <hi>Spirit,</hi> we have elsewhere mention; <hi>My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit shall not always strive with Man,</hi> Gen. 6.3. <hi>Take not thine Holy Spirit from me,</hi> Psal. 51.11. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> Isai. 61.1. <hi>They vexed his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Isai. 63.10. and elsewhere. And if it be said, that by <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> is meant <hi>God himself:</hi> we say so too, for we do acknowledge, that the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> is <hi>God himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, of <hi>the Word,</hi> there is a like intimation, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>God Said</hi> (or spake the <hi>Word) Let there be Light, and there was Light.</hi> And in like manner, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 9, 11.14, 20. <hi>God Said, Let there be a Firmament,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.6, 7. <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He Spake and it was done, He Commanded and it stood fast.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 148.5. <hi>He Spake the Word and they were made, He commanded and they were created.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>By faith we understand that the Worlds were made by the Word of God.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5, 7. <hi>By the Word of God the Heavens were of old, and the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And by the same Word they are kept in store, or preserved.</hi> In which places, by <hi>the Word,</hi> so often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,

                  </gap>) is called the <hi>Word</hi> of God, and the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God. And as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 3, 10. it is said of <hi>the Word,</hi> that <hi>in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the Word, all things were made by Him, and the World was made by him:</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>The Worlds were framed by the Word of God.</hi> So the same is said of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Prov. 3.19. <hi>The LORD by VVisdom hath formed the Earth, by Vnderstanding hath he established the Heavens.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. &amp;c. <hi>The LORD possessed me</hi> (Wisdom) <hi>in the beginning of his way, before his works of old; I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, ere ever the Earth was;—When he prepared the Heavens I was there,— When he established the Clouds above,— When he strengthened the Fountains of the deep,— When he appointed the Foundations of the Earth, then was I by him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And accordingly the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is called the <hi>Power</hi> of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. <hi>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Power of the Highest shall over-shadow thee.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the Power of God, through Faith unto Salvation</hi>

               <p>But, (without laying too great a stress on every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,) there seems a foundation clear enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>Word</hi> of God, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, as clearly

distinguishable, even in the great Work of Creation; and that the holy Writers, even in the Old Testament, have considered them as distinct; and that even the Jewish Writers have owned them as such.</p>
               <p>I know very well that those who have a mind to be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, may cavil at these places, as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> of old did at those passages in the Old Testament tending to prove a <hi>Resurrection.</hi>

                  <hi>They sojourned in the Land of promise, as in a strange Land, dwelling in Tabernacles</hi> (movable from place to place) <hi>for they looked for a City which hath foundations</hi> (a fixed City, not flitting as were those Tabernacles,) <hi>whose buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and maker of God: Declaring plainly that they did seek a Country: Not such as that from whence they came; but a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Country, that is, a Heavenly: wherefore God is not asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a City</hi>; where he directly argues, that God's Promise, <hi>to be their God,</hi> was a Promise of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no doubt but the Prophets, and Men of God, had taught them all along, to put a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sense, upon those (seemingly) <hi>Temporal Promises,</hi> (though the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> would not believe it, but cavilled at it;) in so much that not only the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Doctors of the Law</hi>; but even the <hi>Women</hi> embraced it (even <hi>before</hi> Christ's Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;) <hi>I know saith Martha</hi> (of her dead Brother <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus) that he shall Rise again in the Resurrection, at the last day,</hi> Joh. 11.24.

               <p n="4">4. There is yet another Consideration which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this opinion, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> was not unknown to the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> before Christ: From the footsteps thereof yet extant in Heathen Writers.</p>
               <p>'Tis well known (to those conversant in such Studies) that much of the Heathen Learning (their Philosophy, Theology, and Mythology) was borrowed from the Jews; though much Disguised, and sometimes Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them. Which things though they be Fabulous, as disguised in a Romantick dress: yet they are good Evidence that there was a <hi>Truth in History,</hi> which gave occasion to those <hi>Fables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None doubts but <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Fable of the <hi>Chaos</hi> (of which all things were made) took its rise from <hi>Moses</hi>'s History of the <hi>Creation:</hi> And <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s <hi>Flood,</hi> from that of <hi>Noah:</hi> and the <hi>Titan</hi>'s fighting against the Gods, from the Builders of <hi>Babel</hi>'s Tower: And that of Two-faced <hi>Janus,</hi> from <hi>Noah</hi>'s looking backward &amp; forward to the World before and since the Flood. And many the like, of which we may see in <hi>Natalis Comes,</hi> in <hi>Bochartus,</hi> and others: And of which we have a large Collection in <hi>Theophilus Gale</hi>'s <hi>Court of the Gentiles.</hi> And in Dr. <hi>Duport</hi>'s <hi>Gnomologia Homerica</hi>; wherein is a Collection of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Sayings,</hi>

which look like Allusions to like Passages in Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and seem to be borrowed (most of them) from those Books of it, which were written before <hi>Homer</hi>'s time; who yet is one of the most Ancient and most Fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Heathen Writers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> hath borrowed so much of his Philosophy, History, and Theology, from the <hi>Jewish</hi> learning, as that he hath obtained the Title of (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And I am so far from thinking (as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have us) that St. <hi>John</hi> did but <hi>Platonize,</hi> and borrowed his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> from <hi>Plato</hi>'s Trinity; that I rather think, that <hi>Plato</hi> borrowed his <hi>Trinity</hi> (as he did many other things) from the <hi>Jewish Doctrine,</hi> though by him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised: And take it for a good Evidence, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, was then not unknown to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in the last Chapter of his Book, <hi>De Mundo;</hi> which is <hi>de Dei Nominibus:</hi> He tells us that <hi>God, though he be but One, hath many Names:</hi> And amongst those <hi>many,</hi> he reckons that of the <hi>Tres Parcae</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) or as we call them, <hi>the Three Destinies (Atropas, Clotho,</hi> and <hi>Lachesis</hi>; whom he doth accommodate to the three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities

of <hi>Time; past, present, and future,)</hi> to be <hi>One</hi> of these Names. Which, though numbred as <hi>Three,</hi> are but this <hi>One God.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. (And cites <hi>Plato</hi> to the same purpose) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So that it seems both <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> were of opinion, that <hi>Three Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whats</hi> may be <hi>One God.</hi> And this, in likelihood, they derived from the Jewish Learning.</p>
               <p>I might say the like of their <hi>three Judges</hi> in another World, <hi>Minos, Radamanthus</hi> and <hi>Aeacus.</hi> which thing though it be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous, yet it implies thus much, That they had <hi>then</hi> a Notion, not only of the <hi>Soul's Immortality,</hi> but also of a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> in another World, who should take Account of mens Actions in this World. And both these Notions they had, no doubt, from the <hi>Jewish</hi> Learning; from whence their most sublime Notions were derived.</p>
               <p>To these I might add that of their three-shap'd <hi>Chimaera</hi>; which their Poets feign to have been. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as is to be seen in <hi>Homer</hi> one of their most Ancient Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. And that of <hi>Cerberus,</hi> their three-headed Porter of the other World.</p>
               <p>Which Poetical Fictions, though invented perhaps to <hi>ridicule</hi> the Trinity; do yet at last argue that they had <hi>then</hi> some notices of a Trinity, (of <hi>Three Somewhats</hi> which were yet but <hi>One.</hi>) For, if they had no notice of it, they could not have ridiculed it.</p>
               <p>Our Adversaries, perhaps, may please themselves with the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, that <hi>Chimaera</hi> and <hi>Cerberus</hi> are brought in to prove the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they mistake the point: We are not now <hi>Proving</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, (which is already settled on a firmer Foundation;) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, whether <hi>this</hi> Doctrine were <hi>then</hi> known. And as we think it a good argument to prove the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> to have been known in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s time, (and known to <hi>him,)</hi> because <hi>Lucian</hi> doth <hi>Scoff</hi> at it; which he could not have done, if he had known nothing of it: So is it a good Argument to prove the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> to have been <hi>then</hi> known, when it was ridiculed.</p>
               <p>And it proves also, that there might be <hi>then</hi> prophane Wits to ridicule it, as there are <hi>now</hi> to <hi>Blaspheme the Trinity,</hi> as a <hi>three-headed
