            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSAL Humbly Preſented to the Right Honourable the HOUSE of COMMONS, by which it is Reaſonable to Suppoſe a Million may be Raiſed (and as it is hoped much more) without Oppreſſing any Perſon, every one being at their Liberty to Pay, or not to Pay.</head>
            <p>IF this Honourable Aſſembly think good to Enact, That no Perſon of any Rank, Quality, or Condition whatever, ſhall in their Wearing Apparel, uſe or wear any thing that is not of the true Growth, Product, and Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Kingdom; for and during one whole year, to Commence from the 25th of <hi>March</hi> next, except they take out Liſences for the ſame at a certain Rate; ſome Rates being hereafter ſpecified, which are Humbly Submitted to the Candid Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this Auguſt Aſſembly to Judge of the Equality of.</p>
            <p>That every Duke, Dutches, Marques and Marchioneſs, Earl and Counteſs, pay for ſuch Liſence Five Pounds each, and for their Children under their Tuition, Two Pounds each; that all Perſons under the Degree of an Earl and Counteſs, to a Knight and his Lady incluſive, do pay for ſuch Liſence Four Pounds each, and for their Children, One Pound Ten Shillings each; That all Eſquires by Birth or Place, all Gentlemen, all Clergy Men, all Lawyers, all Merchants and Whole-Sale Trades Men, and all Officers either in His Majeſty's Cuſtoms or elſewhere, whoſe Salaries are Forty Pound a Year, or above, and their Wives to pay for ſuch Liſence Two Pounds Ten Shillings each, and for their Children One Pound each; That all Yeoman Men and Rich Farmers, all Servants, or Men that have any Place whoſe Wages or Sallary is Twenty Pounds a Year or upward, and under Forty; all Retale Trades-Men (except ſuch Handy-Craft Trades that get their Living only by their Work) and their Wives, do pay for ſuch Liſence one Pound each, and for their Children Ten Shllings each; That all other, be they Handy-Craft Trades or Servants, or any other Perſon not before mentioned, and their Wives that take ſuch Liſence, ſhall pay for each Ten Shillings, and for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Five Shillings each.</p>
            <p>And it is Humbly Suppoſed, That at the Rates before ſpecified, it may riſe to a far greater Summ than is firſt mentioned; but if it ſhould fall ſhort of ſuch a Sum (as in all probability it will not) yet whatever Money it doth raiſe, will be preſent Money, and therefore much better than any that will be longer in raiſing; and for the better Effecting the ſame, Books with Blank Liſences may be Printed and Numbered, and room left in the ſaid Books where the Liſence is cut out, to inſert the Perſon's Name, Quality, and Place of Abode that hath ſuch Liſence: And other Cautions are ready to be Propoſed, that will be ſufficicnt to ſecure the Act for being Evaded, or any Perſon Wrong'd, if this moſt Honourable and Auguſt Aſſembly ſhall think fit to make ſuch Act, and to Rectifie the Rates before Propoſed, if found in any part unequal: And it is Humbly Suppoſed, That ſuch Act can be no hindrance or diſadvantage to any Trade whatever, for it may reaſonably be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that moſt People will take out ſuch Liſences rather than lay by the Cloaths they have already, and buy others conformable to the Act, which will coſt more than the Liſence by much; and it is hoped, that ſuch Act in one years time may diſcover ſuch Advantages for the Publick good, as may induce it hereafter to be turned into a perpetual Law; All which is Humbly Submitted to the Wiſdom and Candid Cenſure of this Honourable Aſſembly, by a Real Lover of the preſent Government, and the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and is Your Honours moſt Dutiful, Obedient, and Humble Servant,</p>
