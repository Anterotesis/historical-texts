            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>The Reaſons of the Commons-Houſe delivered by Mr.</hi> Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, <hi>why they cannot admit of the Propoſitions tendered vnto them by the Lords.</hi>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Am Commanded by the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to deliver vnto your Lordſhips their reaſons why they cannot admit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition tendered vnto them by you, but for an introduction to the buſineſſe; pleaſe you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that a Petition of right was ſhewed to your Lordſhips, wherein we deſired you would joyne with vs; a Petition my Lords fitting for theſe times, grounded vpon Law, and ſeeking no more then the Subiects juſt libertie.</p>
                  <p>The Petition conſiſteth of foure parts: The firſt, touching Loanes, Aydes and Taxes; The ſecond, touching Impriſonment of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; The third, touching Billetting of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; The fourth, touching Commiſſions iſſued for Martiall law and put in execution vpon ſeverall perſons; groaning vnder the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of theſe wee deſire remedy, and wiſh your Lordſhips would joyne with vs, which you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken into conſideration, wee muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe haue dealt nobly and freely with vs, not to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3280:3"/>
conclude any thing till you heare our juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for which wee thanke your Lordſhips, and hope your Lordſhips will value thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which wee ſhall now offer vnto your Lordſhips.</p>
                  <p>The worke of this day will make a happie iſſue, if your Lordſhips pleaſe to relinquiſh this, as wee formerly vpon Conference with your Lordſhips haue done ſome other things; For the Propoſition my Lords, wee haue deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it throughly in our Houſe, and I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to deliver vnto you the Reaſons, why we cannot inſert this Clauſe, neither your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips nor wee deſire to debate Libertie beyond the due bounds, nor to incroach vpon the Kings prerogatiue and leſſen the bounds thereof.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon I am to lay downe, is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soveraigne power, which I beſeech you not to accept as mine owne, being but a weake member of that ſtrong body, but as the reaſons of the whole Houſe vpon great and graue Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt my Lords, the words <hi>(Soveraigne Power)</hi> hath either reference or no reference to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; If no reference, then ſuperfluous; if a reference, dangerous, and operatiue vpon the petition: And wee thinke your Lordſhips pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is not to offer vnto vs any thing that may bee vaine, or to the hinderance of any thing wherein you haue already joyned with vs. The Petition declareth the right of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3280:3"/>
which yet may bee broken by the word, (Soveraigne power,) and ſo the vertue of the Petition taken away, the end of the petition is not to inlarge the bounds of Law but their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, being infringed to reduce them to their auncient bounds, and ſhall wee by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe words (Soveraigne power,) in ſtead of Curing the wound, launch it, and Cut it the deeper.</p>
                  <p>The next point is the word, Truſt; a word of large latitude and deepe ſence. Wee know that there is a truſt in the Crowne and King, but regulated by Law, wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in penall Statutes, the King may graunt another power to Diſpence with the Law, But <hi>Magna Charta</hi> inflicting no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie leaveth no truſt, but claimeth his owne right; therefore the word, Truſt, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found this diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Our next reaſon is, Wee thinke it abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to any courſe of Parliament, to put Saving to the Petition: in former times the courſe of petitioning the King was this; The Lords and the Speaker ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by words or writing preferred their Petition to the King, this then was called the Bill of the Commons, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the King, part hee receiued and part he put out, part hee ratified; for as it came from him it was drawne into a Law, but this Courſe in the ſecond of <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. was found
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3280:4"/>
preiudiciall to the Subiect, and ſince in ſuch Caſes haue petitioned by Petition of right as wee now doe, who come to declare what we Demaund of the King; for if wee ſhould tell him what we ſhould not demaund, wee ſhould then, not proceed in a Parliamentory courſe. Now for that, which is alledged by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, <hi>De articulis ſuper cartis,</hi> That my Lords is not like this, That is ſaving vpon particulers, but this Petition conſiſting vpon particulers would bee deſtroyed by a generall ſaving, the ſaving <hi>de articulis ſuper Cartis,</hi> are of three aids; for ranſomming the Kings perſon for Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings eldeſt Sonne, and once for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Kings eldeſt Daughter. Theſe by the forme of the Petition ſhew, that they came not in, vpon the Kings anſwere but vpon the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; firſt then followed the ſavings, which (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour) wee thinke are no reaſons, to make vs accept of this ſaving, being not pertinent to the Petition.</p>
                  <p>Theſe 23. Stat. made 34. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. were made to confirme <hi>Magna Carta:</hi> ſo that there is in all 30. Acts, to ſet <hi>Magna Carta</hi> in his purity, and if ſome ſubſequent Statute, haue laid ſome ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh vpon it, ſhall wee now then make the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in worſe caſe by laying more weight vpon it (God forbid.) In the next place, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips reaſon thus, that this which you wiſh wee would admit of is no more, then what wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did profeſſe by the Speaker, when wee
<pb facs="tcp:3280:4"/>
ſent the King word, wee had no purpoſe at all, to trench vpon his Prerogatiues; It is true my Lords, wee did ſo, but this was not anexed to any Petition, for in that manner we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue done it, And here I am Commanded (with your favours) to deliver vnto you what a Learned member of the houſe delivered vnto our Houſe, touching this point. The King (ſaith hee) and the Subiect hath two Liberties, two Mannors joyning one vpon another; The King is informed the Subiect hath intruded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but vpon tryall it appeareth not to bee ſo; were it fitting thinke you, that the Subiect ſhould giue ſecuritie, that hee ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach or intrude of that Mannor of his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King had beene informed hee did ſo, I thinke you will be of another minde; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am Commanded (ſeeing wee cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of this addition) to deſire your Lordſhips, to joyne with vs in the Petition, which being graunted, and the hearts of the King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple knit together, I doubt not, but his Maieſtie will bee ſafe at home, and feared abroad.</p>

The reply to the Legall your Lordſhips have heard; my ſelfe come intruſted to reply to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, which alſo conſiſted of two branches. The firſt deduced from the whole context of the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall clauſe; the ſecond inforced out of ſome part.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt were theſe reaſons, That the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Our acceptance.

to what Our ſelues had often proteſted and profeſſed expreſſely by the mouth of Our Speaker.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe theſe motives were weighty and of great force; and therfore to avoide miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding &amp; miſ-conceit, which otherwiſe might be taken againſt the Houſe of Commons upon refuſall of the propounded addition, it is neceſſarie to ſtate the queſtion rightly, and to ſet downe the true dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene your Lordſhips and Vs. Now indeede there is no queſtion or difference between your Lordſhips and Vs, concerning this additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall clauſe in the nature and qualitie of a propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ſo conſidered, We ſay it is moſt true, and to be received &amp; imbraced by Vs, <hi>in toto, &amp; quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet parte, &amp; qualibet ſyllabâ:</hi> yea, and were that the queſtion, Wee ſhould adde to this addition, and in ſtead of <hi>due regard,</hi> ſay, Wee have had, and have, and ever will have, a ſpeciall and ſingular <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,</hi> Whereto? <hi>To leave entire Soueraigne power?</hi> No, That were to intimate, as if we had firſt cropt it, and then left it: but Our <hi>regard</hi> was to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe it ſincerely, and to maintaine it conſtantly, even to the hazzard of Our goods and lives, if neede be.</p>
                  <p>To which purpoſe, your Lordſhips may bee pleaſed to remember what ſtrict oath every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Our Houſe hath taken, this very Seſſion, in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> (A. B.) <hi>doe utterly teſtifie and declare in my conſcience, that the Kings Highneſſe is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame</hi>

So that the onely queſtion betweene your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Vs, is, Whether this clauſe ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our Petition, and received into it as part thereof; which to do, your Lordſhips reaſons have not perſwaded Vs: Becauſe ſo to admit it, were to overthrow the fabricke and ſubſtance of Our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right, and to annihilate the right pretended by Vs and the Petition it ſelfe, in effect. For theſe words being added to Our Petition, viz. <hi>Wee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſent this Petition, &amp;c. with due regard to leave intire your Soveraigne power, &amp;c.</hi> doe inure manifeſtly an exception to Our Petition. And an exception being of the nature of the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it is an exception <hi>(Exceptio eſt de regulâ)</hi> muſt of neceſſity deſtroy the Rule or Petition, ſo far as to the caſe excepted; <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam in</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:3280:7"/>
                     <hi>caſibus non exceptis, in caſibus exceptis destruit regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam.</hi> Then this conſtruction followeth upon Our Petition thus enlarged, that after We haue petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>That no Freeman ſhould bee compelled by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, to lend or contribute money to his Maieſtie, without his aſſent in Parliament, nor receive againſt his will ſouldiers into his houſe, or undergoe a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of Martiall Law for life and member in time of peace:</hi> Wee ſhould adde, <hi>Except his Maieſtie be pleaſed to require Our monies, and impriſon Vs for not lending, and ſend Souldiers into Our houſes, and execute Vs by Martiall Law in time of peace, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Soveraigne power.</hi> Which conſtruction, as it followeth neceſſarily upon this enlargement; ſo it concludeth againſt Our right in the premiſes, and utterly fruſtrateth all Our Petition. Neither may it ſeeme ſtrange if this clauſe additionall, (which of it ſelfe in qualitie of a propoſition, We confeſſe to be moſt certaine and true) being added to Our Petition (which alſo is true) ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the very frame and fabrick of it, ſeeing the Logicians take knowledge of ſuch a fallacie, called by them <hi>fallacia à benè diviſis ad malè coniuncta. Horace</hi> the Poet giveth an inſtance to this purpoſe in a Painter, who when he had painted the head of a man according to art, would then joyne to it the necke of a horſe, and ſo marre both the one and the other; whereas each by it ſelfe might haue been a peece of right good workmanſhip.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond branch of my Lord Keepers Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall part, was inforced out of the laſt words of this
<pb facs="tcp:3280:7"/>
addition, by which his Lordſhip ſaid, that <hi>They did not leave entire all Soveraigne power, but that, wherewith his Maieſtie is truſted for the protection, ſafetie, and happineſſe of the people.</hi> As if his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would inferre, <hi>that Soueraigne power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, &amp;c.</hi> in this place to bee <hi>terminum diminuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> a terme of diminution or qualification, and in that conſideration might induce Vs to accept it. But under his Lordſhips correction We cannot ſo interpret it: For firſt We are aſſured, that there is no <hi>Soveraigne power</hi> wherewith his Maieſtie is truſted either by God or Man, but onely that, which is for the protection, ſafetie, &amp; happineſſe of his people. And therefore that limitation can make no impreſſion upon Vs; but We conceive it rather in this place to have the force <hi>termini adaugentis,</hi> to be a terme of important advantage againſt Our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, a terme of aſtriction, as that whenſoeuer his Maieſties <hi>Soveraigne power</hi> ſhould be exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Vs, in all or any the particulars mentioned in the Petition, Wee ſhould without further inquirie ſubmit thereunto, as aſſuming and taking it <hi>pro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſo,</hi> it induced to our ſafetie and happineſſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore (as this Petition is now conceived) it carrieth the forme and face of a picture, which repreſenteth to the life, the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and grievances of the people, with the eaſie remedies: (And therefore Wee hope that His Majeſtie, caſting vpon it a gracious eye, will compaſsionate His poore loyall Subjects, and affoord a comfortable anſwer:) I doe humbly
<pb facs="tcp:3280:8"/>
pray your Lordſhips not to marre nor blemhſi the grace and face of this picture, with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarie addition: And unneceſſarie I prove it to be, according to that rule, <hi>Expreſsio ejus quod tacite ineſt nihil operatur;</hi> And <hi>Soveraigne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> in caſes where it hath place, and ought to be uſed, is alwayes neceſſarily underſtood, and though not expreſſed, yet ſupplyed by reaſonable intendment in the opinion of all learned men. And therefore as it neyther is, nor can be by Us expreſſely excluded, ſo not neceſſarily by your Lordſhips to be expreſſely included; eſpecially in this Petition, where the addition therof would make ſuch a confuſion of the whole ſenſe and ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>The Kings <hi>Soveraigne Power and Prerogative</hi> is alwayes able to ſave it ſelfe: and if it were not, Wee muſt, without this additament, ſave it to Our uttermoſt powers, if We will ſave Our Oaths, and ſave Our Soules. The true ſtate of the cauſe thus ſtanding betweene your Lordſhips and Vs, the Houſe of Commons doth not a little marvell, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what grounds your Lordſhips are ſo earneſt, to urge upon them this addition to be inſerted into their Petition. They nothing doubt but that the ſame proceedeth out of a ſollicitude and feare which your Lordſhips have, leſt otherwiſe the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and abſolute paſſage of this Petition might be conſtrued hereafter in prejudice of his Majeſties <hi>Soveraigne Power.</hi> And this your Lordſhips ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude and feare proceedeth from your love (as the Poet ſaith)</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:3280:8"/>
                     <l>Res eſt ſoliciti plena timoris amor.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But I humbly pray your Lordſhips to examine with Vs the grounds of this your ſollicitude and feare: which grounds needs muſt bee laid eyther upon the words of the Petition, or the intention of the Petitioners.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the wordes there is no poſsibilitie to lay them; for therein is no mention of the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power.</hi> And were the words doubtfull, as thus, <hi>We pray the like things bee not done hereafter under pretext of your Majeſties Soveraigne power;</hi> yet in reſpect of the proteſtations preceding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant and ſubſequent to the Petition, ſuch doubtfull words ought reaſonably to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, only of ſuch <hi>Soveraigne power</hi> as was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to the caſes wherein it was exerciſed, not of ſuch <hi>Soveraigne power</hi> that ſhould be juſtly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But there are no ſuch doubtfull words, and therefore it followeth, that your Lordſhips feare and ſollicitude muſt be grounded upon the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Petitioners. Now your Lordſhips well know, and the Houſe of Commons is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that in a Seſſion of Parliament, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as many weekes as this hath done dayes, yet there is nothing <hi>prius &amp; poſterius,</hi> but all things are held and taken, as done at one time. If ſo, what a ſtrange collection were this, that at the ſame time the Houſe of Commons ſhould oblige themſelues by a fearfull adjuration, to aſſiſt &amp; defend all privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and prerogatives belonging to the King, and at the ſame time by a Petition (cautelouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3280:9"/>
indeavour or intend to diveſt and deprive the King of ſome prerogatives belonging to his Crowne. If therefore ſuch feare and ſollicitude of your Lordſhips can neither be grounded upon the words nor intention of the Petitioners, I humbly pray your Lordſhips to lay them aſide, and as We doe beleeve that the propoſition of this addition from your Lordſhips, was not onely excuſable, but commendable, as proceeding from your love; ſo now having heard Our reaſons, your Lordſhips would reſt ſatisfied, that Our refuſall to admit them into Our Petition, proceedeth from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the integrity and uprightneſſe of Our owne hearts, that We in all this Petition, have no ſuch end to abate or miniſh the Kings juſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. And ſo much in reply to that Rationall part, whereby my Lord Keeper laboured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the entertainment of this addition.</p>
                  <p>This being done, it pleaſed the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to inſtruct and furniſh mee with certaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I ſhould uſe to your Lordſhips, to procure your abſolute conjunction with Vs in preſenting this Petition; which albeit I cannot ſet forth according to their worth and the inſtructions given mee by the Houſe, yet I hope their owne weight will ſo preſſe downe into your Lordſhips conſciences and judgements, that without further ſcruple, you will cheerefully vouchſafe to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this Petition with your right noble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p>The firſt argument wherewith I was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:3280:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to move your Lordſhips, was drawne from the conſideration of the perſons which are Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, <hi>the Houſe of Commons;</hi> a Houſe whoſe <note place="margin">1. <hi>à perſonis petentium.</hi>
                     </note> temper, mildneſſe, and moderation, this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been ſuch, as We ſhould be unthankfull and injurious to Almighty God, if We ſhould not acknowledge his good hand upon Vs, upon Our tongues, upon Our hearts: procured (no doubt) by Our late ſolemne and publique humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and prayers. This moderation will the better appeare, if in the firſt place it may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in what paſſion and diſtemper many members of the Houſe arrived thither, what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, what pockets full of complaints and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable grievances, the moſt part brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thoſe every day renewed by letters and packets from all parts and quarters. You know the old Proverbe, <hi>ubi dolor, ibi digitus, ubi amor, ibi oculus:</hi> It is hard to keepe our fingers from often handling the parts ill affected; but yet Our mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration overcame Our paſſion, Our diſcretion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled Our affection. This moderation alſo will the better appeare, if in the ſecond place it be not forgotten, how Our Anceſtors and Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors carried themſelues in Parliaments upon higher provocations; leſſe could not ſerve their turnes, but new ſevere Commiſſions to heare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine offences againſt their liberties; publique Eccleſiaſticall curſes or excommunications againſt the authors or actors of ſuch violations, accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, condemnations, executions, baniſhments.
<pb facs="tcp:3280:10"/>
But what have Wee ſaid all this Parliament: We onely looke forward not backward, We deſire amendment hereafter, no mans puniſhment for ought done heretofore: nothing written by Vs in bloud, nay, no one word ſpoken againſt any mans perſon in diſpleaſure. The concluſion of Our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is, that Wee may bee better intreated in time to come. And doth not this moderate Petition deſerve your Lordſhips cheerefull conjunction <hi>ex congruo &amp; condigno?</hi> If a worme being trodden upon could ſpeak, a worme would ſay, Tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee no more I pray you. Higher We riſe not, lower We cannot deſcend. And thus much We thinke in modeſty may well be ſpoken in Our owne commendation; Thence to move your Lordſhips to vouchſafe Vs your noble company in this Petition, without ſurcharging it by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>Our next argument is drawne <hi>à Tempore,</hi> from <note place="margin">2. <hi>à circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris.</hi>
                     </note> the unſeaſonableneſſe of the time. The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>There is a time for all things under the ſunne, Tempus ſuum.</hi> And if in the wiſe mans judgement, a word ſpoken in its due time be as precious as gold and ſilver, then an unſeaſonable time detracts as much from the thing or word then done and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. We hold (under Your favours) that the time is not ſeaſonable now for this addition. It is true, that of it ſelfe Soveraigne power is a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſo ſacred, that to handle it otherwiſe than tenderly, is a kinde of ſacriledge; and to ſpeake of it otherwiſe than reverently, is a kinde of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie,
<pb facs="tcp:3280:10"/>
but every vulgar capacity is not ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: the moſt part of men, nay, almoſt all men judge and eſteeme all things not according to their owne intrinſicke vertue and quality, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their immediate effects and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the ſame things have upon them. Hence is it that Religion it ſelfe receiveth more or leſſe credit and approbation, as the teachers and profeſſors are worſe or better. Yea, if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſend a very wette harveſt or ſeede time, men are apt enough to cenſure divine power. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne power hath not now for the preſent the ancient amiable aſpect, in reſpect of ſome late ſad influences, but by Gods grace it will ſoone reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. To intermixe with this Petition any mention of Soveraigne power <hi>(rebus ſic ſtantibus)</hi> when angry men ſay, Soveraigne power hath been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the moſt moderate wiſh it had not beene ſo uſed, Wee hold not ſeaſonable under your Lordſhips correction.</p>
                  <p>Our next argument is drawne <hi>à Loco,</hi> We thinke the place where your Lordſhips would have this <note place="margin">3. <hi>à Loco.</hi>
                     </note> addition inſerted, viz. <hi>in the Petition,</hi> no conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or ſeaſonable place. Your Lordſhips will eaſily beleeve that this Petition will runne through many hands, every man will bee deſirous to ſee and to reade what their Knights and their Burgeſſes have done in Parliament upon their complaints, what they have brought home for their five Subſidies. If in peruſing this Petition they fall upon the mention of <hi>Soveraigne power,</hi> they preſently
<pb facs="tcp:3280:11"/>
fall to arguing, and reaſoning, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> what Soveraigne power is; what is the latitude, whence the originall, where the bounds, &amp;c. with many ſuch curious and captious queſtions; by which courſe Soveraigne power is little advanced or advantaged. For I have ever been of opinion, that it is then beſt with Soveraigne power, when it is had in tacite veneration, not when it is propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by publique <hi>harangues</hi> or examinations.</p>
                  <p>Our laſt argument is drawne from Our duety <note place="margin">4.</note> and loyalty to his Majeſty, in conſideration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of We are fearefull at this time to take this additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Our Petition, leſt Wee ſhould doe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty herein ſome diſ-ſervice. With your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, Wee make the great Councell of the King and Kingdome: and though your Lordſhips ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the happineſſe to be nearer his Maieſty, know other things better, yet certainly the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ſeverall parts for which Wee ſerve, their diſpoſitions and inclinations, their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, their fears and jealouſies are beſt knowne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Us. And here I pray your Lordſhips to give me leave to uſe the Figure called <hi>Reticentia,</hi> that is, to infinuate and intimate more than I meant to ſpeak. Our chiefe and principall end this Parliament, is to make up all rents or breaches between the King and his Subiects, to draw them and knit them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from that diſtance, whereof the world abroad takes too much notice, to worke a perfect union and reconciliation. How improper and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt at this time this addition would be in reſpect of
<pb facs="tcp:3280:11"/>
this end, Wee cannot but foreſee, and therefore ſhunne it; and doe reſolve, that it is neither agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the perſons of ſuch Counſellors whom Wee act, nor anſwerable to that love and duety which We owe to his Majeſty, to hazzard an end of ſuch unſpeakeable conſequence, upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance of this addition into Our Petition, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as We have ſhewed) the omiſſion at this time, can by no meanes harme the Kings Prerogative, the expreſſion may produce manifold inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. And therefore ſince the admittance of your Lordſhips addition into Our Petition, is incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and incompatible with the body of the ſame, ſince there is no neceſſary uſe of it for the ſaving of the Kings Prerogative, ſince the moderation of Our Petition deſerveth your Lordſhips cheerefull conjunction with Vs, ſince this addition is unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for the time, and inconvenient in reſpect of the place where your Lordſhips would have it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted: and laſtly, may prove a diſ-ſervice to his Majeſty:</p>
                  <p>I conclude with a moſt affectionate prayer to your Lordſhips, to joyne with <hi>the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> in preſenting this Petition unto his ſacred Majeſty, as it is, without this addition.</p>
