            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The ſame Act veſts the Patronage in the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and his Succeſſors, and <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> and his Heirs; and then appoints in what Order and Proportion each of the ſaid Patrons ſhall preſent; <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Firſt Rector after the Deceaſe of the ſaid Dr. <hi>Tenniſon,</hi> or other next Avoidance, ſhould be Preſented or Collated by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, and the next by the Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> and his Heirs; the Two next by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and his Succeſſors, and the next by the Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> and his Heirs; and the like Succeſſion of Two Turns and One Turn, for all times to come.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> was duly Elected Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>

            <p>This was Confirmed by the King and Queen, by Letters-Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> (as the Statute of 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. requires). Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid Biſhop Elect was Conſecrated; but by Virtue of the Diſpenſation, and according to the Rules of Law, the Living did not become Void at the time of the Conſecration, (as otherwiſe it would have done); nor did it become Void until the Firſt of <hi>July,</hi> 1692. at which time it void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Ceſſion: In which caſe the Crown hath an Undoubted Right to ſupply it by Preſentation for that Turn, to whomſoever the Patronage belongs.</p>
            <p>This Cauſe was ſeveral times argued at the Bar, and afterwards ſolemnly at the Bench, and Judgment given by the whole Court for Their Majeſties.</p>
            <p>The Matters which have been and probably may be again ſtirred againſt Their Majeſties Right in this Caſe, are theſe,
<list>
                  <item>I. Whether the Crown, upon the Promotion of the Incumbent of a Subject's Living to a Biſhoprick, hath a Right by Prerogative to Preſent to that Living for the next Turn?</item>
                  <item>II. If there be ſuch a Prerogative, yet, Whether the Diſpenſation and Confirmation in this Caſe do not amount to a ſerving of that Turn?</item>
                  <item>III. Whether this Act of Parliament hath made any Alteration in this Caſe, to differ it from the Crown's Preſenting upon ordinary Vacancies in other Livings, upon the Promotion of the Incumbents?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The two firſt of theſe Points being adjudged with the Crown in the Caſe of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> (which was enjoyed accordingly); and there being no difference as to theſe Points between St. <hi>Martins</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> the Third Point riſing upon the Act of Parliament was principally and indeed only intended to be conſidered in the Caſe of St. <hi>James</hi>'s; but ſome of the now Plaintiffs Councel ſtirring the Two firſt Points again, the Court of King's-Bench took them alſo into Conſideration, and gave Judgment upon all Three for Their Majeſties; which was done by the Uniform Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the whole Court with great Clearneſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to the Firſt Point,</p>
            <p>This Prerogative and Right of Preſenting by the Crown, upon the Promotion of the Incumbent of a Subject's Living to a Biſhoprick, is an Ancient Right ſettled and eſtabliſhed by divers ſolemn Judgments in the Reigns of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> I. and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and whenever queſtioned or doubted, always prevailed; and there is no one Judgment or Judicial Opinion in the Law-Books againſt it, but many for it. And if ſo full and particular an Exerciſe of that Prerogative doth not appear in the Old Books of the Law, as hath done in and from the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. downwards, it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be occaſioned by the Unlimited Power and Uſurpation which the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſumed to themſelves in this Kingdom, in making Biſhops, conferring Titles to Vacant Livings, and the like, not only againſt the Prerogative, but even againſt the Statutes of the Realm. And if any Inferences have at any time been drawn from any thing ſaid in any old Book in doubt of ſuch Prerogative, the ſame have been rectified by ſettled Judgments in Courts for many Ages paſt, in times when the Learning and Integrity of the Judges admitted of no diſpute.</p>
            <p>Nor is it any Objection againſt this Right of the Crown, that it hath not been put in Execution in ſome caſes anciently where the Crown had another Title, by reaſon of Wardſhip, or of the Temporalities of a Biſhoprick being in the King's hands; for beſides what is ſaid before as to the Pope's Claims and Uſurpations, the Crown, without prejudice to the Prerogative, might make uſe of that other Title not Claimed by the Pope, upon which to bring <hi>Quare Impedits</hi> (wherein one ſingle Title muſt be relyed on) rather than to make uſe of that which the Pope then Challenged and Uſurped, it being improper for the King to ſet up his own Prerogative againſt himſelf, when he had another Title in him by way of Intereſt.</p>
            <p>And it ſeems a ſtrange attempt after ſo many Ages, and ſuch ſetled Judicial Determinations, to queſtion that point of Prerogative, whereunto (till this Caſe) an entire ſubmiſſion hath been made, and many Eminent Clergy-men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have enjoyed, and ſome now do hold Livings under the Title of that Prerogative; and it appears by ſome Books of Preſentations to Livings, in and ſince the Reign of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> ſtill extant (the former being loſt or deſtroyed) that the Crown hath preſented ſeveral hundreds of times upon ſuch Promotions, and Enjoyment were had accordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As to the ſecond Point about the Diſpenſation; that can in no ſort be any Objection to the Right of the Crown; for this Diſpenſation being granted to the Incumbent to retain his Living, is not in Judgment of Law any <hi>Commenda,</hi> but coming before the Conſecration was lawful and effectual; and the now Plaintiffs by their Pleadings in the Cauſe, have owned and admitted it to be ſo; and then thereby the Avoidance was Suſpended, and no Vacancy happened by the Conſecration, nor till the Diſpenſation expired, which was the Firſt of <hi>July</hi> 1692. So that to affirm this Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Confirmation, did Serve or Execute the King's turn, is to ſay the King uſed his turn before he had it, or filled a Vacancy before it was, and that not by his own, but by the Act or Inſtrument of the Archbiſhop; the Confirmation (which is the King's Act) being barely a Formality required by the Statute <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. to the Diſpenſation of the Archbiſhop.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As to the Third Point upon the Act of Parliament, there have been Two things Objected by the now Plaintiffs Council.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That St. <hi>James</hi> is a new Rectory created by Act of Parliament, and that Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> came not into it by Preſentation, but Donation; and that the Prerogative Operates only upon Preſentative Livings.</item>
               <item>2. That by the expreſs words of the Act it is provided, That the Firſt Rector, after the Deceaſe of Dr. <hi>Tenniſon,</hi> or next Avoidance, ſhall be Preſented or Collated by the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>As to the Firſt; There is no doubt but that St. <hi>James</hi> is by the Act made a Preſentative Rectory, participating of the nature of other Preſentative Livings, and Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> was continued in his former Cure, though under another name: And there is no reaſon in Law to make it a Donative, or otherwiſe than of the nature of a Preſentative Living in Dr. <hi>Tenniſon,</hi> nor for a diſtinction between old and new Rectories; but the Right of the Prerogative being founded upon the Promotion of the Incumbent that holds equally both in old and new Rectories where ſuch Promotion happens to be, and when this new Rectory voided by Promotion, then, and not till then, the Crown's Prerogative to Preſent aroſe, as much as it would or could have done in the Caſe of an old Preſentative Living.</p>
            <p>As to the Second, there can be no reaſon to think the Act intended to take away the Prerogative of the Crown, which generally ſpeaking, is not bound, unleſs ſpecially named: But the end of this Act was to Erect a New Pariſh and Rectory, and to make them of the ſame nature with other Pariſhes and Rectories, and to ſettle the Rights of each as between the Patrons and Pariſhioners, but in no ſort to meddle with, much leſs to take away the Rights of the Crown; nor was there any need of a ſaving of the King's Right which aroſe by the Act by making the Rectory preſentative.</p>
            <p>And it is not of any weight to ſay the expreſs words are for the Biſhop's Preſenting; the Intent of the Act is ſatisfied by ſetling the Ordinary Courſe of Preſentations, without Excluding the Prerogative, and the Biſhop muſt take his Right ſubject to the Rules of Law, one part of which is the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; and it hath been reſolved that the Grantee of the next Preſentation muſt give way to the Prerogative, tho he loſe his Turn by it: And if this Act ſhould be taken Literally, then there would be no Right to preſent by Lapſe, nor Preſentation by the Crown, in caſe of any Forfeiture, or of the Temporalities, being in the King's hands, which would be abſurd to maintain; and ſuch a literal Conſtruction is againſt the Rules and Reaſon of Law, and many Judicial Determinations in the like Caſes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is prayed the Judgment may be affirmed.</p>
