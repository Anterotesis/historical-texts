         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>edestriat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses at home, and in neighbour Regions about; and being fallen in the rotten bosome of declyning age, the sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set on the winter day of mine elabourat time, and that time past three score years: yet now I say for diverse serious respects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this instant year, 1643. April 24. it was my resolution to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke at <hi>Preston</hi> Pannes with sundrie passengers bound for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> Where weighing Ankers, and hoysing saile, with roome winds and fair weather, we coasted along the <hi>Brittannian</hi> shoare. In all which deserted way betweene Forth and Gravesend wee found onely three ships, two <hi>Scots</hi>-men and a <hi>Noruegian,</hi> and one of the royall Whelps lying at Anker in <hi>AErmouth</hi> road, which made the sea resemble a wildernesse, and the devasted shoare the comfortlesse sight of a desolate land. Where never heretofore (winter excepted) these <hi>Tritonian</hi> bounds were seen (reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken) without 2000 saile, recoursing that sandie and shelfy marine</p>
            <p>But the estate and affaires of this world are ever ranging, ever changing, never constant; which made <hi>Solon</hi> tell <hi>Craesus</hi> that man should never reckon on the felicity of this life, because there might be a mutability of fortune ere death. The like may I now say of
<pb facs="tcp:36020:3"/>
deplorable <hi>Germanie,</hi> lately the mother soyle of <hi>Europe,</hi> yea, and the glorie of the whole Universe, that never in these dayes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie could <hi>Chaldea, Chelfania, Assyria,</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> the foure principall pastures for the first Creation, compare with that almost invincible Empyre for Princes, Potentates, Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Imperiall Cities, Gentrie, Merchants, and rich Bowres; no, no, for it was the superabounding fulnesse of men, money and might; and indeed nothing inferior (the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> reserved) to the first orientall Paradise. And yet when the fulnesse of their pride, luxurie, gluttonie, and libidinous lusts, were sprung on high, and crying for Heavens all-commanding judgements, how soon with the sword, plague, and famine, were they thrown down upon the desperat rocks of grievous desolation. And who can tell (it is now begun) how soon the like punishment may fall upon this Ile, the South part whereof being loaden with self love, vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the fatnesse of vices, ambitious pride, and a contemptible dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of all nations, themselves excepted. So that their backs and bellies, like unto <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> are become the loadstone of their flattering follies and pampering pleasures: That without some condigne correction they might easily (in a manner) forget the Creatour, and so the Creature: <hi>Spain</hi> in this chastisement may second <hi>Germany, France</hi> may resemble <hi>Spaine</hi>; and I fear ere long (which God evert) <hi>England</hi> shall be left the last mourner of all; bearing now (as it were) almost the very effigie of the distracted and combustible Kingdomes in this <hi>Europian</hi> tierce, upon the shoulders of her declining fortune.</p>
            <p>But now reverting to my purpose, the first news I heard at my disbarking, was the down-casting of the golden crosse in Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, to the which with speed I approached, where I saw divers imagious relicts tumbling down in the bottomlesse pit of oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: upon the sequell day, May, 4. it was razed to the ground, and the foundation thereof made levell with the street, which was not done by tumult, but by order of Parliament. And now I will neither commend nor condemne the fact, but this far I dare say, whilst it stood, it was a monumentall ornament worthie of a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb facs="tcp:36020:3"/>
Citie, and the beautifull object of admiration to all spectatours and strangers. But indeed some idolatrous Papists made it (in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by) the Sanctuarie of their superstition, making homage to it, and crossing their now crossed breasts, have left the golden crosse to fall down like <hi>Dagon</hi> at the feet of a happie begun reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So the third day thereafter, they caused take downe all the new and old crosses standing on Churches, and steeple tops; and notwithstanding whereof, I still carry six crosses on my arme, and the seventh crosse still followeth mee against my will, which the world may help, and I cannot prevent. Next upon Weddins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ensuing May 10. by order of Parliament, I saw at noone day two great heaps of books burned, both where the golden crosse formerly stood, and before the Royall Exchange: Which books had been compyled by the Popish prelaticall faction, for tollerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sabboth day, sportings, pastimes, prophane playes, and so consequently all sorts of labour, (as the Papists do at this day in the Popes own patrimoniall lands) prohibiting afternoone ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and commanding the erection of Altars and homages ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; which was done for the introduction of the Masse, and other infinite pendicles of Poperie.</p>
            <p>And now truely I never saw <hi>London</hi> these fourtie yeares past so populous as now it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only there is a general muttering that money is hard to come by, and that is, because all kinde of trades and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding begin to decay, and they who have money keep it close, for common imployments are lately metamorphosed in flying col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, toucking of Drummes, inveloping scarffs, and <hi>Pandedalian</hi> Feathers, wherein they have more pleasure than profite: And yet it best agrees with the peoples nature, who delight mainly in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick showes and frivole ostentations. Indeed for victuals they have abundance, and plenty of all things, and at an easie rate, and want for nothing as yet save onely peace.</p>
            <p>But it may truly be feared, that if these their generall combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions draw to a Winter leaguer, that both the City and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shall smart for it: And why? because both the great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and also the pettie armies in every County do so sack and
<pb facs="tcp:36020:4"/>
spoil the grounds of horses, bestiall, grasse, corne, and haye, a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> also pitifully plunder the people of moneys, victuals, and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick furniture, that the continuing of it in a short time shall ruine all.</p>
            <p>And now to begin with the Cities insides, before I come to its outsides, and fortifications, I found the River from <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, full of Merchant ships, and they lying two and two, and side to side, with a pretty distance from couple to couple, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as though they had been to make a sea fight: But indeed they ly at their guard and are well provided. The first lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their tongues offered me here was the dearth and scarcity of coals, &amp; notwithstanding of the daily relief they get from <hi>Scotland</hi> yet they are loath to part with money, and in a wringing way, and grudging at their infranchized lot, heavily bewaile the losse of their advantagious <hi>Tyne.</hi> I confesse their weekly taxes are great levyed to maintain the Parliaments armie, besides many other burthens that daily depend upon their purses: And for all this (besids the monthly contributions of the nine circumjacent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) the Armies pay fals daily short, and they can neither march nor fight for lack of moneyes, the want whereof being the main and chiefest cause of their slow proceedings. Which weekly collections, according to that multipotent place, and the Country about is truely supposed to amount (<hi>per annum</hi>) to three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of money. But how it is disposed, either by the hands of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or if reserved policy for future respects bee the maine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, I cease to discerne it, though many thousands daily gape for it. VVhich makes me call to minde, that when the last <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> lost <hi>Constantinople, Mahomet</hi> the second, the great Turke found such store of gold and silver amongst the inhabitants, that he sighing, said, O! if the Christians had been as bountifull for their own defensive safety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they had substance to do it, all the power of the <hi>Scythian Ottomans</hi> had never been able to have dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned their might. So peradventure the like (as God forbid) may be said of <hi>London</hi> if it should fall out so; then would these rotten Money-mongers lurking within her bowels bee left the miserable
<pb facs="tcp:36020:4"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd mourning spectators (as the Greeks were) upon their own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrized coyne. For the long delicacie of doting peace and pleasure so effeminates the world, that they beginne to spurne at trouble before distresse appear, which sensualitie begets, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull pride would contemne, and yet cannot prevent what the heavens determine.</p>
            <p>Now for a generall view, the Citie hath many courts du guard with new barrocaded posts, and they strongly girded with great chaines of yron; and all the opening passages at street ends for the fields and road wayes are in like manner made defensive, and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly watched: The sides of the river, as at Billinsgate, and other places have also Courts du guard, and they nightly guarded with companies of the Traind Bands: which number being of six old Regiments, and they six thousand men, are now doubled with six new Regiments, which maketh up twelve thousands in all. Beyond the River in the borrough of <hi>Southwark</hi> is the self same discipline observed, and all under the command of the Citie. So is <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> the <hi>Strand,</hi> and all the liberties thereof, now taken in under the custodie of <hi>London:</hi> and their Traind Bands there, I mean of <hi>Westminster</hi> are not be trusted with neither Parliament nor Citie; so that the quotidian guard of the Parliament come daily out of <hi>London:</hi> where they are placed in two courts of Guard, the one before the Hall in the Palace Court near to the water staires, the other Court du Guard standeth in the Parliament yard, where the Peers ascend and descend from the upper House. Both Houses of Peeres and Commons having double Centinels with Picke and Musquet at the entrie of their sitting places, remaine there ay as long as the Parliamentariat bodies remaine: The number of the upper-house amounteth to twenty six Noblemen, besides eight o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at sea and land service, the lower house by a just computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clark and given to me in Print, amount to two hundred and twelve Knights, and Commissioners, besides the deserted persons of both Houses, and some of them lately returned. And what shall I say, I found the Street-enravelld Court before White hall gate, guarded also with a Court du Guard, a noveltie
<pb facs="tcp:36020:5"/>
beyond novelties, and what was more rarer, I found the g<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap> growing deep in the royall Courts of the Kings House, which i<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>deed was a lamentable sight. And in that sight I rancountere<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> there abouts with <hi>George Withers</hi> my fellow Poet, and once my fellow-prisoner, where digesting some discourses (for he is now a Captain of a Horse Troupe) he told me that he had been plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at Michalmes last by some of the Kings forces in <hi>Surray,</hi> for there he hath a wife and residence, where being civilizd, his Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick mansion met with uncivill fellowes, I would say Malignants.</p>
            <p>And here I may not forget the false and lying aspersions laid upon <hi>Scotland</hi> lately by two English authors, the one work, named the <hi>plain English,</hi> where his perjuriat falshood averres, that <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               </gap> hold and enjoy our present peace and safety, of some of their Peeres in <hi>England</hi>; when contrariwise they hold their Parliament and present libertie of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and our invincible armie which procured it. The other worke intituled, <hi>The subjects liberty,</hi> will have <hi>Scotland</hi> at the first but a Dukedoome and in subjection to <hi>England</hi>; see how these damnable villaines can coine &amp; invent (an they please) such base absurdities, and yet go free unpunished And why? because they have from ancient and preteriat times, a generall and natural malignitie against our Nation, which neither can nor will be extermined till the day of doome; for it runneth in a successive line, as the Conduit from the fountaine ingorgeth the Pond. I would speak more freely here, and that justly, but that I do not love to be accounted for a Malignant, whilst there are too many already of that sycophantick kinde in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; and so I proceed in a fair way.</p>
            <p>The daily musters and showes of all sorts of <hi>Londoners</hi> here, were wondrous commendable in marching to the fields and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works; (as Merchants, Silk-men, Macers, Shopkeepers, &amp;c.) with great alacritie, carrying on their shoulders yron Mattocks, and wooden shovels, with roaring Drummes, flying collours, and gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded swords; most companies being also interlarded with Ladies, women, and girles: two and two carrying baskets for to advance the labour, where divers wrought till they fell sick of their pains.

All the trades and whole inhabitants (the I<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sey Courts excepted) within the City, Liberties, Suburbs, and circumjacent dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies went day about to all quarters for the erection of their Forts and Trenches: and this hath continued these foure months past, the half of which time I was a spectator to their laborious toyle, as after you shall hear. The greatest company which I observed to march out, according to their turnes were the Taylours, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying fourtie six collours, and seconded with eight thousand lusty men: The next in greatnesse of number, were the Watermen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to seven thousand Tuggers, carrying thirty seven col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: The Shoe-makers were five thousand and oddes carrying twenty nine collors; and indeed the gentle craft could never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore have mustered so many here since <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Crispianus,</hi> the two supposed Princes, their Patrones, forsook the Trade. Neither in this Catologue dare I forget the Porters that marched forth one day toward Tayburne fields, carrying twentie three collours, being three thousand white shirts: And (<hi>verbi gratia</hi>) upon that same day, a thousand Oyster wives advanced from Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linsgate through Cheapside to Crabtree field all alone, with drummes and flying collours, and in a civil manner, their goddess <hi>Bellona</hi> leading them in a martiall way. The next day following May 17, the Feltmakers, Fishmongers, and Coupers, marched three severall wayes to three sundrie fields, carrying twenty four collours, had their number amounted to three thousand and odds.</p>
            <p>And now to shun prolixitie, let the ingenious Reader judge, what number of numbers would these sequel Trades be, as Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths, Ferriers, Bakers, Bruers, Butchers, Cooks, Candlemakers, Smiths, Cutlers, Carpenters, Shipwrights, Joyners, Boxmakers, Wheelewrights, Turners, Carmers, and foure thousand Weavers, Braziers, Dyers, Imbrouderers, Horologiers, Watchmakers, Engravers, Tinkers, Haberdashers, Feathermakers, Clothiers, Tanners, Curriers, Glovers, Spurriers, Painters, Printers, Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Bookbinders, Gunmakers, Glaziers, Masons, Tecturers, Brickmakers, Plumbers, Vpholsters, Combemakers, Girdlers, Coblers, Chimney-sweepers, Jackfarmers, with many moe that I can
<pb facs="tcp:36020:6"/>
not recollect. Which indeed (as they are of a marvellous great number) so it was a delicat observation, to consider and remarke the indefatigable multitude and strength of the City, never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore practised nor exercised. The computation whereof may sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cirly amount to an hundred thousand able men, not reckoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny above fifty years of age, although the latter number would far exceed the former.</p>
            <p>And now closing this preceeding passage, behold the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Holy dayes in the City, and Countrey, are not as hitherto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished; Neither have they a seeming purpose to abandon them, because they are the baits of prophane pleasures, and vitious wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, which their gadding inclinations love rather to follow than forsake. Neither is their Service Book exterminated, but in an ambiguous way some Churches professing it, and other some disallowing it; I will not here expostulate between the mean and the manner, but surely there is a great wisedome visibly seene in the generall councell, that will not enforce a sudden alteration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People, till weightier matters be first settled, lest the one half should devoure the other, and the common estate of the Common-weal be miserably ramversed, for as the <hi>Italian</hi> saith, <hi>china Piano ua sano,</hi> so say we, that soft fire makes sweet malt: Even so the prudent proceeding of provident policie must with a multitude dallie, as the Fisherman doth with a hooked Salmond, lets him strugle in the streame a while, and then softly steales him to the land, where he is catchd and dispatchd. And now the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man would ever either hear or see novelties, and here a speciall one; the Tower of <hi>London</hi> from long antiquitie, wont ever to guard the City as the Eagle keeps her yong ones from the Griffon) but now the citie guards day and night the Tower, lest Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Wren</hi> should leap out through the iron windowes to swim on Thames, and that <hi>Euripus</hi> to swallow them down, which should be a great pitie, if the Popes indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could prevent it: And now I recall at my first coming here, it was agitate in Parliament, to send these two ghostly fathers to new <hi>England,</hi> that the great Ocean before their arrivall there,
<pb facs="tcp:36020:6"/>
might purget hem (like to purgatorie) of all the corruptions and perfidious knaveries they had done in <hi>England,</hi> with many others these twenty five yeares: This resolution was relented, which many a heart lamented: but it may be against the next spring, they will either make saile or hing. The Citie now hath fourteen horse Troupes, that scoute the high wayes, both day and night, and ride the round nightly twice about the foot squadrons, where so their Centinels are set at watch, and themselves to stand on guard, for this is the militarie way of <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now coming to my maine purpose, I wish the Reader hold but conceive, as my pen shal let him see, the fairest encompas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed city in all <hi>Europe,</hi> which my pedestriall march in twelve hours time painfully performed. And thus, three dayes before my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture thence, I approached to make the <hi>toure</hi> round about, and descending to the lower end of Wappine, there I beganne my circuit. Then here close by the houses and the River <hi>Thames,</hi> I found a seven angled Fort, erected of turffe, sand, watles, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then worke, (as all the rest are composed of the like) having aine Port holes, and as many cannons; and neare the top round about pallosaded with sharpe wooden stakes sixt in the bulwarkes right out, and a foot distant from another, which are defensive for sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain scalets, and single ditchd below, with a Court du guard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Advancing thence along the trench dyke (for all the Trenches are deep ditched about) vvhich runneth through Wappine Fields, to the further end of Whitechappell, a great vvay vvithout Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and on the road vvay to <hi>Essex,</hi> I savv a nine angled Fort, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pallosaded and single ditched, and planted vvith seven pieces of brazen Ordonance, and a Court du guard, composd of timber, and thatch'd vvith tyle stone, as all the rest are: VVhere tovvards Myle-end green I beheld there tvvo pertie Forts or Redoubts, each of them vvith three Ports and they Cannoned, stand vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an intrenched closure, having five courts du guard, that secure the passage vvay: From White chappell Fort Northvvestvvard, I trenched along the Trenches to Shoarditch Fort, standing main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quadrangled, single pallosaded, and single ditched, carrying
<pb facs="tcp:36020:7"/>
on three corners of the four, eight Demicanons and a royall court du guard within: And without which and at Kingsland (being the old post way for <hi>Scotland</hi>) there stands two earthen Rampires, with two Courts du guard. Thence returned; I followed along the champaine breastworkes to Hogston, where I found a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drat Fort, well pallosaded and planted with five Cannons at the two field corners: The strength is double ditched, and betweene the two it is strongly barrocaded, with wooden stakes, everie stake neare the top being fenced with three iron hookes of a span long. Thence I marched through Fineberry fields along the Trench (enclosing there Moorefields) and came to Mount-mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, Fort, (for all the Forts about are blank and blanke in sight of other) where being arryved I found it standing on the high way near to the Red Bull: This is a large and singular fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having a Fort above and within a Fort, the lowest consisting of five angles, two whereof towards the fields, are each of them thrice ported, having as many great Cannon, with a flanking piece from a hid corner: The upper Fort standing circular is furnished with eleven pieces of Cannon reall, which command all the rest, and upon the bosome top of all standeth a Windmill. The low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bulwarks, are first pallosaded round about, and near their tops, and then in the middle flank between the two ditches strongly bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocaded, beside two Countercarps, and three Redoubts of lesser importance, yet all defensive. This is one of the chief Forts about the city and first erected. Thence footing along the Trench dyke (which is three yards thick, and on the ditch side twice as high) I courted Islington, at the lower end whereof I found a strong and large strength, called Waterfield Fort, having within two utter workes a circularie Mount, stored with nine great pieces of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, and on the point of a Countercarp three pieces more: there I saw the longest Court du guard) being longer then two ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Churches) that I have seen as yet. A little further (about ten paire buts) I appoached to Islington hill, where there is erected a most rare &amp; admirable Fortification, called Strawes Fort, but now Fort Royall. It hath eight angles, and a spacious interlarding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb facs="tcp:36020:7"/>
between each of the cornerd bulwarks: This Fort is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous perspicuous and prospective both for City and countrey, commanding all the other inferiour fortifications, near and about that part of the enclining grounds. The Northeast cornerd Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark is double altified above the rest of the vvorke, carrying on the tvvo sides thereof six Cannon Royall; and the tvvo South and West corners are mutually charged on each of them, with two half Culverins of Brasse; and the East promontoriat corner ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with three whole Cannon. The altified bulvvark is tvvice pallosaded, and at the root of the vvork ansvverable to the top of the inmost ditch, it is strongly barrocaded; the middle place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen the two ditches is enravelled all about vvith lovv vvooden Stakes, and long pikes of throvvne pointed iron, and vvithout all vvhich vvorks there is a breastvvork cast up, and made defensive either for the first assault, or for the second invasion.</p>
            <p>Descending thence to Holburne fields <hi>I</hi> accoasted a strength, named, Pinder of Wakfields Fort, being onely quadrangled, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losaded, and single ditched, and enstalled vvith five great Ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and a Court du guard. Abandoning the place and shoaring along the Trench a little further to Longfield, <hi>I</hi> presently ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred vvith North Hampton Fort, consisting of tvvo divided quadrangled bulvvarks, and each of them garnished vvith foure Demiculverins of brasse; the interveening distance fortified, the tvvo former bodies are pallosaded, double ditched, and the middle division vvherof, barrocaded vvith stakes a yard high, and each of them hooked with three counterthwarting pikes of iron: Whence conducted along with the Trenches through S. <hi>Geilles</hi> fields, I arryved at Crabtree fort, in Crabtree fields, standing in a quadrangle, and loaden with six Culverines of brasse, placed on the two field corners, defying the Malignants or what assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants may there encroach: The fort is pallosaded above, double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditched below, and barrocaded in the middle division, with thick standing stakes and they conterbanded with thwarting iron pyks and a stately court duguard within:</p>
            <p>Leaving this and marching along the circulary line, it grieved
<pb facs="tcp:36020:8"/>
me to see so many rich grounds of grasse utterly spoyled with <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> erection of these works, insomuch that horse and cattell certay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels will come short of their food there for seven years and the owners thereof must fall pitty fully short of their yearly profits, for where trouble is, then cometh misery Having left the aforsaid fort, I saluted the banqueting house fortresse, composed of two forts upon <hi>Tayburne</hi> way and <hi>Maribone</hi> fields: Here I found both the forts answerable to other, the way only divyding them, and they both, pallosaded, double ditchd, and barrocaded with iron pyks; the one cled with eight demicanon, and the other fensed with foure semiculverines of iron; both wondrous defensible. A little advanced from this Tayburnian passage, I insulted upon Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants fort, composed mainly of foure angles, a court du guard five piece of ordonance and fortifyed in all things, just like to the former: departing thence, I shortly encroached upon Head Park-corner fort, which is a maine great strength, having one fort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and within another, and the third fort closing the road way standeth breasting the other two: The upmost inveloped fort, overtopping the other two; is garnishd with eight cannon reall and on the inferiour bulwark northward, being a second part of the forts maine body, there bee intrusted there five brazen half-cannons more; and before it towards the fields a breasting Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercarp: The third dependant fort standeth enstald with six demie culverines, amounting to ninteen of all: This great fortification, is but only pallosaded and single ditched, yet wonderfull strong and of great bounds: all the three having seventeen angles. And this this is the west most fortification enclosing the park, the fields, the large mansion, and other enlargements belonging to S. James his liberty. Thence drayning along a devalling Trench through Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field toward Tuttle fields, I rancontred with two half moon workes; some ten paire buttes distant, both of them pallosaded, barrocaded with irne picks, and each of them planted with three demie cannon of brasse: Both these works stand sighting Chelsay: Whence breasting along the breastworkes I happily imbraced Tutlefield fort, my familiar ground of old acquaintance. This
<pb facs="tcp:36020:8"/>
fortresse is composed of nyne angles being pallosaded, and only double ditched, and surcharged at the fouth and west corners with six pieces of ordonance and a court du guard. Here is an end of Midlesex labour: from which posternall place, I courted the river syde, and crossed over to Lambethin Surray: In the head of which town westward, and close by the river, I visited the nyne-elmes fort, composed of foure angles, five ports, and five demicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verines being slenderly pallosaded and single ditched, for this fort and Tuttle fort stand opposite to other, the river only divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Whence following my circulary progresse I enhaunced my desired view of Fauxhall fort, which indeed is a delicate large and defensive work being twice pallosaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> once ditched, and bearing the burthen of fourteen Culverines. And hence transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amaine with a greedy desire to surveigh S. Georges fields, I found half way hither a singular Countercarp, and fortified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides workmanship, with three half culverines; and then I arryved at the fort royall in Georges field: Which indeed of all the works I have as yet made mention of, this is the only rarest and fairest, and contryved and reared after the moderne modell of an impregnant Citadale: Having foure large bulwarks, every one counter banding another from flank to flank, and the foure inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veining quarters are also interlaced with spacious and defensible midworks: The maine bosome of which, with the incumbent insides of the foure Promontories, may easily containe three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men the foure corners being destinated for twenty foure can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non reall. The exteriour works are not as yet accomplished (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though fast advancing) but certainly they will bee perfyted after the Londonian forts as I have newly rehearsed; Neither are the trenches done which are drawn a long thence to the top of South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark called Nevington fort: The which is composed of two flanking Redoubts, divyding nine pieces of ordonance between them, having two courts du-guard, and backed with two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercarps, infringing the road way passenger, till a condigne tryall of what are you what carry you and from whence came you bee demanded; hence I continued my purpose to the top of Kentstreet
<pb facs="tcp:36020:9"/>
and found there only a circulary rampire of smal importance fensed with a single ditch between two ditches, and enstald with five piece of ordonance, and so is the other at the back of Redre<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> but more defensible then the other: yet they are both to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded with redoubts, &amp; countercarps, in the intrenched grounds. So here at Redreiff-fort, just opposite to Wapine fort, I finished the pilgrimagious toyle of a wearisome dayes journey, the circuit whereof on both sides the river amounteth to eighteen Kentish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myles. From which I may say, that London was never truly Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don till now, for now she sits like a noble lady upon a royall thron, securing all her encroaching pendicles under the wings of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly protection; yet these limites were never heretofore granted till the Parliament for their better safety, confirmed this constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that (Grand-<hi>Cayro</hi> excepted) I have not seen a larger inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped compasse within the whole universe. By which computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I apprehend that this circuit comprehends above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand dwelling houses, and in them large three millions of soules, that me thinkes he were a happy Prince, that could bee but only King of such a city, as London now sits intrenched though hee had no moe Provinces besides. And now the maine number of all these circulating fortresses (besides redoubtes, countercarps and halfmoon-workes along the trenches) amount to twenty foure forts in all; &amp; upon them planted and resetled two hundred and twelve pieces of Cannon, which indeed is a mighty and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menduous sight, where <hi>Vulcan</hi> and <hi>Bellona</hi> mean to make a bloody match if the esurious Assailants should come in a tragicall incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable way, to surpryse the virginitie of these new and now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most finished Fortifications. Which indeed have been verie chargeable to the City, and daily will bee more, for all the Port holes are soled and syded with timber, the Plat formes where the Cannons ly, are laid with strong oaken planks; all the Ordonance are mounted upon new wheeles, besides the pallosading and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocading of them without, with yron workes, and other engynes.</p>
            <p>And now sorest in the daily maintaining of Commanders and forces into them, with ammunition and all things necessarie both
<pb facs="tcp:36020:9"/>
for the Forts and Souldiers. But it is no matter, let Guilth'all pay for all, for there lyeth the Treasure and weekly collections of the Citie, which amounteth to twelve thousand pound sterling a week, besides the Countrey about: and moreover, the customes, the Royall rents, the Episcopall revenues, the plundring of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, and all lye there: where there are sitting a daily Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee appointed by the Parliament and City, who have the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of all, as they think sitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithstanding they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne their accounts to both the Houses.</p>
            <p>And now in discoursing of these Forts, I have beene somewhat prolixious, not usuall in my former styles, but done of purpose, that the Reader may conceive by Paper, which I have known by occular experience, and so I proceed.</p>
            <p>Now to observe in these following consequences my former condition, I will bee as indifferent as these relenting times may suffer me; and thus I begin: The chiefest conflicts and accidents, which actually fell out in my being here, were onely three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The first was the intaking of Redding by Generall <hi>Essex,</hi> and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsing skirmish fought at Cussan bridge, the royall Patriot of the Countrey being there in person: for surrendring of which towne, Colonell <hi>Fielding</hi> then governour thereof, was lately condemned by a Councell of war held at Oxford, to bee shot dead at a post.</p>
            <p>The second accidentall blow May 12. was that conflict in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, where sir <hi>Ralph Hapton</hi> prevailed against some of the Earle of Stamfords forces, he being for the time in <hi>Exceter,</hi> and had left five traind bands of that County, to second his intrenched Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gad, which when <hi>Hampton</hi> fell on, they fled, and left <hi>Stamfords</hi> forces to finde the sweet and smart of life and death from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie, some taken, and some dispatchd, and yet <hi>Stamford</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with that defeat the day following. <hi>Hapton</hi> was and is for his Majestie, and Lord <hi>Stamford</hi> for the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The third and most remarkable of all, was that prevalent victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, May 20. which the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> son obtained at Wakfield in Yorkshyre, against Colonell <hi>Gowring</hi> and his forces, being a
<pb facs="tcp:36020:10"/>
part of the Queenes armie led under Generall King, a conjunc<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with the L <hi>Newcastle,</hi> where <hi>Fairfax</hi> put to flight and rout the whole Brigad, taking Colonel <hi>Gowring</hi> prisoner with twenty five pryme officers, and fifteene hundred common Souldiers, so that none escaped save some fevv horse troupes, and a fevv of them slain: for the vvhich auspicuous happinesse, there vvas solemne thanks given to God through all the Churches in <hi>London</hi> May 28 being sunday, and this gratefull celebration was ordered by the Parliament to be done. Colonel <hi>Gowring,</hi> and a Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, with some serjant Majors and speciall Captaines, were sent to Sir <hi>Iohn Hottam</hi> governnour of <hi>Hull</hi> to be enterained there as captives, because they love powder so well, there is a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin standing there, where I leave them to smart, till they finde a better heart: But by your leave, <hi>Gowring</hi> was once taken afore by the Parliaments forces, and thereafter swore at his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment never to carry armes any more against them; but now what the councell of war will modifie I know not, let mercy or the martial law decyde it. Neither will I meddle here with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous battell fought at Edgehill or Keynton, where both the armies left other without either flight or following: nor will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that unhappy busines of Brandford (though in the end it proved happie for <hi>London</hi>) because they do carry a reflection to a greater eminency, than my pen dare to contend with.</p>
            <p>And indeed all the Counties of England (except the five con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federat Counties, and Kent that are (and many moe) for the great Councell) are in a combustion, some for the Papists, some for the Parliament, and all for the King: But understand me better, and be not misled, take not this generall uproare (as I may say) to bee between our gracious King and his loving Subjects; No, no, The quarrell dependeth only and absolutely betweene the Papists and Protestants; for either must the Gospel prevail with us, else their Idolatrie shall overtrample all; and therefore looke to it who may, for here is the main matter. And yet observe more, policie was wont to depend upon prudencie and providence, vertue being the sole foundation of both: but now it dependeth upon perjury
<pb facs="tcp:36020:10"/>
and falshood, perfidious dissimulation being the ground-worke of its deceitfulnesse; and a sophisticall habit, the sycophantick boldnesse of its brazen face: Great God amend it, else speedilie mend it, for this distracted Ile is over burdened with the filthie contagion of its forsworne falsities; and honesty and honour mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably misregarded.</p>
            <p>Neither may I forget that hard and unkindly usage that some of my country gallants have got there, being about an hundred and fifty of them; all officers and souldiers of fortune; And all and most of them being enroll'd, some have attended ten months, some longer, some lesser time, and yet can neither get imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pay, nor passe from the Parliament, to their great undoing and losse of time. But indeed at their first going to the field (not they) but some other speciall Commanders were held in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation, but as soone as the English begun to learn the militarie art of discipline from our Scots Cavaliers, they begun to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them, and wring them out piece and piece from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and charge. I will not herein particularize any more, (although duety commandeth me) least I be found refractary, to that quiet &amp; happy looked for association. But indeed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ambition, cannot away with our generous Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men any longer, than they have reacquisted their owne ends.</p>
            <p>And now some of their flattering Ruffians, begin to direct their souldiers with lectorall lessons, as doting Phormio, would have taught Hanniball to fight, &amp; forgetting the true discipline, would put all upon ignorant practise. So now I call to minde about Whitsontide last, there was such an exclamation against the Scots for a weeks time as was pittyfull to hear, tearming us (commonly and disdainfully) false Scots: with many other incompatible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations; And those their calumnies and despight arose from an imployment sent from Chester to York, the effect wee know, the event is not finished, but this I may say since that imploring mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive was published here in Print, the name of a Scot is growne so odious amongst <hi>Londoners,</hi> as the name of Satan is to the soule of a Sainct. Yet they are still longing and praying for our help. But

wishing and woulding (we say) makes poore housholding: Nay, their tongues challenge our assistance by way of obligation, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that we first begun it and therefore should help to end it; To whom I often answered, that this combustion came first from them, and now it is returned again in their own bosome. And <hi>Scotland</hi> hath done for them (said I) which they could not do for themselves which you all acknowledge and yet are ingratefull; And besides the great summes of moneys resting indebted by their publict faith to our Nation, for that friendly aide, yet our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome keeps now an army in Ireland to danton these bloudy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, set against your peace, and our profession; and as yet they have received no acknowledgement from your Parliament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; And said I cast away your ceremonies your holy daies, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious rites, your Romish letanie, your dregs of Popery, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding of our cavaliers, and then will <hi>Scotland</hi> prove a true Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to <hi>England</hi>; which if not, why should they go fight to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your Fopperies, Many such expostulations had I with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of them. The recitation whereof to avoide prolixitie I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posly omit. And notwithstanding whereof, yet the groaning and mourning people crave commisseration, for even now they are begun to collect a severall domestick contribution through Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and the now enclosed circumjacent parts thereof, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining of coale again winter, and thus, Every house accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the chaulders they spend lesse or more yearly shall present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advance as much money (to set forth a present navy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for recovering of <hi>Newcastle</hi>) viz. twenty shillings sterling for the chaulder, and are to receive the coales (when they get them) at the same rate, which will draw to a marveilous masse of money since the meanest house will spend three or foure chaulder a year. So is there amongst the adventurers here, for the relief of Jreland another colection presently in hand and for defraying the charges of the Scottish army there. And many like burthens have the people lying upon their necks, besides the hebdomadall and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall pay of Essex army. The continuance of which, will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly undo the poorer sort, and make the rich to grumble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36020:11"/>And I may not thrust in oblivion here, the great sea navy weekly maintained by the Parliament and people, round about the coasts of England and Jreland, though to small purpose, yet to an infinite deale of charges, which indeed the commons must bear, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament command, and the shoare loytering Lubbards consume. But now to returne to both armies at this instant June. 28. they are lying within foure myles of other, and near to Oxford, where selected troup partyes on both sides, now and then are snarling at other like unto <hi>Hircanian wolves,</hi> but seldome byte, unles it be with a flying farewell. The Parliaments army is 30 thousand strong, and daily grow stronger and stronger, both out of <hi>Kent,</hi> the city, and the confederat Countyes: The Kings army, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Papists and Malignants forces, are nowayes answerable to their adversaries number, neither for pay, nor power.</p>
            <p>But I must confesse, they are both grievous plunderers of the commons wheresoever they come. Although the Parliaments army be daily and orderly payed; which the other is not. And it is daily expected they shall shortly either fight or flee, or else do both; where after which wee hope the Papists shall seize upon the mountaines of Wales for their refuge: For if it draw, (as it is very likely) to a locall and lingring war, the whole Kingdome shall be utterly spoyled, and undone before the next approaching yeare. As for their captives on both sides they are many, and left misregarded, neither will they interchange quality for quality with other, and our countreymen Sir <hi>William Ballantine,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell Cocheran</hi> with divers others ly incarcerated in <hi>Windsore</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, under the Parliaments reverence; so are also <hi>Colonell Connesby,</hi> Sir <hi>Villiam Crofts</hi> englishmen and many other Cavaleirs enthralld at <hi>Bristoll</hi> under the same reverence and condition; besides Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burryes house in Lambeth now filld full of the like stuffe, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest doctor <hi>Lichton</hi> appointed for their keeper; Which country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ours, was pittifully disfigured and demayned by the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous tyrannicall despight of <hi>William Laud,</hi> who shortly is to undergo his tryals for his former treason, as the Parliament have newly declared. Observe here Gods providence, how <hi>Lichton,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:36020:12"/>
being but lately released from long imprisonment, is now put in <hi>Lauds</hi> house, and cruell <hi>Laud</hi> expuls'd from his princely mansion is now lying fast prisoner in the Towre; being both Physicians, <hi>Lauds</hi> charge should have been for the soul, but indeed <hi>Lichton</hi> is a honester Physitian for the body, and a better Christian which crowneth all.</p>
            <p>And to engrosse here further discourse, Colonell <hi>Bruce</hi> is newly committed to prison, by the Parliament, and his goods that were imbarked for Scotland, are disbarked again and retained for the Parliaments use, till further tryall be had of his negotiating in Jreland these certaine yeares past, with the meer and barbarous Jrish, and upon what authority he went there so often.</p>
            <p>About this time, June 23. Colonell <hi>Hurry</hi> made a start to Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, having just reason, considering diverse affronts he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and could not be righted neither by Committees nor Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall law, which here I forbear to particularize. But we expect ere long he shall deservingly repay all: And why? because there is nought can kill merit sooner than ingratitude, nor enforce a noble disposition to be longer indebted to a misregarding friend, than a just revenge commands expedition. And let me tell you that now presently the sea here and there is spotted with <hi>Dunkirker</hi> Frigots under the collour of Irish rogues, and <hi>Fammouth</hi> in <hi>Cornewall</hi> is become the mother Harlot of these bastard-begotten <hi>Brigants,</hi> being the chief place of their receptance and refuge. I will not touch here the condition nor manner how, because understanding may conceive it. And now the convention of some sound and learned Divines, is presently in hand, who were summond hither by Parliamentall power to sit and meet in Westminster Palace for reforming of Religion, and in abolishing the former fopperies thereof; and they are to continue there, during the indurance of Parliament; being to be assisted with some Nobles, and members of the House of Commons, for the better performance of their burdenable taske, where I leave them to a happie conclusion.</p>
            <p>Neither may I here obumbrate the memorie of this late designe, framed for the overthrow of Parliament and London: The disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
<pb facs="tcp:36020:12"/>
and deliverie whereof was wonderfull, and yet the purpose far more cruel if it had taken effect: I will not further insist here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, since the Oracle of the lower House hath twice already most largely manifested the same, both under print and power. But this much I may avouch, that if that unnatural attempt had prevailed, then &amp; there, had I doubtles suffered with the rest: For now as I live to <hi>Malaga</hi> a living Martyre, so then they had sacrifized me with <hi>London</hi> a dying Martyre. Yea, and the like designe, and that same time, was contrived against <hi>Bristol,</hi> whereupon there were two of the villaines hanged for their paines. There vvas a solemne thanksgiving to God through London, June 15 and the Countrey about for that happie day of their deliverance, and fourty six of their adversaries taken, and under tryall of the Martiall Law. And although every man wisheth and speaketh as he affects, yet have I indifferently (like to the passenger sayling betvveene <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis</hi>) carryed my selfe to neither hand, but in a just vvay keeping a right course, least I should have offended the truth, and so have slaine the honesty of my good intention. For although it is impossible to give all parties content, yet I had rather please many as to offend any. And novv to close, Almighty God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve aright, and sanctifie the royall heart of our dread Leige and governour: And novv good Lord, either in thy mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Papists, else in thy furie confound them, and turne their bloudy svvords back in their ovvn bosomes, that their devilish designes may never hence forth prevaile any more against thy Saints and choicelings; and send us and all true beleevers, the life and light of peace and truth. Amen.</p>
