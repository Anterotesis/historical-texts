            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I confeſs, men better able then my ſelfe might have ſpared my pains, but their ſlowneſſe and modeſty (being as I conceive unwilling to appear in Print about

ſo ſmall a matter) hath put me upon the Worke, which I count very uſefull, though with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of not being ſo well done, as they might have performed it. The Rules of all Arts ought to bee delivered in plaine and briefe language, and not with flowers of Eloquence; and ſo this Worke is more ſutable to my abilities.</p>
            <p>The Work as it is I muſt confeſſe is not all my owne, ſome part of it was collected out of other mens writings, which I hope will the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it: and if the brevity, plainneſſe, and uſefulneſſe thereof may beget acceptance with thee, it will encourage me to do thee more ſervice in other things of this nature.</p>

the expreſſing of the ſeverall ſounds, and leſſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome to the memory.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe names of the <hi>Notes</hi> there is uſed in the GAM-UT ſeven Letters of the Alphabet, which are ſet at the beginning of each Rule and Space, as G. A. B. C. D. E. F. and of theſe there are three <hi>Septenaries</hi> aſcending one above the other, G. being put firſt, which is according to the third Letter in the Greeke Alphabet called <hi>Gamma,</hi> and is made thus r, in token that the firſt derivation thereof was from the ancient Greeks.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeven Letters of the Alphabet are called the 7 <hi>Cliffs,</hi> or more properly <hi>Cleaves,</hi> the other names or ſylables adjoyned to them, the Notes: And by theſe three Septenaries are diſtinguiſhed the ſeverall tones or ſounds, which the Scale is divided into: Firſt the <hi>Baſſe,</hi> which is the loweſt part; the ſecond the <hi>Meane,</hi> or middle part; the third, the <hi>Treble,</hi> or higheſt part, ſo that according to theſe three <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaries, Gam-ut</hi> is the loweſt Note, and <hi>Ela</hi> the higheſt: And this the uſuall <hi>Gam-uts</hi> in Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> and others, do not exceed; but it is well known that there are many Notes in uſe, both above and below exceed that compaſs, both in Vocall and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall Muſick, and therefore ought not to bee omitted; for the Compaſs of Muſick ought not to be confin'd: for though there be but three <hi>Septena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in the <hi>Gam ut</hi> of the Alphabet, which expreſſe the ſeverall ſounds, yet if occaſion requires, you may aſcend one more higher, for it is but the ſame again,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60513:3"/>
onely eight Notes higher; or if occaſion require, you may deſcend lower then <hi>Gam-ut</hi> another <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenarie,</hi> they will be the ſame to thoſe above, onely eight Notes lower, and it is uſuall to diſtinguiſh them thus:</p>
               <p>Thoſe above <hi>Ela</hi> are called Notes in <hi>Alt,</hi> as <hi>F fa ut,</hi> and <hi>G ſol re ut,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Alt:</hi> And thoſe below <hi>Gam-ut</hi> are called <hi>double Notes,</hi> as <hi>Double F fa ut, E la mi,</hi> &amp;c. as being <hi>Eights,</hi> or <hi>Diapaſons</hi> to thoſe above <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> I have therefore in the <hi>Gam-ut</hi> of this Booke expreſſed them in their right places: The <hi>Gam-ut</hi> is drawne upon foureteene <hi>Rules,</hi> and their <hi>Spaces,</hi> which comprehend all Notes or ſounds uſuall in <hi>Muſicks</hi> either <hi>Vocall</hi> or <hi>Inſtrumentall,</hi> though when any of theſe parts which it is divided into, come to be prickt out by it ſelfe, five lines is onely uſuall, as being ſufficient to containe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of <hi>Notes</hi> thereto belonging, if there be a Note that extends higher, it is uſuall to adde a line in that place with a pen. But for Leſſons for the <hi>Organ, Virginalls,</hi> or <hi>Harp</hi> two ſtaves of ſix lines together are required, one for the left hand or lower Keyes, the other for the right or upper Keyes.</p>
               <p>Therefore he that means to underſtand what hee ſings or plays, muſt ſtudy to be perfect in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> and to have it perfectly in his memory without booke, both forwards and backe, and to diſtinguiſh <hi>Cliffs</hi> and <hi>Notes,</hi> in <hi>Rule</hi> and in <hi>Space</hi>; for by knowing their places, their names are eaſily known.</p>

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60513:4"/>This Scale or <hi>Gam-ut</hi> hath three Columns which ſhew the names of the Notes aſcending and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their ſeverall Keyes: the firſt Columne is called <hi>B Duralis</hi> or <hi>B</hi> ſharp, as having no flat in <hi>B mi</hi>: the ſecond is <hi>B</hi> proper, or <hi>B Naturalis</hi> which hath a <hi>B</hi> flat in <hi>B mi</hi> onely: the third is called <hi>B fa</hi> or <hi>B Moralis,</hi> having two <hi>B</hi> flats, the one in <hi>B mi</hi> the other in <hi>E la mi,</hi> and in theſe three obſerve that that what name the Note of any Cliffe hath, the ſame name properly hath his eight above or below him, be it either in Treble, Meane, or Baſſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Cliffs or Cleaves.</head>
               <p>IN the <hi>Gam-ut</hi> (as I ſaid before) is contained three <hi>Septenaries</hi> of Letters, which are, G.A.B.C.D.E.F. theſe 7 Letters are ſet at the beginning of each <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Space,</hi> and are called the ſeven <hi>Cleaves</hi>; of theſe ſeven, foure is onely uſuall: the firſt is the <hi>F fa ut Cleave,</hi> which is only proper to the Baſſe, or loweſt part, and is thus ſigned or marked 𝄢 The ſecond is the <hi>C ſol fa ut,</hi> which is proper to the middle, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parts, as Tenor, Counter-Tenor, or Meane, and he is thus ſigned or marked 𝄡 The third is the <hi>G ſol re ut</hi> Cleave, which is only proper to the Treble, or higheſt, and is ſigned or marked thus 𝄞</p>
               <p>Theſe three Cleaves are called the three ſigned Cleaves, becauſe they are alwayes ſet at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of every line of a Song, or Leſſon; for <hi>Cleave</hi> is derived from <hi>Clavis,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Key,</hi> for by this Key the places of all the Notes in the Song are known.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the <hi>B Cleaves,</hi> which is proper to all parts, as being of two natures or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, that is to ſay, <hi>Flat</hi> and <hi>Sharp,</hi> and doth onely ſerve for that purpoſe for the flatting and ſharping of Notes, and therefore he is called <hi>B fa, B mi:</hi> the <hi>B fa</hi> ſignifies <hi>Flat,</hi> the <hi>B mi Sharp,</hi> The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60513:6"/>
                  <hi>B fa</hi> or <hi>B flat,</hi> is known by this marke ♭ and the <hi>B mi,</hi> which is <hi>ſharp</hi> by this <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>.</p>
               <p>But theſe Rules obſerve of them both: Firſt the <hi>B fa</hi> or <hi>B flat</hi> doth alter both the name and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Notes before which he is placed, and they are called <hi>Fa,</hi> making them halfe a tone or found, lower then they were before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>B mi</hi> or <hi>B ſharp</hi> alters the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Notes before which he is placed, but not their names; for he is uſually placed either before <hi>fa</hi> or <hi>ſol,</hi> and they retaine their names ſtill, but their ſound is raiſed halfe a tone or ſound higher.</p>

               <p>OBſerve that the 2 B. Cleaves before mentioned are uſed in Song for the altering of the tone or tune of Notes. the B flat changeth <hi>mi</hi> into <hi>fa,</hi> making him a ſemitone or half a note lower: and the B ſharp raiſeth the Note before which he is ſet halfe a Tone higher, but alters not their names, ſo that from <hi>Mi</hi> to <hi>fa,</hi> and likewiſe from <hi>la</hi> to <hi>fa</hi> is but halfe a tone, between any two other Notes is a whole tone, as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60513:8"/>
from <hi>fa</hi> to <hi>ſol,</hi> from <hi>ſol</hi> to <hi>la,</hi> and from <hi>la</hi> to <hi>Mi</hi> are whole Tones, and this may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed if you trye it on the Frets of a <hi>Viol,</hi> you ſhal perceive plainly that there goes two frets to the ſtopping of a whole Note, and but one fret to a halfe Note; ſo that is obſerved that <hi>Mi</hi> and <hi>fa</hi> doe ſerve for the flatting or ſharping the other ordinary Notes in the Scale, and they being rightly underſtood, the other Notes are eaſily applied to them; for if <hi>G ſol re ut</hi> have a ſharp ſet before him, it is <hi>A la mi re</hi> flat, and <hi>B mi</hi> flat is <hi>A re</hi> ſharp, and <hi>C. fa ut</hi> ſharp is <hi>D ſol. re</hi> flat, &amp;c. as being of one and the ſame ſound. And it is obſerved that a <hi>Diapaſon</hi> or perfect eight contains five whole tones and two halfe tones, that is in all the ſeven naturall ſounds, or Notes beſides the ground, what flats or ſharps ſoere there be.

               <p>IT is to be obſerved, that Notes have two names, one for Tune, as <hi>Sol la mi fa</hi>; the other for Time, or prolongation of ſounds, as firſt the <hi>Large,</hi> 2. the <hi>Long,</hi> 3. the <hi>Briefe,</hi> 4. the <hi>Semibriefe,</hi> 5. the <hi>Minim,</hi> 6. the <hi>Crochet,</hi> 7. the <hi>Quaver,</hi> 8. the <hi>Semiquaver:</hi> and theſe eight Notes are thus diſtinguiſhed, the <hi>Large</hi> being the firſt and longeſt ſound, the reſt as they follow one another are halfe the proportion of the Note before him. The <hi>Semibriefe</hi> being the Maſter Note; for in Songs or Leſſons all Times are kept to his value, which is the hand up and downe: If it be a <hi>Long</hi> (which is a Note of Augmentation) 'tis foure <hi>Semibriefs,</hi> which is the hand foure times up and down: If Notes of Diminutions as <hi>Minims</hi> and <hi>Crochets,</hi> then ſuch a proportion of them as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount

to the value of one <hi>Semibrief</hi> is a Time, which is the hand up at one <hi>Minim</hi> and downe at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Theſe Notes have often times an augmentation or addition of a prick which followes them, which is for the continuing or prolonging of the ſound of that Note it follows, and the prick is halfe as much as the note which it follows: for example, if a prick be ſet after a Sembriefe, that prick addes a Minim more to him, and the Semibriefe which before but two Minims is now made to contain three Minims<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the like is to the other Notes.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Aeolick Mood</hi> was that which was of a more Ayery and ſoft pleaſing ſounds, as your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigals,</hi> or <hi>Fa la's</hi> of five and ſix parts, which were compoſed for Viols and Voyces by many of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Engliſh Authours, as Mr. <hi>Morley, Wilkes, Wilbey, Ward,</hi> and others, and had his derivation from <hi>Aeolia</hi> (a Kingdome of <hi>Aeolus)</hi> whence hee is faigned to ſend his ruſhing windes, the which do reſemble this Mood, that is ſo commixt with fancy and Ayery ſounds.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Phrygian Mood</hi> was a more warlike and couragious kinde of Muſick, expreſſing the Muſick of Trumpets and other Inſtruments uſed of old, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60513:11"/>
to Arms and activity, as <hi>Almans,</hi> and the like. This <hi>Mood</hi> had it derivation from <hi>Phrygia</hi> (a region bordering upon <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Caria</hi>) in which is <hi>Cios</hi> that martiall Mare Towne, and the moſt high hill <hi>Ida</hi> famous for the <hi>Trojan war:</hi> and many Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have written of its rare effects in warlike prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. (<hi>Suidas in litera T.)</hi> writes of <hi>Timotheus</hi> a skilfull Muſitian, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was much dejected in his minde, and loath to take up Armes, hee with his <hi>Phrygian</hi> Flute expreſſed ſuch excellent ſounds and varieties of Muſick that the Kings paſſions were immediatly ſtirred to war, and ran preſently and took up Arms But the ſtory of <hi>Ericus</hi> Muſitian, paſſes all, who had given forth that by his Muſick he could drive men into what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections he liſted, being required by <hi>Bonus</hi> King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> to put his skill in practice, hee with his <hi>Harp</hi> or <hi>Polycord Lyra</hi> expreſſed ſuch effectuall melody and harmony in the variety of changes in ſeverall <hi>Keyes,</hi> and in ſuch excellent <hi>Fugg's</hi> and ſprightly <hi>Ayres,</hi> that his Auditors began firſt to be moved with ſome ſtrange paſſions; but ending his excellent voluntary with ſome choice Fancy upon this <hi>Phrygian Mood,</hi> the Kings paſſions were altred and excited to that height, that he fell upon his moſt truſty friends which were neare him, and ſlew ſome of them with his fiſt for lacke of another weapon, which our Muſitian perceiving ended with the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Dorick</hi>: the King came to himſelfe and much lamented what he had done.

               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Ionick Mood</hi> was for more light and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Muſick, as pleaſant, amorous Songs, Coran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's, Sarabands and Jigs, uſed for honeſt mirth and delight in Feaſts and other merriments. This Mood had its derivation from the <hi>Ionian</hi> of <hi>Ionia,</hi> which lies between <hi>Aeolia</hi> and <hi>Caria</hi> a ſituation full of all pleaſure, whoſe plenty and idleneſs turned their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt mirth into laſciviouſneſs. By this Mood was the <hi>Pythagoreans Huntſup</hi> or morning Muſick, which wakened and rouſed their dull ſpirits to ſtudy and action.

               </head>
               <byline>By Dr. <hi>THOMAS CAMPION.</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>THere is nothing doth trouble, and diſgrace our Traditionall Muſitian more, than the ambiguity of the termes of Muſick, if hee cannot rightly diſtinguiſh them, for they make him uncapable of any rationall diſcourſe in the Art he profeſſeth: As if wee ſay a leſſer Third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a Tone, and a Semi-tone; here by a Tone is meant a perfect Sound, or (as they name it) a whole Note: But if we ask in what Tone is this or that Song made, then by Tone wee intend the Key
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60513:14"/>
which guides and ends the whole Song. Likewiſe the word <hi>Note</hi> is ſometime uſed properly, as when in reſpect of the forme of it, wee name it a round or ſquare Note: in regard of the place we ſay, a Note in Rule, or a Note in Space; ſo for the Time, wee call a Briefe, or Sembriefe a long Note, a Crochet, or Quaver a ſhort Note. Sometime the word <hi>Note</hi> is otherwiſe to be underſtood, as when it is <hi>ſignum pro ſignato,</hi> the ſigne for the thing ſignified: ſo we ſay a Sharp, or flat Note, meaning by the word Note, the ſound it ſignifies; alſo we term a Note high, or low, in reſpect of the ſound. The word <hi>Note</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply produced, hath yet another ſignification, as when we ſay this is a ſweet Note, or the Note I like, but not the words, we then meane by this word Note, the whole Tune, putting the part for the whole: But this word <hi>Note</hi> with addition, is yet far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be underſtood, as when we ſay a whole Note, or a halfe Note, we mean a perfect or imperfect Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which are not Notes, but the ſeverall diſtances between two Notes, the one being double as much as the other; and although this kinde of calling them a whole and a halfe Note, came in firſt by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet cuſtom hath now made that ſpeech paſſable.</p>
               <p>In like manner there can be no greater hinderance to him that deſires to become a Muſitian, than the want of the true underſtanding of the Scale, which proceeds from the errour of the common Teacher, who can doe nothing without the old <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> in which there is but one Cliffe, and one Note, and yet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60513:14"/>
in the ſame Cliffe he will ſing <hi>re</hi> and <hi>ſol.</hi> It is moſt true, that the firſt invention of the <hi>Gam ut</hi> was a good invention, but then the diſtance of Muſick was cancelled within the number of twenty Notes, ſo were the ſix Notes properly invented to help youth in vowelling, but the liberty of the latter age hath given Muſick more ſpace both above and below, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering thereby the former naming of the Notes: the curious obſerving whereof hath bred much unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary difficulty to the learner, for the Scale may bee more eaſily and plainly expreſt by foure Notes than by ſix, which is done by leaving out <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t</hi> and <hi>Re.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of all Muſicke, and the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scale, conſiſts in the obſervation of the halfe note, which is expreſſed either by <hi>Mi Fa,</hi> or <hi>La Fa,</hi> and they being known in their right places, the other Notes are eaſily applyed unto them.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this I will take the common Key which we call <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> both ſharp in <hi>Bemi</hi> and flat, as alſo flat in <hi>Elami,</hi> and ſhew how with eaſe they may be expreſſed by theſe foure Notes, which are <hi>Sol, La, Mi, Fa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall need no more then one eight for all, and that I have choſen to be in the Baſe, becauſe all the upper eights depend upon the loweſt eight, and are the ſame with it in nature; then thus firſt in the ſharp:</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60513:15"/>Firſt obſerve the places of the halfe Notes, which are marked with a halfe circle, and remember that if the loweſt be <hi>Mi fa,</hi> the upper halfe Note is <hi>La Fa,</hi> and contrariwiſe if the loweſt hafe Note be <hi>La Fa,</hi> the upper muſt be <hi>Mi Fa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will give great light to the underſtanding of the Scale, if you trie it on a Lute, or Viol, for there you ſhall plainly perceive that there go two frets to the raiſing of a whole Note, and but one to a halfe Note, as on the Lute in this manner the former eight may be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Heere you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern<gap reason="music">

               </p>
               <p>Now for the naming of the Notes, let this be a generall rule, above <hi>Fa</hi> ever to ſing <hi>Sol,</hi> and to ſing <hi>Sol</hi> ever under <hi>La.</hi>

               <p>For the tuning thereof I ſhall give you two Rules, the firſt is by the Notes, the ſecond by Letters. By Notes thus: firſt raiſe your <hi>Treble</hi> or firſt ſtring as high as you conceive it will hold without breaking, then tune your <hi>ſecond</hi> to be four Notes lower, and the <hi>third</hi> foure Notes lower then the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and the <hi>fourth</hi> three Notes lower then the <hi>third,</hi> and the <hi>fifth</hi> foure Notes lower then the <hi>fourth,</hi> and the <hi>ſixth</hi> foure Notes lower then the <hi>fifth,</hi> and ſometimes it is tuned five Notes lower then the <hi>fifth,</hi> as being an eight or <hi>Diapaſon</hi> to the fourth ſtring.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60513:17"/>The ſecond Rule for tuning is by eight Letters, which are A. B. C. D. E. F. G. H. and they are thus known, A is the ſtring open, the other ſeven Letters are aſſigned to the ſeven Frets on the Neck of the <hi>Violl,</hi> B. being the firſt Fret, C the ſecond, &amp;c. Firſt raiſe your <hi>Treble</hi> as high as it will beare, and then ſtop your <hi>ſecond</hi> ſtring in F. and tune it till it agree in ſound with the <hi>Treble,</hi> then ſtop your <hi>third</hi> in F. and make it agree in ſound with your <hi>ſecond,</hi> then ſtop your <hi>fourth</hi> in E. and make it agree in ſound with your <hi>third,</hi> then ſtop your <hi>fifth</hi> in F. and make it agree in ſound with your <hi>fourth,</hi> then ſtop your <hi>ſixth</hi> ſtring in F. and make it agree in ſound with your <hi>fifth:</hi> This being exactly done, your <hi>Violl</hi> will be perfectly in Tune. The next thing to be known is your Notes according to the <hi>Gamut</hi> on the 6 ſtrings of your <hi>Violl,</hi> for which followeth an eaſie Rule.</p>
