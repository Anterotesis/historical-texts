            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:95406:3"/>
in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. 'Tis a mercy yet greater, that two Nations formerly at so great a distance in the form of publike Worship and Churchgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should (to their mutuall comfort and happines, and to the further endearing of each to other) through the good hand of God be now agreed upon one Directory of Worship, and with a good progresse advanced, as in one Confession of Faith, so likewise in one forme of Church-government. For all which, as the other Reformed Churches, (in regard of their common interest in the Truth and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Christ) so especially your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> are your debters: Your name is as precious Oynment among them, and they doe esteeme you very highly in love for your workes sake. A worke, which as it is extraordinary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld, requiring a double portion of the Spirit of your Master, so You have very many Hearts and Prayers going along with you in it, that the pleasure of the Lord may prosper in your hand.</p>
            <p>As for my Reverend Colleagues and my selfe, it hath been a good part of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
<pb facs="tcp:95406:3"/>
that we have been partakers of, and Assistants in your grave and learned Debates. Yet (as we declared from our first comming amongst you,) we came not hither presuming to prescribe any thing unto You, but willing to receive as well as to offer light, and to debate matters freely and fairely from the Word of God, the common Rule both to you and us. As herein You were pleased to give testimony unto us in one of your Letters to the Generall Assembly of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so the great respects which in other things and at other times you have expressed, both towards that Church from which we are entrusted, and particularly towards our selves, doe call for a returne of all possible and publique testimonies of gratitude. For which purpose, I doe for my part take hold of this opportunity. I know that I owe much more unto You, then I have either ability to pay, or Elocution to set forth. Yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I cannot retaliate your Favours, nor render that which may be worthy of your selves; I beseech you to accept this part of my retribution of respects. I doe offer and entitle unto You this Enucleation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastian
<pb facs="tcp:95406:4"/>
Controversie, which is <hi>Dignus vindice nodus.</hi> I hope here is a word in season con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.

I submit what is mine unto your greater learning and better judgement, and shall ever continue</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have often and heartily wished that I might not be distracted by nor ingaged into polemick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, of which the World is too full already, and from which many more learned and idoneous have abstained; and I did accordingly resolve that in this Controversall age I should be slow to write, swift to read and learne. Yet there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine preponderating reasons which have made me willing to be drawn forth into the light upon this subject. For beside the desires and sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of diverse Christian friends, lovers of truth and peace, seriously calling upon me for an answer to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Prynne</hi> his <hi>Vindication</hi> of his foure Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions concerning Excommunication and Suspension,
<pb facs="tcp:95406:5"/>
the grand importance of the Erastian controversie, and the strong influence which it hath into the present juncture of asfaires, doth powerfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite me.</p>
            <p>Among the many Controversies which have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted and molested the Church of Christ, those concerning Ecclesiasticall Government and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline are not the least, but among the chiefe, and often mannaged with the greatest animosity and eagernesse of spirit, whence there have growne most dangerous divisions and breaches, such as this day there are, and for the future are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, unlesse there shall be (through Gods mercy) some further composing and healing of these Church-consuming distractions: which if we shall be so happy as once to obtaine, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely contribute very much toward the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of civill and State-shaking differences. And contrariwise, if no healing for the Church, no healing for the State. Let the <hi>Gallio's</hi> of this time (who care for no intrinsecall evill in the Church) promise to themselves what they will, surely he that shall have cause to write with <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus de Clemangis,</hi> a Booke of lamentation <hi>de corrupto Ecclesiae statu,</hi> will finde also cause to write with him <hi>de lapsu &amp; reparatione Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiae.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95406:5"/>
As the thing is of high concernment to these so much disturbed and divided Churches, so the elevation is yet higher by many dègrees; This controversie reacheth up to the Heavens, and the top of it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the clouds. It doth highly concerne Iesus Christ himselfe, in his glory, royall prerogative, and kingdome, which he hath and exerciseth as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Head of his Church. The Crowne of Iesus Christ, or any part, priviledge, or pendicle thereof must needs be a noble and excellent Subject. This truth that Iesus Christ is a King, and hath a Kingdome and government in his Church, distinct from the kingdomes of this World, and from the civill Government, hath this commendation and character above all other truths, that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe suffered to the death for it, and sealed it with his blood. For it may be observed from the story of his Passion, <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 23. 3. John 18. 33, 36 37.</note> this was the onely point of his accusation, which was confessed and avouched by himselfe, <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 23. 2. John 19. 12, 15.</note> was most aggravated, prosecuted, and driven home by the Iewes, <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 19. 12, 13</note> was prevalent with <hi>Pilate</hi> as the cause of condemning him to die, and<note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>d</hi> John 19. 19.</note> was mentioned also in the superscription upon his crosse. And although in reference to God, and in respect of satisfaction to the Divine justice for our sinnes, his death was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a price of redemption,
<pb facs="tcp:95406:6"/>
yet in reference to men who did persecute, accuse, and condemne him, his death was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs Testimony to seale such a truth. This Kingly Office of Iesus Christ (as well as his Propheticall) is administred and exercised, not onely inwardly and invisibly by the working of his Spirit in the soules of particular persons, but outwardly also and visibly in the Church, as a visible politicall ministeriall body, in which he hath appointed his own proper Officers, Ambassadours, Courts, Laws, Ordinances, Censures, and all these administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be in his own name, as the onely King and Head of the Church. This was the thing which <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> did, and many Princes, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, and States doe looke upon, with so much feare and jealousie, as another Government co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate with the civill. But what was darke upon the one side to them, hath been light upon the other side to those servants of Iesus Christ who have stood, contended, and sometime suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much for the Ordinance of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Discipline, which they looked upon as a part of Christs Kingdome.

Yet a failing there may be, and hath been both waies. The best things, whether in Church or State, have been actually abused, and may be so againe, through the error and corruption of men.

<pb facs="tcp:95406:11"/>
from which that assertion shall be gathered, yea also without concealing my explanations, qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or restrictions, if any such there be. Which rule to my best observation I have not transgressed, in reference to the Opposites. Secondly, that as I have not dealt with their <hi>Nauci,</hi> but with their <hi>Nucleus,</hi> I have not scratched at their shell, but taken out their kernell (such as it is) I have not declined them, but encountered, yea sought them out, where their strength was greatest, where their Arguments were hardest, and their exceptions most probable: so no man may decline or dissemble the strength of my Arguments, Inferences, Authorities, Answers and Replies, nor thinke it enough to lift up an Axe against the uttermost branches, when he ought to strike at the root. Thirdly, if there be any acrimony, let it be in a reall and rationall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, not in the manner of expression. In which also I aske no other measure to my selfe than I have given to others. Tis but in vaine for a man to help the bluntnesse of <hi>reason</hi> with the sharpnesse of <hi>passion:</hi> for thereby he loseth more than he gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with intelligent Readers: the simpler sort may peradventure esteem those <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>If any Replyer there be of the Erastian party, who will confine himselfe within these Rules and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as I doe not challenge him, so (if God spare me life and liberty) I will not refuse him.

            <p>I shall detaine thee (good Reader) no longer. The Lord guide thee and all his people in waies of truth and peace, holinesse and righteousnesse, and grant that this Controversie may (I trust it shall) have a happy end to the glory of God, to the embracing and exalting of Iesus Christ in his Kingly Office, to the ordering of his House according to His owne will, to the keeping pure of the Ordinances, to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Holinesse, and shaming of prophanesse, and finally to the peace, quiet, wel-being, comfort, and happinesse of the Churches of Christ.

That this legall Type did certainly signifie a seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of scandalous or morally uncleane persons from Church-Communion under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is proved from <hi>Esay</hi> 52. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16, 17. also from the exposition of <hi>Peters</hi> vision <hi>Acts</hi> 10.

That there may be a distinct Church government under Heathen Magistrates. That the abuse takes not away the just power. They allow of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that they have some jurisdiction. That the Ministery is <hi>Iure divino,</hi> and Magistracy distinct from it. We yeeld unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That none ought to be Rulers in the Church, but such against whom there is no just exception. That Presbyteriall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is not a <hi>Dominion</hi> but a <hi>Service.</hi> That it hath for its object onely the inward man. That Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall government is not an Arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cleared by sive considerations.

                  <p>THis acknowledged by Christian Emperours of old. <hi>Grotius</hi> for us in this particular. Christian Magistracy hath never yet punished all such offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as are Ecclesiastically censurable. Presbyteries in the primitive times did not exercise any power which did belong of right to the Magistrate. No warrant from the word, that the Ordinance of a distinct Church government, was onely for Churches under persecution: but contrariwise the Churches are charged to keep till the comming of Christ, the commandement then delivered. No just ground for the feare of the interfeering of the civill, and of the Ecclesiasticall power. The Churches liberties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, (not diminished) under Christian Magistrats. The Covenant against this exception of the Erasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The Christian Magistrate, if he should take upon him the whole burthen of the corrective part of Church-government, could not give an account to God of it. The Erastian principles doe involve the Magistrate into the Prelaticall guiltinesse.

<pb facs="tcp:95406:23"/>
This confirmed by six reasons.

That the story <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13. concerning <hi>Iudas</hi> and the sop, was neither acted in <hi>Bethany</hi> two daies before the Passeover, nor yet after the Institution of the Lords Supper. The first Argument to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> received not the Lords Supper from <hi>Ioh. 13. 30. he went out imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the sop.</hi> Mr <hi>Prynnes</hi> foure answers confuted.

M. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Arguments from Scripture to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:95406:26"/>
answered. That <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Sacrament, is no indubitable verity as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> cals it, but hath been much controverted both among Fathers, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Protestants. That the <hi>Lutherans</hi> who are much of M. <hi>Prynnes</hi> opinion in the point of <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving of the Lords Supper, that they may the better uphold their Doctrine of the wicked their eating of the true body of Christ, yet are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his opinion in the point of admitting scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons not Excommunicated to the Sacrament. M. <hi>Prynnes</hi> bold assertion that all the Ancients ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Hilary</hi> onely, doe unanimously accord that <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Lords Supper, without one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting voyce; disproved as most false, and confuted by the testimonies of <hi>Clemens, Dionysius Areopagita, Maximus, Pachymeres, Ammonius Alexandrinus, Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, Innocentius 3.

Every unconverted and unworthy person, if he come (while such) to the Lords Table) cannot but eate and drink unworthily, therefore ought not to come. 11. The wicked have no part in an Eucharisticall consolatory Ordinance. 12. Christ calleth none to this Feast but such as have spirituall gracious qualifications. 13.

From the necessity of the precedency of Baptisme before the Lords Supper. 16. From the method of the Parable of the lost sonne. 17.

His sixth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning conversion by the eye, by the booke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by Sacrifices, by Miracles, as well as by the eare, examined and confuted in the particulars. His seventh not proved. Nor yet his eighth, concerning conversion by afflictions without the word. His ninth concerning the rule of contraries is misapplied by him. His tenth concerning the ends of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yeeldeth the cause and mireth himselfe. His eleventh a grosse <hi>petitio principii.</hi> His twelfth appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the experience of Christians, rectified in the state, and repelled for the weight.

That the admitting of the scandalous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane to the Sacrament gives the lie to the word preached, and looseth those whom the word bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. That it is a strengthning of the hands of the wicked Tis a prophanation of Baptisme to baptise a Catechumene Jew, or a Pagan, being of a known prophane life, although he were able to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the true faith by word of mouth. That such as are found unable to examine themselves (whether through naturall or sinfull disability) or manifestly unwilling to it, ought not to be admitted to the Lords Supper. The reason for keeping backe children and fooles holds stronger for keeping back known prophane persons. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.

                  <hi>First, Casaubon exerc. 13. anno 31. num.</hi> 10. proves out of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> that the Sanhedrin was to be made up (if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) wholly of Priests and Levites; and that if so many Priests and Levites could not be found, as were fit to be of the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin, in that case some were assumed out of other Tribes. Howbeit I hold not this to be agreeable to the first institution of the Sanhedrin. But thus much is certaine, that Priests and Levites were members of the Jewish Sanhedrin, and had an authoritative decisive suffrage in making decrees, and infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting punishments, as well as other members of the Sanhedrin. <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew <hi>de vita Mosis</hi> pag. 530. saith that he who was found gathering sticks upon the Sabbath, was brought <hi>ad prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem &amp; sacerdotum consistorium,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. that is, <hi>to the Prince or chiefe Ruler</hi> (meaning <hi>Moses) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with whom the Priests did sit and judge in the Sanhedrin. Jehosaphat</hi> did set of the Levites, of the Priests, and of the chiefe of the Fathers of <hi>Israel,</hi> for the judgement of the Lord, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the people of <hi>Israel</hi> had Gods own Judiciall Law given by <hi>Moses,</hi> for their civill Law: and the Priests and Levites in stead of civill Lawyers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Sanhedrin did punish no man, unlesse admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been first given to him for his amendment. <hi>Maimon. de fundam. legis cap. 5. sect.</hi> 6. (yea saith <hi>Gul. Vorstius</hi> upon the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95406:34"/>
place, though a man had killed his parents, the Sanhedrin did not punish him unlesse he were first admonished) and when witnesses were examined, seven questions were propounded to them, one of which was, whether they had admonished the offender, as the <hi>Talmud</hi> it self tels us <hi>ad tit.</hi> Sanhedrin <hi>cap. 5. sect.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the Sanhedrin <hi>respondebat de Jure,</hi> did interpret the Law of God, and determine controversies, concerning the sence and intent thereof. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8, 9, 10, 11. and it was on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>Ierusalem Talmud</hi> in Sanhedrin <hi>cap. 10. sect.</hi> 2. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. <hi>There were there</hi> (in <hi>Ierusalem) three assemblies of Iudges: one sitting at the entry to the mountaine of the Sanctuary: another sitting at the doore of the Court: the third sitting in the Conelave made of cut stone. First, addresse was made to that which sate at the ascent of the mountaine of the Sanctuary: then the Elder</hi> (who came to represent the cause which was too hard for the Courts of the Cities) <hi>said on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>his manner. I have drawne this sence from the holy Scripture, my fellows have drawn that sence. I have taught thus, my f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>llows so and so. If they had learned what is to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that cause, they did communicate it unto them. If not, they went forward together to the Iudges sitting at the doore of the Court: by whom they were instructed, if they (after the laying forth of the difficulty) knew what resolution to give. Otherwise all of them jointly had recourse to the great Sanhedrin. For from it doth the Law go forth unto all Israel.</hi> It is added in <hi>Exc. Gemar. Sanhed. cap. 10. sect.</hi> 1. that the Sanhedrin did sit in that roome of cut stone (which was in the Temple) from the morning to the evening daily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. The Sanhedrin did judge cases of Idolatry, apostasie, false Prophets, &amp;c. <hi>Talm. Hieros. in Sanhed. cap. 1. sect.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Now all this being unquestionably true of the Jewish San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin: if we should suppose, that they had no supreme Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin but that which had the power of civill Magistracy, then I aske where is that Christian State, which was, or is, or ought to be moulded according to this patterne. Must Ministers have vote in Parliament? Must they be civill Lawyers? must all criminall and capitall Judgements be according to the Judiciall Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and none otherwise? Must there be no civill punishment, without previous admonition of the offender? Must Parliaments sit, as it were in the Temple of God, and interpret Scripture,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95406:35"/>
which sence is true, and which false, and determine controversies of faith and cases of conscience, and judge of all false doctrines? yet all this must be, if there be a paralell made with the Jewish Sanhedrin. I know some divines hold, that the Judiciall Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> so far as concerneth the punishments of sins against the morall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aw, Idolatry, blasphemy, Sabbath-breaking, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, theft, &amp;c. ought to be a rule to the Christian Magistrate. and for my part, I wish more respect were had to it, and that it were more consulted with. This by the way. I am here only shewing, what must follow, if the Jewish Government be taken for a pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sident, without making a dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inction of Civil &amp; Church government. Surely, the consequences will be such, as I am sure our opposites will never admit of, and some of which (namely concerning the civill places or power of Ministers, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Magistrates authority to interpret Scripture) ought not to be admitted.</p>
               <p>Certainly, if it should be granted that the Jewes had but one Sanhedrin, yet there was such an intermixture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>of Civill and Ecclesiasticall both persons and proceedings, that there must be a partition made of that power, which the Jewish Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin did exercise, which (taken whole and entire together) can neither sute to our Civill nor to our Ecclesiasticall Courts. Nay, while the Erastians appeale to the Jewish Sanhedrin (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it now to be but one) they doe thereby ingage themselves to grant unto Church officers a share at least (yea a great share) in Ecclesiasticall government: for so they had in the Supreme Sanhedrin of the Jewes.</p>
               <p>And further the Jewes had their <hi>Synagoga magna,</hi> which <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 17. distinguisheth from the Sanhedrin of 71. for both Prophets and others of place and power among the people <hi>praeter</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, besides the members of that Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin were members of that extraordinary assembly, which was called <hi>the great Synagogue,</hi> such as that Assembly <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. which did decree forfeiture and separation from the Congregation, to be the punishment of such as would not gather themselves unto <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> in which assembly were others beside those of the Sanhedrin. Of the men of the great Synagogue I read in <hi>Tze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach David</hi> pag. 56. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>dit. Hen. Vors.</hi> that they did receive the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95406:35"/>
traditions from the Prophets; and it is added <hi>Viri Synagogae magnae ordinarunt nobis preces nostras. The men of the great Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue did appoint unto us our prayers,</hi> meaning their Liturgies, which they fancy to have been so instituted. The Hebrews themselves controvert, whether all the men of the great Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue did live at one and the same time, or successively; but that which is most received among them, is, that these men did flourish all at one time, as is told us in the passage last cited, where also these are named as men of the great Synagogue, <hi>Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Zerubbabel, Mordechai, Ezra, Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua, Seria, Rehaliah, Misphar, Rechum, Nehemias. Rambam</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Chananiah, Mischael,</hi> and <hi>Azariah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, as Prophets, Pries<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and Scribes of the Law of God had an interest in the <hi>Synagoga magna</hi> after the Captivity, so we read of occasionall and extraordinary Ecclesiasticall Synods before the Captivity, as that assembly of the Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites under <hi>Hezekiah, 2 Chro.</hi> 29. 4. 15. and that erring Synod of the 400 Prophets, 1 <hi>Kings 22. 6. Herod</hi> also gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the chiefe Priests and Scribes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 4. I conclude, that if it should be granted there was no Ecclesiasticall Sanhedrin among the Jewes, distinct from the civill, yet as the necessity of a distinct Ecclesiasticall Government among us, is greater then it was among them (in respect of the foure considerations above mentioned) so likewise the Priests had a great deale more power and authority in the Jewish Church, (not onely by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionall Synods, but by their interest in <hi>Synagoga magna,</hi> and in the civill Sanhedrin it selfe) then the Erastians are willing that Church officers should have in the Christian Church.</p>

Have you appealed to the Jewish Church? thither shall you goe. Wherefore I shall endeavour to make these five things appeare: 1. That the Jewish Church was formally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the Jewish State. 2. That there was an Eccle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iasticall Sanhedrin and Government distinct from the Civill. 3. That there was an Ecclesiasticall Excommunication, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> from Civill pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments. 4. That in the Jewish Church there was also a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exomologesis or declaration of repentance, and thereupon a reception or admission againe of the offender to fellowship with the Church in the holy things. 5. That there was a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension of the prophane from the Temple and Passeover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the Jewish Church was formally di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tinct from the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish State. I say <hi>formally,</hi> because ordinarily they were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>materially,</hi> the same persons being members of both. But formally they were distinct, (as now the Church and State are distinct among us Christians.) 1. In respect of distinct lawes; the Ceremoniall Law was given to them in reference to their Church state, the Judiciall Law was given to them in reference to their Civill State. <hi>Is. Abrabanel de capite fidei cap.</hi> 13. putteth this difference between the Lawes given to <hi>Adam</hi> and to the sonnes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the divine Law given by <hi>Moses:</hi> that those Laws were given for conservation of humane society <hi>and are in the classis of Judiciall or civill Laws.</hi> But the divine Law given by <hi>Moses,</hi> doth direct the soule to its last perfection and end. I doe not approve the difference which he puts between these Lawes. This onely I note, that he distinguisheth Judiciall or Civill Laws for conservation of society, (though given by God) from those Laws which are given to perfect the soule, and to direct it to its last end, such as he conceives the whole morall and ceremoniall Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In respect of distinct acts: they did not worship God and offer Sacrifices in the Temple, nor call upon the name of Lord, nor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95406:36"/>
give thanks, nor receive the Sacraments as that State, but as that Church. They did not punish evill doers by mulcts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, banishment, burning, stoning, hanging, as that Church, but as that State. 3. In respect of controversi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s; some causes and controversies did concerne the Lords matters, some the Kings matters, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19. 11. To judge between blood and blood was one thing.

                  </gap>s and judgements; that is, to give the true sence of the Law of God when it was controverted, was another thing. 4. In respect of Officers: the Priests and L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vites were Church-officers. Magistrates and Judges not so, but were Ministers of the State. The Priests might not take the Sword out of the hand of the Magistrates. The Magistrates might not offer Sacrifice nor exercise the Priests office. 5. In respect of continuance, when the <hi>Romans</hi> tooke away the Jewish State and civill Government, yet the Jewish Church did remaine, and the <hi>Romans</hi> did permit them the liberty of their religion. And now though the Jewes have no Jewish State, yet they have Jewish Churches. Whence it is, that when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The constitution and Government of the Jewish State was not the same, but different, under <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> under the <hi>Iudges,</hi> under the Kings, and after the Captivity. But we cannot say, that the Church was new modelld as oft as the State was. 7. In respect of members. For as <note n="a" place="margin">De Iure natur. &amp; Gentium lib. 2. cap. 4.

Therefore <note n="g" place="margin">In Exod. 18. Quest. 2.</note> he concludeth that the story of <hi>Iethro Exod.</hi> 18. is an anticipation. Lastly, he saith, the seventy Elders mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. could not be Judges who did judge the people before <hi>Iethro</hi> came, because <hi>Iethro</hi> did observe the whole burthen of government did lie upon <hi>Moses</hi> alone, and there were no other Judges.</p>

Tis agreed upon both by Jewish and Christian Expositors, that this place holds forth a supreme civill Court of Judges, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the civill Sanhedrin is mainly grounded on this very Text. Now if this Text hold forth a superior civill Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (as is universally acknowledged) it holds forth also a superior Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction distinct from the Civill. For the Text carrieth the authority and sentence of the Priests as high, as the authority and sentence of the Judges, and that in a disjunctive way, as two powers, (not one) and each of them binding, respectively, and in its proper sphere. 2. The Hebrew Doctors tell us of three kinds of causes, which being found difficult were transmitted from the inferiour Courts to those at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> 1. capitall causes. 2. mulcts. 3. leprosie, and the judgement of clean or unclean. Now this third belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the cognizance and judgement of the Priests. Yea the Text it self holdeth forth two sorts of causes, and controversies, some forensicall between blood and blood: some ceremoniall <hi>between stroke and stroke;</hi> not onely <hi>Hierome,</hi> but the Chaldee, and Greek, readeth, <hi>between leprosie and leprosie.

Here are two Iudicatories distinguished by the disjunctive <hi>Or</hi> V. 12. which we have both in the Hebrew, Chaldee, Greek, and in our English Translation; so that vers. 9. <hi>and</hi> is put for <hi>or,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> noteth, expounding that verse by vers. 12. And as the Priests and Levites are put in the plurall V. 9. the like must be understood of the <hi>Iudge,</hi> whereby we must understand <hi>Iudges,</hi> and so the Chaldee readeth V. 9. even as (saith <hi>Ainsworth</hi>) many Captains are in the Hebrew called <hi>an head,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 42. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95406:39"/>
so you have there, references of difficult cases from inferior Courts, to the Priests or to the Judges at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> 4.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95406:40"/>
controversies brought before them by appeale or reference from inferiour Courts; and whose sentence is put in execution by Ecclesiasticall officers; There it must needs be granted that there was a supream Ecclesiasticall court, with power of Government. But such a Court we finde at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in <hi>Iehoshaphats</hi> time. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Proposition I suppose no man wil deny. For a Court so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, so qualified, and so authorised, is the very thing now in debate. And he that will grant us the thing which is in the assumption, shall have leave to call it by another name if he please. The assumption I prove by the parts. 1. Here are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites and Priests in this Court, as members thereof, with power of decisive suffrage, and with them such of the chiefe of the Fathers of <hi>Israel,</hi> as were joyned in the government of that Church; Whence the Reverend and learned Assembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and many Protestant Writers before them have drawn an argument for Ruling Elders. And this is one of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alledged by our Divines against <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> to prove that others beside those who are commonly (but corruptly) called the Clergy ought to have a decisive voyce in Synods.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

As for that distinction in the Text of <hi>the Lords matters</hi> and <hi>the Kings matters, Erastus</hi> page 274. saith that by the Lords matters is meant any cause expressed in the Law, which was to be judged. Whereby he takes away the distinction which the Text makes; for in his sence the Kings matters were the Lords matters. Which himselfe (it seems) perceiving, he immediately yeeldeth our interpretation, that by the Lords matters are meant things pertaining to the worship of God; and by the Kings matters, civill things. <hi>Si per illas libet res ad cultum Dei spectantes, per haec res civiles accipere, non pugnabo.

In this Court <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was examined and judged as a false Prophet, V. 8. 9. yet though they had judged him worthy to die, the Court of the Princes acquitteth him as a Prophet of the Lord, who had spoken to them in the name of the Lord, V. 10, 11, 16.

Wherefore from this place, these two things may appeare: 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Court of the Priests had not power of capitall punishments; for if they had, certainly <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> had been put to death, as <hi>Hierom</hi> noteth. 2. Yet they had a power to judge of a false Prophet, and judicially to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him to be a false Prophet, and such a one as ought to be punished so and so, according to the Law. That they had such a power, appeareth, 1. from V. 8, 9. where they doe not take him to lead him to the Court of the Princes, and there to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ccuse him; but they take him, so as to give forth their owne sentence against him, as against a false Prophet, <hi>Thou shalt surely die,</hi> say they, <hi>why hast thou prophesied in the name of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Why didst thou dare to pretend the name of God, as if God had sent thee to preach against the Temple and holy City? 2. <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>remiah</hi> doth not in all his differences alledge that the Priests and Scribes had not power to judge of a false Prophet, or to give sentence against one in such a case. Nor yet did the Princes object this, as hath been said; yet this had been as strong an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception as could have been made against the Priests, if they had assumed a power and authority of judgement, which was without their Sphere, and did not at all belong unto them.

But what was the ground of this consequence? surely the ground was, that which <hi>Bullinger</hi> and the late English Annotations doe observe, namely, the Popish error was also their error, the Church cannot erre. But let us yet follow the argument to the bottome. How came they to thinke the Church cannot erre? or what was that Church which they thought infallible?

But they mean collectively, and point at an assembly or councell of Priests, Wise-men, and Prophets, which (as they apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) could not erre, and whose determination they preferred to the word of the Lord by <hi>Ieremiah: for the Law</hi> (that is, saith <hi>Menochius,</hi> the interpretation of the Law) <hi>can not perish from the Priest, nor counsell from the wise.</hi> Now this was an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, not a civill Sanhedrin, which may appeare thus: First, they doe not make mention of <hi>the Judge</hi> mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.

And so endeavours to make it a temporall or civil Magistracy, (which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

But this is confuted by the reasons which I have given. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I further adde these few animadversions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The strongest proofe which <hi>Erastus</hi> brings out of <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus antiq. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. which (as he alledgeth) puts the thing out of all controversie, is a very weake and insufficient proof. <hi>Iosephus</hi> tels us in the close of that Chapter, that after the death of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>A chelaus,</hi> this was the Jewish Government, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But I may with a great deale more probability argue contrariwise from these words. <hi>Iosephus</hi> tels us the Constitution and forme of the Jewish policy or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was at that time Aristocraticall, but it was an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Aristocracy, the government was in the hands of the chiefe Priests. Or thus (if you will) the Jewes at that time had a bare name of an aristocracy; they had their <gap reason="foreign">

That very Chapter gives us a better argument to prove, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did not permit to the Jewes capitall Judgements: for <hi>Iosephus</hi> there records that <hi>Ananus</hi> the high Priest taking the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity after the death of <hi>Festus,</hi> while <hi>Albinus</hi> the Successour of <hi>Festus,</hi> was but yet on his journey toward <hi>Iudea,</hi> did call a Councell of Judges (<gap reason="foreign">

Which mightily displeased all such as did observe the Laws. <hi>Albinus</hi> at that time comming from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being enformed of the thing, and that it was not lawfull for <hi>Ananus</hi> to doe any such thing, without the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, wrote a chiding and threatning letter to <hi>Ananus.</hi> And further, the thing being secretly signified by some to King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who did also beseech the King to command <hi>Ananus</hi> to doe no such thing againe, he having trespassed in this. Whereupon <hi>Agrippa</hi> was so highly offended, that he tooke away from <hi>Ananus</hi> the high Priests place, and gaue it to <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Damneus.</hi>

But marke the words, <hi>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him and judge him according to your Law; The Jewes therefore said unto him, It is not lawfull for us to put any man to death.

Nay, as soone as the Jewes objected, <hi>If thou let this man goe, thou art not Caesars friend; for whosoever maketh himselfe a King, speaketh against Caesar. Pilate</hi> when he heard that, went in againe, and sate down on the Judgement seat <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 12. 13. Therefore when <hi>Pilate</hi> said to the Jewes <hi>take ye him, and judge him according to your law,</hi> he spake it of matters of their Law.

Pilate</hi> unwilling to meddle against Christ, waves the businesse in the Judgement-hall, I perceive (would he say) that this man is accused of such things as concerne your Law and your Religion; therefore take him and judge him according to your Law.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95406:50"/>
onely an impertinent reply, but a yeelding to <hi>Pilates</hi> intention; for he might have said, I doe not meane, that ye shall judge him for that which concerneth <hi>Caesar,</hi> but for that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth your owne Law and Religion. Therefore certainely the answer which the Jewes made to <hi>Pilate,</hi> did reply, that though they had power to judge a man in that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Law and Religion, yet they had no power to put any man to death, no not for that which concerned their Law.</item>
                  <item>4. There are severall passages in the story of <hi>Paul</hi> which shew us, that though the Jewish Sanhedrin might judge a man in matters of their Law, yet they were accusers, not Judges, in civill or capitall punishments, I meane when a man was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as worthy of bonds or of death, though it were for a matter of their Law, they had no liberty to judge, but onely to accuse. The Jewes drew <hi>Paul</hi> before the judgement seat of <hi>Gallio,</hi> even for a matter of their law. This fellow (say they to <hi>Gallio</hi>) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth men to worship God, contrary to the Law <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 13. If they had intended onely an Ecclesiasticall censure, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course had been either to the Sanhedrin, or at least to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, but because they intended a corporall temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which neither the Sanhedrin nor the Synagogue had power to inflict, therefore they must prosecute <hi>Paul</hi> before <hi>Gallio;</hi> whose answer was to this purpose, that if it had been a <hi>matter of wrong or wicked leudnesse,</hi> it had been proper for him to have judged it, but that since it was no such thing, he would not meddle in it, knowing also, that the Jewes had no power to doe it by themselves. Againe, <hi>Acts 23. 28, 29. Claudius Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> writeth to <hi>Faelix</hi> concerning <hi>Paul</hi> thus, <hi>and when I would have knowne the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their Councell. Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their Law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</hi> That which made <hi>Lysias</hi> interpose in the businesse, and rescue <hi>Paul</hi> from the hands of the Jewes, was the Jewes designe to put <hi>Paul</hi> to death, under colour of judging him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Law (which was the pretence made by <hi>Tertullus Acts</hi> 24. 6.) Now in that which was to be punished, either by death, or so much as by bonds, <hi>Lysias</hi> conceives the Jewes to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95406:50"/>
no competent Judges, therefore he brings <hi>Paul</hi> into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Jewes, not to be judged by them, but to know what accusation they had against him. For the same reason <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe did decline going to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to be judged there, no not of matters concerning the Religion and Law of the Jewes, that accusation being so far driven on, as to make him worthy of death. His accusers (saith <hi>Festus</hi> to King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa) brought none accusation of such things as I supposed, but had certaine questions against him of their owne superstition, and of one Iesus which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. And because I doubted of such manner of questions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I asked him whether he would goe to Ierusalem, and there be judged of these matters, Acts</hi> 25. 18, 19, 20. This <hi>Paul</hi> had declined vers. 10. <hi>I stand at Caesars judgement seat</hi> (said he) <hi>where I ought to be judged.</hi> And why? but because his accusation was capitall, even in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Law of the Jewes, and he knew the Jewes at that time had no power of capitall judgements. Some have alledged this example of <hi>Paul</hi> for appeales from Presbyteries or Synods to the civill Magistrate: by which argument themselves grant that the Jewish Sanhedrin then declined by <hi>Paul,</hi> was a Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, not a civill Court.</item>

Now this power being taken from the Jewes forty yeeres before the destruction of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and City, which was in the 71 yeere of Christ, his death being in the 34.

               <p>I have thus largely prosecuted my last argument, drawn from the New Testament, mentioning the Councell of the Priests, Elders, and Scribes.</p>
               <p>And I trust the twelve arguments which have been brought may give good satisfaction toward the proofe of an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Jewish Sanhedrin.</p>
               <p>The chiefe objection which ever I heard or read against this distinction of a Civill Sanhedrin and an Ecclesiasticall Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin among the Jewes, is this. That neither the Talmud nor the Talmudicall writers mention any such distinction, but speake onely of one supreme Sanhedrin of 71, and of other two Courts, which sate the one at the doore of the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Temple, the other at the gate which entereth to the mountaine of the Temple. There were also Courts in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties where capitall cases were judged by three and twenty, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall mults by three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It must be remembred that not onely the Talmudicall Commentators, but the Talmud it selfe, is much later than the time of the Sanhedrin, and the integrity of the Jewish go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Yea later (by some Centuries) than the destruction of the Temple and City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> So that the Objection which is made is no stronger than as if one should argue thus, There is no mention of Elderships constituted of Pastors and Ruling Elders (without any Bishop having preeminence over the rest) neither in the Canon Law, nor decretals of Popes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95406:52"/>
nor in the Booke of the Canons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there was no such Eldership in that Church, constituted as hath been said. But if the Ecclesiasticall Government either of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the Church of the Jewes can be proved from Scripture (as both may) it ought to be no prejudice against those truths, that they are not fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and declining ages. Howbeit there may be seen some footsteps of a Civill and Ecclesiasticall Sanhedrin, even in the Talmudicall writers, in the opinion of <hi>Constantinus L'Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reur,</hi> and in that other passage cited by D. <hi>Buxtorf</hi> out of <hi>Elias.</hi> Of which before. And so much concerning an Ecclesiasticall Sanhedrin among the Jewes.</p>
               <p>If after all this, any man shall be unsatisfied in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, yet in the issue, such as are not convinced that there was an Ecclesiasticall Sanhedrin among the Jewes, distinct from their civill Sanhedrin, may neverthelesse be convinced not by the former arguments, but by other <hi>Mediums,</hi> that there was an Ecclesiasticall government among the Jewes distinct from their civill government. For it belonged to the Priests, (not to the Magistrates or Judges) to <hi>put difference between holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, and between unclean and cleane.</hi> And the Priests (not the Magistrates) are challenged for not putting difference between the holy and prophane <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22. 26. And this power of the Priests was not meerly doctrinall or declarative, but decisive, binding, and juridicall, so farre as that according to their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence men were to be admitted as cleane, or excluded as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. Yea in other cases, as namely in trying and judging the scandall of a secret and unknown murther, observe what is said of the Priests, <hi>Deut. 21. 5. by their word shall every contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie and every stroke be tried.</hi> Yea themselves were Judges of controversies <hi>Ezech. 44. 24. And in controversie they shall stand in judgement, and they shall judge it according to my judgements.</hi> Where the Ministers of the Gospell are principally intended, but not without an allusion unto and parallel with the Priests of the old Testament, in this point of jurisdiction. Suppose now it were appointed by Law, that Ministers shall separate or put difference between the holy and prophane, that by their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95406:52"/>
word every controversie concerning the causes of suspension or sequestration of men from the Sacrament, shall be tried; that in controversie they shall stand in judgement, and judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God: Would not every one looke upon this, as a power of government put into the hands of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. And none readier to aggravate such government, then the Erastians. Yet all this amounts to no more, then by the plaine and undeniable Scriptures above cited, was committed to the Priests. Suppose also, that men were kept backe from the Temple and from the Passeover, not for any morall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but for ceremoniall uncleannesse onely (which is to be afterwards discussed) yet the Priests their judging and deciding of controversies concerning mens legall uncleannesse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which judgement and decision, men were to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, or kept backe from the Temple and Passover (yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time their owne houses, as in the case of leprosie) could not choose but entitle them to a power of government, which power was peculiar to them, and is not in all the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ascribed to Magistrates or Judges. And as the exercise of this power did not agree to the Magistrate, so the commission, charge, and power given to those who did keepe backe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, was not derived from the Magistrate; for it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the intrinsecall sacerdotall authority 2 <hi>Kings 11. 18.

               <p>
                  <hi>Grotius. annot. in Luke</hi> 6. 22. compares the Jewish excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with that which was exercised by the <hi>Druides</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who did <hi>interdicere saerificiis,</hi> interdict and prohibit from their Sacrifices impious and obstinate persons. Yea those who were excommunicate by <hi>Niddui</hi> or the lesser excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he likens to those penitents or mourners in the ancient Christian Church, who were said to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>qui non cum caeteris orabant</hi> &amp;c. He tels us the ancient Christians did in divers things follow the Jewish discipline, and among other things in excommunication; He cites the same passage of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> which is cited by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Selden,</hi> concerning a shntting out, à <hi>communicatione orationis, &amp; conventus, &amp; omnis sancti commercii.</hi> Which is as full and high a description of the Ecclesiasticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Excommunication, as any can be. So that the Jewish Excommunication being paralleld with that Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which <hi>Tertullian</hi> speakes of, and which was practised in the ancient Christian Church, what more can be required in this particular? And here I cannot but take notice, that Master <hi>Prynne</hi> doth very much mistake and misrepresent M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Selden,</hi> as if he held the Jewish excommunication to have been no more but a shutting out from civill company or fellowship, whereas
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95406:54"/>
he clearly holds <hi>lib. 4. de jure nat. &amp; Gent. cap.</hi> 9. p. 522. that he who was excommunicated by the Jewish <hi>cherem,</hi> was put away and cast off from fellowship in prayer, and from all religious fellowship, even as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks of excommunicated persons in the Church.</p>

                  <hi>Lud.

I confesse he understands the <hi>Cherem,</hi> and the <hi>Shammata,</hi> otherwise then I doe; for he takes the <hi>Cherem</hi> to be <hi>nihil aliud,</hi> nothing else than the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a mans substance for the use of the Sanctuary: (whereas it is certaine there was a <hi>Cherem</hi> of persons as well as of things, and the <hi>formulae</hi> of the <hi>Cherem</hi> which shall be cited afterward, containe another thing than forfeiture.) And <hi>Shammata</hi> he takes to be the devoting of men to death, and that being Shamatized they must needs die. (And yet the Jewes did <hi>shamatize</hi> the <hi>Cuthites</hi> or <hi>Samaritans</hi> (as we shall see afterward) whom they had not power to put to death.) However he speaks of the <hi>Nid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dui</hi> as a meere Ecclesiasticall censure, and therefore tels us it was formidable to the godly, it being a shutting out from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the holy things, but not formidable to wicked men; which must be upon this reason, because wicked men did care little or nothing for any censure or punishment, except what was civill. He granteth also that <hi>Niddui</hi> was included in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two: so that in all three there was a shutting out from the holy things.</p>
               <p>I must not forget the Testimony of my Countreyman Master <hi>Weemse</hi> in his <hi>Christian Synagogue lib. 1. cap. 6. sect. 3. paragr. 7. They had three sorts of Excommunication; first the lesser, then the middle sort, then the greatest. The lesser was called Niddui: and in the New Testament they were called</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>put out of the Synagogue: and they hold that</hi> Cain <hi>was excommunicated this way. The second was called Cherem or Anathema: with this sort of Excommunication was the Incestuous person censured</hi> 2 Cor. 2. <hi>The third Shammatha, they hold that</hi> Enoch <hi>instituted it,</hi> Jude v. 14. And after, <hi>these who were</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>from the Temple, but suffered to stand in the Gate, &amp;c. These who were Excommunicated by the second sort of Excommunication, were not permitted to come neer the Temple. These who were Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated after the third sort, were secluded out of the society of the people of God altogether.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have produced fifteen witnesses for the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Excommunication of the Jewes. I might produce many more, but I have made choice of these, because all of them have taken more than ordinary paines in searching the Jewish an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, and divers of them are of greatest note for their skill therein.</p>
               <p>In the next place let us observe the causes, degrees, manner and rites how, the authority by which, the ends and effects of excommunication among the Jewes, and see whether all these doe not helpe to make their Excommunication a patterne for ours. For the causes, there were 24 causes, for which a man was Excommunicated among the Jewes. You may read them in <hi>Buxtorfs Lexicon Chald<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Talmud &amp; Rabbin.</hi> p. 1304, 1305. <hi>M. Selden de jure nat. &amp; Gentium. lib. 4. cap. 8. Jo. Coch Annot. in Excerp. Gem. Sanhedrin cap.</hi> 2. pag. 147. divers of these causes did not at all concerne personall or civill injuries (for such injuries were not accounted causes of Excommunication, but were to be punished otherwise, as shall be proved afterward) but matters of scandall, by which God was dishonoured, and the stumbling-blocke of an evill example laid before others; One cause was the despising of any of the preceps of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or Statutes of the Scribes. Another was the selling of Land to a Gentile. Another was, a Priest not separating the gifts of the oblation. Another, he that in captivity doth not iterate or observe the second time a holy day.

                  <hi>Buxtorf</hi>) or offereth a sickly beast, (as <hi>I. Coch.</hi>) Another, a Sacrificer that doth not shew his Sacrificing Knife before a Wise man or a Rabbi, that it may be knowne to be a lawfull Knife, and not faulty. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he that cannot be made to know or to learne. Another, he that having put away his wife, doth thereafter converse fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with her. Another, a Wise man (that is, a Rabbi or Doctor) infamous for an evill life. The other causes had also matter of scandall in them, namely, the despising of a Wise man or Rabbi, though it were after his death. The despising of an Officer or messenger of the house of judgement. He that casteth up to his neighbour a servile condition, or cals his neighbour servant. He that contumaciously refuseth to appeare at the day appointed by the Judge. He that doth not submit himselfe to the Judiciall sentence. He that hath in his house any hurtfull thing, as a mad dogge or a weake leather. He that before Heathen Judges beareth witnesse against an Israelite. He that maketh the blind to fall. He that hath Excommunicate another without cause, when he ought not to have been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. Thus you have the 24 causes of the Jewish Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; of which some were meere scandals: others of a mixed nature, that is, partly injuries, partly scandals; but they were reckoned among the causes of Excommunication <hi>qua</hi> scandals, not <hi>qua</hi>

provided that the offender should be excommunicate. For they taught the people that he who did contend against a Rabbi did contend against the holy Ghost (for which see <hi>Gul. Vorstius annot. in Maimon. de fundam. legis.</hi> pag. 77, 78.) and hence did they aggravate an Ecclesiasticall or Divine (not a Civill) injury. Whence it appeareth that the causes of Excommunication, were formally lookt upon as scandals. Adde that if <hi>qua injuries,</hi> then <hi>a quatenus ad omne,</hi> all personall or civill injuries had been causes of Excommunication. But all civill injuries doe not fall within these 24. causes. If it be objected, that neither doe all scandalls fall within these 24. causes.

                  <hi>Schammata.</hi> Elias <hi>in Tisbite,</hi> saith plainly that <hi>there were three kinds of excommunication, Niddui, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, and Schammata. Niddui is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> out; but if he be not converted, they smite him with Cherem; and if neither so he repent, they schammatize him.</hi> These three Doctor <hi>Buxtorf</hi> thus distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth, not only out of <hi>Elias,</hi> the common sentence of the but Hebrew Doctors. The first and smallest excommunication is <hi>Niddui,</hi> which is a simple separation for a certain time. The greater excommunication is <hi>Cherem,</hi> which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a separation with imprecations and curses. The greatest of all is <hi>Schammata,</hi> a finall excommunication, without hope of returning to the Church. So likewise <hi>Hen. Uorstius animad. in Pirke</hi> pag. 230. And answerably hereunto some Divines have distinguished <hi>Excommunicatio Minor, Major,</hi> and <hi>Maxima.</hi> The first is suspension from the Sacrament. The second is a casting out
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95406:56"/>
of the Church, and a delivering over to Sathan: which yet is a medicinall excommunication for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved. The third is <hi>Anathema Marana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> an accursing of a man to the comimg of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of mercy; which is <hi>excommunicatio exterminativa,</hi> and cannot be done, without a propheticall Spirit. <hi>Corn. Bertramus de repub. Ebraeor cap.</hi> 7. saith that our suspension from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment answereth to their <hi>Niddui:</hi> our Excommunication to their <hi>Cherem.</hi> And for their <hi>Schammata,</hi> he thinks it was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging of one to eternall death; whereunto answereth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles <hi>Anathema,</hi> and the Churches devoting of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, as one to be no more prayed for, but to be prayed against. <hi>Munsterus</hi> will have <hi>Schammata</hi> to be the same with <hi>Niddui.</hi> Wherein Master <hi>Selden</hi> agreeth with him, still holding a difference between <hi>Niddui,</hi> and <hi>Cherem,</hi> as between the lesser, and the greater excommunication: <hi>de Jure nat. &amp; Gentium, l. 4. c.</hi> 8. Of the same opinion is <hi>Io. Coch, Annot. in Exc. Gem. Sanhedrin. p.</hi> 149. But <hi>Constantinus l' Empereur annot. in rempub. Jud.</hi> tels us, that the Talmudists in divers places, do distinguish the three degrees of Excommunication, as <hi>Bertramus</hi> doth; and that <hi>Schammata</hi> was the highest Excommunication, greater then either <hi>Niddui</hi> or <hi>Cherem,</hi> he proves not onely by the Epitheton <hi>adonai</hi> added by the Chaldee paraphrase <hi>Num. 21. 25. Et percussit eum Israel per Schammata dei;</hi> but further from the words of <hi>Rabbi Solomon,</hi> comparing one excommunicated by <hi>Schammata,</hi> to the fat cast in the Furnace, which is wholly consumed, and which never comes out, so he that is <hi>Schammatized,</hi> is lost for ever, and without all remedy unto all eternity. He confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it also, from the words of <hi>Elias</hi> above mentioned. It is not much to my present argument, to dispute whether the Jewes had three distinct degrees of excommunication or two only. However it's agreed, that the Jews had their <hi>Excommunicatio Minor &amp; Major.</hi> And <hi>Niddui<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> was an Excommunication for 30. dayes, during which time if the person (man or woman) repent, well and good: if not, he was excommunicate, for other 30. dayes. Yea, saith Doctor <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf,</hi> the time might be triplicate to 90. dayes. And if after all that time he repent not, then he was excommunicate, with the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95406:57"/>
greater excommunication <hi>Cherem.</hi> And so much for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
               <p>As for the manner, and rites of their excommunication, it was done most solemnly, <note n="z" place="margin">

               <p>As for the authority, by which a man was excommunicated, we see (by that which hath been already noted) that it was a publike and judiciall act, and it was necessary there should be at least an Assembly of ten.

                  <hi>Io. Coch</hi> gives us <hi>ex Gem. Moed Caton.</hi> Two men having mutually excommunicated each other, it commeth to an authoritative decision. He that had excommunicated the other, for that for which he ought to have been punished by a pecuniall mulct, but not by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, was himself justly excommunicate by the other, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the last of the 24. causes of excommunication before mentioned, that is, that he who unjustly excommunicateth another, shall be himselfe excommunicated. So the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of the one man for a civill injury was declared null: and the excommunicating of the other, for his unjust act of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, was ratified. Which doth not onely prove what I have said of private, or extrajudiciall excommunication: but also confirme what I asserted before, concerning the causes of excommunication, that it was not for personall or civill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, but for matter of scandall. And that pecuniary mulcts and excommunication, were not inflicted for the same but for different causes. And so much for the authority.</p>
               <p>The effects of excommunication were <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Buxtorf. Lexion Chald. Talm. &amp; Rab.</hi> p. 1305. 828.</note> these. He might not be admitted into an Assembly of ten persons. He might not sit within foure cubits to his neighbour. He might not shave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his hair, nor wash himself. It was not lawfull to eat nor drinke with him. He that dyed in excommunication got no Funerals, nor was there any mourning made for him, but a stone was set over him, to signifie that he was worthy to be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95406:58"/>
stoned, because he did not repent, and because he was separated from the Church. An excommunicate person might not make up the number of ten, where there were nine. The reason was because he might not be acknowledged for a Church Member, or one who could make up a lawfull Assembly. <hi>Drusius de tribus sectis Judaeorum lib. 3. cap.</hi> 11. draweth two consequences from that excommunication of the <hi>Cuthites</hi> before mentioned. 1. That it was not lawfull for a Jew, to eat bread with a Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan. 2. That the Samaritans were cut off from the Jewish Church, and that without hope of regresse, being Shammatized.</p>
               <p>It is more disputable, how farre forth Excommunication did deprive a man of the liberty of accesse into the Temple. The Talmudists hold, that of old an Excommunicate person might enter into the Temple, yet so as he might be known that he was Excommunicate. It is said in <hi>Pirke Rabb. Elieser cap.</hi> 17. that <hi>Solomon</hi> built two Gates, one for Bride-grooms, another for Mourners and Excommunicated persons; and when the Children of Israel, sitting between these two Gates, upon the Sabbath-dayes and Holy-dayes, did see a Bride-groome come in, they knew him, and did congratulate with him: but when they saw one come in at the doore of the mourners, having his Lips covered, they knew him to be a mourner, and said, <hi>He that dwells in this house, comfort thee.</hi> But when they saw one come in at the doore of mourners, with his Lips not covered, they knew him to be Excommunicated, and spake to him on this manner. <hi>He that dwells in this house comfort thee, and put into thy minde, to hearken unto thy Neighbours.</hi> The like you have <hi>in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice Middoth cap. 2. Sect.</hi> 2. where it is said that ordinarily, all that came into the Temple, did enter upon the right hand; and they went out upon the left hand, those excepted to whom some sad thing had befallen; and when it was asked of such a one, why dost thou enter upon the left hand, he either answered, that he was a mourner, and then it was said to him, <hi>He that dwells in this house comfort thee,</hi> or he answered, because I am Excommunicate (so readeth <hi>Buxtorf</hi>) or <hi>quia ego contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus rejicior</hi> (so readeth <hi>l' Empereur</hi>) and then it was said to him, <hi>He that dwells in this house, put into thy minde, to hearken to the words of thy companions, that they may restore thee.</hi> The same
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95406:59"/>
thing is cited <hi>e libro Musar</hi> by <hi>Drusius praeter. lib.</hi> 4. in Jo. 9. 22. His opinion is that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> those that were separate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate by the lesser excommunication, were admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, in the manner aforesaid: but that they were not admitted into the Synagogue: because its added <hi>in libro Musar,</hi> (which I finde also added in the fore-mentioned place of <hi>Pirke R Elies.</hi>) that after the temple was destroyed, it was decreed, that Bride-grooms and Mourners should come into the Synagogues, and that they in the Synagogue, should congratulate with the one, &amp; condole with the other. Behold saith <hi>Drusius,</hi> no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here of excommunicate persons, for they did not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Synagogues.

Non docet, non docetur.</hi> He is neither permitted to teach, nor to be taught. <hi>Grotius</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 22. tells us, that excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons under <hi>Niddui,</hi> came no otherwise to the Temple than Heathens did, that is, had no liberty to come into the Court of Israel. However, such as were excommunicate by <hi>Cherem were not permitted to come neere the Temple,</hi> saith Master <hi>Weemse</hi> in his <hi>Christian Synag.</hi> p. 138. An excommunicate person of the first sort, (<hi>Niddui,</hi>) when he came to the Temple, or Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, you see (by what hath been said) he was there publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bearing his shame, and looked upon as one separate from the

                  </gap> is the word used by the Apostle in the case of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, 1 Cor. 5. 13.</p>
               <p>There are five different opinions concerning that <hi>cutting off</hi> mentioned in the Law. First, <hi>Augustine</hi> in divers places, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the meaning to be of the second death or eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. But this is not sutable to the infancy of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church; for whiles they were bred under the paedagogy of the Law, things eternall and invisible were not immediately and nakedly propounded unto them, but under the shadows and figures of temporall and visible things. So that if eternall death were the ultimate intendment of that commination (as I
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95406:60"/>
verily believe it was) yet it must needs be acknowledged, that there was some other punishment in this life, comprehended under that phrase, to resemble in some sort, and to shadow forth that everlasting cutting of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some understand that cutting off to be when a man dieth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without children, having no off-spring or posterity behind him to preserve the memory of him; for he that left children behind him, was esteemed to live in some sort after he was dead. But the cutting off in the Law, is <hi>privative,</hi> not <hi>negative,</hi> it is a depriving of a man of what he hath, not the deniall of what he would have. Neither was that of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of ones name in the posterity, applicable to women, but to their husbands onely; whereas their cutting off was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all that were guilty, whether men or women. Finally, if that were the sence, then the cutting off did neither belong to such as choosed voluntarily to live unmarried, nor to men who being married had children to preserve their memory after their death. But all that committed such or such a sinne, were to be cut off, whether married or unmarried, whether having children or wanting children.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others understand capitall punishment to be inflicted by the civill Magistrate. But if all the offences for which <hi>cutting off</hi> was threatned in the Law, had been punished by death, the Mosaicall lawes, no lesse then those of <hi>Draco,</hi> might have been said to be written in blood, saith <note n="i" place="margin">De gubern. Eccl. <hi>pag. 57.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Gersomus Bucerus.</hi> Is it credible that all and every one, who did by any chance, eate the fat, or the blood, or did make a perfume for smell like to the holy perfume, or did touch a dead body, or a grave, or a tent wherein a man had died, or any thing which an unclean person had touched; and had not been thereafter sprinkled with the water of separation; were without mercy to die for any of these things? Yet these were cut off from among their people <hi>Exod. 30. 38. Lev. 7. 15, 17. Num.</hi> 19. 13. 20. Another reason I take from <hi>Mercerus</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. We nowhere finde either in Scripture, or in the Jewish writings, that such of the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as did neglect circumcision, were punished by the Sword of the Magistrate, yet by the Law such were to be cut off. Now without all controversie such were excluded from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95406:61"/>
communion with the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> and being so excluded they were said properly to be cut off from among their people, saith <hi>Mercerus.</hi> And moreover the cutting off in the Law, is expressed by such a word, as doth not necessarily signifie that the person cut off ceaseth to have any being, but it is used to signifie a cutting off from a benefit, relation, or fellowship, when the being remains, as was noted in the beginning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many of the Hebrews whom M. <hi>Ainsworth annot.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 30. followeth, understand by that cutting off, untimely death, or the shortning of life, before the naturall period. This interpretation I also dislike, upon these reasons, 1. That which is taken for a foundation of that opinion, namely, that the cutting off in the Law is meant onely as a punishment of private sinnes known to God alone, and which could not be proved by witnesses; this (I say) is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted which is to be proved. 2. Yea, the contrary appeareth from <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 4, 5. the end of that cutting off was, that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> might feare to doe that thing which they saw so punished. But how could they make this use of a Divine judgement inflicted for some private sinne, they knew not for what? 3. The commination of Divine judgements is added in a more proper place <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. and in divers places, where wrath and punishment from God is denounced against all such as would not observe his Commandements, nor keepe his Statutes and Judgements. But the <hi>cutting off</hi> is a part (and a great part) of the corrective or penall Mosaicall Lawes, which containe punishments to be inflicted by men, not by God; which makes <hi>Piscator</hi> almost everywhere in his <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> to observe, that <hi>exscindetur</hi> is put for <hi>exscinditor, that soule shall be cut off</hi> for, <hi>let that soule be cut off.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The cutting off was a distinguishing punishment; they that did such and such things were to be cut off, and in being cut off, were to beare their iniquity, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 29. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 31. But we cannot say that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bijah</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> or King <hi>Iosiah,</hi> being taken away by an untimely death, were thereby marked with a signe of Gods wrath, or that they were cut off from among their people, and did beare their iniquity. 5. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they object from <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 10. &amp; 20. 5, 6. that the cutting of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95406:61"/>
was a worke of God, not of men, it is easily answered from that same place, it was onely so, in extraordinary cases, when men did neglect to punish the offenders. <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 4, 5. <hi>And if the people of the land hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off.</hi> Which giveth light to the other place <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 10. What I have said against the third and fourth opinion, doth militate against <hi>Erastus,</hi> for he expoundeth the <hi>cutting off</hi> these two waies, that is either of capitall punishment, or of destruction by the hand of God, yet he inclineth chiefly to the last. See <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. He toucheth this cutting off in divers places but <hi>valde jejunè.</hi> And because he is pleased to professe he had no skil of the Hebrew, he appealeth to the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>There is a fifth exposition, followed by many both Popish and Protestant writers, who understand by the <hi>cutting off,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating or casting out from the Church, and of this opinion are some very good Hebritians, as <hi>Schindlerus lexic. pentagl.</hi> pag. 655. <hi>Cornelius Bertramus de republica Ebraeorum.</hi> cap. 2. <hi>Godwyns Moses and Aaron</hi> lib. 3. cap. 4.

                  <item>2. He that in his uncleannesse did eate of an unholy thing was to be cut off <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 20, 21. yet for such a one was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confession of sinne, and a trespasse-offering, by which he was reconciled and atonement made for him, as M. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> himselfe tels us on <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 2. whence I inferre, that the cutting off such a one was not by death inflicted, either from the hand of the Magistrate, or from the hand of God, but that the cutting off was Ecclesiasticall, as well as the reception or reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know M. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> is of opinion that the cutting off was for defiling the Sanctuary <hi>presumptuously,</hi> or eating of an holy thing presumptuously, when a man was not cleansed from his uncleannesse: and that atonement by sacrifice was appointed for such as defiled the Sanctuary <hi>ignorantly.</hi> But that which made him thinke so, was a mistake; for he supposeth, that for sinnes of ignorance or infirmity onely, God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Sacrifices; but that for wilfull or malicious sinnes there was no Sacrifice. See his annot. on <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 2. Which <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> also holdeth <hi>praelect.</hi> cap. 22. p. 144. But to me, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is plaine from <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. 1. to 8. where we have atonement to be made by Trespasse offerings, for wilfull lying, perjury, fraud, robbing, or violence, which made the Septuagints, V. 2. for <hi>commit a trespasse,</hi> to read, <hi>despising despise the commandements of the Lord.</hi> And whereas M. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> confirmeth his opinion from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. <hi>for if we sinne wilfully after that we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for sinnes;</hi> I answer with <hi>Calvin, Beza, Hemmingius,</hi> and others upon the place, it is not meant of all sinnes done wilfully, (which to hold were a most dangerous and despairing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,) but of a totall defection from Christ and the truth. And now to returne, there is nothing <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 2. to exclude a Trespasse-offering for one who should in his uncleannesse wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully goe to the Sanctuary, or touch an holy thing: but there is this reason, why it should not be excluded, because in that

                  <item>3. The Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. gives us some light concerning the cutting off; for as Vers. 6, 7, 8. most manifestly he pointeth at the purging of all the congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> from leaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. so Vers. 13. when he saith, <hi>therefore put away from among your selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that wicked person,</hi> he plainly alludeth to <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 15, 19. <hi>Whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soule shall be cut off from the Congregation, (or Church) of Israel. Theophylact</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. observeth the Apostles allusion to the old Law of cutting off: and <hi>Maccovius</hi> (otherwise no very good friend to Church-discipline and Government) <hi>loc. com. disp.</hi> 22. proveth that Excommunication was transferred from the Jewes to us, by Christ himselfe <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and that the cutting off mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law, is no other thing than that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle meaneth, when he saith, <hi>put away from among your selves that wicked person.</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95406:63"/>
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 31. <hi>That soule shall be utterly cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him.</hi> Whereby (say they) both the body is destroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the naturall time, and likewise the soule ceaseth to have a being. But whatsoever any of the Hebrews fancied in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining latter times, concerning that second kinde of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, (which M. <hi>Selden</hi> doth not approve, but relate out of them) I am confident it was onely the degenerating notion of Excommunication; and that very fancy of theirs, is a footstep thereof; which may make us easily believe that the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hebrews in purer times, did understand that such a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off was mentioned in the Law, by which a man in respect of his Spirituall being was cut off from the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> whiles his naturall life and being was not taken ftom him. Yea <hi>Gul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>elmus Vorstius annot. in Maimon. de fundam. legis</hi> pag. 60. sheweth us, that some of the Hebrewes acknowledge nothing under the name of the cutting off, but that which is the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of the soule onely. But if there be so much as some cutting off mentioned in the Law, which concerneth a mans Spirituall estate onely, it doth abundantly confirme what I plead for: and I shall not need to assert, that everywhere in the Law Excommunication must needs be understood by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off. Some understand the cutting off in the Judiciall or Civill lawes, to be meant of capitall punishments: and the cutting off in the ceremoniall Lawes (which were properly Ecclesiasticall) to be meant of Excommunication, or cutting off from the Church onely. If anywhere the cutting off be Excommunication, it sufficeth me. Or what ever it may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie more, or be extended unto, if Excommunication be one thing which it signifieth, then they who thinke it signifieth some other thing beside Excommunication, are not against me in this question.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I shall conclude with that in the Dutch Annotations upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>that soule shall be cut off from his people.</hi> The Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Englished saith thus, <hi>that man shall be excommunicate from the fellowship of Gods people. This kind of expression implies also (as some doe conceive) a bodily punishment to be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95406:64"/>
thing beside, they judge not to be so cleare, and therefore offer it to be considered.</p>
               <p>It is but a poore argument, whereby Bishop <hi>Bilson, of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, chap.</hi> 4. would prove the cutting off not to be meant of Excommunication, because it is applyed even to capitall offences, such as the Law elsewhere appointeth men to be put to death for. As if it were any absurdity to say, that one and the same offence, is to be punished <hi>sub formalitate scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dali</hi> with excommunication, and <hi>sub formalitate criminis</hi> with capitall punishment. And who knoweth not that a capitall crime is a cause of excommunication, which is also sometimes the sole punishment, the Magistrate neglecting his duty. If a known blasphemer or incestuous person be not cut off by the Magistrate as he ought by the Law of God: shall he therefore not be cut off by excommunication? If he had proved that all the causes of cutting off in the Law were capitall crimes, he had said much: but that will never be proved.</p>

(though cited by our Opposites againstus) he saith, though it was abused by the Pharisees, yet it sheweth the Antient use of the the thing it self, that there was such a discipline in the Jewish Church. It is not much materiall, to dispute which of the degrees of the Jewish Excommunication, or whether all the three were meant by that casting out of the Synagogue. <hi>Drusius,</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> expound, <hi>Io.</hi> 9. 22. of <hi>Niddui. Gerhard</hi> expounds <hi>Io.</hi> 16. 2. of all the three <hi>Niddui, Cherem,</hi> and <hi>Shammata.</hi> It is enough for this present argument, if it was a spirituall, or Ecclesiasticall Censure, not a civill punishment. Master <hi>Prynne, Vindic.</hi> pag. 48, 49. tels us. First, this casting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, was not warranted by Gods Word, but was onely a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention. Secondly, as it was practiced by the Jewes, it was a diabolicall institution. Thirdly, that it was meerly a civill Excommunication, like to an <hi>Outlary,</hi> whereby the party cast out, was separate from civill conversation onely, or from all company with any man, but was not suspended from any Divine Ordinance. Fourthly, that it was inflicted by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Magistrate. Fifthly, that in the Jewish Synagogues at that time, there was neither Sacrament nor Sacrifice, but onely Reading, Expounding, Preaching, Disputing, and Prayer, so that it cannot prove suspension from the Sacrament. To the first, I answer, it was not onely warranted by the cutting off mentioned in the Law, but <hi>Erastus</hi> himselfe gives a warrant for it from Gods word. He saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 315. the casting out of the Synagogue, was <hi>vel idem vel simile quidpiam</hi> with that <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the congregation Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <list>
                  <item>First, the causes for which men were put out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, were matters of scandall, offences in point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we read of none cast out of the Synagogue for a civill injury or crime; It was for confessing Christ <hi>Io.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 42. then counted heresie: and for Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell <hi>Io.</hi> 16. 2.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, The Synagogicall Assembly or Court, was Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95406:65"/>
and Ecclesiasticall, as <hi>Ludoviens de Dieu</hi> noteth upon <hi>Matth</hi> 10. 17. we read of <hi>the Rulers of the Synagogue, Act.</hi> 13. 15. among whom he that did pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As for that Assembly of the Pharisees, which did cast out, or excommunicate the blind man, <hi>Io.</hi> 9. <hi>Tossanus</hi> upon the place calls it <hi>Senatus Ecclesiasticus;</hi> and <hi>Brentius</hi> argueth from this example against the infallibility of Councells, because this Councell of the Pharisees call'd Christ himselfe a finner.</item>
                  <item>3 The Court of civill Judgement, was in the Gates of the City, not in the Synagogue.</item>
                  <item>4 Such as the Communion and fellowship was in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, such was the casting out of the Synagogue. But the Communion or fellowship, which one enjoyed in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, was a Church-Communion and Sacred fellowship, in acts of Divine worship. Therefore the casting out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue was also Ecclesiasticall and Spirituall, not civill or temporall.</item>
                  <item>4 The end was Sacred and Spirituall, to glorifie God <hi>Is.</hi> 66. 5. to doe God good service <hi>Io.</hi> 16. 2. in that which did more immediately and neerly touch his name and his glory, Though the Pharisees did falsely pretend that end, their error was not in mistaking the nature of the Censure, but in misapplying it where they had no just cause.</item>
                  <item>5 Master <hi>Prynne</hi> himself tells us pag. 49. That this excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from the Synagogue was of force forty dayes (though I beleeve he hath added ten more then enough, and if he look over his Bookes better, he will find he should have said thirty,) yet so as that it might be shortned upon repentance. But I pray, are civill punishments shortned or lengthened ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the parties repentance? I know Church Censures are so. But I had thought, the end of civill punishments, is not to reclaime a mans soule by repentance, and then to be taken off: but to guard the Lawes of the Land, to preserve Justice, Peace,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95406:65"/>
and good order, to make others feare to doe evill, to uphold the publike good. The Magistrate must both punish and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue punishments, as long as is necessary for those ends, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the party be penitent or not.</item>
                  <item>6 How is it credible, that the holy Ghost meaning to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse a casting out from civill company or conversation onely, (which was not within, but without the Synagogue) would choose such a word as signifieth the casting out from an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall or Sacred Assembly? (for such were the Synagogues, in which the Jewes had Reading, Expounding, Preaching and Prayer, as Master <hi>Prynne</hi> tells us) Christ himselfe distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Court or Judicatory, which was in the Synagogue, from civill Magistracy <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>And when they bring you unto the Synagogues, and unto Magistrates and Powers.</hi> Magistrates and Powers are civill Rulers, supreame and subordinate, but the Synagogues are distinct Courts from both these.</item>

First, that it was some ignominy put upon a man: which I thinke no body denies, and it may well stand with our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. Secondly, he saith not that it was a separating of the party <hi>from all company, or society with any man.</hi> (for which Master <hi>Prynne</hi> citeth <hi>Erastus</hi> with others) but a pulling away, or casting out of a man from some particular Towne onely; for instance, from <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Thirdly, He saith, it seemes also to have been a refusall of the priviledges of Jewish Citizens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the esteeming of one no longer for a true Jew, but for a Proselyte.

               <p>To Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> fourth exception, the Answer may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from what is already said. We never find the temporall Magistrate called <hi>the Ruler of the Synagogue,</hi> nor yet that he sate in Judgement in the Synagogue. The beating or scourging in the Synagogues, was a tumultuous disorderly act; we read of no sentence given, but onely to be put out of the Synagogue, which sentence was given by the Synagogicall consistory, made up of the Priest or Priests and Jewish Elders. For the power of judging in things and causes Ecclesiasticall, did belong to the Priests and Levites, together with the Elders of <hi>Israel.</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 30. 32. 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 19. 8. And therefore what reason Master <hi>Prynne</hi> had to exclude the Priests from this corrective power, and from being Rulers of the Synagogue, I know not. Sure I am the Scriptures cited make Priests and Levites to be Judges and Rulers Ecclesiasticall; of which before. As for the chief Ruler of the Synagogue: <hi>Archysynagogus erat</hi>

               <p>To the fifth I Answer, 1. If there was an exclusion from Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Expounding, Preaching, and Prayer, then much more from Sacraments, in which there is more of the communion of Saints. 2. He that was cast out of the Synagogue might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Synagogue, saith <hi>Menochius</hi> in <hi>Io.</hi> 9. 22. therefore he did not communicate in Prayer with the Congregation, nor in other acts of Divine Worship, (which how farre it is applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to excommunication in the Christian Church, I do not now dispute, nor are all of one opinion, concerning excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate persons, their admission unto some, or exclusion from all publike Ordinances, hearing of the word and all) I know <hi>Erastus</hi> answereth the word <hi>Synagogue</hi> may signifie either the materiall house, the place of Assembling; or the people, the congregation which did Assemble; and some who differ in Judgement from us in this particular, hold that when we read of putting out of the Synagogue, the word <hi>Synagogue</hi> doth not signifie the house or place of publike worship (which yet it doth signifie in other places, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 7.) but the Church or Assembly it selfe. But I take it to signifie both joyntly; and that it was a casting out, even from the place it selfe, such as that <hi>Io.</hi> 9. 34. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>and they cast him out,</hi> or <hi>excommunicated him,</hi> as the English Translators adde in the Margine. Besides, I take what it is granted. It was a casting out from the Assembly, or Congregation it selfe. But how could a man be cast out from the Congregation, and yet be free to come where the Congregation was Assembled together? O but he must keepe off foure cubites distance, from all other men. And was there so much roome to reele to and fro in the Synagogue? I doe not understand how a man shall satisfie himselfe in that notion. But I rather thinke <hi>Bertramus</hi> speakes rationally, that he that was excommunicate by <hi>Niddui</hi> was shut out <hi>ab hominum contubernio atque ade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>3 It is more then Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> can prove that the Sacrament of Circumcision was not then administred in the Synagogues. The Jewes do administer it in their Synagogues; and that <hi>Iohn</hi> was Circumcised in the Synagogue, some gather from <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 59. <hi>Venerunt, they came</hi> (to wit to the Synagogue) <hi>to Circumcise the Child;</hi> for my part I lay no weight upon that argument.

                  </gap>sse ground for Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Assertion.</p>
               <p>As for that which M. <hi>Prynne</hi> addeth in the close, that those who were cast out of the Synagogue might yet resort to the Temple, he hath said nothing to prove it. I find the same thing affirmed by <hi>Sutlivius de Presbyt.</hi> pag. 25. (though I had thought Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> Tenen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s of this kind, should never have complyed with those of Episcopall men, against the Anti-Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall party) But neither doth <hi>Sutlivius</hi> prove it; onely he holds that the casting out of the Synagogue was meerely a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Excommunication, and his reason is that which he had to prove, that Christ and his Disciples, when they were cast out of the Synagogues, had notwithstanding a free accesse to the Temple. To my best observation, I can find no Instance of any admitted to the Temple, while cast out of the Synagogue. I turn again to <hi>Erastus</hi> pag. 314. to see whether he proves it. He gives us two instances, first of Christ himselfe who was cast out of the Synagogues, and yet came into the Temple. But how proves he that Christ was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? for this, he tells us onely <hi>Quis dubitat? who makes Question of it?</hi> I am one who make a great Question of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or rather put it out of Question, that Christ was not cast out of the Synagogues; for what saith he himselfe <hi>Io.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple, whether the Iewes alwayes resort.</hi> Christ was cast out of the City of <hi>Nazareth</hi> in the tumult by the people <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. but here was no consistoriall sentence, it was not the casting out of the Synagogue of which our Question is. The other Instance which <hi>Erastus</hi> gives, helps him as little. The Apostles saith
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95406:67"/>
he, were cast out of the Synagogue, and yet immediately went to the Temple, and taught the people <hi>Act.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. And how many Synagogues was <hi>Paul</hi> cast out of? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Yet he is not reprehended for coming into the Temple. <hi>Answ.</hi> I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Synagogue in those places which he citeth. It was the Councell, not the Synagogue which the Apostles had to doe with Act. 4. <hi>v</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>But what have they gained if they could prove that Christ or his Apostles, while knowne to be excommunicate from the Synagogues, were admitted into the Temple? How often did they come into the Temple, when the Priests, and Elders, and <hi>Scribes,</hi> would gladly have cast them out, but they feared the people, and so were restrained? Nay, what if they could give other Instances, that such as were cast out of the Synagogue, were permitted to come into the Temple; what gaine they thereby? If we understand the casting out of the Synagogue to be meant of <hi>Niddui,</hi> of the lesser Excommunication as <hi>Drusius, Bertramus, Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Godwyne</hi> understand it, we are not at all pinched or straitned. Nay, though we should also compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>Cherem</hi> or greater excommunication under this casting out of the Synagogue, all that will follow upon the admission of such into the Temple, will be this, that excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons when they desired to make atonement for their sinne by Sacrifice, were for that end admitted into the Temple (which who denies?) but still with a marke of Ignominy upon them as long as they were excommunicated, as I have shewed before. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. Finally whereas Master <hi>Prynne</hi> concludeth his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of this point, that we may as well prove excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Diotrephes</hi> 3. <hi>Io.</hi> 10, as from the casting out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, I admit the paralell thus. The Pharisees did cast out from the Synagogue such as professed Christ; <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did cast out of the Church (as <hi>Iohn</hi> saith) such as received the Brethren. Both <hi>clave errante:</hi> the Ecclesiasticall censure was abused and misapplyed; yet from both it appeareth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Ecclesiasticall Censures were used in the Church. There was a casting out of the Synagogue used among the Jewes, which the Pharisees did abuse. There was a casting out of the Church used among Christians, which <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did abuse.

                  </gap> signifieth to abalienate a person or thing, by renouncing and quitting the right, title, and interest which formerly we had in that person or thing; so houses, lands, persons, &amp;c. are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienated, when (though they and we remaine where before) we cease to owne them as ours; and thus the Congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> did renounce their interest in those offenders, and would not owne them as Church-members. The other punishment was the dedicating or devoting of their substance. <hi>Gelenius</hi> the Interpreter hath rightly rendered the sence of <hi>Iosephus: Et quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis non adfuerat intra praescriptum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>empus, ut excommunicetur, bonaque ejus sacro aerario addicantur.</hi> You will object, this sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Congregation is coupled together with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of a mans estate, and so seemeth rather banishment than Excommunication. This objection being taken off, I think there shall be no other difficulty to perplex our interpretation. Wherefore I answer these two things. 1. It is the opinion of divers who hold two Sanhedrins among the Jewes, one Civill, and another Ecclesiasticall; that in causes and occasions of a mixed nature which did concerne both Church and State, both did consult conclude, and decree, in a joynt way, and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement together. Now <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. the Princes, Elders, Priests, and Levites, were assembled together upon an extraordinary cause, which conjuncture and concurrence of the Civill and the Ecclesiasticall power might occasion the denouncing of a double punishment upon the contumacious, <hi>forfeiture</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</hi> But 2. The objection made, doth rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme me, that Excommunication is intended in that place. For this forfeiture was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a making sacred, or dedicating to an holy use, as I have shewed out of <hi>Iosephus.</hi> The originall word translated <hi>forfeited</hi> is more properly translated <hi>devoted,</hi> which is the word put in the margin of our bookes. The Greek
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95406:69"/>
saith <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>anathemstizabitur</hi> which is the best ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It was not therefore that which we call <hi>forfeiture</hi> of a mans substance. <hi>Intellige</hi> saith <hi>Grotius, ita ut Deo sacra fiat.</hi> And so the excommunication of a man, and <hi>the devoting of his substance as holy to the Lord,</hi> were joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and the substance had not been anathematized if the man had not been anathematized. I doe not say that Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication <hi>ex natura rei</hi> doth inferre and draw after it, the devoting of a mans estate as holy to the Lord. No: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication can not hurt a man in his worldly estate, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Civill Magistrate and the Law of the Land ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth. And there was Excommunication in the Apostolical Churches, where there was no Christian Magistrate to adde a Civill mulct. But the devoting of the substance of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated persons <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. as it had the authority of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Rulers for it, so what extraordinary warrants or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct there was upon that extraordinary exigence, we can not tell.</p>
               <p>Finally M. <hi>Selden de Jure nat. &amp; Gentium. lib. 4. cap. 9.</hi> p. 523. agreeth with <hi>Lud. Capellus</hi> that the separation from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 8. <hi>plane ipsum est</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>fieri, it is the very same with casting out of the Synagogue,</hi> which confuteth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which M. <hi>Prynne</hi> holds, that the casting out of the Synagogue was not warranted by Gods word, but was onely a humane invention.</p>
               <p>I know some have drawne another argument for the Jewish Excommunication from <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 25. <hi>I contended with them, and cursed them, id est, anathematizavi &amp; excommunicavi,</hi> saith <hi>C. a lapide</hi> upon the place. So <hi>Tirinus</hi> upon the same place. <hi>Mariana</hi> expounds it, <hi>anathema dixi. Aben Ezra</hi> understands it of two kinds of Excommunication, <hi>Niddui</hi> and <hi>Cherem.</hi> For my part, I lay no weight upon this, unlesse you understand the cursing or malediction to be an act of the Ecclesiasticall power, onely authorised or countenanced by the Magistrate: Which the words may well beare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for neither is it easily credible that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did with his owne hand smite those men and plucke off their hayre, but that by his authority he tooke care to have it done by civill Officers, as the cursing by Ecclesiasticall
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95406:69"/>
Officers. The Dutch annotations leane this way, telling us that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did expresse his zeale against them as persons that <hi>deserved to be banned or cut off from the people of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Text proving the Jewish Excommunication is <hi>Luke 6. 22. When they shall separate you, and shall reproach you, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ne was a totall separation or casting out of the Church which is usually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Excommunication; another was a suspension or sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Sacrament onely. Of which I am to speak more afterward in the third Booke. I hold now at the Text in hand, which may be thus read, according to the sence and letter both, <hi>when they shall excommunicate you, &amp;c.</hi> Howbeit the other reading <hi>when they shall separate you,</hi> holds forth the same thing which I speake of; <hi>separate,</hi> from what? our Translators supply <hi>from their company:</hi> but from what company of theirs? not from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95406:70"/>
their civill company onely, but from their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sacred or Church assemblies, and from religious fellowship, it being a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censure and a part of Ecclesiasticall discipline, in which sence, as this word frequently occurreth in the Greeke fathers and ancient Canons when they speake of Church discipline, so doubtlesse it must be taken in this place. 1. Because, as <hi>Grotius</hi> tels us, that which made the Jewes the rather to separate men in this manner from their society was the want of the Civill coercive power of Magistracy, which sometime they had. And I have proved before that the civill Sanhedrin which had power of criminall and capitall judgements did remove from <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and cease to execute such judgement, forty yeeres before the destruction of the Temple. 2. Because in all other places of the new Testament where the same word is used, it never signifieth a bare separation from civill company, but either a conscientious and religious separation by which Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers did intend to keep themselves pure from such as did walke, (or were conceived to walke) disorderly and scandalously, <hi>Acts 19. 9. 2 Cor. 6. 17. Gal. 2. 13.</hi> or Gods separating between the godly and the wicked, <hi>Matth</hi> 13. 49. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. 32. or the setting apart of men to the ministery of the Gospell, <hi>Acts 13. 2. Rom. 1. 1. Gal. 1. 15.</hi> Thirdly, a Civill separation is for a Civill injury; but this separation is for wickednesse and impiety, whether accompanied with civill injury or no; <hi>they shall cast out your name as evill,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Iewish Exomologesis, or publike Declaration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by confession of sinne.</head>
               <p>AS there were some footsteps of publique Confession among the Heathens, and namely among the <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Lorinus in Psal. 31. 5. ex Plutarcho.</note> who made him that was deprehended in a crime, to compasse the Altar, and there to expresse his owne shame, and to pronounce some disgracefull words against himselfe. So, I make no doubt, they had this (as many other rites) from an imitation of the people of God, who had their owne Exomologesis, and publique testimonies of Repentance, which may thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>

                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> a man was to put his hand upon the head of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he brought, and so it was accepted to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 4. and this was done in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle publiquely before the Priest. <hi>Genebrardus</hi> and <hi>Lorinus</hi> in <hi>Psalm</hi> 31. 5. tell us out of <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> and other Rabbinicall Autors, and <hi>ex libro Siphri,</hi> that when he that brought the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, did put his hands between the hornes of the beast which was to be offered, he did distinctly commemorate that sinne for which he did then repent, professing his detestation thereof, and promising to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so no more. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Ainsworth</hi> on <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 4. to the same purpose citeth out of <hi>Maimeny in treat. of offering Sacrifices, cap.</hi> 3. these words. <hi>He layeth his hands between the two hornes, and confesseth upon the same offering, the iniquity of sinne, and upon the trespasse-offering, the iniquity of trespasse: and upon the burnt offering he confesseth the iniquity of doing that which he should not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not doing that he ought, &amp;c.</hi> Now that confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne was joyned with the laying on of hands upon the Sacrifice, is not onely proved by the judgement of the Hebrews, understanding the Law in that sence, but by the Law it selfe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. where <hi>Aaron</hi> is commanded to lay his hands upon the head of the live Goat, <hi>and confesse over him all the iniquites</hi>

                     <hi>of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sinnes, putting them upon the head of the Goat.</hi>

                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Law appointeth confession to be made at the bringing of Trespasse-offerings <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. and that in three kinds of trespasses.</item>
               </list>
               <list>
                  <item>1 If one <hi>heare the voyce of swearing,</hi> that is, heare his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour swearing or cursing, which he ought to reveale: <hi>and is a witnesse whether he hath seen or known of it:</hi> (that is, whether he himselfe hath been present at the cursing or reviling (of God <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 10, 11. or of man, 2 <hi>Sam. 16. 7.</hi>) or hath heard it by relation from others, and knowne it that way. So the Dutch Annotations and the best Interpreters) <hi>if he doe not utter it, then he shall beare his iniquity.</hi> The meaning is when one doth for favour or malice (So <hi>Aretius</hi> and <hi>Pareus</hi> upon the place) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the truth, and conceale his knowledge, and so make himselfe partaker of other mens sinnes. <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds it by <hi>Prov. 29. Who so is partner with a thiefe hateth his owne soule: he heareth a cursing and bewrayeth it not.</hi> In such a case a man did greatly scandalize all those (were they more or fewer) who knew his dissimulation, and that he did not utter his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</item>
                  <item>2 If one had touched any uncleane thing, and not being cleansed from his uncleannesse<note n="m" place="margin">See <hi>Ainswarth</hi> upon the place.</note> did goe into the Sanctuary or touch an holy thing (whether he knew himselfe to have tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the uncleane thing, when he went into the Sanctuary, but did afterward forget it, as the Hebrews understand the place; or whether he did not know of his uncleannes when he went into the Sanctuary) as soon as it was revealed to him by others who did take offence at it, or otherwise brought to his knowledge, he was held guilty till confession and atonement was made. It was not simply the touching of an uncleane thing, for which the confession and trespasse-offering was appointed: <hi>Seeing the Law</hi> (saith <hi>Ainsworth) maketh such uncleane but till eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lev.</hi> 11. 24, 31. <hi>when washing themselves and their clothes they were cleane, and for uncleannesse by a dead man, the sprinkling water cleansed them, Num.</hi> 19. 17, 18, 19. Wherefore he resolveth out of the Hebrew Doctors, that this confession of sinne, and the trespasse-offering was required in case an uncleane person
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95406:71"/>
in his uncleannesse came to the Sanctuary, or did eate of an holy thing.</item>
                  <item>3 If one had sworne unadvisedly, as <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 22. <hi>Herod, Mark</hi> 6. 23. those conspirators against <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 23. 21. (which are the examples given in the Dutch Annotations, and they are examples of scandals) if the thing were hid from him, through the distemper, impetuosity, and passion of his spirit, overclouding the eye of his mind, so that when he hath sworn a scandalous oath, he scarce knowes or remembers well the thing. Or thus; If a man had sworne an oath to doe a thing, or not to doe it, and afterward falsified his oath, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not doe what he had rashly sworne, or because he was unwilling to doe it, or because he neglected to doe it: (<hi>Aretius</hi> puts this triple case in expounding the Text:) When a man was brought to the knowledge of the falsifying of his oath, <hi>being told, or put in mind of it by others,</hi> saith <hi>Diodati,</hi> which was also a case of scandall.</item>

                  <hi>Prynne</hi> affirmeth <hi>Vindic.</hi> pag. 17. For, 1. It was a cereomoniall Law, concerning the externall worship of God, and a part of the Law of trespasse-offerings. He might as well have said, that the Trespasse-offering was made to God alone, without the presence of the Priest or any other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. He himselfe doth not deny (but intimate) that till such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession was made, a man was not admitted to make atonement by trespasse-offerings. And so doe the Jewes understand the Law of confession, as we shall heare by and by. Now how could it be knowne, whether a man had confessed any thing at all, if it was secretly, and to God alone? 3. The sinnes to be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, were oft times scandalous and knowne to others, (as hath been cleared.) Therefore the confession was to be knowne to others also. 4 That this confession (not private and auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but publique and penitentiall) was made in the Temple,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95406:72"/>
before and in the hearing of the Priest, I prove from <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew. In his booke <hi>de sacr. Abelis &amp; Caini,</hi> at the close, speaking of the Levites ministery, he saith, that he did execute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all those services which belong to a perfect Priesthood, and to the bringing of man to God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by burnt-offerings, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>aut pro pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis quorum paenitet</hi> saith <hi>Gelenius</hi> the Interpreter, meaning the trespasse-offerings. But observe further, he speaks of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall part, as a publique thing, or rather of the publique declaration of repentance. Repentance of sinnes, that is, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance declared or professed (which was in the confession joyned with the trespasse-offerings) was one of the chiefe things about which the Leviticall ministery was exercised: which is the cleare sence of the place. More plainly, the same <hi>Philo lib. de victimis</hi> towards the close, where he tels that certaine parts of the trespasse-offerings were eaten by the Priests, and that these must be eaten in the Temple, he gives this reason for it, lest the penitents sinne and shame should be divulged and punished more then needs must, which intimateth that the particular offence was so confessed that it was made knowne to such as were within the Temple.</p>
               <p>The third Scripturall proofe is <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 6, 7. <hi>When a man or a woman shall commit any sinne that men commit, to doe a trespasse against the Lord, and that person be guilty, Then they shall confesse their sinne which they have done: and he shall recompence his tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, &amp;c.</hi> The Hebrews expound it thus: <hi>All the precepts in the Law, whether they command or forbid a thing, if a man transgresse against any one of them, either presumptuously or ignorantly, when he maketh repentance and turneth from his sinne, he is bound to confesse before the blessed God, as in Numb.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>This confession is with words, and it is commanded to be done. How doe they confesse? He saith, Oh God, I have sinned, I have done perversely, I have tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed before thee, and have done thus and thus: and loe I repent, and am ashamed of my doings: and I will never doe this thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And this is the foundation of confession. And who so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a large confession, and is long in this thing, he is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And so the owners of sinne and trespasse-offerings, when they bring their oblations for their ignorant or for their presumptuous</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:95406:72"/>
                  <hi>sinnes: atonement is not made for them by their oblation, untill they have made Repentance and Confession by word of mouth. Likewise all condemned to death by the Magistrates, or condemned to Stripes, no atonement is made for them by their death, or by their Stripes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they have repented and confessed. And so he that hurteth his Neighbour, or doth him dammage, though he pay him whatsoever he oweth him, atonement is not made for him, tell he confesse and turne away from doing so againe for ever, as it is written in</hi> Num. 5. 6. <hi>Any of all the sinnes of men.</hi> All this <hi>Ainsworth</hi> transcribeth out of <hi>Maimony in Misn. treat. of Repentance,</hi> Chap. 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. See also the Latin Edition of the Jewish Canons of Repentance Printed at <hi>Cambridge Ann.</hi> 1631.

               <p>In which passage I nnderstand by sinnes against God, sinnes known to God onely. 1. Because its forbidden to reveale those sinnes, therefore they were secret. 2. Because otherwise those Canons shall contradict themselves, for <hi>cap.</hi> 1. it's told us that all who brought trepasse offerings, were bound to confesse by word of mouth, the sinne which they had done, without which confession, they got not leave to make atonement by the trespasse-offering. Now trespasse offerings were for sinnes against God as well as for sinnes against man. 3. It should other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise contradict the Law <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 6. which appointeth any sinne or trespasse against the Lord to be confessed. 4. Those tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasses were to be publikely confessed, for which in case of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and obstinacy, a man was excommunicated with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95406:73"/>
                  <hi>Cherem,</hi> or the greater Excommunication. But a man was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for divers sinnes against God, which did not at all wrong his Neighbour, setting a side the scandall. Which I have proved before. These four reasons will prove either that the meaning of that Canon must be of private sinnes, and not of publike and scandalous sinnes against the first Table: or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise that the Canon is contrary to and inconsistent with both Scripture, Reason, and other Rabbinnicall writings.</p>

after ministeriall conviction by <hi>Nathan,</hi> who did convince <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> of the greatnesse of that scandalous sinne, in which he had then continued impenitent neer a yeer or thereabout. The Doctrin which Master <hi>Hildersham</hi> draweth from <hi>Davids</hi> example is this, <hi>That they whose sinnes God hath detected and brought to light, whose sinnes are publike and notorious, scandalous and offensive to the congregations where they live, ought to be willing to confesse their sins publikely, to make their Repentance as publike and notorious as their sinne is.</hi> He addeth in his explanation, <hi>when they shall be required to doe it by the Discipline of the Church.</hi> Marke one of his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (which is the Subject of the 37.

                  <hi>ERastus</hi> and his followers hold, that among the Jewes none was excluded from any publike Ordinance in the Temple, for morall uncleanesse, that is, for a prophane scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous conversation, but onely for legall or ceremoniall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanesse. The like Master <hi>Prynne</hi> saith of the Passeover, and of the Temple he holds that even those who were for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences cast out of the Synagogues, were yet free to come and did come to the Temple. I shall particularly make Answer both to <hi>Erastus</hi> and to Master <hi>Prynne</hi> in this point, when they shall fall in my way afterward. I shall here, more generally endeavour to rectifie their great mistake, and to prove an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Temple and publike Ordinances, for publike and scandalous offences in life and conversation, or for morall as well as ceremoniall uncleanesse.</p>

If so, then certainly such wicked and abominable persons were not allowed to come to the Temple; and if they did, they ought to have been judicially and by authority cast out; for that which was permitted to private persons in the executing of justice or inflicting of punishment, out of their zeale to the glory of God, was much more incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent to such as had authority in their hands for correcting and removing the prophanation of the Temple in an authoritative, judiciall, and orderly way.</item>

So here, it was a necessary consequence: If those that were ceremonially uncleane were to be excluded from the Temple, much more those who were morally or impiously uncleane. For, 1. the legall uncleannesse did signifie
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95406:79"/>
the sinfull uncleannesse; and the exclusion of those that were known to be legally uncleane from the Temple, did signifie the excluding of those who are knowne to be grossely and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously uncleane in their life and conversation. Which shall be abundantly confirmed afterwards. Therefore <hi>Bertramus de Rep.

And this gives me occasion to adde in conclusion a further confirmation out of the Hebrew Doctors. They held that an Israelite turning an Hereticke, (that is, denying any of their thirteen fundamentall Articles) to be as an Heathen man, and did therefore permit a Jew to lend to him upon usury even as to an Heathen. M. <hi>Selden de Jure nat. &amp; Gentium. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.

They esteemed an hereticall Jew, more hereticall then a Christian, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him, even summarily and without previous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.

They who did imagine the Scripture it selfe to be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and prophaned, when it came thorough the hands of an Epicurean, or Hereticall Israelite, no doubt, they thought the Temple polluted and prophaned, if such a one should be suffered to come and worship in it.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95406:80"/>
sacramentall and typicall holinesse thereof (for the Temple was a Type of Christ) so prophane persons are now much more to be kept back from the Sacrament of the Lord Supper, which hath more of Sacramentall signification, mystery, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in it, then the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had, and whereby more ample Evangelicall promises are set forth and sealed unto us. And as prophane persons might of old come into the Court of the Gentiles, and there heare the word preached in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch (where both Christ and his Apostles did Preach <hi>Io.</hi> 10. 23. <hi>Act</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 12. which Porch was in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Court, That is, the Court of the Gentiles: of which else-where out of <hi>Iosephus</hi>) but might not come into the Court of <hi>Israel,</hi> nor have communion in the Sacrifices: so prophane obstinate sinners are to be excluded, for their impiety, from the Church communion of Saints, though they may heare the word, as Heathens also may doe. Now that the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had a Typicall Sacramentall resemblance of Christ, may appear plainly in divers particulars. 1. As the glory of the Lord dwelt in the Temple within the oracle, above the Arke and the Mercy seat; and at the dedication of the Temple, the cloud of the glory of the Lord did visibly fill the whole house; so in Christ the fulnesse of the God-head dwells bodily, as the Apostle speakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. As the great God whom the heavens of heavens cannot containe, was yet pleased to dwell on earth, by putting his name in that place; so notwithstanding of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite distance between God and man, yet they are brought neer each to other, to have fellow-ship together in Jesus Christ. 3. God revealed his will, that he would accept no Sacrifices from his people, but in the Temple onely, after it was built: So God hath revealed his will, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>that were present received the passeover, not one of them being exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from eating it.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If it was so, doth not this make as much against himselfe as against us, unlesse he will say, that the Analogy must hold so farre, that all Baptized persons whatsoever, none excepted (if it be not in cases of necessity or disability) how scand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Texts cited by him, prove that men were debarred for legall uncleannesse, but there is not one of them which will prove that men were debarred onely for legall uncleannesse, and no man for morall uncleannesse. Yea, one of those Texts. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6. 21. tells us that those who were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the passeover, were such <hi>as had separated themselves from the silthynesse of the heathen of the Land, to seeke the Lord God of</hi> Israel. 3. That morall uncleannesse, I meane known prophannesse or scandalous sinnes, did render men uncapable of eating the passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I shall prove anone by divers arguments, unto which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Master <hi>Prynne.</hi>

               <p>That which hee objecteth from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. I am to answer also distinctly by it selfe. His second reply is, <hi>that those who were legally uncleane at the day appointed for the passeover, so as they could not then receive it, were yet peremptorily enjoyned to eat it the</hi> 14. <hi>day of the second moneth, &amp;c.</hi> Num. 9. 11. 12. <hi>he must not be suspended from it above one moneth.

And what if any of them were in the second moneth also uncleane, by the touch of a deadbody or otherwise? Were they not kept off in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond moneth, as well as in the first? Is it not plainly said of the second passeover <hi>vers.</hi> 12.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 The Text <hi>Num.</hi> 9 6, 7. tells us the unclean were kept back; but by whom they were kept back, it tells not. That it was neither left free to the unclean person to eat of the passeover, nor to the Family to admit him, but that there was an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative restraint, I prove by this argument. He that was uncleane and before his cleasing did eat of the flesh of the Peace-offerings was cut off from among his people <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 20. 21, Therefore he that in his uncleannesse, did eat the passeover, was to be cut off also. No man will say that there was any lesse punishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the pollution of the passeover, than for the pollution of Peace-offerings. And if the uncleane were not permitted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to eat of the Flesh of the Sacrifices, or if they did they were cut off; shall not as great care be had to keep the body of Jesus Christ (which was signified by the flesh of the sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) and the bloud of the Covenant, from being trod under Foot by Dogges and Swine?</item>

Neither is there any such reason in that Text <hi>Num.</hi> 9. as the excluding quite out of the camp, those who were uncleane by a dead body, and so by consequence from the passeover.

And if Master <hi>Prynne</hi> can prove, that those uncleane persons who were excluded from the Sanctuary, were not excluded from the Passeover, let him try it. That this thing may be yet better understood, let us observe with <hi>Tostatus in Levit.</hi> 22. <hi>Quest.</hi> 7. a threefold separation of the uncleane under the Law: some were separate onely from the Sanctuary and the holy things; for he that had but touched a man or a woman, who had an issue, or had touched the Bed, Clothes, or any thing else, which had been under him or her, was not permitted to come unto the Tabernacle, till he was cleansed <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. Others were separated both from the holy things, and from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or society of their Neighbours, yet not cast out of the camp: for this he gives the case of women having an issue of blood, who were put apart seven dayes <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. and for the same space a woman after the birth of a male Child, was uncleane, so farre as to be kept apart from human society, but she did continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane three and thirty dayes longer, as to the Sanctuary and hallowed things, during which space of the three and thirty dayes, she was not separated from company and society, as in the first seven dayes, onely she was forbidden to touch any hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thing, or to come into the Sanctuary. There was a third sort separated not onely from the Sanctuary, and from humane society, but also cast out of the camp, which was the case of Lepers. I conclude, all uncleane persons whatsoever were excluded from the Tabernacle <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. 31. and from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the flesh of the Sacrifices <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 20. 21.

not for unclean persons their being in the camp, but for their coming to the Tabernacle, or for their eating of the holy things; and accordingly it is said 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 19. that <hi>Ichojada set the Porters at the Gates of the house of the Lord, that none which was uncleane in any thing should enter in.</hi> But we never read that none which was uncleane in any thing, was permitted to enter in at the Gates of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or to converse among the people.</item>

               <p>The fourth and fifth Answers which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi> gives that there is no such warrant for keeping back scandalous persons from the Lords Table, as there was for keeping back the uncleane from the Passeover; and that suspension for legall uncleannesse: proves not suspension for morall uncleannesse, These I say doe but <hi>petere principium,</hi> and therefore to be passedover, because he takes for granted what is in controversie.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore proceed to that which he addeth in the next place, in answer to an argument of mine in my controversall fast Sermon, (as he miscalleth it) The argument as I did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, was this. Those scandalous sinners that were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to offer a trespasse offering (which was reconciling or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance) without confession of sinne, and Declaration of their Repentance for the same, were much lesse admitted to the Passeover (which was a sealing Ordinance) without confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of known and scandalous sins, if they had committed any such. But circumcised persons, if they were scandalous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, were not admitted to offer a trespasse offering (which was a reconciling Ordinance) without confession of sinne and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of their Repentance for the same <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 5. 6. <hi>Ergo</hi>

Because contradicted (as he thinks) by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. which is a contrarious argument, and I shall answer it in the proper place. 2. He saith that examination of the Conscience, Repentance, and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, are no where required of such as did eate the Passeover, it being onely a commemoration of Gods mercy in passing over the Israelites first borne, when he slew the Egyptians: but there being no remission without confession, it was necessary that those who came to offer a trespasse-offering for some particular sinnes, should confesse those very sinnes, yet not to the Priest, but to God alone.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If examination of the Conscience, Repentance, and confession, were not required in those that did eate the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and if there might be a worthy eating of it without this (as he plainly intimateth when he saith that <hi>this is no where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Scripture, of such as did eat the Passeover, though all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and necessaries for the worthy eating of it, he most punctually enumerated</hi>) And if the Passeover was <hi>but onely a commemoration of Gods infinite mercy in passing over the Israelites first borne,</hi> as he saith, (which was but a temporall mercy) Then he must needs say, either that in the Sacrament of the Passeover, or confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, increase of grace, nor spirituall mercy was given, or that in that Sacrament this grace (yea, by his Principles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and regeneration it selfe) was conferred <hi>ex opere operato.</hi> And he must either say the like of the Lords Supper, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hold that the Sacraments of the new Testament differ from those of the old, specifically; and that the Passeover did not seale the same covenant of grace for the substance, which is now sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Lords Supper.</item>
                  <item>2 What was the meaning of the bitter Herbs, with which the Passeover was commanded to be eaten? Were not the people of God thereby taught the necessity of Repentance in that very action? And what means it that at <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Passeover, the people are called to turne againe unto the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 6. that the Priests and the Levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. &amp; offered Peace-offerings <hi>made confession to the Lord God of their fathers,</hi> vers. 22. where I understand confession of sinne, according to the Law, which appointed confession

of sinne to be made with the Peace offerings, which confession was signified by laying hands upon the head of the offering <hi>Lev.</hi> 3. 2. 8. 13. compared with <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. and so we find Repentance joyned with peace offerings. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 20. 26. finally read we not of the peoples preparing of their heart to seeke God at the Passeover 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30. 19. which as it could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance and examination of their consciences, so <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> mentioneth it, as that without which the peoples eating of the Passeover, could not have been in any wise accepted.</item>
                  <item>3. That it was not a private confession to God alone, but a publike penitentiall confession in the Temple, and before the Priests, I have before <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. made it to appear both out of the Text, and out of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew.</hi> This I adde here. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the sin was made in the place of offering the trespasse offering, before the Priest, at the laying on of hands between the horns of the beast, therefore it was not made in secret to God onely: which doth further appear, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is this: <hi>That every particular communicant before he comes to receive the Sacrament, makes a publike confession of his sinnes to God with the rest of the congregation, and in words at least, voweth newnesse of life for the future, there being no communicant that ever I heard of</hi> (saith he) <hi>so desperatly wicked and atheisticall, as not to professe heartily sorrow for all his forepast sinnes, or to avow impenitent continuance in them when he came to the Lords Table.</hi> Behold, what a latitude? If the vilest sinner practically perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in a scandalous sinne, shall but joyne with, and not gainsay the publique confession of the whole congregation (wherein the best men doe and ought to joyne) and in words promise newnesse of life (and who will not promise to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live better?) nay if he have but so much wit, as not to professe or avow impenitency: then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi> alloweth his admission to the Sacrament.

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> A Confutation of the strongest arguments of <hi>Erastus,</hi> namely, those drawn from the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AMong <hi>Erastus</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Confirm. Thes. lib 1. cap. 3. &amp; 4.</note> his arguments against Excommunication, three of them, namely, the first, the seventh, and the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, are all one for the substance, the strength of them lying in this supposition, that the Scripture doth not restraine, nor keep off any from the Sacrifices nor any other Sacraments (as he speaketh) of the old Testament, because of a wicked or scandalous conversation: but contrariwise commandeth that all the males both Jewes and forreiners, being circumcised, and not being legally uncleane, nor in a journey, should compear thrice in the yeere before the Lord at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to keepe the three solemn feasts, of the Passeover, Weeks, and Tabernacles. Now (saith he) Christ hath not in this thing destroyed nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> nor hath he made the rule straiter now then it was then: but as then all circumcised, so now all baptized persons must be acknowledged for Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, having a right to partake of Church priviledges: and as then there was no discipline or punishment for the flagitious and wicked, except by the hand of the Magistrate; so ought it to be in like manner in the Christian Church. This argument he trusteth very much unto. And because it is the common opinion, that the excluding and separating of the uncleane under the Law, did signifie the excluding of scandalous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from communion with the Church, he spendeth <note n="l" place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 1.</note> a long chapter against that opinion, and laboureth to make it appeare that the legall uncleannesse did signifie the corruption of our nature and unbeliefe; that exclusion from the Temple did signifie exclusion from the heavenly Paradice; and that the cleansing and reception into the Temple, did tipyfie the cleansing of our souls, and the turning of us to God by the blood of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now here I shall make such animadversions, as shall not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95406:85"/>
onely enervate the strength which these arguments may seem to have against Church censures: but also afford some strong reasonings against <hi>Erastus,</hi> from those very grounds rightly apprehended, from which (upon misapprehensions) he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth against the excluding of scandalous sinners. <hi>First,</hi> it is certaine that for divers sinnes against the morall Law, the sinners were appointed not onely to bring their Trespasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, but to confesse the sinne which they had committed, and to declare their repentance for the same, and till this was done, the Trespasse-offering was not accepted. Let us but have the like, that is a confession of the sinne, and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of repentance, and then men shall not be excluded for scandals formerly given. <note n="m" place="margin">Pag. 106, 107, 148, 149.</note> 
                  <hi>Erastus</hi> himselfe acknowledgeth that in this point of the confession of sinne, the analogy must hold betwixt the old and new Testament; onely he pleadeth, that the very act, the very desiring of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is really a confession that he is a sinner who desireth it: and that, much more, it may suffice, if sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being asked by the Minister, confesse themselves to be sinners, and that they have not perfectly kept the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God. But all this, say I, can not satisfie the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from that confession of sinne under the Law. For, 1. It was not a confession <hi>ipso facto,</hi> by the bringing of the Trespasse-offerings, but by word of mouth, and <note n="n" place="margin">See <hi>Ainsworth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> annot. on Num. 5. 7.</note> thus it hath been expounded by the Hebrew Doctors. <hi>The owners of siune and Trespasse-offerings, when they bring their oblations for their ignorant or for their presumptuous sinnes, atonement is not made for them by their oblation, untill they have made repentance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession by word of mouth.</hi> 2. It was not a generall confession that one is a sinner, and hath not perfectly kept the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, (for who did ever refuse to make such a confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that were in their right wits? that limitation is as good as nothing, when we speake of the suspending of any from the Lords Table.) But it was a confession of the particular indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall sinne, which had been committed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>And it shall be when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confesse that he hath sinned in that thing.</hi> Marke, <hi>in that thing.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95406:86"/>
Law is to be understood of all like sinnes and trespasses, that is, that other sinnes which were expiated by Sacrifice, were first to be confessed. All this maketh against <hi>Erastus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, whereas he saith <note n="p" place="margin">Pag. 106. 113.</note> that this confession or declaration of repentance for sinne, in the old Testament, had place onely in those sinnes for which the Law appointed no particular pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments: and that there was no confession imposed where the Magistrate was to punish the crime: This with a great deale of boldnesse and considence (as his manner is) he doth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: Intending thereby (it seems) to exempt from all manner of Church-discipline whatsoever is punishable by the civill Magistrate, as adultery, perjury, and the like. But that which he affirmeth so strongly, is manifestly contrary to the expresse Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. from vers. 1. to vers. 8. where wilfull lying, and perjury, robbing and violence, fraud and couzenage, all these were to be confessed and expiated by Sacrifice; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they were also to be severely punished by the civill Magistrate. Nay, in that very place it is commanded that what had been violently taken away, or deceitfully gotten, or frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently detained, should be restored, and moreover a fifth part added thereto, for a mulct, yet this did not exempt the sinner from making confession. So <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. for one and the same offence the Law enjoyneth both that confession be made and expiation; and moreover that recompence be made to the party injured or to his kinsman. Yea the Law, <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 6, 7. speaketh universally; <hi>When a man or woman shall commit any sinne that men commit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then they shall confesse their sinne which they have done.</hi> Which made the Hebrews extend this Law to criminall and capitall cases, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> upon the place noteth out of these words of <hi>Maimony. Likewise, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death by the Magistrates, or condemned to stripes; no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement is made for them by their death, or by their stripes, untill they have repented and confessed. And so he that hurteth his neighbour, or doth him dammage, though he payeth him what ever he oweth him, atonement is not made for him till he confesse.</hi> Therfore <hi>Erastus</hi> is still a double loser in arguing from the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> It proves not what he would, and it doth prove what he would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:95406:86"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> men were kept from the Sanctuary of the Lord, not onely for ceremoniall, but for morall uncleannesse, I meane for publique and scandalous sinnes against the morall Law. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44. 7, 9. God was offended when such proselytes were brought into his Sanctuary, as were either uncircumcised in flesh, or uncircumcised in heart; that is, whose practise or conversation did declare them to be uncircumcised in heart: else the Lord would not have challenged those who brought such proselytes into his Sanctuary, if their uncircumcision of heart had not been externally manifested, so that it might be perceived by his people; according to that <hi>Psalm</hi> 36. 1. <hi>The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no feare of God before his eyes.</hi> To the same purpose we read <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 21. not that all proselytes, nor all uncircumcised, but onely <hi>all such as had seperate themselves from the filthinesse of the Heathen of the Land, to seeke the Lord God of Israel,</hi> did eate of the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Moreover we may argue by a necessary consequence from Scripture. The ceremoniall uncleannesse was a cause of exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Sanctuary, and from the holy things. Therefore much more morall uncleannesse. It was more sinfull in its selfe, and more abominable in Gods sight for those who did steale, murder, commit adultery, sweare falsely, and burne Incense to <hi>Baal,</hi> to come and tread in the Courts of the house of the Lord, and to offer Sacrisices there, as if Gods house had been a denne of robbers, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 7. 9, 10, 11. This I say was more abominable to God then if he that had touched a dead body, or had come into the tent where a man died, should have come unto the Tabernacle in his legall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse. Therefore when Christ casteth out the buyers and sellers out of the Temple, it is not for ceremoniall but morall uncleannesse, and he applieth to them the words of <hi>Ieremiah, Ye have made it a denne of theeves, Matth.</hi> 21. 13. with <hi>Ierem.</hi> 7. 11. And as it was more sinfull to the person, and more hatefull to God, so it was more hurtfull to the soules of others, who were in greater danger of infection from the morall, then from the ceremoniall uncleannesse. This <note n="q" place="margin">Pag. 145.

                  <hi>Erastus</hi> denieth indeed, but his expression is unsavoury and unholy, which I am ashamed to repeat. Sure the Apostle speaketh farre othewise <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.

I meane a root of bitternesse not plucked up, a prophane person not censured, doth defile others, as well as himselfe. Both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> have told us, that scandalous persons are spots and blemishes in the communion of Saints, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Iude</hi> vers. 12. So that as <hi>Erastus</hi> granteth, that one legally uncleane could make others legally uncleane among whom he came, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was kept off from fellowship and company with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Gods people: It must likewise be granted, that scandalous persons are to be suspended from the sacred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Christian Church, because if they should be admitted, the Church should be thereby sinfully defiled. For if the saying <hi>God speed</hi> to a false teacher make us partakers of his evill deeds 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. how much more doth the admitting of such or the like scandalous sinners to the Lords Table make (I say not all who communicate then and there, but) all who consent to their admission, to be partakers of their evill deeds.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> whereas <note n="r" place="margin">Pag. 140.

                  <hi>Erastus</hi> holdeth that the exclusion of the uncleane under the Law, did onely typyfie something which is to come to passe in the life to come, that is, the shutting forth of sinners from the Heavenly Paradice, if they be not washed from their silthynesse by the blood of Jesus Christ: and therefore ought not to be unto us any argument for the exclusion of scandalous sinners. I answer, If the shutting out from Heaven was the onely thing signified, and if there be a fit analogy or proportion between the Type and the thing typified, then 1. one may be in Heaven and cast out againe, and in and out againe, as under the Law one might be many times admitted to the Temple and shut out againe. 2. It would also follow, that there is some other exclusion grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the exclusion from Heaven, as under the Law there was a greater exclusion than the exclusion from the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and that was to be cast out from the company and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95406:87"/>
of Gods people: <note n="s" place="margin">Tostatus in Levit. 12. quast. 21.</note> for though every uncleannesse which did exclude one from the company of the Israelites, did also exclude him from the Sanctuary; yet every uncleannesse which did exclude one from the Sanctuary, did not exclude him from the company of the Israelites. Even as now among us, suspension from the Lords Table is not the greatest and worst exclusion, but there is another greater then that. Thus you see <hi>Erastus</hi> could not make his Type agree with his Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type. Whence it doth further appeare that the exclusion of the uncleane under the Law, did teach and hold forth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in a politicall sence, touching the communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the Church in this life. Whatsoever it might signifie more, I will not now dispute, but this it did signifie. And this I shall so farre make good, that I shall at once both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <hi>Erastus,</hi> and propound a strong argument for the keeping off from the holy things those that are morally aud scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously encleane. <hi>First,</hi> let it be remembered that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already from <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 15, 16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Iude</hi> vers. 12. that the people of God are defiled by communion and fellowship with scandalous sinners. In the <hi>second</hi> place consider that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 1. <hi>Put on thy beautifull garments, O Jesusalem, the holy City: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised aud the uncleane.</hi> That whole Chapter is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy concerning the condition of the Church in the New Testament, as is evident by six parallels at least. Vers. 5. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24. Vers. 7. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. Vers. 10. with <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 6. the beginning of Vers. 11. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4. the following part of Vers. 11. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. Vers. 15. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 21. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it the Church invisible, but the Church visible, for Vers. 15. is applied to the calling of the Gentiles <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 21. and Vers. 11. to the Churches open separation from <hi>Babylon, Revel.</hi> 18. 4. It is also the Church ministeriall Vers. 7, 8, 11. <hi>How beautifull upon the mountaines are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, &amp;c. Thy watchmen shall lift up the voyce, &amp;c. Be ye cleane that beare the vessels of the Lord.</hi> It remaines to consider what is meant by the <hi>uncleane,</hi> Vers. 1. it cannot be meant of legall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse (the ceremoniall Law being abolished) nor of the hid uncleannesse of close hypocrites (for in that sence it is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95406:88"/>
onely the priviledge of the Church triumphant, that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing, nor no hypocrite shall enter there.) It must therefore be meant of such as are visibly or scandalously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. And when it is said, <hi>there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised, and the uncleane,</hi> it must be understood <hi>respective,</hi> the uncircumcised, signifying such as are not fit to be at all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members: the uncleane signifying such as are not fit to have communion in the holy things: for so these two were distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished under the Law. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is another place which (to me) puts it out of controversie, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6: 14, 15, 16, 17. Where the Apostle exhorteth believers to avoyd all intime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation or fellowship with unbelievers, by marrying with them, by going to the Idoll Temples, or the like; he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with a manifest allusion to the legall ceremony, <hi>Be ye sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and touch not the uncleane thing,</hi> or <hi>the uncleane things</hi> as the Syriacke hath it. <hi>And what agreement hath the Temple of God with idols,</hi> Vers. 16. Where the Syriack readeth thus: <hi>And what agreement hath the Temple of God with the temple of Divels?</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, would the Apostle say, that as under the Law, the touching or eating of uncleane things made those that touched them, or did eate of them to be uncleane; so doth your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with unbelievers, or your eating in their Idoll tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples defile you. And as then those that had touched any unclean thing were not received into the Sanctuary, so I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you into fellowship with me and my people, saith the Lord, except you be separate from the sonnes of Belial. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>touch not the uncleane thing, and I will receive you:</hi> Which is not spoken of receiving us into Heaven, but of receiving us into the Tabernacle of God in this life, as is manifest by <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 11, 12. the place cited by the Apostle in the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding. <hi>And I will set my Tabernacle among you, and my soule shall not abhorre you. And I will walke among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</hi> And in this manner, God saith he will not receive us, except we avoid fellowship with the workers of iniquity, especially in holy things.</p>
               <p>I shall adde <hi>fourthly,</hi> for further cleering of this point in hand, <hi>Peters</hi> vision, and the interpretation thereof <hi>Act</hi> 10. &amp; 11. a passage cited by <hi>Erastus</hi> pag. 138, 139. while he is proving,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95406:88"/>
that the thing signified by the legall uncleannesse, was onely the corruption and Infidelity of nature which excludeth a sinner from heaven. The place is so farre from proving what he would, that it proveth the contrary; for it speaketh plainly of that uncleannesse which excludeth men from fellow-ship with the Saints in this life; from companying together, from eating together. And when <hi>Peter</hi> expoundeth the vision, he saith, <hi>ye know how that it is an unlawfull thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or to come unto one of another Nation: but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for being a Gentile and not a <hi>Iew. Act.</hi> 10. 28. you see, the not eating nor touching of unclean Beasts, Birds, and creeping things (such as <hi>Peter</hi> saw in the vision) was understood by the people of God, as forbidding their association or fellowship in this world with Heathens, or irreligious persons, and such as walked not according to the Law. And in this sence the Law was understood, not onely by <hi>Peter,</hi> but generally by the Jews <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>Nay fifthly, the legall uncleannesse, in the sence of the Jewes, did signifie not onely such things as did exclude others from fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ship with them, but such as did exclude the Jewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the holy things. Therefore it is said <hi>Io.</hi> 18. 28. <hi>they themselves went not into the Judgement hall, lest they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed: but that they might eat the Passeover:</hi> Intimating that if they had gone into the house of an uncircumcised man, or had upon such a day gone into the Judgement Hall about a litigious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they had been unclean, and so might not eat the Passeover. Whether it were the coming into the house of <hi>Pilate,</hi> he being a man uncircumcised; or <note n="t" place="margin">

By <hi>Erastus</hi> his principles no man should have been cut off, if he had pleaded himself not to be uncleane; and how many would doe so, if that could save them from being cut off? Is it not also plaine from <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. 15. 30. 31. that both men and women who were uncleane by their issues, (not by Leprosie) were to bring an offering to the Priest for their cleansing, otherwise were not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cleane, but lookt upon as defilers of the Tabernacle in their uncleannesse, whatever they might thinke of themselves. So women that were unclean after Child-Birth, had not power to pronounce themselves cleane, and were not free to come to the Sanctuary when they pleased, but they were first to bring a sinne offering, and the Priest was to make atonement for them <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. 6. 7. 8. There was a certaine number of dayes appointed for the cleansing, both of women after Child-Birth, and of men who had an issue, yea, when the dayes of the cleansing were full-filled, they were not free to come unto the Tabernacle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they brought their offering for atonement. <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. 6. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 13. 14. 15. <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew <hi>de vita Mosis lib.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 531. tells us there was a certaine definit time, till the expiring whereof, those that were uncleane by a dead body, were excluded from the Temple. <hi>Iosephus antiq. Iud. lib.</hi> 3. cap. 10. records the like, not onely of Lepers, but of those that had an issue, or were defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the dead, that till the set time was fulfilled, all these were kept back from the congregration.</p>
               <p>The other thing which <hi>Erastus</hi> saith, that it was left free to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95406:89"/>
the sinner to expiate his sinne when he pleased, doth no better agree with the Word. for it was commanded that upon the very knowledge of the sinne, the trespasse offering should be brought, and the sinne confessed <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 14. 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 3. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, whereas <hi>Erastus</hi> pag. 105. urgeth the universall Law, by which all are commanded to keep the Passeover except the uncleane, and those in a journey, therefore all others (how flagitious or scandalous soever in their lives) were bound to keep it; I answer. Who knows not, that many universalls in Scripture are to be restricted, and not to be understood as the words at first sound? as <hi>Io.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine,</hi> that is every Master of a feast <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 15. <hi>doth not each one of you on the Sabbath lose his Oxe or his Asse;</hi> that is each one that hath an Oxe or an Asse; <hi>Io.</hi> 10. 8. <hi>all that ever came before me were Theeves and Robbers,</hi> meaning whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him did make himself the true doore, by which the sheep must enter in. So <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2. 28. <hi>I will poure out my spirit upon all flesh,</hi> yet not upon all and every one, but upon those onely whom he receiveth in Covenant. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him</hi> (the Beast) <hi>whose names are not written in the Booke of life;</hi> yet there have been many reprobates who neither worshipped the Pope nor knew him: but it is meant of all under the power of the Beast. So when all are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep the Passeover, it must be understood of all sit persons, and such as were not to be excepted. You will say the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth none, but the unclean, and those in a journey, therefore all others not excepted were to keep it; for where an exception is made from an universall Rule, that Rule is the more sure and certaine concerning all other particulars not excepted. To that I answer, <hi>Erastus</hi> himself addeth another exception, and that is, of the sick who could not be present. The Hebrewes make divers other exceptions, for they say, <hi>Women and Servants are not bound to appear: but all men are bound except the deaf, and the Dumb, and the Foole, and the little-Child and the Blinde, and the Lame, and the defiled, and the uncircumcised; and the old man, and the sick, and the tender and weake which are not able to goe up on their Feet.

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Fourteen Arguments, to prove that scandalous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Offenders against the morall Law (though circumcised and not being legally uncleane) were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Passeover.</head>
               <p>THere is so much weight laid, both by <hi>Erastus</hi> himself, and by Master <hi>Prynne,</hi> upon the universall Law commanding all that were circumcised to eat the Passeover, except such as were legally uncleane, or were in a journey: that I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, once for all, to demonstrate against them, that men were excluded from the Passeover, for scandalous and enormous Trespasses against the morall Law, as well as for legall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Peradventure it will seeme to some, that I undertake to prove a paradox, and to walke in an untrodden or obscure Path. Yet my Arguments are such, as I trust shall weigh much with intelligent men.</p>
               <p>The first Argument shall be this. (which is hinted by <hi>Ursinus</hi> and <hi>Pareus Explic. catechit. Quest.</hi> 85. <hi>art.</hi> 2.) Whosoever by Gods appointment were excluded from the priviledges of Church Members, and not to be reckoned among the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Israel, those were by Gods appointment excluded from the Passeover. But whosoever committed any scandalous sinne presumptuously, or with an high hand, were by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment excluded from the priviledges of Church Members and not to be reckoned among the Congregation of Israel. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Proposition hath this manifest reason for it. Those <hi>all</hi> who were commanded to eat the Passeover, cannot be understood to be of a larger extent then the Church of Israel: Those there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who were not to be acknowledged or used as Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Members, were by Gods appointment excluded from the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. The Assumption is proved from <hi>Numb</hi> 15. 30. 31. <hi>But the soule that doth ought presumptuously (whether he be born in the land, or a stranger) the same reproacheth the Lord, and that soule shall</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:95406:91"/>
                  <hi>be cut off from among his people, Because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken his commandement, that soule shall utterly be cut off: his iniquity shall be upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The presumption here spoken of, is not onely the presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart (saith <hi>Cajetan</hi>) of which God onely is Judge, but a presumption manifested in word or work, which he conceives to be intimated by the Hebrew phrase, <hi>with an high hand. Grotius</hi> understands one that either denyes that there is a God, or that the Law was given by God, or after admonition goeth on in his trespasse. But sure he mistakes the punishment, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands to be extrajudiciall, and that he who finds one thus sinning presumptuously, may kill him <hi>ex jure Zelotarum,</hi> as <hi>Phinehes</hi> did kill <hi>Zi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>i</hi> and <hi>Cosbi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have spoken before of the cutting off, which I will not here resume. Onely this, such presumptuous and contumacious sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were not to be reckoned among the people of God, nor to enjoy the priviledge of Church Members, therefore not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Passeover.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Iosephus de bello Iud. lib.</hi> 7. cap. 17. speaking of such as were permitted to eat the Passeover, in the time of <hi>Cesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> doth thus designe them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>being all of them pure and holy,</hi> not onely pure from legall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, but such as were also esteemed holy. But moreover, it is clear from <hi>Io.</hi> 18. 28, <hi>they themselves</hi> (the Jewes) <hi>went not into the Judgement Hall lest they should be defiled: but that they might eat the Passeover:</hi> that the Jewes did so understand the Law, that morall as well as ceremoniall uncleannesse, did render them uncapable of the Passeover: for they had no such ceremoniall Law, that they who come into the Judgement Hall, should be legally or ceremonially uncleane: yet this had disabled them from eating the Passeover: for they held litigious or forensicall actions unlawfull upon a holy day as <hi>Capellus,</hi> and <hi>Casaubon</hi> (above cited) doe prove. Such a finfull and scandalous act had kept them back from the Passeover.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we consult the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphrase upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 43. it saith thus. <hi>Every Sonne of Israel, who is an Apostate, shall not eat of it.</hi> And upon the same place Master <hi>Ainsworth</hi> proves out of <hi>Maimonides</hi> that no Apostate nor Idolater was permitted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95406:91"/>
to eat of the Passeover. Yea, some Israelites who were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates, nor idolaters, were for a seandalous action excluded from civill, how much more from Ecclesiasticall fellow-ship? See <hi>Maimon; of Idolatry</hi> cap. 9. Sect. 15. <hi>With an Israelite, who hath made defection to the worship of Idolls, it is forbidden to have traffique or commerce either in his going or returning: with another Israelite going to the Markets and Faires of Heathens, we are onely forbidden to have commerce in his returning.</hi> If it was unlawfull to them, so much as to have civill commerce with an Israelite coming from the Markets of Heathens (fearing lest he had sold some what which was dedicate to Idolatry, as the reason is there given) although he was no Apostate nor Idolater: it is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imaginable, that such a one was freely admitted to the Passeover.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, an Israelite though circumcised, and not legally uncleane, yet if he either turned Idolater, or an Heretick, or an Epicurean, was no longer acknowledged to be in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fellowship or Communion, therefore rendred uncapable of the Passeover. <hi>Is. Abrabanel</hi> in his Book <hi>de capite fidei,</hi> as he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whom they esteemed Apostats or Hereticks <hi>cap.</hi> 12. so he also intimateth that such were excluded from the communion of their Law <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>dub.</hi> 5. none being acknowledged to be <hi>in the Communion of Israel,</hi> who did not beleeve the Articles of faith professed in the Jewish Church <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. yea, he tells us <hi>Cap.</hi> 24. (which the <hi>Talmud</hi> it self saith <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>it. Sanhedrin. cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.) that Hereticall or Epicurean Israelites were lookt upon as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from having portion in the world to come. And as Doctor <hi>Buxtorf</hi> sheweth out of their owne writers, they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Hereticall Israelite to be so abominable, that they did straight and without delay excommunicate him. <hi>Lexic. Chald. Talm. &amp; Rabbin.</hi> pag. 195. How is it then imaginable that they admitted such a one to eat the Passeover? Let us heare <hi>R. Moses Maimonides</hi> himself <hi>de Idololatria</hi> cap. 2. Sect. 8. <hi>An Idolatrous Israelite is as an Heathen in all things which he doth</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So also Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites who are Epicures are not esteemed to be Israelites in any action of theirs</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now they are Epicures who aske counsell from the thoughts of their own mind, being Ignorant of those things we have spoken of, untill having transgressed the chief heads of the Law, they</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:95406:92"/>
                  <hi>offend by contumacy and presumption, and say there is no sinne in this thing. But it is forbidden to speake with them or to answer them; for it is said, come not neer the door of her house</hi> Prov. 5. 8. Therefore the whorish woman that <hi>Solomon speakes of,</hi> was (in the opinion of <hi>Maimonides</hi>) such a one as was not to be esteemed as an Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite, nay nor such as was to be spoken with, much lesse to be admitted to the Passeover. yea, <hi>Maimonides de Idal.</hi> cap. 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. saith yet more. <hi>But those Israelites which forsake their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or become Epicures we are bidden kill them and persecute them even unto hell.</hi> How could they then admit to the passeover those whom they thought themselves obliged to persecute even unto hell?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, those Arguments which prove an exclusion of known prophane persons from the Temple, will also prove an exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of known prophane persons from the Passeover: for none might eat of the Passeover, who might not also come into the Temple. That scandalous prophane persons might not come into the Temple, hath been proved already.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I argue from the lesser to the greater. If men were to be kept back for legall uncleannesse, much more for morall uncleannesse, this being more hatefull to God and more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to men then the other. This just consequence <hi>Grotius an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in</hi> Luk. 6. 22. doth admit. If by the Law saith he, one that was leprous or had a filthy scab, was separated from mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, lest he should infect others, it was no ill consequence. that (if no heavier thing) this at least should be imposed on flagitious &amp; wicked persons, who did by the contagion of their sinfull example hurt others, &amp; bring a reproach upon the whole congregation from which the congregation could not be made free, but by some publik detestation of that wickednes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus <hi>Groti:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, the purging out of leven from the Congregation of Israel, was a significant teaching Ceremony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holding forth this duty, that the Church ought to put away wicked persons from among them; for so doth the Apostle expound it 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. vers. 6. 7. <hi>Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lumpe? purge out therefore the old leaven.</hi> Which relateth not onely to the purging of their own hearts, but to the purging of the Church, and the putting away of that wicked person, this being the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95406:92"/>
scope of the whole Chapter. Now the morall signification of that ceremony of purging out the leaven, did concerne the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> as well as the Christian Church; even as the divers washings under the Law did teach and hold forth the duty of sanctification and purity to the people of God at that time, as well as typifie the sanctification of the Christian Church.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, though the hallowed bread might in case of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity be lawfully given to <hi>David</hi> and his men, (the <hi>Ceremonials</hi> of the first Table yeelding to the <hi>Substantials</hi> of the second) yet <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Priest would not adventure to give it, till he understood that the young men had then kept themselves at least from women, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 4, 5, 6. this being a part of that san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification which was required in those who did partake of holy things, not onely among the Hebrews, but among other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> noteth upon the place, and upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 15. Now the Shew-bread, or the twelve loaves which did shew or present the people to God, can not be supposed to be holier then the Paschall Lambe which did shew or present Christ to the people, and was a Sacrament or Seale of the covenant of grace. <hi>David</hi> also and his men in that danger of their lives had as good right to eate the Shew-bread, as any Israelite could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to for his eating the Passeover: yea that was a substantiall duty of the second Table, which Christ himselfe justifieth: this was a ceremoniall duty of the first Table, and grounded on a positive law. This therefore doth afford me an argument with manifold advantages. For if the Shew-bread might not be given to <hi>David</hi> and his men in their extreame necessity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they had for a certaine space before abstained from the use of their wives, otherwise lawfull: how much lesse might the Passeover be given as an holy Ordinance (which did not concern the saving of mens lives in extreame necessity) to scandalous persons living in known whordome and adultery?</p>
               <p>Ninthly, I argue from that place, <hi>Ezech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 22. 26. <hi>Her Priests have violated my law and have prophaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and prophane.</hi> Will any man say, that they were to put a difference between the holy and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95406:93"/>
prophane in other Ordinances, and not in the Passeover? and why not in the Passeover, as well as in other Ordinances? If such difference was to be put in the Passeover, then how shall one imagine that no man was kept backe from the Passeover because of known prophanesse or morall uncleannesse? for what difference was put between the holy and prophane, when the prophane were received as well as the holy? M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Coleman</hi> held that this Text reacheth not to the keeping pure of the Ordinances by any act of government, but onely that the Priests did prophane the holy things in their owne practice, by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their uncleannesse, and also in their ministery because they taught not the children of <hi>Israel</hi> to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the cleane and the uncleane. <hi>Maledicis</hi> pag. 11. But the Text gives not the least ground to restraine this fault of the Priests here reproved, either to their personall actions, or to their doctrinall ministery. Nay the Text will reach to an act of government neglected; for the word here used to expresse the <hi>distinguishing</hi> or <hi>putting of a difference</hi> between the holy and prophane is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is often used in Scripture to expresse an act of government or authority, whereby one person is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated or distinguished from another person, or one thing from another thing, as <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 24. <hi>Then I separated twelve of the chiefe of the Priests, &amp;c. Ezra</hi> 10. 8. <hi>all his substance should be forfeited, and himselfe separated from the congregation.</hi> Here it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth such a separation, as was a publique censure: why not also <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22. 26? The same word is used in the story of the division of the Land by <hi>Ioshua, Iosh.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>And the separate Cities for the children of Ephraim.</hi> It is used also to expresse Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of light from darknesse, <hi>Genes.</hi> 1. 4. also his separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Israel</hi> from all other Nations, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 24. And whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Coleman</hi> did take hold of the following words in that place of <hi>Ezechiel, neither have they shewed difference between the uncleane and the cleane,</hi> as being meerly doctrinall. First, (if it were so) how will it appeare that these words are exegeticall to the former, and that the putting of difference between the holy and prophane, mentioned in the former words, was onely meant of shewing the difference doctrinally?
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95406:93"/>

Hence was it that the word Heathen was used for an irreligious or wicked man, as is observed by <hi>Mathias Martinius in lexic. philol. pag.</hi> 717. 718. and as a discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating name from believers; so <hi>Zonaras in Cone.

How then can it be supposed, that those who were esteemed as heathens, were admitted to all Church priviledges, as well as the best Israelites?</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, that which was among the Jewes a sufficient cause to deny circumcision to him who desired to be admitted and received into the Jewish Church as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Ger ben berith, a proselyte, sonne of the covenant,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Ger tsedeck, a proselyte of righteousnesse,</hi> was also a sufficient cause to deny the Passeover to a proselyte who desired to eate it. Even as now that for which we may and ought to refuse Baptisme to one that desireth it, must needs be also a cause and reason to refuse the Lords Supper to him that desireth to receive it; for he that is not fit to be baptized, is much lesse fit to receive the Lords Supper. But prophanesse or a scandalous conversation was among the Jewes a sufficient cause and reason to refuse Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision. Yea as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Buxtorf</hi> tels us in <hi>Lexic. Chald. Talm. &amp; Rabbin. pag.</hi> 408. before the Jewes would circumcise or baptize a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte (for after circumcision they did baptize him) they did first examine him exactly, and prove him narrowly, whether he desired to be a proselyte, from covetousnesse, ambition, feare, the love of an Israelitish virgin, or the like sinister end. If upon examination it did appeare that he was not moved by any worldly consideration, but by affection to Religion and the glory of God, then they proceeded to set before his eyes the strictnesse of the law, and how strait and narrow a path he must walke in, telling him also of the persecutions and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of <hi>Israel.</hi> If after all this triall they found him stedfast in his desires and resolutions, then they received him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95406:94"/>
first instructed in the Articles of their faith, and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Law. How much lesse would they have circumcised a scandalous person, being so farre from any hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full signes of sincerity, that he had the blacke markes of a worker of iniquity? And if they would not receive such a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous flagitious person to circumcision, how could they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such a one (being circumcised) to the Passeover?</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, compare <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 21. with <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 16, 17. First it is marked <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 21. that such proselytes did eate the Passeover with the children of <hi>Israel, as had separated themselves unto them from the silthinesse of the Heathen of the Land, to seeke the Lord God of Israel.</hi> If those who did eate were thus qualified, it is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely intimated, that those who were not thus qualified did not eate. And if no proselyte who did not separate himselfe from the filthinesse of the Heathen, was allowed to eat the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, then muchlesse was an Israelite who did not separate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the silthynesse of the Heathen, allowed to eat it. I like well <hi>Beda</hi> his observation upon <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 16, 17. <hi>Israel</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from unlawfull marriages, and the strange wives put away; and this worke was ended against the beginning of the first moneth, to the intent that none defiled with unlawfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages might eate the Passeover, <hi>Ut ante initium mensis primi consummarentur omnes qui prophano erant connubio maculati, id est a tali scelere purgarentur, quatenus ipsum mensem primum in quo erat pascha faciendum, mundi intrarent, mundi paschalia festa peragerent &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, I argue from the signification of the legall or ceremoniall uncleannesse, and from that which was signified by the exclusion of those that were legally uncleane. Without all controversie the keeping backe of such, was a significant cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. For all the legall ceremonies concerning cleannesse or uncleannesse were teaching ceremonies, and are therefore called <hi>Doctrines, Matth.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 22. 2. What was taught and signified thereby, I have before shewed, namely, that prophane ones be not admitted to fellowship with Gods people in their holy things. Yea, was not prophannesse and open wickednesse more hatefull to God than legall uncleannesse? yes saith <hi>Erastus</hi> pag. 144. because God appointed greater punishments for the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95406:95"/>
former then for the latter: the greater crimes were punished by fire and sword, stoning, hanging; the smaller by mulcts, and stripes. But yet (say I) by his grounds the legall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was more hatefull to God than prophanesse and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in reference to fellowship in the holy things, (for that is the point) He holds that the most flagitious and prophane were commanded of God to eate the Passeover, and yet those that were onely Iegally uncleane were forbidden: though the Scripture say, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. &amp; 21. 27. that the Sacrifice of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is abomination to the Lord, and the oblations of those whose hands were full of blood, his soule hated, and he could not away with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13, 14. and when they came to his house, he told them, <hi>When ye come to appeare before me, who hath requird this at your hands, to tread my courts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall not need to insist here, upon the excluding of bond servants, and those that were bought with money, from the Passeover, and the admitting onely of those that were free. Which <note n="z" place="margin">Lavater hom. 23. in Ezram.</note> some of the <hi>Zurik</hi> Divines themselves have interpreted to signifie the exclusion of those who are servants of sinne, and of those who seeke onely the things of the earth. But there is one argument more (it shall be the last) which doth convince me, that others besides the uncircumcised, and they that were legally uncleane, even those that had scandalously transgressed the morall Law, were excluded from the Passeover. The ground of my argument is that whereof I have spoken before, the law for confession of sinne and declaration of repentance; without which the Trespasse-offering was not accepted <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 5, 6. which Law is extended to every knowne sinne that was to be expiated by Sacrifice, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 6, 7. <hi>When a man or woman shall commit any sinne that men commit, to doe a trespasse against the Lord</hi> (the 70 read, <hi>and despising he despise;</hi> to note rebellion or co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>macy) <hi>and that person be guilty</hi> (that is be found guilty, or when the sinne shall be known, so the phrase of being guilty is explained, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 13, 14.) <hi>Then they shall confesse their sinne which they have done.</hi> After which followes restitution to the party wronged, and atonement made by the Priest. Whence I argue thus. If the scandalous persons were not admited to the Trespasse offering (which was a reconciling Ordinance) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95406:95"/>
confession of their sinne, which was knowne to have been committed by them, much lesse were they admitted to the Passeover (which was a sealing Ordinance) without such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their sinne. But scandalous persons were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Trespasse-offering, (which was a reconciling Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance) without confession of their sinne which was known to have been committed by them. Therefore much lesse were they admitted to the Passeover, (which was a sealing Ordinance) without such comession. This argument I did before Chap. 10. vindicate from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne.</hi> I will here further strengthen it, and vindicate it from another exception, which peradventure will be made against it. The proposition is certaine: for some are called to make their peace with God, who can not have any assurance sealed unto them, that their peace is made with God; But if God will not be reconciled, he will farre lesse seale re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. <hi>There is no peace to the wicked</hi> saith God, how much lesse can their peace be sealed to them? The assumption is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from the Scriptures last cited. And if any shall say that the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. is meant onely of private sinnes, and those of ignorance, which so soon as they come to knowledge, are to be confessed: I answer. 1. Its more then can be proved, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly private sinnes and those of ignorance are there meant of. Of this I have spoken elsewhere. But be it so. If some private sinnes, yea sinnes of ignorance were to be publiquely confessed when they were known, how much more were publique and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sins to be publiquely confessed? 2. The Hebrews understand the Law of confession to be extended to all sinnes whatsoever that were expiated by Sacrifice, and that before atonement could be made, the sinner must make confession and say, <hi>O God I have sinned, and done perversely, I have trespassed before thee, and have done thus and thus: and lo I repent and am ashamed of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and I will never doe this thing againe.</hi> 3. In all Sacrifices for atonement or expiation a man laid his hand upon the head of his offering, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 10, 15, 19. This laying on of hands was the rite used in confession of sinne, whereby a man did professe that he was worthy to be destroyed for his sinne, and that he laid his sinne upon the beast which was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95406:96"/>
killed in his stead, thereby figuring that upon Christ are laid the iniquities of us all. And with the laying on of hands upon the Sacrifice, confession of sinne was made by word of mouth; which as it is the judgement of <note n="a" place="margin">Tostatus in Levit. 1. quaest. 15. Ainsworth on Levit. 1. 4.</note> Interpreters, so it is easily proved from <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 21. <hi>And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live Goat, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sinnes, putting them upon the head of the Goat.</hi> Whereupon I conclude, that any sinne which was expiated by Sacrifice, whether a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or secret offence, was confessed before it was expiated. 4. The Law <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 6. extends confession to any sinne that men commit, as hath been before observed. 5. <hi>Philippus Gamachaeus</hi> a learned Doctor of <hi>Sorbon, comment. in tertiam partem Thomae, de Paenitentiae Sacramento cap.</hi> 13. doth ingenuously acknowledge, that the foresaid law of <hi>Moses,</hi> concering confession of sinne, is no warrant for their private auricular, and Sacramentall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, <note n="b" place="margin">Deinde nec Judaei confite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If he had perceived the least colour of an argument, from that Mosaicall Law, for the necessity of confessing private sinnes to the Priest, surely he had taken hold of it, and had not quit it.</p>

               <p>MAster <hi>Prynne</hi> in the 15. page of his <hi>Vindication</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to prove, that spirituall pollution by reason of grosse and scandalous sinnes, did not debaree them that were circumcised from the Passeover. <hi>as</hi> Paul (saith he) <hi>expressely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 1. <hi>to</hi> 10. <hi>(an unanswerable Text to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) moreover Brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant that:</hi> (the Text saith <hi>how that) all our Fathers were under the Cloud, and all passed through the Sea, &amp; were all Baptized unto</hi> Moses <hi>in the Cloud &amp; in the Sea; and did all eat the same spirituall meat (to wit the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over and Manna) and did: all drinke of the same spirituall drinke, for they dranke of the Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ. But perhaps all these Communicants were visible Saints, free from any legall pollution, at least not Tainted with any scandalous sinne: The Apostle to take off this evasion, subjoynes, in the very next words. But with many of them, God was not well pleased,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites being once circumcised, were all admitted to eat the Passeover, though some of them were Idolaters, others lusters after evill things; others fornicators, others tempters of Christ; others murmurers against God and</hi> Moses. The same argument he hinteth <hi>pag.</hi> 9. to prove the like under the Gospell. It's one of <hi>Erastus</hi> his argments, <hi>Confirm. Thes. pag.</hi> 118. 119. and as colourable as any other, yet not unanswerable as Master <hi>Prynne</hi> holds.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>For 1. though he saith the Apostle cleerly determines, that those who were tainted with grosse and scandalous sinnes, were admitted to the Passeover; yet I finde nothing of the Passeover, neither in the Text, nor in the sence of any Interpreter which I have looked upon. Nay, it did not so much as fall in the thoughts of <hi>Erastus</hi> himself; for <hi>Beza</hi> having objected to him that he ought to have compared our Sacraments with the purely sacred Feasts in the old Testament rather than with the manna, and with the water of the Rock, which were for corporall nourishment; <hi>Erastus</hi> replyeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the Passeover (which had been his best answer
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95406:97"/>
if he had seen any probability for it,) onely he saith that he compareth our Sacraments with the manna and the water of the Rock, as the Apostle doth before him.</item>
                  <item>2. The Text it self seemeth rather to determine clearly, that the Passeover is not there intended for all the other particulars there mentioned did agree to all the Israelites, men, women, and Children: all these were under the Cloud, and all these passed through the Sea, and all these drank of the water of the Rock; and why shall we not understand, that all these did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so eat of the same spirituall meat, that is of the Manna, not of the Passeover, of which women and Children under 13 yeares of age did not eat: neither did all the males above 13 yeares eat of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the unclean were excluded by the Law: those that were in a journey did not eat of it nor the hired Servant: the sick saith <hi>Erastus</hi> did not eat of it: the Jewes exclude also the Dumbe and the Deaf. If it be said, that <hi>vers.</hi> 1. speaketh onely of the Fathers, and that therefore the Text is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of women and Children also. I answer, This is as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, as if one would argue, <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>Men, Brethren, and Fathers,</hi> therefore no women were among that multitude of the people <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 35. 36. 39. 40. or thus, the Apostle saith <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren pray for us,</hi> therefore he desires not beleeving Sisters to pray for him. In this same Text in hand, the Apostle speakes to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to make them afraid of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments if they sinne as the Israelites did. If he had argued onely from the sinne and judgement of the men, and not also of the women in the wildernesse, the women in <hi>Corinth</hi> had so much the lesse applyed it to themselves. But if I should grant (which will never be proved) that by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are understood the men onely, yet it cannot be said that as all the men of Israel were Baptized in the Cloud and Sea, and all of them drank of the same spirituall drink which came out of the Rock, so all of them did eat the Passeover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for even of the males divers were excluded from the Passeover, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, the hired Servant, the Child, the sick, &amp;c. so that this would make the Apostles argumentation running upon a five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>all</hi> to hang ill together. I had not insisted at all upon this, but to shew the weak grounds of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes</hi> strong confidence.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:95406:97"/>3. If this argument of his hold good, he must grant by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy that all Baptized persons must be admitted to the Lords Table, though they be Idolaters, fornicators, &amp;c. which as it is contrary to the Ordinance of Parliament, so to his own professed Tenents, for he professeth otherwhere, he is not for the admission of scandalous persons to the Sacrament, and that he would have them in case of obstinacy, not onely suspended from the Sacrament, but excommunicated from all other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, till publike satisfaction given for the scandall, and till externall symptomes of repentance appear. So <hi>the Antidote ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted</hi> tells us and his owne <hi>vindication</hi> pag. 50. If this be his minde, then it is incumbent to him to loose his owne knot, all circumcised persons though Tainted with grosse scandalous sinnes, as Idolatry, and Fornication, were admitted to the Passeover, and so it ought to be under the Gospell. If he say that those scandalous sinners in the wildernesse had not been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, were not obstinate, or that they professed repentance, and promised amendment, and did not in the meane while per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in their wickednesse, but satisfied for the scandall: first how proves he that? next, in so saying he will answer for us as well as for himself, and his argument (if all granted) cannot prove that such scandalous sinners as have manifest symptoms of impenitency, or doe not confesse and forsake their sinne, may be admitted to the Lords Table.</item>
                  <item>4. The Manna and the water out of the Rock, though they had a spirituall and evangelicall signification, and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> typifie Jesus Christ, yet they were also the ordinary Food and Drink of the people in the wildernesse: so that if scandalous sinners had been excluded from partaking of these, they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their ordinary daily corporall nourishment; which makes a vast difference between their case in the wildernesse, and ours at the Lords Table.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>5. The Apostle speakes of those scandalous sinnes, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, not before, but after the eating of that spirituall meat, and drinking of that spirituall drink; first this is cleer of their Baptisme in the Cloud and in the Sea, which was at their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through the Red Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. before any of the grosse and scandalous sinnes there mentioned were committed; and

therefore was not pertinent to be objected. Immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they did eat of the spirituall meat, that is of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na <hi>Exo.</hi> 16. and drank of the spirituall drink, that is of the Water out of the Rock which followed them <hi>Exod. 17. to give drink to my people, my chosen</hi> saith the Lord <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 20. Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those men had eaten of the spirituall meat, and drunk of the spirituall drink, they did fall into Idolatry, Fornication, &amp;c. and this is all which the Apostle saith, thereby warning the <hi>Corinthians</hi> not to presume upon their partaking in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, nor to think all well with themselves, because they were Baptized, and had eaten and drunk at the Lords Table; for after all this they had need to take heed, lest they fall in foule sinnes, and lust after evill things, and so draw upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the heavier judgements. That which Master <hi>Prynne</hi> takes for granted (upon a marvellous mistake of the Apostles words) he hath yet to prove, that is, that after some of them had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into Idolatry, others into fornication, others into mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring against God, those who were known to have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those grosse and scandalous sinnes, were allowed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as before, to eat of the spirituall meat, and drink of the spirituall drink. I mean not onely the Passeover, (which is not at all meant in this Text) but even from the Manna and the water of the Rock those scandalous sinners were cut off by death, except such of them as did repent and turn, for whom atonement was made to God. As soon as <hi>Moses</hi> came into the camp, he gave a charge to slay every man his Brother, and every man his companion which had committed the sinne of Idolatry: and for the rest who survived <hi>Moses</hi> made atonement, and got an answer of Peace from God, concerning them. <hi>Exo.</hi> 32. &amp; 33. We read also that the Lord plagued the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Idolatry <hi>Exo.</hi> 32. 35. and the people did mourn and humble themselves and cast off their Ornaments <hi>Exo.</hi> 33. 4. So that (I am sure) the first case mentioned by the Apostle mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much against our Opposites. The second example is the matter of Peor, where they did fall both into Idolatry and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication together; but what came of it? <hi>Moses</hi> gave a charge to the Judges of Israel, to slay every one his men that were joyned to <hi>Baal Peor Numb.</hi> 25. 5. and there died also of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95406:98"/>
Plague 24000. <hi>v.</hi> 9. But what was the peoples part in Repenting? <hi>vers.</hi> 6. tells us, that <hi>all the congregation of the Children of Israel were weeping before the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation;</hi> and for those that remained alive, <hi>Phinehes</hi> made atonement, and the Lord smelled a savour of rest <hi>vers.</hi> 11. 13. As for the third case, instanced by the Apostle, which is the tempting of Christ, <hi>much people of Israel dyed</hi> for it, and the remnant did repent, and confesse that particular sinne that they had <hi>spoken against the Lord and against</hi> Moses, and therefore did desire <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> to pray unto the Lord for them. <hi>Num.</hi> 21. 6. 7. Lastly, for that of murmuring, those that had the chiefe hand in it died of the Plague, <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 37. and <hi>the people mourned greatly,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, <hi>We have sinned vers.</hi> 34. 40. And thus by searching for an Answer to our Opposites argument, we have found this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against them.</p>
                     <p>If God himself did execute such Discipline upon those who were tainted with the grosse and scandalous sinnes of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Fornication, &amp;c. That he would not permit them to enjoy their former liberty of eating of the Manna, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Water of the Rock, (being spirituall meat, and spirituall drink, as Typifying Christ, though appointed of God also for ordinary daily food and drink to his people) untill they mourned, repented, confessed, and atonement was made for them: It is much lesse the will of God, that such scandalous sinners, as are manifestly impenitent and manifestly not reconciled to God, should be admitted and received to the Lords Supper, which is an Ordinance purely spirituall.</p>
                     <p>But the former part is true. Therefore so is the latter.</p>

                  <item>
                     <p>6. Another Answer I shall adde, (though I need adde no more) Those sinnes mentioned by the Apostle were not scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals given by a few persons, nor yet by a few Families, nor by a Tribe, but they were common nationall sinnes; and so fall not within the verge of our Controversie, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the suspending of a scandalous Nation from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for some nationall sinne; but concerning the suspension of scandalons persons for their personall publike offences. If it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95406:99"/>
be objected unto me, that the Apostle saith, that some of them were Idolaters, and some of them did commit Fornication, &amp;c. I answer, when he saith <hi>some,</hi> he saith so in reference to the <hi>All</hi> which had gone before, that is, all the Israelites who did eat of the Manna and drink of the water of the Rock, during the 40 yeers in the wildernesse, successively: so that he makes a distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Israel in the wildernesse, comparing one passage with another, not distributing those that lived together at one and the same time. And that it must needs be so understood I prove from <hi>Exo.</hi> 32. where we find <hi>all the people</hi> falling into Idolatry, so <hi>Num. 14. 2. And all the Children of Israel murmured against</hi> Moses <hi>and against</hi> Aaron. The other two are also called the sinnes of the people, and of Israel, and the people were punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for one of them all the Heads of the people commanded to be hanged. <hi>Num.</hi> 21. 5. 6. &amp; 25. 3. 4. Peradventure every one did not act in each of these sinnes, but yet they were natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall (as we call nationall) sinnes, the generality of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, either acting or partaking therein. In such a case <hi>Augustine</hi> thought fit to suspend the exercising of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the sinne of drunkennesse rather than to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all <hi>Africa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are my six answers to Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> unanswerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>

               <head>AN APPENDIX To the First Booke: Containing an additionall debate concerning the Jewish Church-Government and Censures.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have said enough (as I suppose) of a Church-Government and Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures distinct from Magistracy and civill Justice among the Jewes, whereby the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Old Testament strength of the Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, is sufficiently yea abundantly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; And now it appeareth how ill grounded that Assertion is which did lately come abroad in the Discourse entituled, <hi>The difference about Church-government ended</hi> Pag. 8. <hi>Moses was first the sole Ruler, &amp;c. Afterwards when Kings reigned in Israel, King Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon put Abiathar the high Priest from his Office, setting up Zadok, and David distinguished the courses of the Priests, and other godly Kings from time to time ruled in things Ecclesiasticall, and Priests never; till that after their returne from the Babylonish captivity, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:95406:101"/>
And no better grounded are the first five questions in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> his <hi>Diotrephes catechised,</hi> in which he doth intimate that there was no distinct Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction among the Jewes, and that all scandalous sinnes and offences now pretended to be of Ecclesiasticall cognisance, were by Gods owne institution throughout the old Testament, inquireable, examinable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable, and punishable onely by the temporall Magistrates or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ivill powers, not by any Ecclesiasticall persons or Officers. But when he should prove that there was no Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction distinct from the civill, he brings many Scriptures to prove that there was a civill jurisdiction and civill or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishments in the Old Testament. How cold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence from hence will be, against Church-Government, the intelligent Reader cannot but perceive.</p>
               <p>The most of that strength which doth militate against these Erastian Principles, is presented and drawn up in this prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Booke. That which I now intend is onely an additionall debate.</p>

                  </note> with the Anabaptists, they holding as the Erastians doe, that in the old Testament, there was but one kind of government, one kind of jurisdiction, one kind of punishment, and that it was Civill or Temporall; but an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Judicature or censure in the old Testament they deny. Wherein they are contradicted by those that writ against them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must distinguish with great caution, and (as they say) <hi>cum grano salis,</hi> between that which was ordinary and that which was extraordinary in the Jewish Government. We can not, from extraordinary cases collect and conclude that which was the fixed, setled, ordinary rule. The examples which have been alledged for the administration of Church-Government, the purging away of scandals, the ordering of

the Ministery in the old Testament, by the Temporall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate or civill powers onely, and by their owne immediate authority, how truly alledged or how rightly apprehended shall appeare by and by: this I say for the present, diverse of them were extraordinary cases, and are recorded as presidents for godly Magistrates their duty and authority,<note n="b" place="margin">

So that the Erastian Arguments drawn from those examples, for investing the Magistrate with the whole and sole power of Government and jurisdiction in Ecclesiasticall affaires, are no whit better than the Popish and Prelaticall Arguments, for the lawfulnesse of the civill power and places of Clergymen (as they called them) drawne from some extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Aaron</hi> his joyning with <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Eleazer</hi> with <hi>Ioshua,</hi> in civill businesse of greatest consequence; of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration and Government of the Commonwealth by <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest, and by <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet; of the anointing of <hi>Iehu</hi> to be King by <hi>Elisha;</hi> of the killing of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and the making of <hi>Ioash</hi> King by the authority of <hi>Iebojada</hi> the Priest; of the withstanding and thrusting out of King <hi>Uzziah,</hi> by fourscore valiant men of the Priests, and such like cases. Master <hi>Prynne</hi> himself in his <hi>Diotrephes catechised</hi> pag. 4. noteth that <hi>Ezra</hi> the Priest received a speciall commission from <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to set Magistrates and Judges which might judge all the people <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 11, 25. from all which it appeareth that as Priests did extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary some things which ordinarily belonged to Magistracy, so Magistrats did extraordinarily that which ordinarily did not belong to their administration. I conclude this point with a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in the second book of the Discipline of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Chap. 10. <hi>And although Kings and Princes that be godly, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by their own authority, when the Church is corrupted, and all things out of order, place Ministers, and restore the true service of the Lord, after the example of some godly Kings of Judah and divers godly Emperours and Kings also in the light of the new Testament: yet where the Ministery of the Church is once lawfully constituted, and they that are placed doe their Office faithfully, all godly Princes and Magistrates ought to beare and obey their voyce, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>

To restrict the word <hi>you</hi> to the Priests and Levites onely, is an intolerable wresting of the Text; for all these relatives, Verse 9, 10, 11. <hi>them, ye, you,</hi> must needs repeat the antecedent Verse 8. and so relate to the chiefe of the Fathers of Israel, as well as to the Priests and Levites. So that these words, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariah the chiefe Priest is over you,</hi> are spoken to the Sanhedrin; and the plaine meaning is, that <hi>Amariah</hi> the chiefe Priest was at that time the <hi>Nasi,</hi> or <hi>princeps Senatus,</hi> the Prince or chiefe Ruler of the Senat, as <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds it. 3. That the high Priest was a Ruler of the People, as well as of the Priests and Levites, is manifest from, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 5. where <hi>Paul</hi> applieth to the high Priest, that Law, <hi>Thou shalt not speake evill of the Ruler of thy people.</hi> 4.

The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees did account sinners and prophane persons to be uncleane, and thought themselves polluted by the company of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for which reason also they used to wash when they came from the mercate. Though there was a superstition in this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, yet the opinion that prophane persons are uncleane persons, and to be avoided for uncleannesse, had come from the purest antiquities of the Jewes, even from <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Since therefore both in the old Testament phrase, and in the usuall language of the Jewes themselves, a scandalous prophane person was called an unclean person, it is to me more then probable that where I read, <hi>none which was uncleane in any thing should enter in</hi> it is meant of those that were morally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane by a scandalous wicked conversation, no lesse yea much more than of those that were onely ceremonially uncleane. 3. Especially considering that the Sanctuary was prophaned and polluted by the morall uncleannesse of sinne, and by prophane persons their entring into it, as is manifest from <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 3. <hi>Eze.</hi> 23. 39. How can it then be imagined that those Priests whose charge it was to keepe back those that were uncleane in any thing, would admit and receive such as were not onely unclean persons in the language of Scripture and of the Jewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but were also by expresse Scriptures declared to be defilers or polluters of the Sanctuary? 4. It is said of the high Priest, <hi>Lev</hi> 16. 16. <hi>and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesse of the children of Israel, and because of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions in all their sins:</hi> or <hi>from</hi> their uncleannesse and <hi>from</hi> their transgressions, as the Chaldee and the LXX have it: the sence is the same: and it sheweth that the holy place was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane by the transgressions and sinnes of the children of Israel: which uncleannesse of transgression, if it were visible, publik and notorious, then the Priests had failed in admitting such to the holy place.</p>

Ib. sect.</hi> 11. <hi>He who is excommunicated in his own Town, ought also to be esteemed in all other Cities and Towns, as a person excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Answerable hereunto were the ancient Canons, which did appoint that a person excommunicated in his own Church should not be received to communion in another Church. The 24. causes of excommunication (above mentioned) he there reckoneth forth from <hi>sect.</hi> 13. to the end of that Chapter. Again, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. <hi>What is the manner of a simple excommunication or Niddui? He that doth excommunicate saith: Let that person N. be in</hi> (or <hi>under) an excommunication or separation. If the person excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated be present, they who doe excommunicate say unto him, Let this person N. be separated or excommunicated. And when Cherem or the greater excommunication is inflicted, what is the manner? They say, Let N. be devoted and accursed, let an execration, adjuration and separation be upon him. But how doe they loose the person excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and how doe they free him from the separation or the curse? they say, Be thou loosed, be thou pardoned. If the guilty party be absent, they say. Let N. be loosed, and let him be pardoned.</hi> In the same Chapter sect. 8. <hi>Neither is there any certain space of time predetermined, before which the bond of the excommunication inflicted may not be loosed. For immediately and at the same time when excommunication is inflicted, it may be loosed if the guilty party doe immediately repe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>t, and come to himselfe.</hi> Which doth further set forth the great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the nature and scope of Excommunication, and the nature and scope of corporall or civill punishments. For how soon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an excommunicat person giveth good signes of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he is to be loosed from the bond of excommunication. But he that is punished in his body or estate for any crime, is not freed from the punishment, because he is known to be penitent; The repentance of a criminall person is no <hi>supersedeas</hi> to civill Justice. Thereafter <hi>Maimonides</hi> proceedeth thus. <hi>Yet if it seem good to the Sanhedrin that any man shall be left in the state of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:95406:108"/>
                     <hi>for how many yeeres shall be be left in excommunication? The Sanhedrin will determine the number of yeers and space of time, according to the haynousnesse of the trespasse. So likewise if the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin will, it may devote and subject to a curse, first the party himself who is guilty of the crime, and then also every other person whosoever eateth or drinketh with him, or sitteth neere unto him unlesse at foure cubits distance: that so by this means the heavier correction may fall upon the sinner, and there may be as it were a hedge put about the law, which may restrain wicked men from transgressing it.</hi> Whence observe 1. It was from the Jewish Church, that the ancient Councels of the Christian Church, took a pattern for determining and fixing a certaine number of yeeres to the separation of some haynous offenders from the Sacrament, and sometimes from other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances also. Though I doe not approve this thing, either in the Jewish or Christian Church; for at what time soever a scandalous sinner doth give evident signes of repentance, the Church ought to receive him againe into her bosome and fellowship. 2. From the Jewish Church also was the patterne taken, for that ancient Discipline in the Christian Church, that he who keepeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and communion with an excommunicated person, should fall under the same censure of excommunication. Which thing must be well explained and qualified before it can be approved. 3. Compare also this passage of <hi>Maimonides</hi> with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>with such a one no not to eate,</hi> 2 Thes. 3. 14. <hi>have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</hi> Which Texts doe fitly answer to that which the Hebrew writers say of a person excommunicated. 4. The excommunication of an offender among the Jewes, was intended not onely for the offenders humiliation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for an ensample to others, that they might heare and feare and do no more any such thing: it was therefore a publique and exemplary censure. And so much of <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>In the 9. and 10. Sections <hi>Maimonides</hi> sheweth us, that though a wise man was allowed to prosecute unto the sentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication one that did revile or calumniat him, yet it was more praise-worthy and more agreeable to the example of the holy men of God to passe in silence and to endure patiently such injuries. Then followeth <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. <hi>These things which have been said, are to be understood of such reproaches and contumelies as are</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:95406:108"/>
                     <hi>clandestine. For if railers doe put a publike infamy upon a wise man, it is not lawfull to him to use indulgence or to neglect his honour: and if he shall pardon</hi> (as to the punishment) <hi>him who hath hurt his fame, he himselfe is to be punished, because that is a contempt of the law. He shall therefore avenge the contumely, &amp; not suffer himselfe to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, before the guilty party hath craved merey.</hi> Here is the true object, or (if you will) the procuring and meritorious cause of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>viz.</hi> not a private personall or civill injury, which a man may passe by or pardon if he will, but a scandalous sinne the scandall whereof must be removed and healed, by some Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony or Declaration of the sinners repentance, otherwise he must fall under the censure and publique shame.</p>
                  <p>These Testimonies of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and the observations made thereupon, beside all that hath been said in this preceding Book, will make it manifest that the Spirituall censure of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication was translated and taken from the Jewish Church into the Christian Church.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, beside all the Scriptural proofs already brought, I shall desire another Text, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 1, 3. to be wel weighed. After the reading of the law (<hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 3.) that the <hi>Amm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <item>Secondly, that this separation from Israel is to be understood in a spirituall and ecclesiasticall sence, it appeareth by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and application immediately added <hi>Neb.</hi> 13. 4. to vers. 10. <hi>And before this,</hi> that is, before this separation, <hi>Eliashih</hi> the Priest being allied unto <hi>Tobiah</hi> had prepared for him a chamber in the Courts of the house of God, but now when the separation of the mixed multitude was made; <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did east out the stuffe of <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and commanded to cleanse the chambers of the Temple which had been defiled by <hi>Tobiah.</hi> Behold an instance of the separation in reference to the Temple or holy place, not to any civill Court.</item>

                  <p>There are but two objections which I finde brought against that which I have been now proving. One is from <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48. a law which admitteth strangers to the Church and Passeover of the Jewes, provided they were willing to be circumcised. The other objection is from the example of <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabitesse,</hi> who was a member of the Church of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the first I answer, that <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48. will not prove that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95406:110"/>
every stranger who desired to be circumcised, and to eate the Passeover, was to be immediately admitted upon that desire, without any more adoe: onely it proves that before any stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger should eate of the Passeover, he must first be circumcised. A stranger might not be <hi>Gertsedek,</hi> a proselyte of righteousnesse, when he pleased, but he was first to be so and so qualified. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, it may be justly doubted whether <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 3. be not an exception from the rule <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48. for all strangers were not to be alike soon and readily received to be proselytes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse: but a great difference there was between those Nations which God had expressely and particularly devoted and accursed, and others not so accursed.</p>
                  <p>To the other objection concerning <hi>Ruth, Rabanus</hi> cited by <hi>Pelargus</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. answereth that the tenth generation of the <hi>Moabites</hi> was past, before <hi>Ruth</hi> did enter into the congregation of the Lord. And if it had not, yet the case was extraordinary, and one Swallow makes not Summer.</p>

One of these was a publick dispute at <hi>Heydelberg</hi> in the year 1568. upon certain <hi>Theses</hi> concerning the necessity of Church Government, and the power of Presbyteries to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate: Which <hi>Theses</hi> were exhibited by M. <hi>George Withers</hi> an <hi>Englishman,</hi> who left <hi>England</hi> because of the Ceremonies, and was at that time made Doctor of Divinity at <hi>Heydelberg.</hi> And the learned dispute had thereupon, you may find epitomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed (as it was taken the day following from the mouth of <hi>Dr. Vrsinus</hi>) in the close of the second part of <hi>Dr. Pareus</hi> his expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Heidelberg</hi> Catechisme.</p>

                  <hi>Theses;</hi> also the close of his sixth Book; put these together, you will find him yeeld, that all ought not to be admitted promiseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to the Sacrament, but that such admission be according to the custome and rule observed in the Church of <hi>Heidelberg</hi> (and what that was, you may find in the <hi>Heidelberg</hi> Catechisme <hi>Quaest.</hi> 82. &amp; 87. namely a suspension of prophane scandalous persons from the Sacrament, and in case of their obstinacy and continuing in their offences, an excommunicating of them.) He yeelds also that these seven sorts of persons ought not to be esteemed as members of the Church, and that if any such be found in the visible Church, they ought to be cast out. 1. Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. 2. Apostates. 3. Such as do not understand the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that is, Ignorant Persons. 4.

Such as doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and acknowledge their sins, and professe sorrow and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for them, and a hatred or detestation of them. And thus you see as <hi>Erastianisme</hi> pleadeth for no favour to Sectaries, or whosoever dissent in doctrine, or whose Tenents concerning Christs Institution, or manner of Administration, are contrary to that which is received in the Church where they live: (for <note n="c" place="margin">Erastus ib. <hi>Equidem in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibus ab initi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> it is content that all such, were they never so peaceable and godly, be cast out of the Church by excommunication. All the favour and forbearance which it pleadeth for, is to the loose and prophane) So neither doth it altogether exempt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, but such onely as do neither deny nor defend their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, but confesse their sins, and professe sorrow for them. Let the Erastians of this time observe what their great Master hath yeelded touching the Ecclesiastical Censure of prophane ones. Which though it is not satisfactory to us, for reasons elsewhere given, yet it can be as little satisfactory to them. But whereas <hi>Erastus</hi> together with those his Concessions (that hee may seem to have said somewhat) falls a quarrelling with Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries for presuming to judge of the sincerity of that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95406:113"/>
professed by a scandalous sinner, and their not resting sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with a mans owne profession of his repentance. If his followers will now be pleased to reduce the controversie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that narrow circle, Whether a Presbyterie may excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate from the Church, or at least suspend from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, any Church-member, as an impenitent scandalous sinner, who yet doth not defend nor denie his sin by which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven scandall, but confesseth it, and professeth sincere and hearty repentance for it: (which is the point that <hi>Erasius</hi> is faine to hold at in the issue) Then I hope we shall be quickly agreed, and the controversie buried; for we do rest satisfied with the offender his confession of his sinne, and profession of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, unlesse his owne known words or actions give the lye to his profession of repentance; that is, if he be known to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie and defend his sin in his ordinary discourse, or to continue in the practice of the sin, which he professeth to the Presbyterie he repents of; if these or such like sure signes of his impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be known, must the Presbyterie notwithstanding rest satisfied with his verbal profession of repentance? All that fear God (I think) would cry shame, shame, upon such an assertion. And moreover, let us take it in the case of an Idolater, Heretick, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate (for <hi>Erastus</hi> is content that such be excluded from the Sacrament.) Suppose such a one doth confesse his sin, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth repentance, in the mean while is known to be a writer or spreader of books in defence of that Idolatry or Heresie, or to be a perswader and enticer of others secretly to that way, or if there be any other known infallible signe of his impenitency, must his verbal profession to the Presbyterie in such cases be trusted and taken as satisfactory? I am confident <hi>Erastus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self would not have said so. Wherefore as in the case of an Heretick, so in the case of a prophane person, or one of a scandalous conversation, there is a necessity that the Presbyterie examine the real signes of repentance, and the offenders verbal profession is not all.</p>
               <p>The third cause which helped forward the deadly malady and consumption of Erastianisme; was the grief, shame, confusion and losse which it sustained by the learning and labour of some Divines in the Reformed Churches, who had to very good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

Yea also as Church-Officers, they are to be kept within the limits of their calling, and compelled (if need be) by the Magistrate to do those Duties which by the clear Word of God and received principles of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or by the received Ecclesiastical Constitutions of that Church, they ought to do. 4. And <hi>in corrupto Ecclesiae statu,</hi> I mean, if it shall ever happen (which the Lord forbid, and I trust shall never be) that Presbyteries, or Synods shall make defection from the Truth to Errour, from Holinesse to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse, from Moderation to Tyranny and Persecution, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring the innocent and absolving the guilty, as Popery and Prelacy did, and there being no hopes of redressing such enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in the ordinary way by intrinsecal Ecclesiastical reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that is, by well-constituted Synods, or Assemblies of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, holy, moderate Presbyters: In such an extraordinary exigence, the Christian Magistrate may and ought to interpose his Authority to do diverse things which in an ordinary course of Government he ought not to do; for in such a case, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy (without expecting the proper intrinsecal remedy of better Ecclesiasticall Assemblies) may immediately, by it self, and in the most effectual manner, suppresse and restrain such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, exorbitancy, and tyranny, and not suffer the unjust,

                  <item>5. I dare confidently say, that if comparisons be rightly made, Presbyterial Government is the most limitted and the least Arbitrary Government of any other in the world. I should have thought it very unnecessary and superfluous, to have once named here the Papal Government, or yet the Prelatical, but that Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> in his preface to his four grand Questions, puts the Reverend Assembly of Divines in mind, that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of usurping that which hath been even by themselves dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed against, and quite taken away from the Pope and Prelats. Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> also in his Sermon brought objections from the usurpations of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, and of the Archhbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> Well, if we must needs make a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, come on. The Papal usurpations are many. 1. The Pope takes upon him to determine what belongs to the Canon of Scripture, what not? 2. That he onely can determine what is the sence of Scripture. 3. He addeth unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 4. He makes himself Judge of all controversies. 5. He dispenseth with the Law of God it self. 6. He makes himself above General Councels. 7. His government is Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. 8. He receiveth appeals from all the Nations in the world. 9. He claimeth Infallibility at least <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> 10. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Lawes absolutely binding the Conscience, even in things indifferent. 11. He claimeth a Temporal Dominion over all the Kingdoms in the world. 12. He saith he may depose
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95406:119"/>
Kings, and absolve Subjects from their oath of allegiance. 13. He persecuteth all with fire and sword and Anathema's, who do not subject themselves to him. 14. He claimeth the sole power of convocating general Councels. 15. And of presiding or moderating therein by Himself or his Legates.</item>
               </list>
               <p>What Conscience or ingenuity can there now be, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any parallel between Papall and Presbyteriall Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>As little there is in making the comparison with Prelacy, the power whereof was indeed arbitrary and impatient of those limitations and rules which Presbyteries and Synods in the Reformed Churches walkby. For 1. The Prelate was but one, yet he claimed the power of ordination and jurisdiction as proper to himself in his owne Diocesse. We give the power of ordination and Church censures not <hi>uni,</hi> but <hi>unitati,</hi> not to one, but to an Assembly gathered into one.</p>
               <p>2. The Prelate assumed a perpetual precedency and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant priviledge of moderating Synods, Which Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment denyeth to any one man. 3. The Prelate did not tye himself either to aske or to receive advice from his fellow Presbyters, except when he himself pleased. But there is no Presbyteriall nor Synodicall sentence, which is not concluded by the major part of voices. 4. The Prelate made himself Pastor to the whole Diocesse (consisting it may be of some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Congregations) holding that the Ministers of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations did preach the Word and minister the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, in his name by vertue of authority and order from him, and because he could not act by himself in every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. The Presbyteriall Government acknowledgeth no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall charge of preaching the Word and ministring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to more Congregations then one; and doth acknowledge the Pastors of particular Churches, being lawfully called, to have power and authority for preaching the Word and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Sacraments in the name of Christ, and not in the name of the Presbyterie. 5. The Prelates as they denyed the power and authority of Pastors, so they utterly denyed the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offices of ruling Elders, and Deacons for taking more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of the poor, in particular Congregations. 6. They
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95406:119"/>
did not acknowledge Congregationall Elderships, nor any power of discipline in particular Congregations which the Presbyteriall Government doth. 7. They intruded Pastors oft times against the consent of the Congregation, and <hi>recla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante Ecclesiâ,</hi> which the Presbyteriall Government doth not. 8. They ordained Ministers without any particular charge, which the Presbyterial Government doth not. 9 In Synods they did not allow any but the Clergie alone (as they kept up the name) to have decisive suffrage. The Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives decisive voices to ruling Elders as well as to Pastors. 10. The Prelates declined to be accountable to and censurable by either Chapters, Diocesan or Nationall Synods. In Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall Government all (in whatsoever Ecclesiasticall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration) are called to an account in Presbyteries, Provinciall and Nationall Assemblies respectively, and none are exempted from Synodicall censures in case of scandall and obstinacy. 11. The Prelates power was not meerly Ecclesiasticall, they were Lords of Parliament, they held Civil places in the State, which the Presbyterial Government condemneth. 12. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats were not chosen by the Church, Presbyters are. 13. The Prelates did presume to make Lawes binding the Conscience, even in things indifferent, and did persecute, imprison, fine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, excommunicate men for certain Rites and Ceremonies acknowledged by themselves to be indifferent (setting aside the will and authority of the Law makers) This the Presbyteriall Government abhorreth. 14. They did excommunicate for money matters, for trifles. Which the Presbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment condemneth. 15. The Prelates did not allow men to examine by the Judgement of Christian and private discretion, their Decrees and Canons, so as to search the Scriptures and look at the Warrants, but would needs have men think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know the things to be commanded by them that are in place and power. Presbyteriall Government doth not lord it over mens consciences, but admitteth (yea commendeth) the searching of the Scriptures, whether these things which it holds forth be not so, and doth not presse mens Consciences with <hi>Sic volo, sic jubeo,</hi> but desireth they may doe in faith what they do. 16. The Prelates held up pluralities, non-residen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95406:120"/>
&amp;c. Which the Presbyteriall Government doth not 17. As many of the Prelates did themselves neglect to preach the Gospel, so they kept up in diverse places a reading non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching Ministery: Which the Presbyteriall Goverment suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not. 18. They opened the door of the Ministery to diverse scandalous, Arminianized, and popishly affected men, and locked the door upon many worthy to be admitted. The Presbyteriall Government herein is as contrary to theirs, as theirs was to the right. 19.

               <p>In the third place, The Presbyterian Government is more limited and lesse arbitrary than the Independent Government of single Congregations, which exempting themselves from the Presbyterial subordination, and from being accountable to, and censurable by Classes or Synods, must needs be supposed to exercise a much more unlimited or arbitrary power, than the Presbyterial Churches do: especially when this shall be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

and laid together with one of their three grand Principles, which disclaimeth the binding of themselves for the future un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their present judgement and practice, and avoucheth the keeping of this reserve to alter and retract. See their <hi>Apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal narration,</hi> pag. 10, 11. By which it appeareth that their way will not suffer them to be so far moulded into an Uniformity, or bounded within certain particular rules (I say not with others, but even among themselves) as the Presbyterian way will ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Finally, The Presbyterial Government hath no such liberty nor arbitrarinesse, as Civil or Military Government hath: there being in all civil or temporal affairs a great deal of latitude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to those who manage the same, so that they command nor act nothing against the Word of God. But Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is tyed up to the rules of Scripture, in all such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars as are properly spiritual and proper to the Church; Though in other particular, occasional circumstances of times, places, accommodations, and the like, the same light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reason guideth both Church and State; yet in things properly Spiritual and Ecclesiastical, there is not near so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much latitude left to the Presbytery, as there is in civil affairs to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>And thus I have made good what I said, That Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Government is the most limited and least arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of any other. All which Vindication and clearing of the Presbyterial Government, doth overthrow (as to this Point) Master <hi>Hussey's Observation,</hi> pag. 9. of the irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and arbitrarinesse of Church-government. And so much of my fourth Conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ssion.</p>
               <p>The fifth shall be this: 'Tis far from our meaning, that the Christian Magistrate should not meddle with matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or things and causes Ecclesiastical, and that he is to take care of the Common-wealth, but not of the Church. Certainly there is much power and Authority which by the Word of God, and by the Confessions of Faith of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, doth belong to the Christian Magistrate in matters of Religion. Which I do but now touch by the way, so far as is necessary to wipe off the aspersion cast upon

Presbyterial Government. The particulars I refer to Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 8.</p>
               <p>Our sixth Concession is, That in extraordinary cases, when Church-government doth degenerate into tyranny, ambition, and avarice; and they who have the managing of the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical power, make defection and fall into manifest Heresy, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, or Injustice, (as under Popery and Prelacy it was for the most part:) then, and in such cases (which we pray and hope we shall never see again) the Christian Magistrate may and ought to do diverse things in and for Religion, and interpose his Authority diverse wayes, so as doth not properly belong to his cognizance, decision, and administration, ordinarily, and in a Reformed and well constituted Church.

But the Magistrate is free in this, to do or not to do, to do more or to do lesse, as he will answer to God and his conscience: it is a cumulative Act of favour done by the Magistrate. My meaning is not, that it is free to the Magistrate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>in genere moris;</hi> but <hi>in genere entis.</hi> The Magistrate ought to adde the Civil Sanction <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> or he ought not to do it. It is either a duty, or a sin; it is not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. But my meaning is, The Magistrate is free herein from all coaction, yea from all necessity and obligation; other then ariseth from the Word of God, binding his conscience. There is no power on Earth, Civil or Spiritual, to constrain him. The Magistrate himself is his own Judge on Earth, how far he is to do any cumulative Act of favour to the Church. Which takes off that calumny, that Presbyterial Government doth force or compel the conscience of the Magistrate. I pray God we may never have cause to state the Question otherwise, I mean, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Magistrate his forbidding what Christ hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or commanding what Christ hath forbidden: in which case we must serve Christ and our consciences, rather then obey
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95406:121"/>
Laws contrary to the Word of God and our Covenant: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the other case, of the Magistrate his not adding of the Civil Sanction, we may both serve Christ, and do it without the least appearance of disobedience to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, We grant that Pastors and Elders, whether they be considered distributively, or collectively in Presbyteries and Synods, being Subjects and Members of the Common-wealth, ought to be subject and obedient in the Lord to the Magistrate and to the Law of the Land; and as in all other duties, so in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil subjection and obedience they ought to be <hi>ensamples to the Flock;</hi> and their trespasses against Law are punishable, as much, yea, more then the trespasses of other Subjects. Of this also before.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, If the Magistrate be offended, at the sentence given, or censure inflicted by a Presbytery or a Synod, they ought to be ready in all humility and respect, to give him an account and reason of such their proceedings, and by all means to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the satisfaction of the Magistrate his conscience: or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be warned and rectified, if themselves have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the agreements and differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the nature of the Civil and of the Ecclesiastical Powers or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</head>
               <p>HAving now observed what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>our opposites yeeld to us, or we to them, I shall for further unfolding of what I plead for, or against, adde here the chief agreements and differences between the Civil and Ecclesiastical powers, so far as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them. They both agree in these things: 1. They are both from God; both the Magistrate, and the Minister is authorized from God, both are the Ministers of God, and shall give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their administrations to God. 2. Both are tyed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Law and Commandments of God: and both have certain directions from the Word of God to guide them in their administration. 3. Both Civil Magistrates and Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ought to be honoured and obeyed according to the fifth Commandment: <hi>Utrumque scilicet dominium,</hi> saith <hi>Luther, Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 139. both Governments, the Civil and the Ecclesiastical, do pertain to that Commandment. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Both Magistracy and Ministery are appointed for the glory of God as Supreme, and for the good of men as the subordinate end. 5. They are both of them mutually aiding and auxiliary, each to other. Magistracy strengthens the Ministery, and the Ministery strengthens Magistracy. 6. They agree in their general kinde; they are both Powers and Governments. 7. Both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire singular qualifications, eminent gifts and endowments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:95406:122"/>
and of both it holds true, <hi>Quis ad haec idoneus?</hi> 8. Both of them have degrees of censures and correction according to the degrees of offences. 9. Neither the one nor the other may give out sentence against one who is not convict, or whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is not proved. 10. Both of them have a certain kind of Jurisdiction <hi>in foro exteriori.</hi> For though the Ecclesiastical power be spiritual, and exercised about such things as belong to the inward man onely; yet as Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> upon the Decalogue, pag. 260. 261. saith truly, there is a two-fold power of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal jurisdiction which is exercised <hi>in foro exteriori:</hi> one by Church-Censures, Excommunication, lesser and greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is not committed to the Magistrate, but to Church-Officers: Another, which is Civil and coercive, and that is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. But Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> told us, he was perswaded it will trouble the whole World to bound Ecclesiastical and Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, the one from the other; <hi>Maledicis</hi> pag. 7. Well: I have given ten agreements. I will now give ten differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>The difference between them is great; they differ in their causes, effects, objects, adjuncts, correlations, executions, and ultimate terminations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the efficient cause. The King of Nations hath insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Civil power; The King of Saints hath instituted the Ecclesiastical power. I mean the most high God, possessor of Heaven and Earth, who exerciseth Soverainty over the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of his own hands, and so over all mankind, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Magistrates to be in his stead, as gods upon Earth. But <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> as Mediator and King of the Church, whom his Father hath <hi>set upon his holy Hill of Zion, Psal.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>to reigne over the House of Jacob for ever, Luke</hi> 1. 33. who hath the key of the House of <hi>David</hi> laid upon his shoulder, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 22. hath instituted an Ecclesiastical power and goverment in the hands of Church-Officers, whom in his name he sendeth forth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the matter, Magistracy or Civil power hath for the matter of it the earthly Scepter and the Temporal Sword: that is, it is Monarchical and Legislative: it is also punitive or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive of those that do evil; understand, upon the like reason,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95406:123"/>
remunerative of those that do well. <note n="n" place="margin">Festus Honnius disp. 30. thes. 6. <hi>Circa bonum spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituale versatur potestas Ecclesi astica proprie ita dicta, cujus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium officium est verbum Dei praedicare, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenta admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrare, discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam exercere, Ministros Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae ordinare, de controversiis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesi isticis quae circa doctrinam aut regimen Ec clesiae interci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt, ordinarie judicare, &amp; de ritibus adiapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ad ordinem, decorum atque aedificationem Ecclesiae perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentibus, Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes seu leges Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituere.</hi> I.

                  </note> The Ecclesiastical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath for the matter of it, the keyes of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 1. The key of knowledge or doctrine, and that to be administred, not onely severally by each Minister <hi>concionaliter,</hi> but also Consistorially and Synodically in determining contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Faith, and that according to the rule of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture onely: which is <hi>clavis</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. The key of order and decency, so to speak: by which the circumstances of Gods Worship and all such particulars in Ecclesiastical affairs, as are not determined in Scripture, are determined by the Ministers and ruling Officers of the Church, so as may best agree to the generall rules of the word concerning order and decency, avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of scandall, doing all to the glory of God, and to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of one another.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 3. The key of corrective discipline or censures to be exercised upon the scandalous and obstinate: which is <hi>clavis</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 4. Adde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the key of Ordination or mission of Church-Officers, which I may call <hi>clavis</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the authorizing or power giving key, others call it <hi>missio potestativa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ in their formes. The power of Magistracy is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is an authority or dominion exercised in the particulars above mentioned, and that in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate subordination to God: for which reason Magistrates are called gods. The Ecclesiastical power is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> onely. It is meerly Ministeriall and Steward-like, and exercised in an immediate subordination to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as King of the Church, and in his name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They differ in their ends. The supreme end of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy is onely the glory of God, as King of Nations, and as exercising dominion over the inhabitants of the earth: And in that respect the Magistrate is appointed to keep his Subjects within the bounds of external obedience to the moral Law, the obligation where of lyeth upon all Nations, and all men. The supreme end of the Ecclesiastical power, is either <hi>proximus</hi> or <hi>remotus.</hi> The neerest and immediate end is the glory of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> as Mediator and King of the Church. The more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote end is the glory of God, as having all power and authority
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95406:123"/>
in heaven and earth. You will say, Must not then the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrate intend the glory of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and to be subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to him as he is Mediator and King of the Church? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he ought and must; and God forbid but that he should do so. But how? not <hi>qua</hi> Magistrate, but <hi>qua</hi> Christian. If you say to me again, Must not the Christian Magistrate intend to be otherwise subservient to the Kingdom of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, then by personal or private Christian duties, which are incumbent to every Christian? I answer, no doubt he ought to intend more, even to glorifie <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Magistracy. Which that you may rightly apprehend, and that I be not misunderstood, take this distinction. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together incumbent to the ruling Officers of the Church, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the glory of <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator, even <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the very nature of Ecclesiasticall power and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which hath no other end and use for which it was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and instituted, but to be subservient to the Kingly office of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in the governing of his Church upon earth (and therefore <hi>sublata Ecclesiâ perit regimen Ecclesiasticum,</hi> take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Church out of a Nation, and you take away all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall power of government, which makes another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from Magistracy, as we shall see anon.) But the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate though Christian and godly, doth not <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the nature of his particular vocation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> intend the glory of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> as Mediator, and King of the Church: but in regard of the common principles of Christian Religion, which do oblige every Christian in his particular vocation and station (and so the Magistrate in his) to intend that end. All Christians are commanded that whatever they do in word or deed, they do all in the name of the Lord <hi>Iesus, Col.</hi> 3. 17. that is, according to the will of <hi>Christ,</hi> and for the glory of <hi>Christ:</hi> And so a Marchant, a Mariner, a Tradesman, a School-master, a Captain, a Souldier, a Printer, and in a word, every Christian in his own place and station ought to intend the glory of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the good of his Church and Kingdom. Upon which ground and principle, if the Magistrate be Christian, it is incumbent to him so to administer that high and eminent vocation of his, that <hi>Christ</hi> may be glorified as King of the Church, and that this
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95406:124"/>
Kingdom of <hi>Christ</hi> may flourish in his Dominions, (which would God every Magistrate called Christian did really intend.) So then the glory of <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator and King of the Church, is to the Ministery both <hi>finis operis,</hi> and <hi>finis operantis.</hi> To the Magistrate, though Christian, it is onely <hi>finis operantis;</hi> That is, it is the end of the godly Magistrate, but not the end of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy: whereas it is not onely the end of the godly Minister, but the end of the Ministery it self. The Ministers intendment of this end, flowes from the nature of their particular vocation. The Magistrates intendment of the same end, flowes from the nature of their general vocation of Christianity, acting, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and having influence into their particular vocation. So much of the supreme ends.</p>
               <p>Now the subordinate end of all Ecclesiastical power, is, that all who are of the Church, whether Officers or members, may live godly, righteously, and soberly in this present world, be kept within the bounds of obedience to the Gospel, void of all known offence toward God, and toward man, and be made to walk according to the rules delivered to us by <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles. The subordinate end of the Civil power is, that all publike sins committed presumptuously against the moral Law, may be exemplarly punished, and that peace, justice, and good order may be preserved and maintained in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which doth greatly redound to the comfort and good of the Church, and to the promoting of the course of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For this end the Apostle bids us pray for Kings, and all who are in Authority (though they be Pagans, much more if they be Christians) <hi>that we may live under them a peaceable and quiet life, in all Godlinesse and Honesty:</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. He saith not simply, <hi>that we may live in Godlinesse and Honesty,</hi> but that we may both live peaceably and quietly, and also live godly and honestly: which is the very same that we commonly say of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that he is <hi>Custos utrius<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> Tabulae.</hi> He is to take speciall care that all his Subjects be made to observe the Law of God, and live not onely in moral honesty, but in Godlinesse, and that so living, they may also enjoy peace and quietnesse. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly; the end of Church censures is, that men may be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, humbled, reduced to repentance, that their spirit may
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95406:124"/>
be saved in the day of the Lord. The end of civil punishments inflicted by the Magistrate is, That justice may be done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, and that peace and good order may be maintained in the Common-wealth, as hath been said. The end of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Satan,</hi> was, <hi>that they may learn not to blaspheme,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Erastus</hi> yeelds to <hi>Beza,</hi> pag. 239. that the Apostle doth not say <hi>Ut non possint blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare, that henceforth they may not be able to sin as they did before</hi> (which yet he acknowledgeth to be the end of civil punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,) but <hi>that they may learn not to blaspheme.</hi> Wherefore when he expounds <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to no other sence but this, That the Apostle had delivered those two to be killed by <hi>Satan, Ut non possint,</hi> that they may not be able to blaspheme so any more; just as a Mastgirate delivers a theef from the gallows, that he may not be able to steal any more, and (as he tels us some speak) that he may learn to steal no more: He is herein confuted, not onely out of the Text, but out of himself. So then, the end of Church-censures is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders may learn or be instructed to do so no more; which belongeth to the inward man or soul. The end of civil punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is, <hi>Ut non possint</hi> (as <hi>Erastus</hi> tels us) that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may not be able or at least (being alive and some way free) may not dare to do the like, the sword being appointed for a terrour to them who do evil, to restrain them from publike and punishable offences, not to work upon the spirit of their mindes, nor to effect the destroying of the flesh by mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the spirit may be safe in the day of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The fifth difference between the Civil and Ecclesiastical powers, is in respect of the effects. The effects of the Civil power are Civil Laws, Civil punishments, Civil rewards. The effects of the Ecclesiastical power, are Determinations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of Faith, Canons concerning Order and Decency in the Church, Ordination or Deposition of Church-Officers, Suspension from the Sacrament, and Excommunication. The powers being distinct in their nature and causes, the effects must needs be distinct, which flow from the actuating and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in execution of the powers. I do not here speak of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Ecclesiastical power of Order, the dispensing of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95406:125"/>
Word and Sacraments; but of the effects of the power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction or Government, of which onely the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic is.</p>
               <p>Sixthly: The Civil power hath for the object of it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the things of this life, matters of Peace, War, Justice, the Kings matters, and the Countrey-matters, those things that belong to the external man: But the Ecclesiastical power hath for the object of it, things pertaining to God, the Lords matters, as they are distinct from Civil matters, and things belonging to the inward man, distinct from the things belonging to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. This difference Protestant Writers do put between the Civil and Ecclesiastical powers. <hi>Fr. Junius Ecclesiast. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. saith thus: <hi>We have put into our definition humane things to be the subject of Civil administration: but the subject of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical administration, we have taught to be things Divine and Sacred. Things Divine and Sacred we call both those which God commandeth for the sanctification of our minde and conscience, as things necessary; and also those which the decency and order of the Church requireth to be ordained and observed, for the profitable and convenient use of the things which are necessary: For example, Prayers, the administration of the Word and Sacraments, Eccl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical censure, are things necessary and essentially belonging to the Communion of Saints: but set dayes, set hours, set places, fasts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the like, belong to the decency and order of the Church &amp;c. But humane things we call such as touch the life, the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goods and good name, as they are expounded in the second Table of the Decalogue; for these are the things in which the whole Civil administration standeth. Tilen, Synt. part.</hi> 2. <hi>disp.</hi> 32. tels us to the same purpose, That Civil Government or Magistracy <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satur circa res terrenas &amp; hominem externum. Magistratus,</hi> saith <hi>Danaui Pol. Christ. lib. 6. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>instituti sunt à Deo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum humanarum quae hominum societati necessariae sunt, respectu, &amp; ad earum curam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be objected, How can these things agree with that which hath been before by us acknowledged, that the Civil Magistrate ought to take special care of Religion, of the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and purgation thereof, of the abolishing idolatry and superstition; and ought to be <hi>Custos utriusque Tabulae,</hi> of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95406:125"/>
first, as well as second Table? I answer, That Magistrates are appointed, not onely for Civil Policy, but for the conservation and purgation of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is expressed in the Confession of Faith of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before cited, we firmly beleeve, as a most undoubted truth. But when Divines make the object of Magistracy to be onely such things as belong to this life and to humane society, they do not mean the object of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates <hi>Care</hi> (as if he were not to take care of Religion;) but the object of his Operation. The Magistrate himself may not assume the administration of the keys, nor the dispensing of Church-censures; he can but punish the external man with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal punishments. Of which more afterwards.</p>
               <p>The seventh difference stands in the Adjuncts: For 1. the Ecclesiastical power in Presbyterial or Synodical Assemblies, ought not to be exercised without prayer and calling upon the Name of the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19. There is no such obligation upon the Civil power, as that there may be no Civil Court of Justice without prayer. 2. In divers cases Civil Jurisdiction hath been and is in the person of one man: But no Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jurisdiction is committed to one man, but to an Assembly in which two at least must agree in the thing, as is gathered from the Text last cited. 3. No private or secret offence ought to be brought before an Ecclesiastical Court, except in the case of contumacy and impenitency, after previous admonitions: This is the ordinary rule, not to dispute now extraordinary exceptions from that rule. But the Civil power is not bound up by any such ordinary rule: For I suppose, our opposites will hardly say (at least hardly make it good) that no Civil injury or breach of Law and Justice, being privately committed, may be brought before a Civil Court, except first there be previous admonitions, and the party admonished prove obstinate and impenitent.</p>
               <p>The eighth difference stands in their correlations. The <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum</hi> of Magistracy is people embodied in a Common-wealth, or a Civil corporation. The <hi>Correlatum</hi> of the Ecclesiastical power is people embodied in a Church, or Spiritual corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Common-wealth is not in the Church, but the Church is in the Common-wealth, that is, One is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95406:126"/>
in or of the Church, because he is in or of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, of which the Church is a part; but yet every one that is a Member of the Church, is also a Member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, of which that Church is a part. The Apostle distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth those that are without, and those that are within in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Church, who were notwithstanding both sorts within in reference to the Common-wealth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12, 13. The <hi>Correlatum</hi> of the Ecclesiastical power may be quite taken away by persecution, or by defection, when the <hi>Correlatum</hi> of the civil power may remain. And therefore the Ecclesiastical and the civil power do not <hi>se mutuò ponere &amp; tollere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly: There is a great difference in the ultimate termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The Ecclesiastical power can go no further then Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or (in case of extraordinary warrants, and when one is known to have blasphemed against the holy Ghost) to <hi>Auathema Maranatha.</hi> If one be not humbled and reduced by Excommunication, the Church can do no more, but leave him to the Judgement of God, who hath promised to ratifie in Heaven, what his Servants in his Name, and according to his Will, do upon Earth. <hi>Salmasius</hi> spends a whole chapter in confuting the Point of the coactive and Magistratical Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Bishops. See <hi>Walo Messal. cap.</hi> 6. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in that very place, <hi>pag.</hi> 455, 456, 459, 462<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Elders of the Church have in common the power of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Discipline, to suspend from the Sacrament and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, and to receive the offender again upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his repentance. But the Point he asserteth is, That Bishops or Elders have no such power as the Magistrate hath, and that if he that is excommunicate do not care for it, nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself, the Elders cannot compel him. But the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <hi>Quo usque</hi> of the civil power, is most different from this. It is <hi>unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.</hi> Ezra 7. 26.</p>
               <p>Tenthly: They differ in a divided execution. That is, the Ecclesiastical power ought to censure sometime one whom the Magistrate thinks not fit to punish with temporal or civil pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments: And again, the Magistrate ought to punish with the temporal Sword, one whom the Church ought not to cut
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95406:126"/>
off by the Spiritual Sword. This difference <hi>Pareus</hi> gives, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plic. Catech. quaest.</hi> 85. <hi>art.</hi> 4. and it cannot be denied: For those that plead most for Liberty of conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and argue against all civil or temporal punishments of Hereticks, do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing acknowledge, that the Church whereof they are Members ought to censure and excommunicate them, and doth not her duty except she do so. The Church may have reason to esteem one as an Heathen and a Publican that is no Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Member, whom yet the Magistrate in prudence and policy doth permit to live in the Common-wealth. Again, the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and scandalous sinners, blasphemers, murtherers, adulterers, incestuous persons, robbers, &amp;c. when God gives them repentance, and the signes thereof do appear, the Church doth not binde but loose them, doth not retain but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their sins; I mean ministerially and declaratively. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Magistrate may and ought to do Justice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, even upon those penitent sinners.</p>

               <p>THe Controversie which hath been moved concerning the civil Magistrate his Vicegerentship, and the holding of his Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of and under and for Jesus Christ as he is Mediator, hath a necessary coherence with, and dependance upon another Controversie concerning a twofold Kingdom of Jesus Christ; one, as he is the eternal Son of God, raigning together with the Father and the holy Ghost over all things; and so the Magistrate is his Vicegerent, and holds his Office of and under him: another as Mediator and Head of the Church, and so the Magistrate doth not hold his Office of and under Christ as his Vicegerent. Wherefore before I come to that Question concerning the origination and tenure of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's Office, I have thought good here to premise the enoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Question concerning the twofold Kingdom of Jesus Christ. It is a distinction which Master <hi>Hussey</hi> cannot endure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:95406:127"/>
and no marvel; for it overturneth the foundation of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. He looks upon it as an absurd assertion, pag. 25. <hi>Shall he have one Kingdom as Mediator, and another as God?</hi> He quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relleth all that I said of the twofold Kingdom of Christ, and will not admit that Christ as Mediator is King of the Church onely, pag. 25, 26, 27, 35, 36, 37.</p>
               <p>The Controversie draweth deeper then he is aware of: for <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Photinians</hi> finding themselves puzzled with those arguments which (to prove the eternal Godhead of Jesus Christ) were drawn from such Scriptures as call him <hi>God, Lord, the Son of God;</hi> also from such Scriptures as ascribe Worship and Adoration to him; and from the Texts which ascribe to him a Supreme Lordship, Dominion, and Kingdom over all things: (For this hath been used as one Argument for the Godhead of Jesus Christ and his consubstantiality with the Father. <hi>The Father raigns, the Son raigns, the holy Ghost raigns. Vide lib. Isaaci Clari Hispani adversus Varimadum Arianum:</hi>) Thereupon they devised this answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Jesus Christ in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his Kingly Office, and as Mediator, is called <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>the Son of God,</hi> (of which see <hi>Fest. Honnij Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Controv. Belgic.</hi> pag. 24. <hi>Ionas Schlichtingius contra Meis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerum</hi> pag. 436.) and that in the same respect he is worshipped, that in the same respect he is King, and that the Kingdom which the Scripture ascribeth to Jesus Christ, is onely as Mediator and Head of the Church, and that he hath no such Universal Dominion over all things as can prove him to be the eternal Son of God. This gave occasion to Orthodox-Protestant-Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, more fully and distinctly to assert the great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that which the Scripture saith of Christ, as he is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God; and that which it saith of him, as he is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: and particularly to assert a twofold Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and to prove from Scripture, that besides that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which Christ hath as Mediator, he hath another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom over all things which belongs to him onely as he is the eternal Son of God. This the <hi>Socinians</hi> to this day do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and stisly hold that Christ hath but one Kingdom, which he exerciseth as Mediator over the Church, and in some respect over all things; but by no means they admit that Christ as God
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95406:128"/>
raigneth over all things: But our Writters still hold up against them the distinction of that twofold Kingdom of Jesus Christ. See <hi>Stagmanni Photinianismus Disp.</hi> 27. <hi>quaest.</hi> 6.

               </p>
               <p>The Arguments to prove that distinction of the twofold Kingdom of Christ, are these:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, Those Kingdoms of which the one is accessory and adventitions to the Son of God, and which, if it were not, the want of it could not prove him not to be God: the other necessarily floweth from his Godhead, so that without it he were not God; are most different and distinct Kingdoms. But the Kingdom of Christ as Mediator, and the Kingdom of Christ as he is the eternal Son of God, are such. <hi>Ergo:</hi> If the Son of God had never received the Office of Mediator, and so should not have raigned as Mediator, yet he had been the natural Son of God; for this could not be a necessary consequence, He is the natural Son of God, Therefore he is Mediator; for he had been the natural Son of God, though he had not been Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and though man had not been redeemed. But if you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the Son of God raigns not as God with the Father and the holy Ghost, from everlasting to everlasting, then you must needs suppose that he is not the natural and eternal Son of God.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Those Kingdoms of which the one is proper and personal to Jesus Christ God-man; the other is not proper and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95406:128"/>
personal, but common to the Father and the holy Ghost, are most different and distinct Kingdoms. But the Kingdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ as Mediator, and his Kingdom as he is the eternal Son of God, are such. <hi>Ergo:</hi> That Kingdom which Christ hath as Mediator, by special dispensation of God committed to him, is his alone properly and personally: for we cannot say that the Father raigns as Mediator, or that the holy Ghost raigns as Mediator. But that Kingdom which Christ hath, as he is the eternal Son of God, is the very same consubstantially with that Kingdom whereby God the Father and God the holy Ghost do raign.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, He that hath a Kingdom which shall be continued and exercised for ever, and a Kingdom which shall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and exercised for ever, hath two distinct Kingdoms. But Jesus Christ hath a Kingdom which shall be continued and exercised for ever, namely, the Kingdom which he hath as the eternal Son of God; and another Kingdom which shall not be continued and exercised for ever, namely, the Kingdom which he hath as Mediator. <hi>Ergo:</hi> The eternity of the one Kingdom is not doubted of: But that the other Kingdom shall not be for ever exercised, that is, <note n="p" place="margin">Synt. pur. Theol. Desp. 26. thes. 35. <hi>Ipsi (Patri) suum queque Sceptrum Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorium seu oeconomieum traditurus dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium mere divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eadem glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria ae Majestate cum Patre, erga suos electos in aeternum exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat.</hi> Zach.

                     </note> that Christ shall not for ever raign as Mediator, is proved from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24, 25. Master <hi>Hussey</hi> pag. 35, 36, 37. goeth about to answer this Argument, which he confesseth to say something: and indeed it saith so much, that though he maketh an extravagant exception, <hi>(Doth it appear,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the Kingdom that he shall lay down to God his Father, is not over all the world?)</hi> yet he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeelds the Point, which I was then proving. <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the day of Judgement shall lay down all the Office of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torship.</hi> I hope he will not say that Christ shall lay down at the day of Judgement that Kingdom which he hath as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God. So then I have what I was seeking, that Christ hath one Kingdom as Mediator, another as the eternal Son of God. And whereas Master <hi>Hussey</hi> holdeth that Christ as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator raigns over all things as the Vicar of his Father, we shall see anon the weaknesse of his Arguments brought to prove it. Mean while, I ask, What then is that Kingdom which belongs to Christ as the eternal Son of God, and which shall
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95406:129"/>
not be laid down, but continued for ever? Let him think on this Argument, Whatsoever belongs to that Kingdom which shall be continued for ever, and shall not be laid down at the day of Judgement, doth belong to Christ, not as Mediator, but as the eternal Son of God. But the general Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, by which Jesus Christ exerciseth Soveraignty over all creatures without exception, doing to them and fulfilling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them all the good pleasure of his Will, belongs to that Kingdom which shall be continued for ever, and shall not be laid down at the day of Judgement. <hi>Ergo:</hi> That general Power and Dominion by which Jesus Christ exerciseth Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over all creatures without exception, doing to them and fulfilling upon them all the good pleasure of his Will; doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Christ, not as Mediator, but as the eternal Son of God. And thus I make a transition to another Argument.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, He that hath a Kingdom administred by and in Evangelical Ordinances, and a Kingdom administred by his Divine Power, without Evangelical Ordinances, hath two different and distinct Kingdoms. But Jesus Christ hath a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom administred by and in Evangelical Ordinances, and a Kingdom administred by his Divine power, without Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Ordinances. <hi>Ergo:</hi> Doth not Jesus Christ raign over the Devils and damned Spirits by his Divine Power, reserving them in chains of darknesse to the Judgement of the great day? But will Master <hi>Hussey</hi> say that Christ raigns over the Divels and damned Spirits as Mediator or by the same Kingdom by which he raigns in his Church by and in his Ordinances? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must needs say, That Christ hath one Kingdom as the eternal Son of God, another as Mediator.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, He that hath a Kingdom in subordination to God the Father, and as his Vicegerent; and another Kingdom wherein he is not subordinate unto, but equal with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath two most different Kingdoms. But Jesus Christ hath a Kingdom in subordination to God the Father, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Kingdom wherein he is not subordinate unto, but equal with God the Father. <hi>Ergo:</hi> The Kingdom which Christ hath as Mediator doth (in regard of the Office of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) constitute him in a subordination to his Father, whose
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95406:129"/>
Commandments he executeth, and to whom he gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Ministration. So that though he that is Mediator, being the eternal Son of God, is equal with the Father; yet as Mediator, he is not equal with the Father, but subordinate to the Father, which our Divines prove from these Scriptures, <hi>Isai.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>Behold my servant. Jo.</hi> 14. 28. <hi>My Father is greater then I.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>The Head of Christ is God:</hi> In the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration as Christ is our Head, God is Christs Head, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Christ is Mediator. But that Kingdom which Christ hath as he is the eternal Son of God, he holds it not in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to God the Father; but as being consubstantial with his Father, and thinking it no robbery to be called equal with God: So that in this consideration, the Father is not greater then he. Master <hi>Hussey</hi> pag. 37. saith of Christ, in respect of the Government which he hath as Mediator, <hi>He is as it were the Vicar of his Father.</hi> I hope he will not say so of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which Christ hath as the eternal Son of God. And pag. 27. he holds that Christ as Mediator is subject to God; <hi>But in the consideration that Christ is the second person of Trinity, so he is not inferior to God the Father.</hi> So that he himself cannot but yeeld my Argument.</item>
                  <item>Sixthly, If Christ hath a Kingdom in time dispensed and delegate to him, and unto which he was anointed, and hath another Kingdom which is not delegate nor in time dispensed, nor he anointed to it; but doth necessarily and naturally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the communication of the Divine nature to him by eternal generation: then he hath two most different Kingdoms, one as he is Mediator; another as he is the eternal Son of God. But Christ hath a Kingdom in time dispensed and delegate <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you speak of Christ as Mediator, God hath made him both Lord and Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 36. but as he is the eternal Son of God he is not <hi>Dominus factus;</hi> he is not made Lord and King, no more then he is made the natural Son of God. When the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist speaketh of that Kingdom which Christ hath as Mediator, he tels us of the anointing of Christ. <hi>Ps.</hi> 45. 6. <hi>The Scepter of thy Kingdom is a right Scepter:</hi> vers. 7. <hi>Thy God hath anointed thee with the oyle of gladnesse.</hi> But we cannot say that Christ was anointed to that Kingdom, which he hath as the eternal Son of God.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:95406:130"/>Seventhly, If the Scripture holds forth a Kingdom which Christ hath over all creatures, and another Kingdom which he hath over the Church onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it holds forth the twofold Kingdom which I plead for, and which Master <hi>Hussey</hi> denieth. But the Scripture holds forth <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Christ as he is <hi>God over all, blessed for ever, Rom.</hi> 9. 5. exerciseth Soveraignty and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all things, even as his Father doth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 3. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4 34, 35. for his Father and he are one. But as he is Mediator, his Kingdom is his Church onely, and he is <hi>over his own House, Heb.</hi> 3. 6. You will say the word <hi>onely</hi> is not in Scripture. I answer: When we say that Faith onely justifieth, the word <hi>onely</hi> is not in Scripture, but the thing is. Just so here: For, first, <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Eliakim</hi> were types of Christ the King. Now <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> did raign onely over Gods people as their Subjects, though they had other people tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries and subdued: So doth Christ raign over the House of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> onely, Luk. 1. 32, 33. <hi>The Lord shall give unto him the Throne of his Father</hi> David, <hi>and he shall raign over the house of</hi> Jacob <hi>for ever.</hi> Isai. 9. 7. <hi>Of the encrease of his Government and Peace there shall be no end, upon the Throne of</hi> David <hi>and upon his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to order it.</hi> Isa. 21. 22. <hi>I will commit the Government into his hand, and he shall be a Father to the Inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and to the house of</hi> Judah, <hi>and the key of the house of</hi> David <hi>will I lay upon his shoulder.</hi> 2. It was foretold and applied to the Church and people of God as a proper and peculiar comfort to the Church, that Christ was to come and raign as a King: Isai. 9. 6. <hi>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government shall be upon his shoulder.</hi> Zech. 9. 9. <hi>Rejoyce greatly O Daughter of</hi> Zion: <hi>Shout O Daughter of</hi> Jerusalem: <hi>Behold THY KING cometh unto thee.</hi> Matth. 2. 6. <hi>Out of thee shall come a Governour that shall rule my people</hi> Israel. 3. The <hi>Iews</hi> did generally understand it so, That the <hi>Messias</hi> was to be the Churches King onely, which made <hi>Pilate</hi> say to them, <hi>Shall I crucifie your King?</hi> And hence it was also, that the wise men who came to enquire for Christ, said, <hi>Where is he that is born King of the</hi> Jews? Matt. 2. 2.</item>
                  <item>Eighthly, That very place <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23. from which Master <hi>Coleman</hi> drew an Argument against us, doth plainly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95406:130"/>
hold forth a two-fold supremacy of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> one over all things, another in reference to the Church onely which is his body, his fulnesse, and to whom alone he is head, according to that Text: Of which more afterwards.</item>
                  <item>Ninthly, The Apostle <hi>Col.</hi> 1. doth also distinguish this two-fold preeminence, supremacy, and Kingdom of <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> one, which is universal, and over all things, and which belongeth to him as he is the eternal Son of God, vers. 15. 16. 17. <hi>Who is the Image of the Invisible God, the first born of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For by him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers: all things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</hi>

                     </note> Another which is oeconomicall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in and over the Church, and this he hath as Mediator: vers. 18. <hi>And he is the head of the body the Church: who is the beginning, the first born from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence.</hi> That vers. 18. he speaketh of <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator, is not controverted. But Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> pag. 35. would fain make it out (if he could) that <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator is spoken of, vers. 15. 16. 17. The Apostle indeed in that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did speak of <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator. But the scope of these three verses is to prove the God-head of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Yea, Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> himself yeeldeth, that as God and not as Mediator he did create the world. How can he then contend that the Apostle speaketh here of <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator? and why doth he find fault with my exposition that the Apostle speaketh here of <hi>Christ</hi> as God? Do not our Writers urge <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. 17. against the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Photinians,</hi> to prove the eternal God-head of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> because by him all things were created, and he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things.

Where you may see, that the Adversaries contend (as Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> doth) that the Apostle vers. 15. 16. 17. doth not speak of the person of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> proving him to be true God; but that he speaks of <hi>Christ</hi> as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator or in respect of his Office, and of that dominion which <hi>Christ</hi> hath as Mediator (So <hi>Ionas Schlichtingius contra Meisner.</hi> pag. 469.) and that vers. 15. 16. 17. ascribeth no more to <hi>Christ,</hi>

than vers. 18. But <hi>Becmanus</hi> answering <hi>Iulius,</hi> distinguisheth the Text as I do: for which Analysis I did formerly cite <hi>Beza, Zanchius, Gualther, Bullinger, Tossanus,</hi> M. <hi>Bayne,</hi> beside diverse others. But I have found none that understands the Text as Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> doth, except the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Photinians,</hi> who do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that <hi>Christ</hi> hath such an universall dominion and Lordship over all things, as God the Father, but onely that he ruleth over all things, as Mediator.
<p>Now for answer to that which Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> pag. 26. 27. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, to prove that <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator reigneth over all things, First, he tells us out of <hi>Diodati</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> is head of the Church, and King of the Universe, and out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that the Kingdom of <hi>Christ</hi> is over all, and filleth heaven and earth: But who denieth this? That which he had to prove, is, that <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator, is King of the Universe, and as Mediator his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is spread over all: and when he hath proved that, he hath another thing to prove, that the universality of <hi>Christs</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as he is Mediator, is to be understood not onely in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical notion, that is, so far as all Nations are or shall be brought under the obedience of the Gospel; but also in the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Civil Government, that is, that <hi>Christ</hi> reignes as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor over all creatures, whether under or without the Gospel: and that all Civil Power, Principality, and Government what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever in this World, is put in <hi>Christs</hi> hand as Mediator. If therefore he will argue, let him argue so, as to conclude the point.</p>
                     <p>The next objection he maketh, is from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. Christ as Mediator is made <hi>Heir of all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I answer, <hi>Christ</hi> is Heir of all things. 1. as the eternall Son of God, in the same respect as it is said of <hi>Christ</hi> in the next words of the same verse, that he made the world: and thus he may be called Heir of all things by nature, even as <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. he is called <hi>the first borne of every creature.</hi> 2. He is heir of all things as Mediator, for the Heathen and all the ends of the earth are given him for an inheritance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 8. but that is onely Church-wise, he shall have a Catholique Church gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of all Nations, and all kings and people, and tongues, and languages shall be made to serve him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:95406:131"/>Moreover <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> objecteth from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. that God hath put all things under <hi>Christs</hi> feet as he is Mediator. <hi>Answ.</hi> As this is not perfectly fulfilled in this World, but will then be fulfilled when <hi>Christ shall have put down all rule and all authority, and power:</hi> so in the measure and degree wherein it is fulfilled in this World, it concerneth not men onely, but all the works of Gods hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands.</hi> Which is taken out of the eighth <hi>Psalme,</hi> vers. 6. 7. <hi>Thou hast put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen &amp;c.</hi> Now how is it that the Apostle applyeth all this to <hi>Christ?</hi> How doth <hi>Christ</hi> rule over the beasts, fowles, fishes? <hi>Calvin in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27. 28. answereth, <hi>dominatur ergo, ut omnia serviant ejus gloriae. He ruleth, so as all things may serve for his glory.</hi> So then, all things are put under <hi>Christs</hi> feet as he is Mediator, both in regard of his excellency, dignity, and glory unto which he is exalted far above all the glory of any creature; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his power and over-ruling providence whereby he can dispose of all things so as may make most for his glory. But it is a third thing which <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> hath to prove, namely, that <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator exerciseth his office and government over all men as his Subjects, and over all Magistrates as his Deputies, yea over all things, even over the reasonlesse creatures; for by his arguing, he will have <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator to governe the sheep, oxen, fowles, and fishes: <hi>all things</hi> as well as <hi>all persons</hi> being put under <hi>Christs</hi> feet. But in the handling of this very argument <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> yeelds the cause. <hi>God is said to put all things under him,</hi> saith he, <hi>whereby it is implyed that all things were not under him, before they were put under him; but as the second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Trinity, so nothing could be said to be put under him, because they were in that respect alwaies under him.</hi> Is not this all one for substance with that distinction formerly cited out of <hi>Pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> of a two-fold Kingdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> one <hi>natural;</hi> as he is the second Person in the Trinity, another <hi>donative,</hi> as he is Mediator?</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>Lastly, <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> argueth from <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. 9. 10. <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator is exalted to have a name above every name, that at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> every knee may bow. <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is indeed <hi>a</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:95406:132"/>
                     <hi>dignity, glory, and power,</hi> as <hi>Diodati</hi> saith, above all things, but yet not a government or kingdom, as Mediator: for those who must bow the knee to <hi>Christ,</hi> are not onely things <hi>in heaven,</hi> that is, Angels, and things <hi>in earth,</hi> that is, men, but also things <hi>under the earth,</hi> that is, divells, yet divells are none of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Christs</hi> kingdom as he is Mediator. Therefore this Text proves not a Head-ship or Government over all, (which <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> contends for) but a power over all.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I will here anticipate another objection, which is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Mr. Hussey.</hi> It may be objected from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>that the head of every man is Christ.</hi> I answer, 1. Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this of <hi>Christ</hi> as God, and as the Creator of man. And if it be said that the latter clause <hi>the head of Christ is God,</hi> is meant of <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator, and not as God: yet <hi>Martyr</hi> tells us out of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that all these comparisons and subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this Text, are not to be taken in one and the same sence. 2. I grant also that <hi>Christ</hi> may be called the head of every man, not onely in respect of his God-head, but as Mediator, that is, the head of every man in the Church, not of every man in the World: for the Apostle speaks, <hi>de ordine divinitus sancito in Ecclesiae corpore mystico,</hi> as <hi>Mr. David Dicksone</hi> (an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who hath taken very good pains in the Textuall study of Scripture) saith upon the place. I shall clear it by the like formes of speech. <hi>Ier.</hi> 30 6. <hi>Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loyns? Luke</hi> 16. 16. <hi>The Kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth unto it.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staetion of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall. Heb.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Iesus did taste death for every man.</hi> Yet none of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are meant of every man in the World. 3. Yea in some sence <hi>Christ,</hi> as Mediator, may be called the head of every man in the World, that is, in respect of dignity, excellency, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, eminence of place, <hi>quia in hoc sexu ille supra omnes eminet,</hi> saith <hi>Gualther,</hi> or because no man hath parity or equality of honour with <hi>Christ:</hi> So <hi>Martyr</hi> and <hi>Hunnius.</hi> The English annotations say, that <hi>Christ</hi> is the Head of every man, <hi>in as much as he is the first begotten among many brtheren.</hi> Which best agreeth with my second answer.</p>
               <p>But for taking off all these, and for preventing of other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95406:132"/>
that one distinction will suffice, which I first gave in examining <hi>Mr. Colemans</hi> Sermon. In the Mediator <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> there is, 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, dignity, excellency, honour, glory, splendor. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his mighty power, by which he is able to do in heaven and earth whatsoever he will. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> his Kingdom, and Kingly-office or government. Which three as they are distinguished in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory:</hi> Why not in the Mediator also? In the first two respects, <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator is over all things, and so over all men, and so over all Magistrates, and all they in subjection to him. But in the third respect the relation is onely between <hi>Christ</hi> and his Church, as between <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom.</hi> So that the thing in difference, is that which <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, namely, that <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator doth not onely excell all things in glory, and exercise a supreme power and providence over all things, for his own glory, and his Churches good (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which is denied) but that he also is as Mediator, King, Head, and Governor of the Universe, and hath not onely the government of his Church, but all Civil government put in his hand. When <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> pag. 28. saith that I denyed pag. 43. what this distinction yeeldeth, namely, that <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator exerciseth acts of divine power in the behalf and for the good of his Church, it is a calumny: for that which I denied pag. 43. was concerning the Kingdom, not the power: my words were these. <hi>But as Mediator he is onely the Churches King, Head, and Governour, and hath no other Kingdom.</hi> Yea himsef, pag. 26. speaking to these words of mine, noteth that I did not say, that as Mediator he hath no such power. How commeth it to passe that he chargeth me with the denying of that, which himself but two pages before had observed that I denie it not?</p>
               <p>Well, but pag. 43, he desires from me a further clearing of my distinction, <hi>Kingdom, power, and glory,</hi> and that I will shew from Scripture, how it agreeth to <hi>Christ.</hi> I shall obey his desire: though it was before easie to be understood, if he had been willing enough to understand. <hi>Solomon</hi> did excell all the Kings of the earth in wisedom, riches, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and honour, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 12. and herein he was a type
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95406:133"/>
of <hi>Christ, Psal.</hi> 89. 27. <hi>I will make him my first born, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the Kings of the earth:</hi> But as <hi>Solomon</hi> was onely King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and was not by office or authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, a Catholique King over all the Kingdomes of the World, nor all other Kings <hi>Solomons</hi> Vicegerents, or Deputies: So <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> as Mediator is onely the Churches King, and is not King or Governour of the whole World, nor Civil Magistrates his Vicegerents, though he excell them all in dignity, glory, and honour. Again, <hi>David</hi> did subdue by power diverse States, Provinces, and Kingdoms, and make them tributary. But was <hi>David</hi> King of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and King of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and King of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and King of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> because he smote them and subdued them, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. Nay it is added, in that very place vers. 15. <hi>And David reigned over all Israel, and David executed justice and judgement unto all his people.</hi> (And this is one argument to prove that those subdued and tributrary Territories, were not properly under the government of Israel, because Israel was not bound to extirpate Idolaters out of those lands, but onely out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly land. See <hi>Maimonides de Idolol. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>sect.</hi> 1. with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation of <hi>Dionysius Vossius.</hi>) So <hi>Christ</hi> who was set upon the throne of <hi>David,</hi> doth as Mediator, put forth his divine and irresistible power in subduing all his Churches enemies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Psal.</hi> 2 9. <hi>Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in peeces like a Potters vessel. Rev.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>The Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings.</hi> But this <hi>vis major,</hi> this restraining subduing power makes not Christ, as Mediator, to be King and Governour, not onely of his Church, but of the whole World beside. Yea the power of Christ is over all things, as well as all persons, over all beasts, fowles, and fishes; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 7. 8. compared with <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 7. 8. Yea his power is over divells, meant by things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. Wherefore it cannot be said, that Christ as Mediator, is King, Head, and Governour of all those whom he excelleth in glory, or whom he hath under his power, to do with them what he will. It is a strange mistake when <hi>Mr, Hussey</hi> pag. 43. objecteth against this distinction, that a Kingdom without power and glory, is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95406:133"/>
a nominall empty thing. Surely there may be a Kingly right and authority to governe, where there is little either power or glory. But this is nothing to my distinction, which doth not suppose a Kingdom without power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor yet power and glory without a Kingdom, but onely that the Kingdom and Government is not to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all those whom the King excelleth in glory (for then one King that hath but little glory, shall be subject to a King that hath much glory:) or over whom the King exerciseth acts of power, (for then the King shall be King to his and his Kingdomes enemies) I verily beleeve that this distinction rightly apprehended, will discover the great mistakes of that supposed universall Kingdom of Christ, as Mediator, reigning over all things, and the Civil Magistrate as his Vicegerent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Come now therefore and let us try<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his strength in this great point. He holds that Christ as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator hath placed the Christian Magistrate under him, and as his Vicegerent, and hath given him commission to govern the Church, which if he or any man can prove from the Word of God, it will go far in the decision of the Erastian contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie: though this is not all which is incumbent to the Erasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to prove, for as I first replied to Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> fourth rule, the Question is, whether there be not some other government instituted and appointed by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to be in his Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Civil Government: and if it should be granted that Christ even as Mediator hath committed, delegated and institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95406:134"/>
Civil Government in his Church, yet they must further prove, that Christ hath committed the whole and sole power of Church-Government to the Magistrate, and so hath left no share of Government to the Ministery. But I can by no means yeeld that so much contended for Vicegerentship of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrate, and his holding of his Office of and under Christ as he is Mediator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Coleman</hi> in his re-examination pag. 19. was fearfull to set his foot upon so slippery ground. He was loth to adventure upon this a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sertion, that Magistracy is derived from Christ as Mediator by a Commission of Deputation and Vicegerentship (which yet did necessarily follow upon the fourth rule which he had delivered in his Sermon) Wherefore he made a retreat and held him at this, <hi>That Magistracy is given to</hi> Christ <hi>to be serviceable in his Kingdom.</hi> But out steps <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a great deal more: I much mistake if he shall not be made either to make a retreat as <hi>Mr. Coleman</hi> did, or to do worse.</p>
               <p>First of all, this part of our Controversie is to be rightly sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Question is not. 1. Whether the Magistrate be Gods Deputy or Vicegerent, and as God upon earth; for who denies that? Nor 2. Whether the Magistrate be Christs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty as Christ is God, and as he exerciseth an universall domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all things, as the Father and the holy Ghost doth. Here likewise I hold the affirmative. Nor 3. Whether the Christian Magistrate be usefull and subservient to the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, even as he is Mediator and King of the Church; for in this also I hold the affirmative, that is, that as every man in his owne calling, parents, masters, servants, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, souldiers &amp;c. being Christians, so the Magistrate in his eminent station, being a Christian, is obliged to endeavour the propagation of the Gospel, and the good and benefit of the Church of Christ. But the Question is, Whether the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrate be a Governour in the Church <hi>Vice Christi,</hi> in the room and stead of Jesus Christ as he is Mediator. Or (which is all one) Whether the rise, derivation, and tenure of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistracy be from Jesus Christ under this formall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as he is Mediator and head of the Church. Or (which
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95406:135"/>
is also the same) whether Jesus Christ by vertue of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power of Government which as Mediator, and as God-man, he received of the Father, hath substituted and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven commission to the Christian Magistrate to govern the Church in subordination to him, as he governeth it in subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his Father. In all these <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> is for the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I am for the negative. Let us hear his reasons. First pag. 16. He argueth from my concession. A Christian Magistrate is a Governour in the Church, said <hi>Mr. Coleman,</hi> This under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>sano sensu</hi> I admitted. Now saith <hi>Mr. Hussey, If the Church be Christs Kingdom, surely such as govern in it, must receive commission from him.</hi> Which commission saith he, must be in this forme. <hi>Christ the Mediator, King of his Church, doth appoint Kings and Civil Magistrates to govern under him.</hi> Let him find this commission in Scripture, and I shall confesse he hath done much. Neither doth any such thing follow upon my Concession. For 1. It is one thing to govern in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another thing to govern the Church: Christian parents, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Colledges, and the like, are Governours in the Church, that is, being within, not without the Church, yet as Parents or masters they are not Church-Governours. 2. I can also admit that the Christian Magistrate governeth the Church; and if this had been the concession, which is more then the other, it could not have helped him. For how doth the Magistrate govern the Church? not <hi>qua</hi> a Church, but <hi>qua</hi> a part of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wealth, as learned <hi>Salmafiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> distinguisheth, <hi>Appar. ad lib. de primat.</hi> pag. 292. 300. For the Common-wealth is not in the Church, but the Church in the Common-wealth, according to that <hi>Rev,</hi> 2. <hi>The Church in Smyrna, the Church in Pergamus, the Church in Thyatira.</hi> And suppose all that are members of the Common-wealth to be also Church-members, yet in an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall spread of the Gospel, the Church is governed by the Magistrate as it is a Common-wealth, not as it is a Church.

Christ shall come <hi>in sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, to take vengeance on all them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> but in that place they that obey not the Gospel, are those disobedient persons to whom the Gospel was preached: He cites also <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Iudge all the world according to my Gospel:</hi> but the Text saith not so; it saith, <hi>the secrets of men,</hi> not all the World. Wherefore as the Apostle there saith of the Law <hi>vers.</hi> 12. so say I of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as many as have sinned without the Gospel, shall also pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish without the Gospel; and as many as have sinned under the Gospel, shall be judged by the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He draweth an argument the strength whereof is taken from <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Ask of me and I shall give thee the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession:</hi> and from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15. our Lord Jesus Christ is said to be <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords:</hi> Jesus, Christ, being names that agree to him onely as Mediator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ as Mediator hath right to the whole earth, and all the kingdoms of the World, not as if all government (even civil) were given to Christ (for in this kind he governeth not so much as any part of the earth as he is Mediator) which was the thing he had to prove: but it is meant onely of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual kingdom, which is not of this world, and in this respect alone it is, that Christ as Mediator hath right to the government of all Nations, he hath <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> though not <hi>in re.</hi> As for that title <hi>King of kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood two wayes. First, as Christ is the eternal and natural Son of God, the eternal wisdom of God, by whom Kings reigne, and Princes decree justice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. 16. which is spoken of Christ, as he was the Fathers delight, and as one brought up with him before the foundation of the World: <hi>Ibid. vers.</hi> 22. to 30. Neither can the names of Jesus and Christ prove that what is said there must needs be meant of him as Mediator, mark how well grounded <hi>Mr. Husseys</hi> arguments are. <hi>Iesus sate at meat in Simon the Pharisees house. Luke</hi> 7. 37. <hi>Iesus wept for Lazarus because he loved him. Iohn</hi> 11. 35. 36. Must we needs therefore
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95406:136"/>
say, that as Mediator he sate at meat in the Pharisees house, and as Mediator he wept for <hi>Lazarus? Christ</hi> is the Son of <hi>David, Matth.</hi> 22. 42. Must we therefore say that as Mediator he is the Son of <hi>David?</hi> Christ is <hi>God over all, blessed for ever. Rom.</hi> 9. 5. Must we therefore say that this is meant of Christ onely as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator? What is more ordinary then to use the names of Jesus and Christ when the thing which is said is meant in reference to one of the natures? Secondly, Christ is <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> even as Mediator: not in <hi>Mr. Husseys</hi> sence, as if Kings had their commission from Christ, and did reigne in his stead, as he is Mediator; but in the sence of the Hebraisme, <hi>Vanity of vanities,</hi> that is, <hi>most vain; holy of holies,</hi> that is, <hi>most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> so <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> that is, the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent glorious King of all others: the excellency, splendor, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity, and majesty of Kings may be compared without any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination. <hi>Drusius Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>terit. lib.</hi> 8. upon this very place which <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> objecteth, saith that this forme of speech, <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> was taken from the Persians and Assyrians, who called a great King, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Kingdom of Christ</hi> saith <hi>Mr. Hussey, is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> ample as his Prophecy; but the Prophecie of Christ is extended to all Nations, as may appear by the commission, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> teach all Nations.</hi> But 1. I throw back the argument; Christs Kingdom and his Prophecie are commensurable: therefore as his prophecie is not actually extended to all Nations, except successively, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel commeth among them, so his Kingdom, as he is Mediator, is extended no further then the Church, not to all Nations. 2. His argument therefore is a miserable fallacy <hi>à dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter.</hi> Christs prophecy is extended to all Nations successively, and when the Gospel comes among them, therefore his Kingdom is simply extended to all Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is not bounded within the Church onely.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He tells us pag. 17. <hi>if kings may be called holy, if their Offices may be accounted holy Offices, or not sinful, they must be held off and under Christ. Answ.</hi> If he mean holy in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to civil, humane, worldly, secular, I denie the office of kings to be holy; if he mean holy in opposition to sinful, unlawful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95406:136"/>
(as it seems he doth) then I confesse the office of Kings is lawful not sinful, and themselves are holy when sanctified: but this proves not that they hold their office of and under Christ, more then carters or coblers hold their office of and under Christ: I am far from making a paralel between the Magistrate and these: but this I say, <hi>Mr. Husseys</hi> plea for the Magistrate is no other than agreeth to these. And where he addeth out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> Kings have place in the Church, and flock of Christ, and are not spoiled of their Crown and Sword that they may be admitted into the Church; this in reference to the conclusion he driveth at, is no more than if he had argued thus, carters and coblers have place in the Church and flock of Christ, and are not necessitated to quit their secular calling that they may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church of Christ, therefore they hold their offices of and under Christ.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He argueth thus, <hi>That Office which Christ hath declared to be of God, and bounded and limited in his Gospel, that Office is held under Christ as Mediator: But the Civil Magistrate is so, Rom.</hi> 13. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. His proposition is most false, and will never be proved. 2. If this argument hold good, then the Pagan Magistrate holds his office under Christ as Mediator (for of such Magistrates then in being, the Apostle meaneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.) So that either he must recall what he saith here, or what he saith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that the office of the Pagan Magistrate is sinful and unlawful. 3, By <hi>Mr. Husseys medium,</hi> one might prove that servants hold their office under Christ as Mediator, because he hath declared their office to be of God, and hath bounded and limited the same in his Gospel. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He saith they be the same persons that are under Christ, and under the Magistrate, and further, <hi>Christs ends and the Kings ends are both one,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>that we may lead a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and peaceable life in all godlinesse and honesty.</hi> Now either the office of the Mediators Kingdom is superior, or inferior, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, in reference to the Magistrates office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Very often they are not the same persons that are under Christ, and under the Magistrate. For 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11, 12. the Apostle distinguisheth those that were <hi>within,</hi> or those
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95406:137"/>
that were called brethren, from those that were <hi>without,</hi> both were under the Magistrate, both were not under Christ; and now the Jews in diverse places are under the Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, not under Christ. 2. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to offer indignity and dishonour to Jesus Christ. Kings are indeed appointed, that we may live under them a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and peaceable life in all godlinesse and honesty: But herein he hath answered himself pag. 29. <hi>the civil Magistrate may require of the people, that they will attend upon the means, out of natural Principles, Deum esse &amp; colendum.</hi> More of the ends of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy I have spoken before, whether I remit him. The ends of Christs Kingly Office are quite another thing; namely, to destroy all our soules enemies, Satan, the flesh, the wicked world, death, to put all his enemies under his feet; to send out his officers and ministers for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministery, for the edifying of the body of Christ, to govern his people by his Word and Spirit, and to keep them by the power of God through faith unto salvation. 3. The comparison between Christs Kingly office as Mediator, and the Magistrates office, is neither to be drawn from superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and inferiority, nor co-ordination; for they are <hi>disparata,</hi> and differ <hi>toto genere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I shall proceed for methods sake to examine other four Arguments from Scripture, upon which <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> (though he doth not joyn them to the former six) afterward layeth no small weight for upholding that opinion, that the Magistrate holds his office of and under Christ, as he is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>
               <p>The seventh argument therefore shall be that which he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. pag. 25. Whereunto I have two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, according to two different applications of that Text. When Christ said <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth,</hi> it may be understood either as he is Mediator, or as he is the second person in the blessed Trinity, the eternall Sonne of God. So when the Ubiquitaries would prove from that place the reall communication of Divine omnipotency to the humane nature of Christ, our Divines answer, the Text may
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95406:137"/>
be understood either of Christs person, God-man, or as he is the natural Son of God. See <hi>Gomarus</hi> upon the place. Now take the Text either way, it proves not what <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> would. Let it be understood of Christ as God-man, and as Mediator, (which is the most promising sence for him) yet it cannot prove that all power without exception, and all government as well <hi>without</hi> as <hi>within</hi> the Church, as well <hi>secular</hi> as <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,</hi> is put in Christs hand as he is Mediator, and that the civil Magistrate holds his office of and under Christ: but the sence must be <note n="r" place="margin">Greg. de Valenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Text will suffer yet a further restriction, namely that all power in heaven and in earth is said to given unto Jesus Christ, as he is the eternal Sonne of God, and that both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the eternal generation by which the God-head, and so all Divine properties (of which omnipotency is one) was from all eternity communicated from the Father to the Son: and in respect of the declaration or manifestation of him to be the Son of God with power, when God raised him from the dead. <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> saith he is astonished to hear that any thing should be given to Christ, as God; Where first of all I observe how miserably he mangleth and maimeth my words as in other places, so here; He citeth these words as mine, That Christ <hi>as he is eternal God, doth with the Father and the holy Ghost reigne over the Kingdoms of the earth, &amp;c. and this power was given &amp;c.</hi> It is not fair nor just dealing to change a mans words in a citation, especially when the change is materiall.

               <p>The eigth argument shall be that which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> did draw from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. to prove that Christ hath placed in his Church Magistrates or civil Governments.

                  </gap>ng of the Church, and am ready to prove it against any that will denie it: But upon supposition, that civil Government is meant in that Text, (which I utterly deny) I had reason to call the affirmer to his proper task, to prove from that Text, that Christ as Mediator hath placed civil Government or Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in his Church. This was the point it was brought for, and still I call to make good that proof, for I denie it. It seemes Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> finds himself puzzled to make it out, and therefore he saith, <hi>if Mr. Coleman will be ruled by me. so as</hi> Mr. Gilespie <hi>will not urge this for constitution of Church-Governments, he shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>My next answer was, that <hi>the Apostle speaks of such Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, as the Church had at that time; but at that time the Church had no Godly nor Christian Magistrates.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth that it cannot be proved <hi>that the Apostle speaketh of such Officers as were in the Church in his time onely.</hi> He addeth, <hi>I shall urge some few argaments to the contrary.</hi> To the contrary of what? I did not say that the Apostle speaketh of such Officers as were in the Church in his time onely: but that the Church at that time had all those Officers whom the Apostle speaketh of. One would think that he who censureth others so much for want of skill in disputations, should not so far mistake his mark. But we know what he would have said though he hath not hit it. Let us hear his arguments. First, he tells us that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> will signifie <hi>proposuit</hi> or <hi>decrevit,</hi> so that where we read <hi>God hath set in the Church,</hi> it may be read <hi>God hath appointed to his Church,</hi> so to take in those Governments which should afterward by Gods appointment come to the Church. He clears it by <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 21. <hi>Answ.</hi> Then the Apostle saith no more to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> then might have been said to the old world before the flood, for if the meaning be that God hath ordained and purposed, all this Text had been true, if delivered <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis terminantibus,</hi> to the old World, <hi>God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The context sheweth that the Apostle speaketh onely of such administrations, as the Church had at that time, for all this is spoken in reference to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95406:140"/>
of a Schisme in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that every member of that body might discharge its owne proper functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without usurping anothers. 3. He confuteth himself, for he addeth, <hi>This cannot be a Catalogue of such Officers as are at all times necessary to the Church, for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n Apostles might not be mentioned.</hi> Therefore it must be said, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this place is <hi>posuit</hi> or <hi>collocavit</hi> (according to the more usuall signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and doth relate to that present time, as well as <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>The holy Ghost hath made or set you overseers</hi>

                  </gap> be <hi>decrevit,</hi> then it will referre the Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Evangelists, miracles, to the future estate of the Church, as if they were ordinary Officers to continue in the Church. 4. When <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifieth <hi>decrevit,</hi> then the thing is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as having an actuall present existence, but a futurition; so that when he takes him to the <hi>decrevit,</hi> he quits the <hi>posuit,</hi> and by that means one cannot prove from that Text, that the Church at that time had any of these Officers there enumerated: <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>5. If he had intended to expresse Gods decree or purpose to give unto his Church certain Officers, he would not have said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  </gap> he might have rendred it so, but when the Text saith <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> he must not render it <hi>

               <p>The second Argument whereby he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that which I said, is this, <hi>at tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> time there were workers of miracl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s which did supply the defect of civil Magistrates.</hi> And here he insisteth a while to tell us that <hi>thus much a National Covenant and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:95406:140"/>
                  <hi>Magistrate may require of the people, that they will attend upon the means out of natural principles,</hi> which at that time miracles caused men to attend upon. But <hi>quid haec ad Rhombum?</hi> How comes this home to that which he undertook to prove? And if it did, I must say that the civil Magistrate is but little, and a National Covenant far lesse beholding to him. And if the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of miracles did at that time supply the defect of civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates (I suppose he should have said Christian Magistrates) then he must draw Christian Magistracy to come in succession not so much to the civil Magistracy in the Apostles times (which yet was true Magistracy) as to the miracles mentioned in the Text, and so bring in the Christian Magistrate upon the ceasing of miracles. A fine plea indeed for Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracie.</p>
               <p>His third Argument goeth thus, We have in the Text first, second, and third; when the Apostle speaks of these which might be liable to present view, but then he breaks off with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>after that miracles,</hi> which lasted somewhat longer then the Apostles and Prophets; and last we have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and these may be ordinary gifts, and this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> relates to helps, Governments: that <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks the helps <hi>were some Officers the Church hath lost: But being put both in one case without any conjunction copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, why they may not</hi> (I beleeve he would have said, <hi>why may they not?</hi> for the sence can be no other) <hi>belong both to one thing, and this</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>may not have some influence upon the times and after age. Answ.</hi> If this be his manner, we shall not much fear the dint of his Arguments, when it comes to the Schooles, which he calls for. What a great matter is made of meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? First, he offereth violence to the Text, because if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> note posteriority of time, and ordinary gifts, then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is compounded from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> must much rather note the same thing, and so we shall have not onely gifts of healing, but miracles too, ordinary and continuing administrations in the Church. Next he offereth violence to the Greek language: for when <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifie posteriority, not onely in the enumeration, but in the time of existence, then the one must needs signifie a pre-existence, and the other a post-existence, they cannot be contemporary from their beginnings; yet Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> will needs

have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> efore gifts of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diversities of tongues, to signifie posteriority of time, though he cannot say that gifts of healing and diversities of tongues were not contemporary but posterior in time to mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, And further observe that when the Text runs in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, &amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> will make this the sence, that there were Apostles before prophets, there were Prophets before teachers, there were Teachers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore miracles, there were miracles before gifts of healings, &amp;c. and <hi>vice versa,</hi> there were no gifts of healings till after there had been miracles, no miracles till after there had been Teachers in the Church, &amp;c. even as <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 28. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>first the blad</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>then the ear,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>after that the ful corn in the ear:</hi> the blade hath an existence before the eare, the eare before the full corne. So that taking <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in his sence, he must either make out distinctly the order of time, or else confesse he would make the Apostle speak as never Grecian in the world spake, or lastly be content to understand the Apostles words of the order of enumeration. If the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> had been in the Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that had indeed carried it to posteriority of time as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> (though sometime it signifieth posteriority of time, yet) in this place having reference to such antecedents and consequents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear his sence. I see it were no ill sport to examine his quint Arguments if a man had but so much leisure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He offereth violence to <hi>Calvin,</hi> for <note n="s" place="margin">Calv. in 1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>Aut certe tam munus quam domum olim su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, quod nobis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die est incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum: aut ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aconiam perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, hoc est curam pauperum.

                     </hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> saith that these helps mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. were either an ancient gift and office unknown to us now, or it belongs to Deaconship, that is, the care of the poor. And this second (saith he) rather pleaseth me. <hi>Qua fide</hi> then, could Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> affirm that <hi>Calvin thinks they were some Officers that the Church hath lost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whereas he thinks helps, governments, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long both to one thing, there was some such thing once foisted into the English Bibles: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was read thus, <hi>helps in Governments:</hi> but afterwards the Prelats themselves were ashamed of it, and so it was printed according to the Greek distinctly, <hi>helps, Govirnments.</hi> The Syriack addeth a copulative, and readeth thus, <hi>and helpers, and Governors,</hi> so
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95406:141"/>
making them distinct officers in the Church. Neither is it any unusual thing in the Greek, to put together Nouns in the same case without any conjunction copulative, when the things themselves so expressed are most different, as <hi>Matth. 15, 19. Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Rom.</hi> 1. 29, 30. 31.</p>
               <p>The next thing he brings against me, is from <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. where there is no ordinary or standing Officer left to us, but the Teacher of the Word: here is neither help nor government but this poor Teacher left alone to edifie the body of Christ, and to perfect the Saints. <hi>Answ.</hi> What Argument is there here? ruling Elders are not mentioned <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. therefore the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mentioned 1 <hi>Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 12. are such as the Church had not at that time. There are diverse passages of Christs doctrine, life, and sufferings, which are not mentioned by <hi>Matthew,</hi> yet they are mentioned by <hi>Iohn</hi> or some of the other Evangelists. So if we take the primitive platform right, we must set the whole before us, that which is not in one place is in another place. The Apostle <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. intendeth onely to speak of preaching officers who are appointed for this work of the Ministery, to bring us to unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, that we be not carried about with every wind of Doctrine, v 12 13, 14. And if the Apostle had intended to enumerate all Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in that place, which were then in the Church, how comes it he doth not mention Deacons which he distinguisheth from Bishops or Elders? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>His last Argument is, that in this very place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. the Apostle, when he doth again enumerate the particulars vers. 29. 30. he leaveth out <hi>helps, Governments,</hi> for which, he saith, he knows no reason, but because there were none such at that time, and the Apostle in that induction was to deal with their experience. This (as many other things which he hath) was before answered to Mr. <hi>Coleman.</hi> I give this plain reason for the omission of these two. The Apostle speaketh to those, who were not well satisfied nor contented with their owne station in the Church, but were aspiring to more eminent gifts and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations, <hi>are all Apostles?</hi> saith he, <hi>are all Prophets?</hi> &amp;c. and so he reckoneth out onely those rare and singular gifts, which men did most covet: and for that cause it was neither necessary,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95406:142"/>
nor had it been agreeable to the scope of the Apostle to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>are all helps? are all Governments?</hi> But now he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely leaveth out these, thereby intimating to the ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Deacons of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that they ought to be contented with their owne station, though they be neither Apostles, nor Prophets. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It remaineth therefore that the Governments in the Church mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. were such Governments as were in the Church at that time, and therefore not to be understood of Christian Magistracy: but of Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Government distinct from the civil.</p>
               <p>The ninth Argument brought to prove that all Government is given to Christ as Mediator, and that the Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate holds his office of and under Christ, as the head of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy and Principality, is from <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment first propounded by Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> is prosecuted by Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> pag. 32, 33. &amp;c. He demurres upon that which I said, that this place maketh more against him then for him; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof was no more then this, that this place doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afford us an Argument against him, then him against us. Come we to the particulars. My first Reply was, <hi>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith not that Christ is given to the Church, as the head of all Principalities and Powers. The Brother saith so, and in saying so he makes Christ a head to those that are not of his body.</hi> This exception Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> quarrelleth, but when he hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove from that Text that <hi>Christ</hi> is the head of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities: because he that is head of all things, is also head of Principalities: though he will never be able to make it out from that Text, that Christ (as Mediator) is head of all things, but onely, that he who is the Churches head is over all things; <hi>and gave him to be the head over</hi> (not of) <hi>all things to the Church,</hi> saith the Text, which as I told before, the Syriack readeth more plainly thus, <hi>and him who is over all, he gave to be the head to the Church.</hi>) At last he fairly gives over the proof. <hi>It is true</hi> saith he, <hi>disputations do require men to keep close to termes, but in Col. 2. 10. ye have the very words, head of all Principality and Power.</hi> In <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10. Christ as he is the eternall Son of God, is called head of all Principality and power: as we shall see anon: but
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95406:142"/>
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. where the Apostle speaketh of Christs headship, in reference to the Church, and as Mediator, he is not called the head of all Principality and Power. So that I had reason to except against Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> argument which made that Text <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. to say what it saith not. Now what saith he to the reason I added, can Christ be a head to them that are not of his body? He tells me the visible Church is not the body of Christ, but onely the faithfull. He might have observed the visible Church consisting of visible Saints, plainly spoken of, as the body of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16, 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 12, 12. 14 27. I know the visible Church is not all one with the invisible and mystical body of Christ; but he who denyeth the visible Church to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the visible, political, ministerial body of Christ, must also deny the visible Church to be the visible Church; for if a Church, then certainly the body of Christ, at least vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly.</p>
               <p>The next thing which I did replie, was in explanation of the Text, which was to this sence. He that is the Churches head, is over all, both as he is the Sonne of God, or as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith <hi>Rom. 9. 5. God over all, blessed for ever,</hi> yea even as man he is over or above all creatures, being exalted to a higher degree of glory, majesty, and dignity, then man or Angel ever was, or shall be: but neither his divine omnipotency, nor the height of glory and honour which as man he is exalted to, nor both these together in the Mediator and Head of the Church, omnipotency and exaltation to glory, can prove that (as Mediator) he exerciseth his Kingly office over all Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers, and that they hold of and under him as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> replieth that the Text makes Christ over or above Principalities and Powers, not onely in dignity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but as King or Head of them, and that thus we must understand the comparison, that he <hi>is above Principality in Principality, Power in Power, Might in Might, Dominion in Dominion.</hi> This is nothing but a begging of what is in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That the Power and Dominion of the civil Magistrate, is eminently in Christ as Mediator, and from him (so considered) derived to the Magistrate, is that which I deny can be proved from that Text; and lo when he comes to the point of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95406:143"/>
he supposeth what he had to prove. My exposition of the Text made good sence; For as an earthly King is exalted to have more power and more glory, then those not onely of his Subjects, but of another State or Kingdom to whom he is not King; so the Mediator and King of the Church is exalted to power and glory far above all Principality and Power, but is not therefore Head or King or Governor to all Principality and Power, as Mediator. And as me exposition makes good sence of the Text, his makes very bad sence of it. For if Christ as Mediator be head and King of all Principalities, powers, and Dominions, then he is, as Mediator, head and King of Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and Turkish Principality, Power, might, and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and when the Apostle wrote this to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> it must be granted (according to Mr. <hi>Husseys</hi> glosse) that Christ as Mediator was head and King of the Romane Emperour, and that <hi>Caesar</hi> held his office of and under Christ as Mediator: for if head of all Principality, how shall they except any?</p>
               <p>I further brought severall reasons from the Text it self. The first was this, <hi>The honour and dignity of Jesus Christ there spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, hath place not onely in this world, but in that which is to come (vers.</hi> 21) <hi>But the Kingdom and Government which is given to Christ as Mediator, shall not continue in the World to come.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> answereth <hi>pag.</hi> 41. this is <hi>Ignoratio el nehi,</hi> it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, <hi>that which belongeth to him in reference to the World to come, belongeth not to him as Mediator, therefore that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is given to him in reference to this World, is not given to him as Mediator.</hi> But still he beggs what is in Question, and divideth asunder what the Text coupleth together, <hi>not onely in this World, but also in that which is to come:</hi> here is a rising and heightning, but no contradistinction, nothing here of one exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in reference to the World to come, another in reference to this World: but that exaltation of Christ above every name that is named, (which this Text speaks of) beginnes in this World, and shall continue in the World to come. <hi>Calvin. in Eph. 1. 21. Seculi autem futuri disertam facit mentionem, ut si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificet non temporalem esse Christi excellentiam, sed aeternam. He makes expresse mention of the World to come, that he may signifie Christs excellency not to be temporal, but eternal.</hi> This doth well
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95406:143"/>
agree to the dignity, excellency, glory, and honour of Christ, but it cannot be said that Christ shall for ever continue in his Kingly Office as Mediator.</p>
               <p>The second reason which I fetcht from the Text, was from vers. 22. <hi>He hath put all things under his feet;</hi> that is, all things except the Church, saith <hi>Zanchius.</hi> But all things are not yet put under his feet, except in respect of Gods decree; It is not yet done actually. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. Now Christ reignes as Mediator before all things be put under his feet, not after all things are put under his feet, which is clear 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 25. Act.</hi> 2. 34, 35. Mr. <hi>Husseys</hi> reply <hi>pag.</hi> 41. 42. saith, that the Church is not here to be excepted, but Church and all is here put under Christs feet, which he proveth by <hi>Heb. 2. 8. He left nothing that is not put under him.</hi> But this cannot be understood to be actually done; for the next words say, <hi>But now we see not yet all things put under him:</hi> and if not done actually, but in respect of Gods decree and fore-knowledge, (according to the sence I gave out of <hi>Hierome</hi> on <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22.) how can it strengthen him in this particular? <hi>We see not yet.</hi> This <hi>yet</hi> shall not expire till the end, when Christ shall put down all authority and power. And now when it is said <hi>He hath put all things under his feet. Ephes.</hi> 1. 22. that the Church is not meant to be comprehended, but to be excepted in that place as <hi>Zanchius</hi> saith, may thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; the Apostle distinguisheth the <hi>all things</hi> from the <hi>Church,</hi> and calls the Church the body of Christ, and him the head to that body, but the <hi>all things</hi> are put under Christs feet (his body is not under his feet, but under the head) and he over all things: for so runs the Text, <hi>and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> distinguisheth between Christs putting all his enemies under his feet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25. and the Fathers putting all things under his feet, <hi>Ibid. vers.</hi> 27. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this latter to be an actual putting under him of friends, foes, Church and all, whence it seems he would have it to follow, that Christ reignes as Mediator, even after all things are put under his feet. He is herein easily confuted from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Where God the Father his putting all things under Christs
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95406:144"/>
feet, is plainly declared to be a thing to come, and not yet actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done.</p>
               <p>The next reason which I gave out of the Text was from those words, <hi>And gave him to be the head over all thiags to the Church;</hi> Christs headship and his Government as Mediator, are commensurable. <hi>Christ is a head to none but to his Church.</hi> These words of mine Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> changeth thus: <hi>he is head over none saith Mr.</hi> Gilespie, <hi>but his Church,</hi> and then he addeth, <hi>Is this to argue out of Scripture, or rather to deny and outface the Scripture? the Scripture saith, he is over all.</hi> See what uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable impudent boldnesse this is, to cite my words (yea in a different character too, that his Reader may beleeve it the better) and yet to change not onely my words, but my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I purposely kept my self to the Text, that Christ is a head to none but to his Church, yet he that is the Churches head is over all things. And since Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> will needs hold that Christ as Mediator is head of all things (which the Text saith not) what were the consequence hereof? The Text saith <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>over all things,</hi> not over all persons onely: So <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 7, 8. compared with <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 6, 7. Whence it followes by Mr. <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seys</hi> principles (which I tremble to mention) that Christ as Mediator is Head and King not onely of men, but of sheep, oxen, fowles, and fishes. Behold how dangerous it is for men to be wise above that which is written.</p>
               <p>The last reason which I brought from the last verse, was this, The Church is there called Christs fulnesse in reference to his Headship. This Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> saith, seemeth to come tolerably from the Text; but the next words, <hi>that which makes him full and compleat so farre as he is a Head or King:</hi> he calls a fallacy, <hi>How commeth this word King in here?</hi> saith he; First here he yeelds that the Church makes Christ full and compleat so farre as he is a Head, whence it followeth that as Mediator he is onely the Churches head, and there is no other body of Christ but the Church; for if the Church be his fulnesse, his compleat body, there can be no other body of Christ. Doth not this destroy what he hath been arguing for, that <hi>Christ</hi> as Mediator is head of all Principality and Power? And for the word <hi>King,</hi> it may well come in where <hi>Head</hi> commeth: for is not <hi>Christs</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:95406:144"/>
Kingdom as Mediator, commensurable with his Headship as Mediator? Is he as Mediator King to any to whom he is not Head? Surely this very answer as it is his last, so it really yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cause.</p>
               <p>The tenth objection is that which I my self moved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my Antagonists. Christ is called <hi>the Head of all Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Power, Col.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p>To this I answered out of <hi>Bullinger, Gualther,</hi> and <hi>Tossa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> the scope and meaning of the Apostle, is to shew that Christ is true God, and therefore we must not understand the Apostle to speak of Christs headship as he is Mediator, but as he is the natural and eternal Sonne of God. <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> pag. 34. thinks it is no good consequence, the Apostle speaks not of Christ as Mediator, because he speaks of him as true God, <hi>Is not Christ</hi> saith he, <hi>true God as Mediator?</hi> I answer, As Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator he is God-man. But he must remember the Argument is urged to prove the subordination of all Principality and power to Jesus Christ as Mediator. Now let him prove that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh there of Christ as Mediator; I say he speaketh of Christ as God; He cannot conclude against what I said, except he argue thus, that which Christ is as God, he is as Mediator; which is false, as I have made it appear else-where. Well: but <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> proves from the Text that Christ is there spoken of as Mediator. <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10. For <hi>in him dwelleth the fulnesse of the God-head bodily, and ye are compleat in him which is the head of all Principality and power.</hi> But he draweth no argument from the words. Neither is there any thing in them which maketh against me. The Apostle shews them, that the man Jesus Christ is also true God, equal and consubstantial with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for the very fulnesse of the God-head is in him, that is, he is fully and compleatly God, so that saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> they who desire something more then Christ, must desire something more then God. Wherefore our Writers make the right use of this place when they bring it against the Socinians, to prove the God-head of Christ. See <hi>Christian. Becman. exercit.</hi> 9. This fulnesse of the God-head is in Christ bodily, that is, either <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally,</hi> to distinguish him from the holy men of God, who were inspired by the holy Ghost; or <hi>substantially,</hi> as others
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95406:145"/>
take the Word, in opposition to the Tabernacle and Temple in which the God-head was <hi>typically. Ye are compleat in him,</hi> saith the Apostle, meaning because he is compleatly God, so that we need not invocate or worship Angels, as if we were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in Christ. <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> admitteth what I said concerning the scope of the place, to teach the <hi>Colossians</hi> not to worship Angels, because servants: <hi>But</hi> saith he, <hi>may they not worship Christ as Mediator? yes doubtlesse they may.</hi> No doubt he that is Mediator must be worshipped, because he is God; Christ God-man is the object of divine adoration, and his God-head is the cause of that adoration; but whether he is to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped because he is Mediator, or under this formall considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Mediator; and whether the Mediator ought to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adored with divine adoration, because he is Mediator, is <hi>res altioris indaginis.</hi> If <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> please to read and consider what divers School<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men have said upon that point, as <hi>Aquinas tertia part. quaest. 25. art. 1. &amp; 2. Alex. Alensis Sum. Theol. part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. quaest. 30. membr. 2. Suarez in tertiam part. Thomae Disp. 53. sect. 1. Valentia Comment. in Tho. Tom. 4. Disp. 1. quaest. 24. punct. 1.

Theol. Disp. 14. An Christus qua Mediator sit adorandus?</hi> Then I beleeve he will be more wary and cautious what he holds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Question. But I must not be ledd out of my way to multiply Questions unnecessarily: All that I said was, that the Apostle teacheth the <hi>Colossians,</hi> not to worship Angels, because they are servants, but Christ the Son of the living God, who is the Head and Lord of Angels; and in that place the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaketh of the honour which is due to Christ as God; and if we would know in what sence the Apostle calls Christ the Head of all Principality and Power, see how he expounds himsel <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17. speaking of the God-head of Jesus Christ. Finally, If <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> will prove any thing from <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 10. against us, he must prove that those words <hi>which is the head of all Principality and power,</hi> are meant in reference not onely to the Angels, but to Civil Magistrates;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95406:145"/>
and next, that they are meant of Christ, not onely as God, but as Mediator. Both which he hath to prove, for they are not yet proved.</p>

               <p>MY Arguments against the derivation of Magistracy from Jesus Christ as Mediator, and against the Magistrates holding of his office of and under Christ as Mediator, are these.</p>
               <p>First, This Doctrine doth evacuate and nullifie the civil Authority and Government of all Heathen or Pagan Magistrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; for which way was the authority of Government derived from Christ, and from him as Mediator, to a Pagan Magistrate or Emperour? If he hath not his power from Christ as Mediator, then he is but an usurper, and hath no just title to reign, according to their Principles which hold that all government, even civil, is given to C rist, and to him as Mediator. <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth doth learnedly yeeld the argument, and answereth pag. 20. that not onely it is a sin to be a Heathen, but the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Heathen is sinfull and unlawfull, for which he gives this reason, <hi>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</hi> He might as well conclude, in that sence, that the best vertues of the Heathen were sin, because not of faith, that is, <hi>accidentally</hi> sin, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the end, or manner of doing, not <hi>materially,</hi> or in their own nature. Vpon the same reason he must conclude, that the government of a Christian Magistrate is unlawfull, if it be not of faith, as oftimes it is not, through the blindnesse and corruption of mens hearts who govern. But whether is
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95406:146"/>
the government of a Heathen Magistrate <hi>per se, simpliciter, &amp; ex natura sua,</hi> unlawful and sinful? Whether hath he any just right or title to Government and Magistracy? If his title to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistracie be just, and if his government be in it self ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially and substantially lawful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he must have a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from Christ, and from him as Mediator: This I suppose cannot be <hi>Mr. Husseys</hi> sence, for he hath not answered one syllable to the argument, tending that way. But if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of an Heathen Magistrate be in it self materially, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially, and in the nature of the tenure, sinfull and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, so that as long as he remains an Heathen, he hath no reall right, nor true title to Government, but onely a pretended and usurped title (which must needs be <hi>Mr. Husseys</hi> sence, if he hath answered any thing at all to my Argument) then he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth crosse not onely to the holy men of God in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who honoured Heathen Princes, and were subject to them as to lawful Magistrates; but also to the doctrine of Jesus Christ, who taught his Disciples to give unto Caesar what is Caesars; and of the Apostles who in their time exhorted the Churches to be subject even to Heathen Magistrates (for they had no other at that time) to obey them, to pray for them. <hi>Rom. 13. Titus 3. 1. 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. 17. It is justly condemned as one of the errors of the Anabaptists, that an heathen Magistrate is not to be acknowledged as a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Magistrate, or as being from God. See <hi>Gerhard loc. com. Tom. 6. Pag. 498 499 P. Hinkelmannus de Anabaptismo disp. 13. cap.</hi> 1. The Scriptures now cited are so clear, that when <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> saith of the heathen Magistrate, <hi>Let Baal plead for himself,</hi> he might as well have said, that Christ and his Apostles pleaded for Baal. They that plead for the authority of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Magistrate do not plead for Baal, but for God, and for his ordinance: for <hi>the powers that be, are ordained of God,</hi> saith <hi>Paul</hi> speaking even of the heathen Magistrates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. But what will <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> say, if his great master <hi>Erastus</hi> be found a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Baal, as much as I am? <hi>Confirm. Thes. lib. 3. cap. 2. pag.</hi> 184. speaking of the heathen and unbeleeving Magistrates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the <hi>Corinthians</hi> went to law one against another, he saith, <hi>An non est impius quoque Magistratus à Deo praepositus,</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:95406:146"/>
                  <hi>ut subjectes quoslibet ab injuria &amp; vi tueatur? Is not the ungodly Magistrate also preferred by God, that he may defend any of his Subjects from injury and violence.</hi> Yea the Scriptures afore touched are so clear in this point, that <hi>Gamachaeus in primam se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda Quaest. 4. &amp; 5. cap.</hi> 33. though he hold that by humane and Ecclesiastical right, Pagan Princes lose their dominion and authority over their Subjects, when their Subjects turne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; yet he acknowledgeth that they still retain their former Jurisdiction over those Subjects, by the Law of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Surely one might as well say, that heathen Parents are unlawful, and heathen masters are unlawful, and heathen husbands are unlawful; (all which were contrary to the Word of God) as to say that heathen Magistrates are unlawful. Take the instance in Parents, for all lawful Magistrates are fathers by the fifth Commandement. Doth the paternity of a heathen father <hi>differre specie,</hi> from the paternity of a Christian father? are they not both lawful parents, being made such by God and nature? are not their children bound to honour them, and be subject to them, and obey them in things lawful? The pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is the same <hi>in se,</hi> but different <hi>modaliter</hi> that I may borrow a distinction from <hi>Mr. Hussey.</hi> The Christian father is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and qualified to do service to Jesus Christ, as a father, in educating his children Christianly, which an heathen father can not do. So the heathen Magistrate, and the Christian Magistrate are both lawful Magistrates, being made such by God and nature, or by election of people: they are both of them to be honoured, submitted unto, and obeyed, they are both of them the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of God for good to their people: their power is the same <hi>in actu signato,</hi> though not <hi>in actu exercito.</hi> The heathen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate may do and ought to do what the Christian Magistrate doth; but the Christian Magistrate is fitted, qualified, enabled, and sanctified to glorifie and serve Jesus Christ, as a Magistrate, which the heathen Magistrate is not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They that hold the derivation of Magistracy to be from Jesus Christ, and that it is held of and under him as Mediator, must either shew from Scripture that Jesus Christ as Mediator hath given a commission of Vicegerentship or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putyship to the Christian Magistrate, or otherwise acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95406:147"/>
that they have given the most dangerous and deadly wound, even to Christian Magistracy it self, which ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it received. <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> pag. 20 answereth, <hi>I conceive he</hi> (the Christian Magistrate) <hi>hath a Commission from Christ:</hi> but when he should prove it (which my argument calld for) here he is at a losse. He citeth <hi>Psal. 72<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. All Kings shall fall downe before him, all Nations shall serve him. Isa. 60. 12. That Nation and Kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish.</hi> I hope indeed there is a time comming when all Kings shall fall down before Jesus Christ, and all Nations shall serve him, and that will make an end of the Erastian controversie. But I pray, do all that serve Jesus Christ, hold their office of and under Christ, as Mediator, and as his Vicegerents? then the poorest servant that fears God shall be a Vicegerent of Jesus Christ, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and shall have a commission from Christ to that effect, for every godly servant doth not serve his master onely, but Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7. Again, if those who shall perish because they serve not Christ, be his Deputies and Vicegerents; then the wickedest persecuters in the World shall have a commission of Vicegerentship from Jesus Christ. Well, let the Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate animadvert, whether these men have done any thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy service to Magistracy, who will needs have it to hold of and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er Christ as Mediator, and by a commission of Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerentship from him; and when they are put to it, to produce that commission, they prove no more then agreeth either to the meanest Christian, or to the wickedest persecuter. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery hath a clear undeniable commission from Christ as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator (even our opposites themselves being Judges) <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. and 28. 19. 20. <hi>Iohn 20. 21, 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23. 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. Eph. 4. 11, 12. Act. 20. 28. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. I say therefore again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let them also shew from Scripture a commission from Jesus Christ constituting Christian Magistrates to be his Vicegerents as he is Mediator, and to hold their office of and under him as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: which if they cannot shew, they have done a greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service to the Christian Magistrate, then they can easily repair or amend: We are sure the lawful Magistrate (whether Heathen or Christian) is Gods Vicegerent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that is a safe holding of his office. But our opposites shall never prove, that any civil
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95406:147"/>
Magistrate (though Christian and godly) is the Vicegerent of Jesus Christ as Mediator. And in seeking to prove it, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded they shall but discover their own weaknesse, and shall also weaken the Magistrates authority more then they can strengthen it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Scripture intimateth this difference between Ministery and Magistracy; that the work of the Ministery and the administrations thereof are performed in the name of Jesus Christ as Mediator and King of the Church: the work of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy not so, except we adde to the Word of God; they who will do any thing in the Name of Jesus Christ as Mediator, and cannot find any Scripture which can warrant their so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are lyars, and the truth is not in them. Now let our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites shew (if they can) where they find in Scripture, that the Christian Magistrate is to rule in the name of Christ, to judge in the name of Christ, to make laws in the name of Christ, to make war or peace in the name of Christ, to punish evil doers with the Temporal Sword in the name of Christ. Of the Ministery I did shew, that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we do assemble our selves together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20. in his name doe we preach, <hi>Luk. 24. 47. Act.</hi> 4. 17, 18. and 5. 28. 44. and 9. 27. In his name do we baptize, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. and 8. 16. and 19. 5. In his name do we excommunicate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. These my proofs from Scripture <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> pag. 21. professeth he will examine according to laws of disputation. I know none trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth those laws more than himself, and even in this very place where he professeth to keep close to lawes of disputation: my first proof from <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20. he quarrelleth upon a meer mistake of his owne. He saith I brought it to prove the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-officers, and that to prove it, I do appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the meeting in the name of hCrist to Church-Officers, and thereupon he tells us the Text saith not, that none shall gather together in my name but Church-Officers. Are these <hi>Mr. Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seys</hi> lawes of disputation? He had need to be a better disputer who calls others to School. I did not speak here of the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-Officers, and far lesse did I exclude all others from meeting in the name of Christ; Church-officers assemble in the name of Christ with the Church; and when they assemble
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95406:148"/>
in the name of Christ apart, and without the multitude, will it follow that because they meet in the name of Christ, therefore none but they meet in the name of Christ. Well, let <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> try all his Logick in this consequence, it will not do. The sixth general Councell, <hi>Actione</hi> 17. apply unto their owne oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Assembly, that promise of Christ <hi>Matth. 18. 20. Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, &amp;c.</hi> Protestant Writers both in their Commentaries, and Polemick Writings, do usually apply the same Text to Synods and Councells: For instance, <hi>Calvin. Instit. lib. 4. cap. 9. sect</hi> 1. &amp; 2. holds that the authority of Councells dependeth upon that promise of Christ, <hi>Where two or three are met together in my name, &amp;c.</hi> That which went before, carries it to Assemblies for acts of discipline, as being principally intended in that place. The promise ver. 20. is general, belonging to all Church Assemblies: yet in that place it is applyed to Assemblies of Church-Officers for discipline. But neither need I go so far in this present argument; for when Church-Officers meet with the Church for the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other parts of Worship, this is in the name of Jesus Christ, without all controversie, and this is enough to justifie all that I brought that Text for; especially there being herein a difference between sacred and civil Assemblies: there is no such promise made to Magistrates Courts of Justice, as to Church Assemblies. That which he citeth out of Dr. <hi>Whittaker</hi> and Bishop <hi>Mortoun</hi> makes nothing against me, neither doth he quote the places, peradventure because he found something in those passages which made against him. <hi>Whittakers</hi> sence is plainly of sacred, and not of civil Assemblies. And for that so much controverted Text <hi>Matth. 18. 17. Tell the Church. Whittaker</hi> expoundeth it as we do against the Erastians, <hi>Tell the Pastors and Rulers of the Church. Whittak. de Eccles. quaest. 1. cap. 2. Dic Ecclesiae, hoc est Pastoribus &amp; Praefectis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for preaching, Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> saith, it is out of question that we preach in the name of Christ. Well: then let him shew such another thing of the Magistrate, as is without controversie done by him in the name of Christ.</p>
               <p>But where I added, that in the name of Jesus Christ we
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95406:148"/>
baptize, though I said no more then the Scripture saith, yet he is pleased to object against me. <hi>These places he citeth</hi> saith he, <hi>to prove that we baptize in the Name of Jesus, as exclusively to Father and holy Ghost, (leaving out the words of the commission: Matth. 28. Baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost) for so the state of his question doth require; for he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth acutely and acurately between Christ as Mediator and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person</hi> (he should have said <hi>as second Person) in Trinity, in all this Argument.</hi> And so he concludes that which I had said to be <hi>contrary to the words of the Commission and the practice of all Churches.</hi> What doth he drive at? I cited plain Texts to prove that baptisme is administred in the name of Christ: Either <hi>Mr. Hussey</hi> denyeth that this is done in the name of Christ as Mediator: or he denyeth it not. If he denie it, let him speak it out, and he shall not want an answer. Mean while let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that himself pag. 25. saith, that Christ as Mediator did give that commission to the Apostles, <hi>Go Preach and baptize.</hi> If he denie it not, then let him give the like instance for Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy and civil Government, to prove it to be managed in the name of Jesus Christ as Mediator, else he must not plead that Magistracy is of the same tenure from Christ as the Ministery. Again, either he admitteth a distinction between Christ as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and as second person in Trinity, or not. If he doe not, he will infallibly wind himself into a grosse heresie; as namely these two. 1. He must denie that principle which according to the Word of God, all Orthodox Divines hold against the Arrians and Antitrinitarians, that <note n="t" place="margin">Synop. pur. Theol. Disp. 26. Thes. 29. <hi>Tametsi ob istam mediationem fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Dei minor sit Patre, non propterea ipso minor est quoad Deitatem.</hi>
                  </note> Christ as Mediator is subordinate unto, and lesser then the Father; but as second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Trinity he is not subordinate unto nor lesser then the Father, nor the Father greater then he, but as such he is equal with the Father in greatnesse, glory, and honour. 2. As <hi>opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa,</hi> he must also hold that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Christ as Mediator doth, that also the Father and the holy Ghost doth: but Christ as Mediator did humble himself to the death, offer himself in a sacrifice for sin, maketh intercession for us, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he must conclude the Father doth the same. But if he do admit the distinction as Mediator, and as second person in Trinity, then why doth he so often quarrell it? And in this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95406:149"/>
very place his Argument must drive against that distinction, or against nothing. But how doth the baptizing in the name of Christ as Mediator, agree with the commission to baptize in the name of the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Son, and holy Ghost? Though this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to my Argument, yet I will by the way speak to it. First I say, the Question is of things or actions, not of words. Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> (it seems) did apprehend my meaning, as if I had intended an expression to be made in the act of baptizing, thus, <hi>I baptize thee in the name of Iesus Christ.</hi> But I spake of the action, not of the expression, even as in the other instance I gave; our assembling together is in the name of Christ, though we do not say <hi>in terminis, We are now assembled in the name of Christ.</hi> In baptisme Christ doth not command us to say, either these words, <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of Christ;</hi> or these words, <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost:</hi> but we are commanded to do the thing, both in the name of Christ as Mediator, and in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost: But in different respects. A minister of Christ doth both preach and baptize in the name of Christ as Mediator, that is <hi>vice Christi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in Christs stead, and having authority for that effect from Christ as Mediator; for Christ as Mediator gave us our commission to preach and baptize by Mr. <hi>Husseys</hi> confession. So that to preach and baptize <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which we find both of preaching, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24 47. and of baptizing, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38.) comprehendeth a formall commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, power and authority given and derived from Christ, I say not that it comprehendeth no more, but this it doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. But when Christ biddeth us baptise <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>unto,</hi> or <hi>into,</hi> or <hi>in the name</hi> of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. this doth relate to the end and effect of baptisme, or the good of the baptized (if we understand the words properly) not the authority of the baptizer, as if a formall commission were there given him from the Father, Son, and holy Ghost. So that to baptize one <hi>in</hi> or <hi>unto</hi> the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, is properly meant both of sealing the parties right and title to the enjoyment of God himself, as their God by covenant, and their interest in the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the communion of the holy Ghost; and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95406:149"/>
the party to the knowledge, profession, saith, love, and obedience of God, the Father, Son, and holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>I return, The next branch of my Argument was that we excommunicate in the name of Christ 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 5. Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> pag. 22. saith I make great hast here, <hi>deliver to Sathan</hi> saith he <hi>is not to excommunicate, &amp;c. But grant that it were excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp;c. the decree was Pauls, and not the Corinthians.</hi> What is meant by delivering to Sathan, belongs to another debate. Call it an Apostolicall act, or call it an Ecclesiasticall act, or both, yet it was done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; the like whereof we find not in Scripture of any act of the civil Magistrate. Why doth he not attend to the drift of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And as to his exceptions <note n="u" place="margin">Synops. pur. Theol. Disp. 42. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll. 4. <hi>An Apostolus Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus cum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem incestuojum Satanae tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That the Apostle commandeth to excommunicate the incestuous man, is acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Prynne.</hi> That he who is excommunicated may be truly said to be delivered to Sathan, is undeniable; for he that is cast out of the Church, whose sins are retained, on whom the Kingdom of heaven is shut and locked, whom neither Christ nor his Church doth owne, is delivered to Sathan, who reignes without the Church. That this censure or punishment of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a Church act, and not an Apostolicall act onely, may thus appear. 1. The Apostle blameth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that it was not sooner done; he would not have blamed them, that a miracle was not wrought. 2. He writeth to them, to do it when they were gathered together, not to declare or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse what the Apostle had done, but to joyne with him in the authoritative doing of it, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. 5. again he saith to them vers. 7. <hi>Purge out therfore the old leaven.</hi> vers. 12. <hi>Doe not ye judge them that are within?</hi> vers. 13. <hi>Put away from among your selves that wicked person.</hi> 3. It was <hi>a censure inflicted by many,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6 not by the Apostle alone, but <hi>by many.</hi> 4. The Apostle doth not absolve the man, but writeth to them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. Lastly, the Syriack maketh for us, which runneth thus, vers. 4. <hi>That in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you all may be gathered together, and I with you in the Spirit, with the power of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> vers. 5. <hi>That you may deliver him to Sathan. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:95406:150"/>But now at last Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> comes home, and gives this answer to my third Argument. <hi>A thing may be said to be done in the name of Christ or of God, when men do any thing in confidence that God will assist us: so Psal.</hi> 20 5. <hi>In the name of our God will we set up our banners in confidence God will assist us: Thus I hope the Parliament and other Christians may undertake the businesse in the name of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, <hi>In the name of Christ a thing is said to be done, that is done in the authority, room, and place of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. So he pag. 24. seeking a knot in the rush. In the first part of his distinction, he saith nothing to my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, neither saith he any more of the Parliament then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to all Christians, the poorest and meanest; for every Christian servant, every Christian Artificer is bound to do whatsoever he doth, in the name of Christ, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 17. But what is that to the Argument? Come to the other member of his distinction. The Ministers of Christ do act in the name of Christ: that is, in the authority, room and place of Christ; We are Ambassadors for Christ, and we preach in Christs stead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. This he doth not nor cannot denie: (which makes good my Argument;) Why did he not shew us the like concerning Magistracy? I suppose he would, if he could: this is the very point which he had to speak to, but hath not done it.</p>
               <p>My fourth Argument against the Magistrates holding of his office of, and under, and for Christ, that is, in Christs room and stead as Mediator, shall be that which was drawn from <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 14. The Jewes were of the same opinion, which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> have followed, namely, that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil government should be put in the hands of Christ, which they collected from <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>He shall execute justice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the earth;</hi> and such other Prophecies by them mis-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. And hence it was that one said to Christ, <hi>Master, Speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me.</hi> Our Lords answer was, <hi>Man who made me a Judge or a divider over you.</hi> Whatsoever act of authority is done by a Deputy or Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, as representing his Master and Soveraigne, may be done by the King himself when personally present: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Magistrate judge civil causes, and divide inheritances,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95406:150"/>
as the Vicegerent of Christ, and of Christ as Mediator, then Christ himself, when present in the dayes of his flesh, had power as Mediator to judge such causes. But this Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self plainly denyeth. Let us hear Mr. <hi>Husseys</hi> answer, pag. 24. (It is the very same with that which <hi>Azorius Instit. mor. part.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. (pleading for the Popes Temporall Dominion) answereth concerning the point now in hand) <hi>It doth not follow that because Christ was not a Iudge actu exercito, therefore the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall right of Government was not in him: And this Objection may be answered thus, Christ doth not say he was not a Iudge, but who made me a Iudge? how dost thou know that I am a Iudge? And thus Christ in the time of his humiliation did often hide the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of his power.</hi>

               <p>The fifth Argument I take from <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 36. <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> The great jealousie and fear which both <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> had of Christ; was, that they understood he was a King. Christ clears himself in this point, his Kingdom was such as they needed not be afraid of, for though it be <hi>in the World,</hi> it is not <hi>of the World;</hi> though it be <hi>here,</hi> it is not <hi>from hence,</hi> it is heterogeneous to Temporal monarchy and civil Government. Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> pag. 24. tells us, he knows not how those Governments that should be executed by Church-Officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should savour lesse of the World then the civil Government. For this I remit him to those many and great differences, which I have shewed between the civil and the Ecclesiastical Power. In the mean while my argument stands in force; For if all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government were put in Christs hand as he is Mediator, and he to depute and substitute others whom he will under him; then what is there in that answer of his to <hi>Pilate,</hi> which could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly answer those mistakes and misapprehensions of the nature of his Kingdom. That which is now taught by Master <hi>Hussey,</hi> is the very thing which <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were afraid of: but Christ denyeth that which they were afraid of: and vers. 36. is an answer to the Question asked, vers. 33. <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?

               <p>Sixthly, I prove the point from <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 20, 21. <hi>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God should come; he answered them and said, The Kingdom of God commeth not with observation. Neither shall they say loe here, or lo there; For behold the Kingdom of God is within you.</hi> By the Kingdom of God is meant in this place the kingdom of the Messiah, as Interpreters do unanimously agree. Both <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and Chrst himself had preached, that the Kingdom of God was at hand; and the Jews themselves were in expectation of the Messiah to make them free from the Roman yoke, and to restore a temporal or earthly monarchy to Israel. Hereupon they aske when this Kingdom should come. His answer is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God commeth not</hi>

                  <hi>with observation,</hi> or <hi>outward shew</hi> and pomp, but it is within you, it is spiritual, it belongs to the inward man. But if the Magistrate be Christs Vicegerent, and hold his office of and under Christ as Mediator, and if Christ as Mediator reigne in, through and by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, then the Kingdom of the Messiah doth come with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and pomp, with a crown, a scepter, a sword, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with princely splendor, riches, triumph, such as the Pharisees then, and the Jews now do expect: which saith <hi>Grotius</hi> is the thing that Christ here denieth; For all the outward pomp, observation, splendor, majesty, power, and authority, which a Vicegerent hath, doth principally redound unto his Master and Soveraign: So that by our opposites prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the Kingdom of Christ must come with observation, because the dominion of the Magistrate (whom they hold to be his Vicegerent) commeth with observation.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Government and authority which hath a foundation in the law of nature and Nations (yea might and should have had place and been of use, though man had not sinned) cannot be held of and under and managed for Christ as he is Mediator. But Magistracy or civil Government hath a foundation in the law of Nature and Nations (yea might and should have had place and been of use though man had not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) <hi>Ergo.</hi> The reason of the proposition, is because the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95406:152"/>
law of nature and nations, and the law which was written in mans heart in his first creation, doth not flow from Christ as Mediator, but from God as Creator: neither can it be said that Christ as Mediator ruleth and governeth all nations by the law of nature and nations, or that Christ should have reigned as Mediator, though man had not sinned. The Assumption is proved by <hi>Gerhard loc. com. Tom.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 459. 460. 474 In the state of innocency there had been no such use of Magistracy as now there is; for there had been no evil doers to be punished, no unruly persons to be restrained; yet as the wife had been subject to the husband, and the son to the Father, so no doubt there had been an union of diverse families under one head, man being naturally <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Eightly, If the Scripture hold forth the same derivation or origination of Magistracy in the Christian Magistrate and in the heathen Magistrate, then it is not safe to us to hold that the Christian Magistrate holds his office of and under Christ as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. But the Scripture doth hold forth the same derivation or origination of Magistracy in the Christian Magistrate, and in the Heathen Magistrate. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The proposition hath this reason for it, because the Heathen Magistrate doth not hold his office of and under Christ as Mediator; neither doth Mr. <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> herein contradict me: onely he holds the heathen Magistrate and his Government to be unlawful: wherein he is Anabaptisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and is confuted by my first Argument.

               <p>THe new notion that the Christian Magistrate is a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officer, and Magistracy an Ecclesiastical as well as a civil administration, calls to mind that of the Wise-man; <hi>Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See this is new? it hath been already of old time which was before us. Plato</hi> in his <hi>Politicus</hi> (a little after the middle of that book) tells me, that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were also Priests, and that in many Cities of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the supream Magistrate had the administration of the holy things. Notwithstanding even in this particular there still ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth some new thing under the Sun. For <hi>Plato</hi> tells me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>Epist.</hi> 8. that those supreme Magistrates who were Priests, might not be present nor joyne in criminall nor capitall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lest they (being Priests) should be defiled. If you look after some other President for the union of civil and ecclesiastical Government, secular and spirituall administrations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in one and the same person or persons, perhaps it were not hard to find such presidents, as our opposites will be ashamed to owne.</p>
               <p>I am sure Heathens themselves have known the difference between the office of Priests and the office of Magistrates. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>For this is another thing then civil Magistrates.</hi> He had said before, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> who is made by election or lot, is not a civil Magistrate: and the first instance he giveth is that of the Priests: and so <hi>Aristotle</hi> would have the Priest to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Ruler, but not a civil Magistrate. So <hi>de Repub. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. he distingu sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth between the Priests and the Judges in a Citty.</p>
               <p>But to the matter. I will here endeavour to make these two things appear. 1. That no administration formally and properly Ecclesiasticall (and namely the dispencing of Church censures) doth belong unto the Magistrate, nor may (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God) be assumed and exercised by him, 2. That Christ hath not made the Magistrate head of the Church, to receive appeals (properly so called) from all Ecclesiasticall Assemblies. Touching the first of these, it is no other than is held forth in the Irish Articles of Faith (famous among Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and Learned men in these Kingdoms) which do plainly exclude the Magistrate from the administration of the Word and Sacraments, and from the power of the keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. It is the unhappinesse of this time that this and other truths formerly out of controversie, should be so much stuck at and doubted of by some.</p>
               <p>Now that the corrective part of Church-Government, or the censure of scandalous persons in reference to the purging of the Church, and keeping pure of the ordinances, is no part of the Magistrates office, but is a distinct charge belonging of right to Ministers and Elders; as it may fully appear by the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought afterwards to prove a government in the Church distinct from Magistracy: (which Arguments will necessarily carry the power of Church censures and the administration of the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven into other hands then the Magistrates;) so I shall here strengthen it by these confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>First, Church-censures must needs be dispensed by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Elders, because they are heterogeneous to Magistracy: For first, the Magistrate by the power which is in his hand,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95406:154"/>
ought to punish any of his Subjects that doe evil, and he ought to punish like si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s with like punishments. But if the power of Church-censures be in the Magistrates hands, he cannot walk by that rule; For Church-censures are onely for Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, not for all Subjects: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. 12. Secondly, Church-censures are to be executed in the name of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20. with vers. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. and this cannot be done in his name, by any other but such as have commission from him to bind and loose, forgive and retain sins. But where is any such commission given to the civil Magistrate, Christian more then Heathen? Thirdly, Church-censures are for impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent contumacious offenders: but the Magistrate doth and must punish offenders (when the course of Justice and law so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth) whether they appear penitent or impenitent. Fourthly, The Magistrates power of punishing offenders, is bounded by the law of the land. What then shall become of such scandalls as are not crimes punishable by the law of the land? such as obscene rotten talking, adulterous and vile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, or the most scandalous conversing and companying together (though the crime of adultery cannot be proved by witnesses) living in known malice and envie, refusing to be reconciled, and thereupon lying off (it may be for a long time) from the Sacrament, and the like, which are not proper to be taken notice of by the civil Judge. So that in this case, either there must be Church-censures and discipline exercised by Church-officers, or the Magistrate must go beyond his limits: Or lastly. Scandalls shall spread in the Church, and no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against them. Far be it from the thoughts of Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, that scandalls of this kind shall be tolerated, to the dishonour of God, the laying of the stumbling blocks of bad examples before others, and to the violation and pollution of the Ordinances of Jesus Christ, who hath commanded to keep his ordinances pure.</p>
               <p>A second Argument may be this, In the old Testament God did not command the Magistrates, but the Priests to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the prophane and the holy, the unclean and the clean: <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 22. 26. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44. 23, 24. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 5. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 18, 19. And in the new Testament, the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95406:154"/>
keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven are given to the Ministers of the Church: <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. and 18. 18. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 23. but no where to the civil Magistrate. It belongeth to Church-officers to censure false doctrine. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 2. 14. 15. to decide contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 4. and to examine and censure scandalls, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44 23, 24. which is a Prophecy concerning the ministery of the New Testament. And Elders judge an Elder, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. or any other Church-member. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Scripture holdeth forth the civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical power as most distinct; insomuch that it condemneth the <hi>Spiritualizing</hi> of the civil Power, aswell as the <hi>Seculari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> of the Ecclesiastical power; <hi>State Papacy,</hi> aswell as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal-State:</hi> Church-officers may not take the civil sword, nor judg civil causes: <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13, 14, and 22. 25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 52. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. So <hi>Uzzah</hi> might not touch the Ark: nor <hi>Saul</hi> offer burnt offerings: nor <hi>Uzziah</hi> burn incense: I wish we may not have cause to revive the proverb which was used in <hi>Ambrose</hi> his time. <hi>That Emperors did more covet the Priesthood, then the Priests did covet the Empire.</hi> Shall it be a sin to Church-officers to exercise any act of civil government? and shal it be no sin to the civil Magistrate to ingrosse the whole and sole power of Church-Government? Are not the two powers formally and specifically distinct? Of which before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>It is to be well noted that <hi>Maccovius</hi> and <hi>Vedelius</hi> who ascribe a sort of Papal power to the civil Magistrate, to the great scandall of the Reformed Church; do notwithstanding acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Christ hath appointed Church discipline and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and the same to be dispenced by Church-officers onely: And that the Magistrate as he may not preach the Word, and administer the Sacraments; So he may not exercise Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discipline, nor inslict spiritual censures, such as excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Though <hi>Erastus</hi> pag. 175. hath not spared to say, that the Magistrate may in the New Testament (though he might not in the old) exercise the ministeriall function, if he can have so much leisure from his other employments.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The power of Church discipline is intrinsecall to the Church, that is, both they who censure, and they who
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95406:155"/>
are censured, must be of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. 13. They must be of one and the same Corporation, the one must not be in the body, and the other out of the body. But if this power were in the Magistrate, it were extrinsecall to the Church. For the Magistrate <hi>quatenus</hi> a Magistrate, is not so much as a Church-member; far lesse can the magistrate as magistrate have jurisdiction over Church-members, as Church members, even as the minister as minister is not a member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or State, far lesse can he, as minister, exercise jurisdiction over the Subjects, as Subjects.</p>
               <p>The Christian magistrate in <hi>England</hi> is not a member of the Church as a magistrate, but as a Christian. And the minister of Jesus Christ in <hi>England,</hi> is not subject to the magistrate as he is a minister of Christ, but as he is a member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England</hi> He was both a learned man and a great Royallist in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who held that all Kings, Infidel as well as Christian, have equal authority and jurisdiction in the Church, though all be not alike qualified or able to exercise it. <hi>Io. Wemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, de Reg. primat. pag.</hi> 123. Let our opposites loose this knot among themselves; for they are not of one opinion about it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Church-officers might and did freely and by themselves dispence Church-censures, under Pagan and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving magistrates, as is by all confessed: Now the Church ought not to be in a worse condition under the Christian magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, then under an Infidel; for the power of the Christian magistrate is <hi>cumulative,</hi> not <hi>privative</hi> to the Church; He is a <hi>Nursing Father, Isa.</hi> 49. 23. not a <hi>Step-Father.</hi> He is keeper, defender and guardian of both Tables, but neither Judge nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I shall shut up this Argumentation with a convincing <hi>dilemma.</hi> The Assemblies of Church-officers being to exercise discipline, and censure offences (which is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and must be granted in regard of the Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) either they have power to do this <hi>Iure proprio,</hi> and <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute officii:</hi> or onely <hi>Iure devoluto,</hi> and <hi>virtute delegationis,</hi> such authority being derived from the magistrate; If the former; I have what I would; If the latter, then it followeth, 1. That
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95406:155"/>
where Presbyteries and Synods do exercise spirituall Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not by any power derived from, or dependant upon the civil Magistrate, but in the name and authority of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and by the power received from him, as in <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> &amp;c. there all Ecclesiastical censures, such as deposition of Ministers, and Excommunication of scandalous and obstinate persons. have been, are, and shall be void, null, and of no effect. Even as when the Prelaticall party did hold, that the power of ordination and jurisdiction pertaineth onely to Prelats, or such as are delegate with commission and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from them: thereupon they were so put to it by the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Anti-Episcopall party, that they were forced to say, that Presbyters ordained by Presbyters in other Reformed Churches, are no Presbyters, and their excommunication was no excommunication. 2. It will follow, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate himself may excommunicate, for <hi>nemo potest aliis delegare plus juris quam ipse habet;</hi> No man can give from him by delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deputation to another, that right or power which he himself hath not. 3. If the power of excommunication come by delegation from the Magistrate, either the Magistrate must in conscience give this power to Church-officers onely, or he is free and may without sin give this power to others; If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, what can bind up the Magistrates conscience, or astrict the thing to Church-Officers, except it be Gods ordinance that they only do it? If the latter, then though this Parliament hath hath taken away the old High Commission Court, which had <hi>Potestatem utrius<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> gladii,</hi> yet they may lawfully and without sin erect a new High Commission Court, made up of those who shall be no Church-officers, yea having none of the Clergy in it (as the other had) with commission and power granted to them to execute spiritual Jurisdiction and Excommunication, and that not onely in this or that Church, yea or Province, but in any part of the whole Kingdom. So much of the first point. Now to the second, concerning appeals to the Magistrate, as to the head of the Church.</p>
               <p>It is asked, what remedy shall there be against the abuse of Church-discipline by Church-officers, except there be appeals from the Ecclesiastical Courts to the civil Magistrate: which if
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95406:156"/>
it be, Church-officers will be the more wary and cautious to do no man wrong, knowing that they may be made to answer for it: And if it be not, there is a wide dore opened, that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters may do as they please.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 Look what remedy thene is for abuses in the preaching of the Word, and administration of the Sacraments; the like remedy there is for abuses in Church-discipline; Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>administration of the Word and Sacraments is no lesse sinfull to the ministers, and hurtful to others, then mal-administration of discipline: and in some respects the former is more to the dishonour of God and destruction of men than the latter: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters have not an arbitrary power to preach what they will, Now when the word is not truly preached, nor the Sacraments duely administred by any minister or ministers, the Magistrate seeketh the redresse of these things (in a constituted Church) by the convocating of Synods, for examining, discovering, and judging of such errors and abuses as are found in particular Churches. But if the Synod should connive at, or comply with that same error; yet the Magistrate taketh not upon him the supreme and authoritative decision of a controversie of faith, but still endeavoureth to help all this by other Ecclesiastical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; as another Synod, and yet another, till the evil be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. The like we say concerning abuses in Church-disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: The Magistrate may command a resuming and re-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the case in another Synod: but still the Synod ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisieth or reverseth the censure. In which case it is betwixt the Magistrate and the Synod, as betwixt the will and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; for <hi>Voluntas imperat Intellectui quo ad exercitium,</hi> yet notwithstanding <hi>determinatur per intectellum quoad specificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem actus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take for instance this also. If it be a case deserving depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition or degradation: In such a case saith learned <hi>Salmasius ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. ad lib. de primatu pag.</hi> 298. the Prince or Magistrate cannot take from a minister that power which was given him in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with imposition of hands, for he cannot take away that which he cannot give. But if a Prince would have a minister for his offence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>There are two examples alledged from Scripture for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from Ecclesiastical to Civil Courts: One is the example of <hi>Ieremiah; I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>r.</hi> 26. The other is the example of <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 25. But neither of the two prove the point. For 1. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was not censured by the Priests with any Spirituall or Ecclesiastical censure (of which alone our controversie is) but the Priests took him and said to him, <hi>Thou shalt surely die. Jer.</hi> 26. 8. 2. Would God that every Christian Magistrate may protect the servants of God from such unjust sentences and persecuting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. When Ecclesiasticall Courts are made up of bloody
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95406:157"/>
persecuters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is an extraordinary evil which must have an extraordinary remedy. 3. Neither yet is there any syllable of <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> appealing from the Priests to the Princes, but the Text saith, <hi>When the Princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verse</hi> 10. that is, The Princes so soon as they understood that the Priests had taken <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and had said to him <hi>Thou shalt surely die. verse</hi> 8. And being also infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that all the people were gathered together tumultuously and disorderly against the Prophet, <hi>verse</hi> 9. They thought it their duty to rescue the Prophet from the Priests and people, that he might be examined and judged by the civil Court, he being chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged and accused as one worthy to die.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Pauls</hi> Appellation to <hi>Caesar.</hi> First, It is supposed by our opposites that he appealed from the Ecclesiastical San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin of the Jews, which is a great mistake; For he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from the Judgement-seat of <hi>Festus</hi> to <hi>Caesar;</hi> that is, from an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eriour civil Court, to a superiour civil Court, which he had just cause to do: for though <hi>Festus</hi> had not yet given forth any sentence against <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he appeals <hi>à gravamine,</hi> and it was a great grievance indeed, while as <hi>Festus</hi> shew'd himself to be a most corrupt Judge, who though the Jews could prove none of those things whereof they accused <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 25. 7. (which should have made <hi>Festus</hi> to acquit and dismisse him) yet being willing to do the Jews a pleasure, he would have <hi>Paul</hi> to go to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> there to be judged before himself. <hi>verse</hi> 9. Now this was all the favour that the Jews had desired of <hi>Festus,</hi> that he would send <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they laying wait in the way to kill him. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. No appellation here from the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where he had not as yet compeered to be examined, far lesse could he appeal from any sentence of the Sanhedrin. The most which can be with any colour alleadged from the Text, is, that <hi>Paul</hi> declined to be judged by the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they not being his competent and proper Judges in that cause. <hi>I stand at Caesars Iudgement-seat</hi> saith he, <hi>where I ought to be judged;</hi> meaning that he was accused as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, for sedition, and offending against <hi>Caesar;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ought to be judged onely at <hi>Caesars</hi> Tribunall; not by the Jews, who were no Judges of such matters.

                  </gap>d from the Sanhedrin at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> either it was the civil Sanhedrin, or the Ecclesiasticall. If the civil, it is no President for appeals from Ecclesiastical Courts. If the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, yet that serveth not for appeals from Ecclesiasticall Courts in Ecclesiasticall causes; for it was a capital crime whereof <hi>Paul</hi> was accused. Nay, put the case that <hi>Paul</hi> had at that time appealed from the Ecclesiastical Sanhedrin in an Ecclesiastical cause: yet neither could that help our opposites, for the government of the Christian Church, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Jewish Church were at that time separate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, so that the Ecclesiastical Court, which should have judged of any scandall given by <hi>Paul</hi> (if at all he ought to have been censured) had been a Christian Synod, not a Jewish San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin. And so much of Appeals. Of which Question <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glandius, Revius,</hi> and <hi>Cabeljavius,</hi> have peculiarly and fully written. Three famous Academies also, of <hi>Leyden, Groening,</hi> and <hi>Utrecht,</hi> did give their publike testimonies against appeals from Ecclesiastical to civil Courts. And the three Professors of <hi>Utrecht</hi> in their testimony do obtest all Christians that love truth and peace, to be cautious and wary of the Arminian poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son lurking in the contrary Tenent. See <hi>Cabeljav. defensio pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis Ecclesiasticae.</hi> pag. 60.</p>
               <p>It is further objected, That thus fixing a spirituall jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Church-officers, we erect two collateral Powers in the Kingdom, the Civil and the Ecclesiastical, unlesse all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Courts be subordinate to Magistracy, as to a certain head-ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a subordination of Persons here, but a co-ordination of powers: A subordination of Persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the Ministers of the Church are subject to the civil Magistrate, they being members of the Common-wealth or Kingdom; So the Magistrate is subject to the Ministers of the Church, he being a Church-member.</p>
               <p>The former we assert against Papists, who say that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is not subject to the Magistrate. The latter we hold against those who make the Magistrate to be the head of the Church:
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95406:159"/>
Again, a co-ordination of powers; because as the subjection of the person of the Christian Magistrate to the Pastors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, in things pertaining to God, doth not inferre the subordination of the power and office of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to the Church-officers: So the subjection of Pastors and Elders to the Magistrate in all civil things (as other members of the Common-wealth are subject) may well consist with the co-ordination of the Ecclesiastical power with the civil. And as it is an error in Papists to make the secular power dependant upon, and derived from the Ecclesiasticall power: So it is an error in others to make the Ecclesiastical power derived from, and dependant upon the civil power: for the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical power is derived from Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
               <p>And now while I am expressing my thoughts, I am the more confirmed in the same, by falling upon the concession of one who is of a different Judgement; For he who wrote <hi>Ius Regum</hi> in opposition to all spiritual authority exercised under any forme of Ecclesiastical Government, doth not withstanding acknowledge pag. 16. <hi>Both of them</hi> (the Magistrate and the Minister) <hi>have their Commission immediatly from God, and each of them are subject to the other, without any subordination of offices from the one to the other, for the Magistrate is no lesse subject to the operation of the Word from the mouth of the Minister, then any other man whatsoever: And the Minister again is as much subject to the authority of the Magistrate as any other Subject whatsoever; And therefore though there be no subordination of Offices, yet is there of Persons; the Person of a Minister remaining a Subject, but not the function of the Ministery.</hi> He might have said the same of the exercise of Church-discipline which he saith of the preaching of the Word, for the same Christ who gave the keyes of doctrine, gave also the keys of discipline, without any tye to make the use thereof subject to the pleasure of the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. Let him prove that the ministery of the Word is not subordinate to, nor dependant upon the Magistrate; and I shall prove by the same <hi>medium,</hi> that the ministery of Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures hath as little of that subordination in it.</p>
               <p>And this I must adde, that least of all others can our Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent brethren charge the Presbyterians with the setting up
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95406:160"/>
of an Ecclesiastical Government co-ordinate with, and not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate unto the civil Government: For themselves hold as much in this point (if not more) then we do. Take for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> his <hi>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Pag. 53. <hi>As the Church is subject to the sword of the Magistrate in things which concerne the civil peace: so the Magistrate (if Christian) is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the keyes of the Church.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for that collaterality which is objected, I answer, The Civil and Ecclesiastical power, if we speak properly, are not collateral. 1. They have no footing upon the same ground: there may be many subject to the Magistrate, who are no Church-Members, and so not under the Spiritual power: and where the same persons are subject to both the powers, there is no more collaterality in this case, nay, not so much, as is betwixt the power of a Father in one man, and the power of a Master in another man, when both powers are exercised upon the same man who is both a son and a servant. 2. Powers that are collateral, are of the same eminency and altitude, of the same kinde and nature; but the civil Power is a Dominion and Lordship: the Ecclesiastical power is Ministerial, not Lordly. 3. Collateral powers do mutually and alike exercise authority over each other respectively. But, though the Magistrate may exercise much authority in things Ecclesiastical, Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers can exercise no authority in things civil. The Magistrates authority is Ecclesiastical <hi>objective,</hi> though not <hi>formaliter:</hi> but the Church-Officers authority is not civil so much as <hi>objective,</hi> not being exercised about either civil, criminal, or capital cases. 4. Collateral powers are subordinate to, and derived from the Supreme and Original power, like two branches growing out of the same stock, two streams flowing from the same foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, two lines drawn from the same center, two arms under the same head. But the power of the Magistrate is subordinate unto; and dependeth upon the Dominion of God the Creator of all: the power of Church-Officers dependeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95406:160"/>
the Dominion of Christ, the Mediator and King of the Church.</p>

               <p>I have now done with the negative part of this present Controversie, what the power of the Magistrate <hi>in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> is not. I proceed to the positive part, what it is. To this I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the general, I hold with the large Consession of Faith of the Church of <hi>Scotland; Art. 25.

                  </gap>erstanding and enodation of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Question, I will particularize and explain what I hold, by these five following Distinctions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <p>1. <hi>Distingue materiam subjectam.</hi> There are two sorts of things belonging to the Church. Some which are intrinsecal, and belonging to the soul or inward man, directly and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. Such things are not to be dispensed and administred by the civil Magistrate, I mean the Word and Sacraments, the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Suspension or Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Church-Officers or Members, the Ordination or Deposition of Officers, the Determination and Resolution from Scripture of Controversies concerning the Faith, the Worship of God, the Government of the Church, Cases of Conscience. These being in their nature, end, and use, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spiritual, and belonging not to the outward man, but to the inward man or soul, are committed and intrusted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and other ruling Officers of the Church, and are not of civil and extrinsecal, but of Ecclesiastical and intrinsecal cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance and judgement. There are other things belonging to the Church, which are extrinsecal and do properly belong to the outward man, and are common to the Church with other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies or Corporations. Things of this kinde fall within the civil Jurisdiction. For the Churches of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Societies of men and women, and parts of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, are accountable unto and punishable by the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, in their bodies, lives, civil Liberties, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Estates, for trespasses against the Law of God or the Law of the Land: By the Law of God I understand here <hi>Ius divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num naturale,</hi> that is, the moral Law or Decalogue, as it bindeth all Nations (whether Christians or Infidels) being the Law of the Creator and King of Nations. The Magistrate by his authority, may and in duty ought to keep his Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of external obedience to that Law, and punish
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95406:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the external man with external punishments for external tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes against that Law. From this obligation of the Law, and subjection to the corrective power of the Magistrate, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Subjects are no more exempted then Heathen Subjects, but father more straitly obliged. So that if any such trespasse is committed by Church-Officers or Members, the Magistrate hath power and authority to summon, examine, judge, and (after just conviction and proof) to punish these, as well as other men. We do therefore abominate the disloyal Papal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that Clergy men are not to be examined and judged by civil, but by Ecclesiastical Courts onely, even in causes civil and criminal. Whereof see <hi>Duarenus de Sacr. Eccl. Minist. lib. 1. cap. 2. Spelman Concil. Britann. Tom. 1. pag. 413.</hi>

All things properly belonging to the soul or internal man, (which here we call <hi>things inward</hi>) are the object of Ecclesiastical power given to Church-officers, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and other ruling officers. But what belongs to the outward man, to the bodies of Church-officers and members (which things are <hi>outward</hi>) the judging and managing thereof, is in the hand of the Magistrate, who ruleth not onely <gap reason="foreign">

But in doing hereof, he is also helpfull and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Kingdom of Christ as Mediator; Magistracy being (in the respects aforesaid) serviceable and profitable (as to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Common-wealth aright, so also) to purge the Church of scandals, to promote the course of the Gospel, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of one another.

                        </gap> by the aid of the secular power. And so much of the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive part of the Magistrates administration. The other part of his administration in reference to Religion, is auxiliary, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant to the Church. For the Magistrate watcheth over the outward businesse of the Church, not onely by troubling those persons, and punishing those sins that trouble the Israel of God; but by administring such things as are necessary for the well being and comfortable subsistence of the Church, and for that end, doth convocate Synods <hi>pro re nata,</hi> (beside the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and set meetings) and presideth therein (if he please) in externall order, though not in the Synodicall debates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions:
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95406:162"/>
He addeth his civil sanction to the Synodical results, if he find nothing therein which may hurt Peace or Justice in the Common-wealth. The Magistrate ought also to take care of the maintenance of the Ministery, Schooles, poor, and of good works for necessary uses, that Religion and Learning may not want their necessary adminicles. Finally, He ought to take care that all Churches be provided with an able, orthodox, and Godly Ministery, and Schools with learned and well qualified Teachers, such as shall be best approved by those to whom it belongeth to examine and Judge of their qualifications and parts. And all these wayes the Magistrate ought to be, and the well affected Magistrate hath been and is a nursing Father to the Church of Christ.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. My second distinction shall be this: The Magistrate may and ought not onely to conserve Justice, peace and order in the Common-wealth, and in the Church, as it is in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but also to take speciall care of the conservation of the true Reformed Religion, and of the Reformation of it when and wherein it needeth to be reformed, <hi>imperativè,</hi> not <hi>elicitivè.</hi> The Magistrate saith Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> on the decalogue, pag. 262. is neither to administer Word, nor Sacraments, nor Church discipline, &amp;c. but he is to take care that all these things be done by those whom God hath called thereunto. What ever is properly spiritual belonging to the soul and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man (such as Church-censures, and the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars before mentioned) cannot be <hi>actus elicitus</hi> of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate: The Magistrate can neither <hi>immediatione suppositi,</hi> nor <hi>immediatione virtutis,</hi> determine controversies of faith, ordain Ministers, suspend from the Sacraments, or excommunicate. He can neither doe these things himself; nor are they done in the name and authority of the Magistrate or by any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall power receeived from him, but in the name and authority of Jesus Christ, and by the power given from Jesus Christ. Yet all these and generally the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the keyes of the Kingdom of heaven, are <hi>actus imperati</hi> of the Christian Magistrate, and that both <hi>antecedenter</hi> and <hi>consequenter. Antecedently,</hi> the Magistrate may command Church-officers to suspend or excommunicate all obstinate and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95406:163"/>
scandalous persons: he may command the Classis to ordain able and godly ministers, and no other: he may command a Synod to meet, to debate and determine such or such a controversie. <hi>Consequently</hi> also, when the thing is examined, judged, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or done by the Ecclesiasticall power, the Magistrate hath power and authority to adde his civil sanction confirmation, ot ratification, to make the Ecclesiasticall sentence to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and submitted unto by all whom it concerneth. In all which the Christian Magistrate doth exceeding much for the conservation and purgation of Religion: not <hi>elici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <item>3. Distinguish the <hi>directive</hi> part and the <hi>coercive</hi> part. The directive part, in the conservation or purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion, doth belong to the Ministers and ruling Officers of the Church assembled together; In administring therefore that which concerneth Religion and peoples spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, the Magistrate not onely <hi>juvatur,</hi> but <hi>dirigitur,</hi> is not onely <hi>helped,</hi> but <hi>directed</hi> by the Ecclesiastical directive power; <hi>Fest.

                        </gap>strate hath indeed an authoritative influence into matters of Religion and Church-Government; but it is cumulative, that is, the Magistrate takes care that Church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers as well as other Subjects may do those things which <hi>ex officio</hi> they are bound to do; and when they do so, he aideth, assisteth, strengtheneth, ratifieth, and in his way, maketh ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall what they do. But that which belongs to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate is not privative, in reference to the Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It is understood <hi>salvo jure Ecclesiastico:</hi> for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate is a nursing Father, not a step. Father to the Church: and the Magistrate (as well as other men) is under that tye; 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 8. We can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi> This <hi>Proviso</hi> therefore is justly made, that whatever power the Magistrate hath in matters of Religion, it is not to hinder the free exercise of Church discipline and censures against scandalous and obstinate sinners.</p>
                     <p>As the Casuists in other cases distinguish <hi>Lucrum cessans,</hi> and <hi>damnum emergens,</hi> so must we distinguish between the Magistrate his doing no good to the Church, and his doing evil to the Church: between his not assisting, and his opposing: between his not allowing or authorizing, and his forbidding or restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It doth properly and of right belong to the Magistrate to adde a civil sanction and strength of a law for strengthning and aiding the exercise of Church discipline, or not to add it. And
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95406:164"/>
himself is Judge whether to add any such cumulative act of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or not. But the Magistrate hath no power nor authority to lay bands and restraints upon Church-officers to hinder any of Christs ordinances, or to forbid them to do what Christ hath given them a commission to do. And if any such restraints of prohibitions or lawes should be laid on us, we ought to obey God rather than men.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Distingue tempora.</hi> Whatever belongs to the Magistrate in matters of Religion, more then falls under the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, is extraordinary, and doth not belong to ordinary Government. In extraordinary reformations the Magistrate may do much by his owne immediate authority, when Synods have made defection either from the truth of doctrine, or from holinesse and godlinesse: yet in such a case he ought to consult with such orthodox godly Divines as can be had, either in his owne or from other Dominions. <hi>Fest. Hon. Disp. 30. Thes. 5.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And so much be spoken of the Magistrate his power and duty in things and causes Ecclesiasticall. As we do not deny to the Magistrate any thing which the Word of God doth allow him, so we dare not approve his going beyond the bounds and limits which God hath set him. And I pray God that this be not found to be the bottome of the controversie, Whether Magistracy shall be an arbitrary Government; if not in civil, yet in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal things? Whether the Magistrate may do, or appoint to be done in the matter of Church-Government, admission to, or exclusion from the Ordinances of Christ, what ever shall seem good in his eyes? And whether in purging of the Church he is obliged to follow the rules of Scripture, and to consult with learned and godly Ministers? although <hi>Erastus</hi> himself (as is before observed) and <hi>Sutlivius</hi> (a great follower of him) <hi>de Presbyt. cap.</hi> 8. are ashamed of, and do disclaim such assertions.</p>

               <p>THis Question hath arisen from Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> third and fourth rule which he offered to the Parliament, excluding all Government of Church-officers, Ministers and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; that is, as he expounds himself all corrective govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leaving them no power except what is meerly doctrinal, and appropriating all government properly so called to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate onely. Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> following him falls in the same ditch with him. The Question is not whether Church-officers ought to have any share in the Civil Government? Nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church-officers may have any Lordly government or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious domination over the Lords heritage? Nor whether Church-Officers may exercise an arbitrary irregular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and rule as themselves list? God forbid. But the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plainly is, Whether there may not, yea ought not to be in the Church a Ministeriall or Ecclesiastical Government proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called, beside the civil Government or Magistracy. Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> did, and Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> doth hold there ought not. I
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95406:165"/>
hold there ought: and I shall propound for the affirmative these Arguments.</p>
               <p>The first Argument I draw from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Elders that rule well.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hussey pag.</hi> 8. askes whether the word Elder be <hi>prima,</hi> or <hi>secunda notio.</hi> If <hi>prima notio,</hi> why must not Elder women be Church-officers as well as Elder men? If <hi>secunda notio</hi> for a ruling Officer, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament men, Kings and all Civil Governours are such Elders. I know no use which that distinction of <hi>prima</hi> and <hi>secunda notio</hi> hath in this place, except to let us know that he understands these Logicall termes. <hi>Egregiam vero laudem.</hi> He might have saved himself the labour, for who knowes not <hi>Hieromes</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Elder is either a word of age or of office: but in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall use it is a word of office. Mr. <hi>Husseys</hi> first notion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Elder women is no masculine notion. His second no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an anti-parliamentary notion. For the honourable Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament in the first words of their Ordinance concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ordination of Ministers have declared, that by the word of God a Bishop and a Presbyter or Elder are all one; for thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth the Ordinance, <hi>Whereas the word Presbyter, that is to say Elder, and the word Bishop, do in the Scripture intend and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie one and the same function, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore Parliament men and civil Governors cannot be the Elders mentioned by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul,</hi> except Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> make them Bishops, and invest them with power of ordination. Besides this, if Kings and Parliament men be such Elders as are mentioned in this Text, then the Ministers of the Word must have not onely an equall share in Government, but more honour and maintenance then Kings and Parliament men. See how well Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> pleadeth for Christian Magistracy: It is also an anti-Scripturall notion, for some of those Elders that ruled well, did labour in the Word and Doctrine, as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in the very same place; these (sure) are not civil Governours. Wherefore Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> must seek a third notion before he hit the Apostles meaning. It is not <hi>hujus loci</hi> to debate from this Text the distinction of two sorts of Elders; though among all the answers which ever I heard or read, Mr. <hi>Husseys</hi> is the weakest, pag. 11. that by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that labour in the Word and Doctrine, are meant those
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95406:165"/>
Ministers whose excellencie lies in Doctrine and instruction, and that by Elders that rule, are meant those that give reproof. He contradistinguisheth a reproving minister from a minister labouring in the Word and Doctrine. The very reproof given by a minister will be, (it seemes) at last challenged as an act of government. It is as wide from the mark, that he will have the two sorts of Elders to differ thus, that the one must governe and not preach, the other must preach and not govern; not observing that the Text makes ruling to be common to both. The one doth both rule and labour in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: The other ruleth one y, and is therefore called ruling Elder, <hi>non quia solus praeest, sed quia solum praeest.</hi> But to let all these things be laid aside as heterogeneous to this present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: the point is, here are Rulers in the Church who are no civil Rulers. Yea this my Argument from this Text was clearly yeelded by Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> in his <hi>Maledicis</hi> pag. 8. <hi>But I will deal clearly</hi> saith he, <hi>these Officers are Ministers, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted not here, but else-where; and those are the Rulers here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Ergo,</hi> he yeeldeth Ecclesiastical rulers (and those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted) distinct from Magistracy. Neither is it a Lordly but a ministeriall ruling of which our Question is. <hi>For my part</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Hussey, I know not how Lordship and Government doth differ one from another.</hi> Then every Governour of a ship must be a lord. Then every Steward of a great house must be lord of the House. There is an oeconomicall or ministerial government, and of that we mean.</p>
               <p>My second Argument I take from 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>And we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you.</hi>

                  </gap> or ruling power of ministers, is not meerly doctrinall or perswasive, as is manifest by 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. where those who are not convinced of two sorts of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are yet fully convinced of two sorts of acts, the act of ruling, and the act of teaching. Whatsoever that Text hath more in it, or hath not, this it hath, that those who labour in the Word and Doctrine, are Rulers; but they are more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be honoured for their labouring in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Next, as to the force of the Word, if it be true which Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> here saith, then the English Translators that read <hi>are over you; Calvin, Beza, Bullinger, Gualther,</hi> and others that here follow <hi>Hierome,</hi> and read <hi>praesunt vobis; Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> who reads <hi>praesidentes vobis,</hi> have not well understood the Greek.

               <p>Well: Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> will try if his Logick can help him, if his Greek cannot. <hi>Whatsoever this person is that is to be beloved, ho is supposed not instituted in this place, the subject is supposed not handled in any Science.</hi> The like he saith afterward <hi>pag.</hi> 22. that we cannot prove from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. that <hi>Paul</hi> did institute excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, but at most that he <hi>supposed an Institution.</hi> For my part, that Scripture which supposeth an Institution, shall to me prove an Institution; for I am sure that which any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture supposeth, must be true. And herein as I take it, Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> would have said as I say, for in his fourth rule he proved the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95406:167"/>
Institution of Magistracy from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. yec Magistracy is not instituted in that place, but supposed to be instituted.</p>
               <p>A third Argument I take from <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13 7. <hi>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the Word of God:</hi> Vers. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves: for they watch for your soules, as they that must give an account. Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Gualther</hi> referre this 17th. verse both to <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Ministery,</hi> and so far they are ours, in sharing the rule and government between both, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king obedience due to both. But <hi>Calvin</hi> and many others doe better expound the Text of Ecclesiasticall Rulers or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours onel: wherein <hi>Salmasius</hi> followeth the Greek Scholiasts, who expound the Text of Bishops or Elders who did in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon govern the Church.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is rightly translated in our Books <hi>to obey Magistrates:</hi> but Master <hi>Hussey</hi> will make it no more, but <hi>to be perswaded by Magistrates.</hi> Yea, the very simple and uncompounded Verb <gap reason="foreign">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the fore-cited passages of <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> is used where they speak of obedience to Magistrates and masters.</p>
               <p>If this must fail him, he hath yet another answer: Let the word stand, saith he, as it is translated <hi>obey;</hi> yet it is not alway correlative to the command of a Superiour: and the holy Ghost requireth obedience here, <hi>not by an argument from the authority of him that leadeth them, but from the benefit that cometh to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for that is unprofitable for you.</hi> He divideth what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:95406:168"/>
joyneth; for there are two sorts of Arguments in the Text, by which the Apostle perswadeth them to this obedience: one is taken from the authority of the Ministery, which is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both by that name of authority <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and by their subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination or submission which the Apostle calls for: another from the benefit that cometh to themselves, by their obedience, and the hurt which they shall do to themselves by their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Both these Arguments are wrapt up in these words, <hi>For they watch for your souls,</hi> which is the very same with that <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>To all the flock over the which the holy Ghost hath made you overseers.</hi> The Apostle doth also perswade Christians to be subject to the Magistrate, by an Argument taken from the benefit that cometh to themselves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>For he is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of God to thee for good:</hi> yet that doth not weaken but rather strengthen the Authority of the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument shall be taken from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Elder receive not an accusation, but before</hi> (or <hi>under) two or three witnesses.</hi> Which is not a temporary charge laid upon <hi>Timothy</hi> as an Evangelist, and so incompetent to ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: for it is joyned with the rules of publike Rebuking, of laying on of hands, not partaking of other mens sins, and such like things which are of ordinary concernment. He is also charged to keep the Commandment till the appearing of Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 14, which cannot be otherwise understood then as spoken to him in reference to the Ministery. Now what is an act of Government, if this be not, to receive accusations, and that against Elders, and that under two or three witnesses? The Apostle intendeth here the avoiding of these two evils; first, upon the one hand, because <hi>veritas odium parit,</hi> and Elders doing their duty faithfully, will certainly be hated, and slandered, and evil spoken of by some, that therefore every <hi>Diotrephes</hi> pratling against a servant of Christ with malicious words, may not be able to blast his Christian reputation and good name: Next, upon the other part, because the offences and scandals of Elders are not to be connived at, but to be aggravated and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, more then the offences of others, that therefore an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation be received against them, if it be under two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Now where accusations ought to be received, and that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:95406:169"/>
under two or three witnesses, and not otherwise (with special charge also to observe these things, <hi>without partiality, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one before another,</hi> vers. 21.) there is certainly a forensical proceeding, and a corrective Jurisdiction or Government. More of this Argument in <hi>Malè audis,</hi> pag. 14.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, what is that else but a corrective Jurisdiction, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>A man that is an heretick, after the first and second admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reject,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> He speaks of a rejecting of persons, not of things onely; and of such a rejecting of persons, as cannot be understood onely of that avoiding or rejecting, by which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private Christian ought to observe, and avoid, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive false Teachers, but of a publike Ministerial or Consistorial rejecting of an Heretick, by cutting him off, or casting him out of the Church.</p>
               <p>It is a Canon <hi>de Judiciis Ecclesiasticis,</hi> saith <hi>Tossanus</hi> upon the the place. This the Greek will easily admit: for <hi>Stephanus in Thesauro linguae Gr.</hi> tells us that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>to repudiate or put away a wife.</hi> As here also we may read, <hi>A man that is an Heretick, after the first and second ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, repudiate</hi> or <hi>put away;</hi> though the word <hi>reject</hi> doth also bear the same sence. And as the Greek will admit it, so I have these reasons to confirm it, which shall suffice for the present. (He that pleaseth, may read a large Discourse concerning the censure of Hereticks, in <hi>Claudius Espencaeus</hi> upon this place.) First, The Apostles scope is not to hold forth the common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all Christians, except <hi>ex consequenti:</hi> but his primary intention all along in that Epistle, is to instruct <hi>Titus</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordering and governing of the Church, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 5. Secondly, there must be a first and second admonition, before the Heretick be thus rejected. This rejecting is not for his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and false Doctrine, simply or by it self considered, but for his contumacy and incorrigiblenesse. But private Christians ought to observe by the judgement of private discretion, and ought in prudence and caution to avoid all familiar fellowship and conversation with a man that is an Heretick, though he hath not yet gotten a first and second admonition: <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15, 16. <hi>Beware of false Prophets which come to you in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>inwardly they are ravening Wolves. Ye shall know them by their</hi> fruits. Thirdly, the admonition in the Text is a publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative or ministerial admonition, <hi>after that thou</hi> (Titus) <hi>hast once and again admonished him</hi> saith the Syriack: therefore the rejecting must also be publick and ministerial. Fourthly, <note n="h" place="margin">Zach Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinus Tom. 3. pag. 769.

                  </gap>

Fifthly, Look by what authority Elders were ordained, by the same authority they were for heresie (main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with contumacy) rejected: for the Apostle committeth into the same hands, the ordaining of Elders, and the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Hereticks; compare <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. with <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. Now the ordination was by the Presbyterie: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. Therefore so was the rejection.</p>

               <p>Seventhly, We have an Argument from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32, 33. <hi>And the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets; for God is not the Author of confusion, but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints.</hi> The Apostle is giving such rules and directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning prophecying or interpretation of Scripture, that upon the one hand there may be a liberty to all the Prophets to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and that the Church may be edified by the gifts of all, and that for that end one ought to give place to another: upon the other hand, that a boundlesse liberty and confusion, and immunity from censure, may not be introduced into the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To this latter branch belongs vers. 29. 32. 33. <hi>Let the Prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</hi> He will have two, or at most three Prophets to speak in one Congregation, at one diet or time of assembling: and those Prophets, saith he, must be <note n="i" place="margin">Aegid.

                  </note> examined, judged, and censured by the other Prophets: for the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets, that is, every particular Prophet distributively, is subject to all the Prophets collectively, or to the colledge of Prophets (add, and of other spirituall persons intrusted with the government of the Church, together with the Prophets, as from <hi>vers.</hi> 37. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. is well observed by our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man Mr. <hi>Dickson</hi> upon this place). Therefore <hi>Walaeus Tom.</hi> 1 pag. 468. doth rightly collect from this place an authority of Church-Government. Protestant Writers prove hence the authority of General-Councels above the Pope: and that the Pope is a false Prophet, because he refuseth to be subject to the Prophets. <hi>Iunius</hi> in divers places, applieth this Text to the authority of Presbyteries and Synods. <hi>Gualther</hi> upon the place applyeth it against the Pope who will judge all men, and be judged of no man; whereas (saith he) the Apostle here will have no man how eminent soever, to be free from censure, when he is censurable. So then we have in this Text a subjection, and an authority of judging and censuring. And this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Apostle here speaks of, is neither the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:95406:171"/>
of the civil Magistrate, nor the Judgement of discretion common to the whole Church, but it is the Judgement or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Prophets, and that not School-wise according to Mr. <hi>Husseys</hi> notion of Schooles, that is by the Prophets disputing a man out of his error, and no more, no vote, no decision, no result, except he that hath taught an error do agree to the arguments of the other Prophets, and so all <hi>end in a brotherly accord,</hi> and in the <hi>unanimous consent of the whole Clergy</hi> (for so doth he advise the Parliament) so that he shall be no more subject to all the Prophets, then all the Prophets to him. Yea in Mr. <hi>Husseys</hi> sence the Pope will not refuse to be subject to a Councel of Prophets, and then Protestant Writers have been far out of their way, who have disputed against the Pope from this Text, supposing it to hold forth a binding authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Judgement of the Prophets, whereunto any one Prophet is bound to be subject, the Judgement of his private discretion being alwaies reserved to him, that he give not blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, I argue from <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 14. 20. The Lord Jesus reproveth the Angel of the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> for suffering those that taught the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the Angel of the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> for suffering <hi>Iezebel</hi> which called her self a Prophetesse, to seduce his people. The fault here reproved must be the neglect of Church-censures and corrective govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is so manifest, that they who plead most for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience from the Magistrate, do acknowledge that the Angels of these Churches are reproved for not censuring Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastically those that did thus seduce Gods people. Neither is it said <hi>because thou art silent and dost not reprove nor convince;</hi> but <hi>because thou hast there them that hold the Doctrine of Balaam:</hi> that is, because thou dost not cast them out of the Church, that they may not hurt others. So the English Annotations upon the place, referring us also to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. The Angel of the Church was guilty in this, that those who had so much scandalized the Church by their Doctrine, were still in the Church, and not yet cast out of the Church. And who can imagine that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of those Churches whom Christ himself commendeth for holding fast his name, and for their love, service, faith, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:95406:171"/>
patience were so void either of prudence as not to observe, or of zeal, as not to gainsay and confute by sound doctrine those soul and scandalous errors? Certainly their sin was like that of <hi>Eli,</hi> they did not together with the doctrinal and monitory part, make use of that Jurisdiction and corrective power, which God had put in their hands.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, We have another Argument from 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>And if any man obey not our word by this Epistle, note that man, and have no Company with him, that he may be ashamed.</hi> Here the Syriack helpeth us much. <hi>And if any man obey not these words which are contained in this Epistle, let that man be separated from you, neither have company with him, that he may be ashamed. Gualther</hi> upon the place saith, the Apostle speaks <hi>de disciplina Ecclesiastica,</hi> what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline they ought to have in the Church, and the end thereof. So <hi>Calvin, Beza, Piscator, Zanchius, Diodati,</hi> The Dutch Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Gomarus,</hi> also <hi>Mariana, Cajetan, Salmeron, Gorranus, Esthius in lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Sent.

Some controversie there is whether this Text reach as far as Excommunication (which doth not belong to this present Argument) but certainly it reacheth to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church-censure, and is more then the withdrawing of private Company and Fellowship, either because of personal or private injuries, or because of prophanesse. For 1. the offence spoken of by the Apostle is not a matter of Civil or Personal injury, but of scandal; he speaks of idle bodies that walked disorderly, not working at all, and if these must be noted and separated, how much more saith <hi>Theoylact.</hi> those who commit crimes and wickednesse? 2. Here is contumacy added to the offence, <hi>if any man obey not our word by this Epistle,</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that upon occasion of this Epistle, those that walked dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly were to be solemnly admonished, and required to work in quietnesse, and to eat their owne bread: which if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter admonition they would not do, then to note them. <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> clears it by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 23- <hi>for rebellion is as the sin of witck-craft, and stubbornesse is as iniquity and as idolatry.</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">

The learned Authors of the Dutch Annotations upon 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 14. tell us that <hi>this Greek word doth not properly signifie to present or represent one, but to note one and mark him out, putting some ignominy upon him, or outing him from an honourable Congregation, and marking or blotting out his name, as one unworthy of that honour.</hi> By which reason, as likewise by that which followes, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute those who construe the word <hi>note</hi> with the Word <hi>Epistle,</hi> as if the Apostle had said, note or present me such a one by a letter. 4. <hi>Have no company with him.</hi> He speaks it to the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, he will have those that walk orderly and by rule, to have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with those that walk disorderly. Now this concerneth the whole Church equally, and it is spoken to the Church, for what reason can there be that some in the Church should have no company with one, because of his scandalous and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly walking, but the same reason will make the whole Church to have no company with him? there may be divers ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil respects and considerations which may make it unfit for some to keep familiar civil fellowship, which respects and considerations do not concern others. But the avoyding of the company of those who walk scandalously and disorderly, and that because they walk in that manner, and further adde obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to their sin after publike admonition; must needs belong to the whole Church. 5. <hi>Note that man and have no company with him;</hi> he must first be noted, before he be avoyded, and both these are publick Ecclesiastical acts: for it was far from the Apostles meaning that every man should be herein left to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95406:172"/>
his liberty; he that pleaseth to note him and have no company with him, well and good; he that pleaseth not, shall be free. But unlesse there be an Ecclesiastical Judgement and censure past upon such a one, every one had been left to his liberty. 6. <hi>That he may be ashamed:</hi> this as it is the end of Church-censures, so it will be attained in a very small measure, and perhaps not at all, by one private man his avoyding the company of another, which will not make the offender ashamed, abased, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but when he is publikely noted, and when the Church avoids his Company, that is it which most covers a man with shame and confusion of face.</p>

               <p>Twelfthly, If in the Jewish Church there was an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Government, distinct from the Civil; then in the Christian Church also there ought to be an Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment distinct from the Civil.

               <p>The Proposition is proved thus. There can be no reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for an Ecclesiastical government among the Jews, distinct from the Civil, which will not hold as well and as strongly for an Ecclesiastical government among Christians, distinct from

                  </gap>. Now from the phrase, to the purpose of the Text. That it is meant of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I have these reasons which confirme me: 1. Because <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,</hi> are the very same words which he useth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. where he presseth the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the inces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uous man; as there, one unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in life; so here, some few seducers (especially that one who is singularly pointed at vers. 10.) is meant by the <hi>little leaven,</hi> which was to be purged out, lest it should leaven the whole Church. 2. Interpreters do generally agree, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle here alludeth to Circumcision, which those Judaizing teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pressed upon the <hi>Galatians</hi> as necessary: wishing that they who would so fain have the <hi>Galatians</hi> circumcised, were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves cut off and cast out of the Church as rotten members, or as a Gangren out of the body. This allusion suteth best with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. 3. The words so understood will more fitly answer and be paralel unto the cutting off in the Law, <hi>that soul shall be cut off from among his people</hi> (which I have before proved to be meant of excommunication) as likewise to that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Put away that wicked person from among you.</hi> 4. Other Interpretations do not so well agree to the Text. This cutting off could not be expected nor any hopes had of it by the hand of Justice, or of the Magistrate, for the Magistrates of that time were themselves troublers of the Christians, so far they were from cutting of those that troubled them. Those that understand the words of an imprecation of eternal cutting off from God,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:95406:174"/>
and being accursed from Christ, draw themselves into thorny questions, wherein they can hardly satisfie themselves or others. To understand it of cutting off by death, doth not well answer that allusion to Circumcision, generally observed (as hath been said) by Interpreters: which allusion doth intimate that it is not a cutting off out of the World, but a cutting off from the body of the Church. I would that they themselves were cut off as the <hi>praeputium</hi> from the Church, that is, cut off <hi>à consortio Ecclesiae</hi> saith <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>lther.</hi> If it be said, why then doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle onely wish it? Why doth he not prescribe or command to excommunicate them? To this we may either answer as <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>za,</hi> The Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> authority at that time was extreamly blasted and weakned in the Churches of <hi>Galatia;</hi> Or thus, the Apostle knew that as the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> then stood affected (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bewitched with the Judaizing Zealots, and in a manner moved away to another Gospel) both Churches and Ministery were unwilling to excommunicate those that he means of: for which cause he would not peremptorily command their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, <hi>renitente Ecclesiâ,</hi> but forbeareth for that season, wishing for better times. Some think that the Apostle speaketh positively of excommunication, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>He shall bear his Judgement.</hi> But others are of opinion the Apostle there speaks of the judgement of God, which he certainly and positively denounces, and that <hi>vers.</hi> 12. he addeth this as a distinct pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that he could wish them also cut off from the Church by excommunication.</p>
               <p>It will be an Argument of more weight against <hi>Erastus</hi> his Interpretation of that Text, if we object against him thus. This cutting off which the Apostle wisheth to those that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the <hi>Galatians,</hi> cannot be meant of a divine or miraculous judgement upon them, such as he thinks to be meant 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. (which place he parallels with <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 12. as to the punishment intended) for if so, why doth not the Apostle adjudge them posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to be cut off or destroyed, as he did constitute and decree by his Apostolical power of miracles (so thinks <hi>Erastus</hi>) the incestuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> to be delivered to Satan?

stay any, but when it seemed good in Gods eyes, <hi>sed quando Deo visum fuit utile, necessarium, &amp; salutare.</hi> But I ask, Was it right and agreeable to the will of God, that the Apostle should wish their cutting off? Was it not profitable and necessary for the Churches good, that they should be cut off? Where shall we finde that the working of a miracle was profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Churches good, and that an Apostle did desire and thirst after the working of that miracle, and yet had not power from God to work it? How had the false Apostles insulted at this? Is this the great Apostle of the Gentiles, who hath not power from God to work a miracle, when himself professeth he would gladly have it wrought?</p>

The Apostle is in that Chapter confuting the calumny of such as said of him, His Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were weighty and powerful, and did speak of great things; but when he himself is bodily present, he doth but little, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes no great authority, he is weak and almost contemptible. In answer hereunto, he tells them, <hi>The weapons of our warfare</hi> (speaking not onely in his own name, but in the name of all the Ministers of Christ) though they be not carnal, yet they <hi>are mighty through God</hi> to conquer and captivate souls to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ. And as for the stubborn and unruly, we are armed with a power of corrective government, which shall be more fully executed in due time. There is but one of two Interpretations which can with any probability seem to agree
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:95406:175"/>
to this Text, namely, that it is meant either of the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Apostolical power, by which they did miraculously punish some offenders (as <hi>Peter</hi> did <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ymas</hi>) or of a corrective Church-government, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. The Reasons which induce me to believe, that the Apostle meaneth here of Church-censures, especially Excommunication, and not of that extraordinary miraculous power, are these. 1. The reason added, <hi>When your obedience is fulfilled,</hi> cannot suit to the power of working miracles (for it had been the more seasonable to work such miracles, while the obedience of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was not yet fulfilled. Miracles are not for them that believe, but for them that believe not, saith the same Apostle.) But it suits very well to the power of Church-censures: for as <hi>Esthius</hi> and <hi>Novarinus</hi> explain the Apostles reason, it is in vain to excommunicate all such as are worthy of Excommunication, when there is a general re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and unwillingnesse in the Church; or to cut off a member, when the same evil hath infected either the whole or the greatest part of the body; which <hi>Augustine</hi> also tells us in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And this (by the way) confirms the reason which I gave why the Apostle onely wisheth those that troubled the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to be cut off, but doth not command it, in regard of the present unwillingnesse and disaffection of those Churches. 2. We may have a great deal of light to this place by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                  </gap>eandalous sins, whereof they had not repented, and for which they were not censured or cast out of the Church. The Apostle certifieth them, that if he come, he will not spare. What? was it his meaning to work a miracle upon every fornicator, and each other scandalous person in the Church of <hi>Corinth?</hi> No sure: mark his words; <hi>Now I write to them which heretofore have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and to ALL OTHER, that if I come again, I will not spare.</hi> Who can imagine his meaning to be, that he would work a miracle upon them and all other?

                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:95406:176"/>
that which the Apostle saith of the Spiritual weapons, <hi>mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds,</hi> &amp;c. was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or peculiar to the Apostles, but is rightly applied to all the Ministers of the Gospel: the more hardly can it be supposed, that what is immediately added, and as it were with one breath uttered, <hi>And having in readinesse to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> all disobedience,</hi> is meant of the extraordinary Apostolical power. Fourthly, such as the weapons are for conquering and subduing souls to the obedience of Christ, such is the corrective or punitive part there spoken of. But the weapons for conquering, are meerly Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, not corporal: Therefore the corrective or punitive part there spoken of, is also Spiritual, and so doth not concern the inflicting of corporal punishment, such as the <hi>Erastians</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by delivering to Satan.</p>

               <p>The sixteenth Argument to prove a distinct Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is this.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:95406:178"/>
Zion to be here meant. I conclude, as the Church is not onely a <hi>mystical</hi> but a <hi>political</hi> body, So Christ is not onely a <hi>mystical</hi> but a <hi>political</hi> Head.</p>
               <p>But peradventure some men will be bold to give another answer, that the Lord Jesus indeed reigneth over the Church, even in a political respect, but that the administration and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of this his Kingly office is in, by, and through the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, who is supreme Judge, Governour, and Head of the Church under Christ. To this I answer, Hence it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low 1. That Christs Kingdom <hi>is of this World, and commeth with observation,</hi> as the Kingdoms of this World do, which himself denieth <hi>Luke</hi> 17 20 <hi>Iohn</hi> 18 36. Next, It would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Christ doth not reigne nor exercise his Kingly office in the Government of his Church under Pagan, Turkish, or persecuting Princes, but onely under the Christian Magistrate, which no man dare say.</p>
               <p>3. The Civil Magistrate is Gods Vicegerent, but not Christs: that is, the Magistrates power hath its rise, orig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nation, insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and deputation, not from that speciall dominion which Christ exerciseth over the Church as Mediator and Head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, But from that Universal Lordship and Soveraignity which God exerciseth over all men by right of Creation: In so much, that there had been (for orders sake) Magistrates or superior Powers though man had not fallen, but continued in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and now by the Law of Nature and Nations there are Magistrates among those who know nothing of Christ, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom Christ reigneth not as Mediator, though God reigneth over them by the Kingdom of power.</p>
               <p>4. If the Magistrate be supreme Head and Governour of the Church under Christ, then the Ministers of the Church are the Magistrates Ministers as well as Christs, and must act in the Magistrates name, and as subordinate to him; and the Magistrate shall be Christs Minister, and act in Christs Name.</p>
               <p>The seventeeth Argument I draw from the institution of Excommunication by Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Tell it unto the Church: But if he neglect to hear the Church, Let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a Publican.</hi> In which Text 1.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pasle is here lookt upon under the notion of scandal, and of that which is also like to destroy his owne soule. 3. The scope is not ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but spiritual, to gain or save his soul. 4. The proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not without witnesses. 5. There is a publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made to the Church. 6. And that because he appeares impenitent, after admonitions given privatly, and before two or three. 7. The Church speaks and gives a: Judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, which he is bound to obey. 8. If he obey not, then he is to be esteemed and held as a heathen man and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican. 9. And that for his not hearing the Church, which is a publike scandal concerning the whole Church. 10. Being as as an Heathen and Publican, he is kept back from some ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. 11. He is bound on earth by Church-Officers. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever ye bind, &amp;c.</hi> 12. He is also bound in Heaven. More of this place else-where. These hints will now serve. The Erastians deny, that either the case, or the court, or the censure there mentioned is Ecclesiastical or Spiritual. But I prove all the three.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Christ</hi> speaketh of the case of scandals, not of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal or civil injuries, whereof he would be no Judge, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 14. and for which he would not permit Christians to go to Law before the Roman Emperor or his deputies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. 6. 7. But if their interpretation stand, they must grant that Christ gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth laws concerning civil injuries, and that he permitteth one of his disciples to accuse another for a civil injury before an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Judge. Beside, <hi>Christ</hi> saith not, If he shall hear thee, thou hast from him a voluntary reparation of the wrong, or satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for it (which is the end why we deal with one who hath done us a civil injury) But he saith, <hi>If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother,</hi> intimating that the offending brother is told and admonished of his fault, onely for a spiritual end, for the good of his soul, and for gaining him to repentance. All which proveth that our Saviour meaneth not there of private or civil injuries, as the Erastians suppose, but of scandals, of which also he had spoken much before, as appeareth by the preceding part of that chapter. A civil injury done by one brother to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is a scandal, but every scandal is not a civil injury. The
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95406:179"/>
Jewes (to whose custome <hi>Christ</hi> doth here allude) did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate for diverse scandals which were not civil inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And <hi>Paul</hi> saith of a scandal which was not a civil inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>when ye sin so against the brethren.</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The court is Ecclesiastical, not civil, for when it is said Tell it unto the Church, must we not expound Scripture by Scripture, and not understand the Word Church to be meant of a civil Court? for though the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is used <hi>Act.</hi> 19. <hi>reoitative,</hi> of a heathenish civil assembly, called by that name among those heathens: yet the pen-men of the holy Ghost have not made choice of the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in any place of the new Testament, to expresse a civil court either of Jewes or Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. So that we cannot suppose that the holy Ghost speaking so as men may understand him, would have put the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this place to signifie such a thing as no where else in the new Testament it is found to signifie. Nay, this very place expoundeth it self, for <hi>Christ</hi> directeth his speech to the Apostles, and in them to their Successors in the government of the Church. <hi>Whatsoever ye shall bind &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>if two of you shall agree,</hi> &amp;c. So that the church which here bindeth or judgeth, is an Assembly of the Apostles, Ministers, or Elders of the church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The censure is spirituall, as appeareth both by these words, <hi>Let him be unto thee as a Heathen and a Publican;</hi> which relate to the Excommunication from the church of the Jewes, and comprehendeth not onely an exclusion from private fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship and company (which was the condition of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, with whom the Jewes would not eat) but also an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from the Temple, Sacrifices, and communion in the holy things, which was the condition of heathens, yea of prophane Publicans too: of which elsewhere. And further it appeareth by these words, <hi>Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, &amp;c.</hi> The Apostles had no power to inflict any civil punishment, but they had power to bind the soul, and to retain the sin. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 23. And this power of binding is not in all the Scripture ascribed to the civil Magistrate.</p>
               <p>The eighteenth Argument shall be drawn from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of excommunication, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, 5. The Apostle writeth to the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to deliver to Sathan (for the delivery
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:95406:179"/>
to Sathan was an act of the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as the Syriack explaineth it) the incestuous man, which is called a <hi>censure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by many</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. that is, by the whole Presbytery of the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> And whereas some understand by delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Sathan, the putting forth of the extraordinary Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall power to the working of a miracle upon the offender, by giving him over into the hands of Sathan, so as to be bodily tormented by him, or to be killed and destroyed (as <hi>Erastus</hi> takes it) I answer 1. It cannot be meant of death, for it is said that <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> were delivered to Sathan, and to what end? that they might learne not to blaspheme, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20 which had been too late to learn after death, 2. Nor is it at all meant of any miraculous tormenting of the body by the divel, for beside that it is not likely this miracle could have been wrought, <hi>Paul</hi> himself not being present to work it, it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incredible that the Apostle would have so sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for that a miracle was not wrought upon the incestuous man, (it not being in their power to do:) or that he would seek the consent of that Church to the working of a miracle, and as a joynt act proceeding from him and the Church by common counsell and deliberation, for where read wee of any miracle wrought that way? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is much more safe to understand by delivering to Sathan, (as <hi>Gualther</hi> himself doth) Excommunication, which is a shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of a Church-member from the Church, whereby Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than commeth to get dominion and power over him, for he is the God of this World, who reigneth at his pleasure in and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver those who are not the Church and people of God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Eoh.</hi> 2. 2. And if any shall be so far unsatisfied as not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this sence which we put upon that phrase of delivering to Sathan; Yet our Argument for Excommunication drawn from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. standeth strong, the weight of it not being laid upon <hi>tradere Satanae</hi> onely, but upon <hi>vers.</hi> 6. 7. 11, 12. compared with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. which undeniably prove Excommunication from Church fellowship.</p>
               <p>The nineteenth Argument shall be drawn from <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your selves, and to all the flock over the which the holy Ghost hath made you Overseers</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Which Texts as they hold forth a Bishop and a Presbyter to be one and the same <hi>Iure divino,</hi> so they hold forth the ruling power of Presbyters or Elders.</p>
               <p>First, Because otherwise the <hi>simile</hi> (so much made use of in these Scriptures) of overseeing the flock (mentioned and joyned together with the feeding thereof) will fall short in a main and most materiall point: for the overseers of flocks do not onely make them to lye down in green pastures, and lead them beside the still waters, but they have also rodds and staves for ruling the flocks, and for correcting and reducing the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring sheep, which will not be brought home by the voice of the shepheard, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 2. 4. The Pastorall rod there mentioned by <hi>David</hi> is corrective: as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus paedag. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. who doth also paralel it with that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.

                  </gap> unto you with a rod?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> requireth the Elders of the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> to take heed unto, and to oversee the whole flock, which did consist of more then did or could then meet together ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily into one place for the worship of God, as appeareth by the Church in the house of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> (which was one, but not the onely one Church assembly at <hi>Ephesus</hi>) by the great and wonderfull increase of the Gospel at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and such other Arguments which I do but point at, the full debate of them not being my present work. <hi>Peter</hi> also writing to the Churches of the strangers in severall provinces, calls them the <hi>flock</hi> not <hi>flocks,</hi> and commends unto the Elders the feeding and oversight of that flock. Now what is it that can denominate many particular visible Churches or Congregations to be one visible ministeriall flock or Church, unlesse it be their union and association under one Ecclesiasticall Government? No doubt, they had the administration of the Word and Sacraments <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or severally. Nor do I deny but they had a partitive seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Government: but there was also an union or association of them under one common Government, which did denominate them to be one visible Ecclesiastical flock.</p>

                  </gap>s or extrinsecall from the Magistrate. Whence the soundest Protestant writers prove, that though the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate hath a power of convocating Synods, and he ought to do it when the Churches necessity or danger doth call for such a remedy; yet this power of his is <hi>positive,</hi> not <hi>privative, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative,</hi> not <hi>destructive,</hi> And that <hi>if the Magistrate be an enemy and persecuter of the Church and of true Religion, or cease to do his duty, that is to wit, in a manifest danger of the Church, the Church notwithstanding ought not to be wanting to her self, but ought to use the right and authority of convocation, which first and for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Secondly, Beside the publike debate and deliberation, the Synod did also choose and send certain delegates or commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and wrote by them a Synodical Epistle to the Churches in <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> I beleeve such Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical acts of sending Commissioners and letters to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in other Nations or Provinces, should now be lookt upon as acts of government, if done without the leave of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, as then <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were sent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That Synod did exercise and make use of a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Ecclesiastical power, for remedy of a three-fold Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical disease. 1. They purge out the leven of false doctrine and heresie, by deciding and determining that great controversie, whether Circumcision and the keeping of the Ceremoniall Law of <hi>Moses</hi> were neeessary to salvation. They hold forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the Churches the negative; And this they do by the <hi>dogmatik</hi> power. 2. There was a great scandal, taken by the beleeving Jewes (then not fully instructed and perswaded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abrogation of the Ceremoniall Law by the death of Christ) who were so far stumbled and offended at the beleeving

Gentiles for their eating of things sacrificed to Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ls, and of blood, and things strangled, that they could not freely nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly converse, company, and eate together with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. For remedy whereof, the Synod doth require (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the law of love, edification, peace, and avoyding of scandall) that the Gentiles should abstain from those things, as also from fornication, (which for what cause it is added, I do not now dispute) And this they do by the <hi>Diataktik</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. 3. There was a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a schisme, dissention, and rent made in the Church by the Judaizing Teachers, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. Who clothed themselves with a pretended authority and warrant from the Apostles and Elders at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and thereupon got the more following, and drew away the more disciples after them. For remedy hereof, the Synod stigmatizeth and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth those men, by declaring them to be lyars, troublers of the Church, and subverters of souls, <hi>vers.</hi> 24. And this they do by the <hi>Critick</hi> power, or authority of censures.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The decree and Canon of the Synod, which is made, imposed, emitted and promulgat, is authoritative, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive, and binding; <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>For it seemed good to the holy Ghost, and</hi> (here the Arabick repeateth <hi>it seemed good) to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen then these necessary things, That ye abstain &amp;c.</hi> If it be said that this was but a doctrinal advice. <hi>It seemed good &amp;c.</hi> I answer, <hi>Iosephus Antiq.

               </p>
               <p>These four considerations being laid together, concerning an intrinsecall Ecclesiastical power of assembling together Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodically; of choosing and sending Commissioners with a Synodical Epistle to the Churches in other parts; of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding effectual and necessary remedies both for heresies, scandals, and schismes arising in the Church; of making and imposing binding decrees on the Churches, will infallibly prove from Scripture authority another Government in the Church beside Magistracy.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MR.</hi> Hussey <hi>in his Epistle to my selfe objecteth thus,</hi> What will your censure doe? it will shame a few whores and knaves; a great matter to shame them the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shameth.</p>
               <p>All this <hi>in terminis</hi> might have been as justly objected against the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he wrote to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to put away from among themselves the incestuous man. What will your censure do <hi>Paul?</hi> a great matter to shame one whom the law of nature shameth. The Lord save me from that Religion which will not shame Whores and Theeves, and all other whom the Law of Nature shameth, and that in a Church way (as well as civilly) if any such member fall into such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety: yet this is not all. All Orthodox Writers that write of Church-censures, will tell him, that scandalls either of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or life, either against the first or second Table, fall under Ecclesiastical cognizance and censure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, He argueth thus</hi> Ibid. Sure in the day of our Lord there will be as good a returne of the word preached, as of the censure. <hi>And in his</hi> plea pag. 1. If the Word be able to make the man of God perfect, then nothing is wanting to him: <hi>perfectum cui nihil deest:</hi> and it is a wonder how that Conscience should be wrought upon by humane authority, with whom divine cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:95406:185"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This also he might as well have objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who did require the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to put away from among them the incestuous man, and <hi>Titus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct an Heretick after once or twice admonishing of him. 2. He might object the same thing against Magistracy. Shall there not be a better account of the word preached then of Magistracy? and if the Word be able to make the man of God perfect, there is no need of Magistracy. <hi>Perfectum est cui nihil deest.</hi> Surely many Erastian Arguments do wound Civil as well as Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Government. 3. Church-censures are not acts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority, for they are dispensed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and (if <hi>clave non errante</hi>) are ratified in heaven. 4. Discipline is no addition to that Word which is able to make the man of God perfect, for it is one of the directions of the Word. 5. The comparison which some make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the efficacy of the Word preached, and the efficacy of Church-discipline, as to the point of converting and winning foules, is a meer fallacy <hi>ab ignoratione <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>lenchi:</hi> for Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline is not intended as a converting, light-giving, or life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Ordinance. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God:</hi> and the Word is <hi>the power of God for salvation to every one that beleeveth.</hi> But Ecclesiastical Discipline hath a necessary use, though it hath not that use. Discipline and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in the Church are intended. 1. For the glory of God. that his name may not be blasphemed, nor the doctrine of the Gospel reproached, by occasion of uncensured scandalls in the Church. 2. For keeping the Ordinances of Christ from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation and pollution, that <hi>signa gratiae divinae,</hi> the signes of Gods favour and grace, and the seales of his Covenant may be denied to unworthy scandalous persons. 3. For preserving the Church from the infection of bad and scandalous examples, it is fit to put a black mark upon them, and to put away the wicked person as the Apostle saith; for a rotten member if it be not cut off, and a scabbed sheep if not separated from the flock, may infect the rest. 4. For the good also of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself, <hi>that he may be ashamed,</hi> and humbled. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 14. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. This afflicting of the sinner with shame and sorrow, may and shall by the blessing of God be a means to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

of the flesh; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. that is to tame and mortifie his lusts, and so far <hi>removere prohibens</hi> that he may be the better wrought upon by the Word. I conclude, Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being instituted by Christ, and having a necessary use in the Church; the Erastians gain nothing by comparing it with the Word. Because it is not so necessary as the Word, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not necessary at all. Or because it is not efficacious in the same manner as the word is. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not efficacious at all. The Apostle saith <hi>Christ sent me not to baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet this expression could not have proved that Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not an Ordinance of Christ, more then that can prove that Baptisme is not an Ordinance of Christ. A negative in the comparative, will not inferre a negative in the positive.</p>
               <p>3. Object. I could never yet see <hi>said Mr.</hi> Coleman, how two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate governments exempt from Superiority and inferiority can be in one State.</p>
               <p>Against this I instanced in the co-ordinate governments of a General and an Admiral, of a Master and a Father, of a Captain and a Master in one ship. Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> finding he can not make good Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> word, tells me pag. 7. that he meaneth two supreme co-ordinate Governments. Where first he loseth ground, and tacitely yeeldeth that Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Civil Government, distinct each from other do well consist, as long as they are not supreme, but as two armes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one head: No inconsistency therefore of Congregational and Classical Elderships, and of Provinciall Assemblies, with the subordinate Magistrates and civil Courts in Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Next we shall find also in Scripture two co-ordinate su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governments, for the civil and the Ecclesiastical San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin of the Jewes were both supreme and co-ordinate, and there was no appeal from the sentence of either: as is evident by that disjunctive Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 12. <hi>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the Priest</hi> (that is to the Priests, as <hi>vers.</hi> 9.) <hi>or unto the Judge</hi> (that is, the Assembly or Court of Judges, as I have cleared else-where) <hi>even that man shall die.</hi> But I have also answered more fully this objection concerning co-ordination.

And as strange it is that Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> makes <hi>Paul</hi> to act in the businesse, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. before he was either Saint or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Now to the Argument. I did answer at first (though Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> is pleased not to take notice of it) <hi>pag.</hi> 36. that where Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> objected, Ministers have other work to do, he might as well have added, that when Ministers have done that other work, and all that ever they can, yet without the power of Church-government, they shall not keep themselves, nor the Ordinances from pollution: that is, Church-Government is a part of their work, and a necessary part, which hath been proved: I thought it enough to touch an answer where an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was but touched: another objection in that very place being more insisted on (and with more colour of reason) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fear of an ambitious ensnarement.</p>
               <p>And for the objection now in hand, Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> hath made it no whit stronger by his instance from <hi>Act.</hi> 6. For 1. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did not wholy lay aside the care of the poor. Sure <hi>Paul</hi> (afterward an Apostle) took great care of the poor at diverse times, and in diverse places as himself recordeth: but such ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care of the poor as did distract and hinder them from the main work of preaching the Gospel, this was it which they declined; and in that respect the work of baptizing also did give place to the work of preaching, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. Likewise

the work of Discipline must be so ordered, as may not hinder the principal work of preaching the Gospel: which is very pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, yea <hi>probatum est:</hi> for where Church-government is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, there are as painful Preachers as any in the World, and such as neglect none of their other work. 2. To take speciall and particular care of the poor, did belong by Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (whose mind was no doubt known to the Apostles) to the office of Deacons, and for that reason the Ministers of the word ought in like manner to be relieved of that burthen by Deacons: but Church-Government doth belong to the Elders of the Church, of whom some labour both in Doctrine and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, others in Government onely.</p>
               <p>But neither must the Argument go so, I have another thing to ask; what is that other work which will take up the whole man? Mr. <hi>Hussey pag.</hi> 12. expounds Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> meaning, <hi>that the preaching of the Gospel would take up the whole man, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our time: our knowledge of the Scriptures is to be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ordinary means &amp;c.</hi> And in his Epistle to the Parliament he saith, <hi>I found the Minister charged onely with preaching and baptizing, which being performed with such zeal and diligence as is needful, is aboundantly a sufficient employment.</hi> And so he takes off the Minister not onely from Government, but from visiting particular families, especially the sick; from catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and examining those who are to be admitted to the Lords Supper, from the celebration of the Lords Supper it self, to say nothing of the solemnization of marriage, yea from disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Schools concerning the controversies of the time, which yet himself so much calls for. And why? the Minister hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work to do, and such as will take up the whole man, which is to preach and baptize.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Object.</hi> If acts of Government be put in the hands of Church-Officers, there is fear of an ambitious ensnarement, which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> proved by an arguing from his owne heart to the hearts of other men. <hi>Mr. Gilespies answer to the matter of ambition</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Hussey, pag.</hi> 10. <hi>is onely by involving the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistrate in the same danger of ambition.</hi> And here he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out into a concertation, professedly with my answer, but really with Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Argument: for the foundation of his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:95406:187"/>
Argument was universal. <hi>Might I measure others by my selfe, and I know not why I may not (God fashioneth mens hearts alike, and as in warer face answers to face, so the heart of man to man) &amp;c.</hi> Hereupon I replyed, <hi>Is this corruption onely in the hearts of Ministers? or is it in the hearts of all other men? I suppose he will say in all mens hearts; and then his Argument will conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Civil Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now <hi>per omnes musas</hi> I beseech him, which of us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volveth the Magistrate in ambition? Must I be charged with involving the Magistrate because I discovered that Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Argument involveth the Magistrate? He might as truly say he is not the Traytor that commits Treason, but he is the Traytor that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Treason. And why saith he that my answer was <hi>onely</hi> concerning that involving of the Magistrate? Did I not first shew that the two Scriptures on which Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was grounded, did not prove it: though now Mr. <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> tells us Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> did but allude to those Scriptures (I am sure it was all the Scripturall proof which was brought for that Argument upon which so much weight was laid) <hi>which I will not trouble my Reader withall</hi> saith he: A pretty shift, when a man cannot defend the Argument, then forsooth he will not trouble the Reader. Next, did I not deny that which Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> did take for granted; that we may reason from this or that particular corruption in one mans heart, to prove the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular corruption in all other mens hearts, and that <hi>Paul</hi> taught us not so? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3. Did I not also answer in his owne words, that his Brethrens <hi>wisedom and humility may safely be trusted with as large a share of Government as themselves desire?</hi> Did I not lastly answer, that if his whole Argument were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it cannot prove that there ought to be no Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for where the thing is necessary, abuses must be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and amended, but must not take away the thing it self? Unto which exceptions nothing hath been replied, nor offered to vindicate or make good that Argument which was publikely offered to the Parliament. If such men were fit to put the reverend Assembly and all the Ministery of <hi>England</hi> to school again, to learn to dispute, let every pious and wise man judg. And so I am ledd on to another Objection.</p>

But Mr. <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> pag. 15. tells us the Minister must not be called from his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to examine notorious offences: which indeed suteth his noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Schools.

How shall the Censurers themselves be censured? This objection I find in the eight Epistle of <hi>Dionysius Areopagita</hi> (or who ever he was that wrote under that name) It was made by one <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <gap reason="foreign">

It is too much diffidence (and groundlesse, I dare say) to apprehend that Ministers who have taken upon them the bond of such a Covenant, and joyned in such a Reformation, will yet be ready to connive at any scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous person of their owne coat. And if a Classis should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to commit such an error, yet there can be no such fear in this particular from a Provinciall or National Assembly, which in a well Reformed Church, (as they are constituted of choice, able, and godly, both Ministers and others assembled from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse quarters, so) use to correct (not to confirme) the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>administration in inferior Ecclesiastical Courts. I speak here of the Ecclesiastical offences of Church-officers: their other offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces belonging wholy to the Civil cognizance and Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>let the Scripture speak expressely, and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions appear Institutions, and all must bow.</hi> It is asked why we must not prove <hi>a must be,</hi> as well as <hi>a may be:</hi> and whether do our proofes amount to an Institution and a <hi>Ius divinum.</hi> For satisfaction in this point also. I answer the Question which for the present I speak to, is not whether Christ hath in his Word limited and determined us to any one particular forme of Church-government, so as no other forme can be admitted
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:95406:188"/>
as lawful or agreeable to the Word: Much lesse do I now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what is that particular forme or kind of Government which Christ hath instituted. But the present controversie with the Erastians is, whether Christ have not appointed and instituted a Government in his Church in the hands of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers, distinct from Civil government: As it is one thing to enquire whether it be the will of God, that there be a civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Magistracy, that is, that there be not an Anarchie in a N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion, but some rule and government. Another thing, to enquire whether God hath in his Word limitted a nation to any one particular kind of Civil Government, and if any, what it is? So it is one thing to enquire whether it be the will of Christ, that there be an Ecclesiastical Government, or an intrinsecal power of ruling in the hands of Church-officers, distinct from the civil Government? Another thing to ask whether the Word determineth any one kind of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as necessary, and which it is? The former, not the latter is our present controversie. Yea in very truth the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastians do oppose not onely the institution, but the lawfulnesse and agreeablenesse to the Word of God, of a Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment distinct from the civil; For their principles and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments tend to the investing of the civil Magistrate with the whole and sole power of Church-Government; as that which belongeth to him onely, and that <hi>Iure divino:</hi> So that if their Principles hold good, it shall be unlawful and contrary to the Word of God, for Church-officers to claim, or assume, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise any Government or power of censures. Though (I say) the clearing and vindicating of the lawfulnesse of a distinct Church-Government, doth overthrow the Erastian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: yet that I may deal the more clearly and fully, for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all such as may be satisfied, this I avouch and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre: <hi>It is</hi> Jure divino, <hi>It is the will of God, and of his Sonne Iesus Christ the King and Head of his Church, that there be a Church-Government in the hands of Church-Officers distinct from the Civil Government. It is</hi> de necessitate praecepti, <hi>of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of precept that it be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:95406:189"/>
it, especially if the strength of them be put together. Yet now to drive the nail to the head, I adde these following Arguments, directly inferring and proving an Institution.</p>
               <p>First, The Scripture speaks of Church Government in the same manner, and with the same height, fulnesse, and perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorinesse of expression, as it speaketh of other things which are without controversie acknowledged even by the Erastians themselves to be Institutions of Christ. For instance, Let the Erastians prove against the Socinians the necessity and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of the Ordinance of Baptisme, that it ought to continue alwais in the Church, and that by vertue of an Institution and precept of Christ: I will undertake by the like <hi>medium</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the like conclusion concerning Church-Government. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, let them prove the necessity, perpetuity, and instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (I say not now of the Word it self, or of preaching, but) of the ministery, or of the Pastoral office, I will bring the like Argument concerning Church-Government: I do not now compare or paralel the Government with the Ministery of the Word <hi>quo ad necessitatem medii vel finis,</hi> as being equally neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to salvation, nor yet as being equally excellent; but this I say, The one is by the Scripture language an Institution and Ordinance of Christ as well as the other. One Ordinance may differ much from another, and still both be Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Church-Government is reckoned among such things as had an Institution, and which God did set in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. It is a good Argument for the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pastors and Teachers, that God set them in the Church, as we read in that place, and Christ gave them to the Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. Will not this then hold as well for the Institution of a Government in the Church? That the Governments men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. are Ecclesiastical and distinct from civil, is already proved, Chap. 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it be the will and commandement of God, that we be subject and obedient to Church-Governors, as those who are over us in the Lord, as well as to civil Governors, then it is the will of God that there be a rule and Government in the Church, distinct from the civil. For <hi>Relata se mut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o ponunt vel tollunt.</hi> If we be obliged by the fifth commandement to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:95406:189"/>
honour Magistrates as Fathers, then it is the will of God that there be such Fathers. So when we are commanded to know them which are over us in the Lord, and to esteem them highly, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. to honour doubly Elders that rule well, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. to be subject and obedlent unto Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Rulers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. with verse 7. 24. doth not this intimate the will of God, that Pasto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s and Elders be over us in the Lord, and rule us Ecclesiastically?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That which being administred is a praise and commendati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n to a Church, and being omitted is a ground of controversie to Christ against a Church, can be no other then an Ordinance, and necessary duty. But Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Discipline is such a thing, as being administred, it is a praise and commendation to a Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Revil.</hi> 2. 2. and being omitted is a ground of Controversie to Christ against a Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. 2. 6. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 14. 20. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The rules and directions concerning an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Government and Discipline are delivered precept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in Scripture 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>Put away that wicked person from among you.</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Note that man.

               <p>Sixthly, There is an Institution and command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18 17. <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen man and a Publican.</hi> In which place there are three Acts of the Church, that is, of the Assembly of Church-Officers. 1. They must be met together to receive complaints and accusations, <hi>Tell the Church.</hi> 2. They give sentence concerning the case, <hi>if he neglect to hear the Church,</hi> &amp;c. Where heareing is required and obedience, there must needs be an authoritative speaking or judging. So that they who would prove the Church here hath onely power to admonish doctrinally, because it is said <hi>If he hear not the Church;</hi> they may as well prove that the Judges of Israel had no more power but to admonish doctrinally because it is
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:95406:190"/>
appointed <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 12. that the man who will not hearken to the Judge shall die; and it is not there expressed that the Judge shall put him to death, more then it is expressed here that the Church shall declare the offender to be as a heathen and a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. 3. They must bind such a one by Excommunication, <hi>Whatsoever ye bind on earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Neither could it ever enter in the thoughts of Jesus Christ to command one Church-member or private brother to esteem another brother as an heathen and a publican, whom he would not have so esteemed by the whole Church: and least of all can it be the will of Christ that one and the same person should be esteemed by one of the Church to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be as a heathen and a publican, and withall be esteemed by the whole Church as a brother, a good Christian, a Church-member, and accordingly to be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted to the Ordinances.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Where is that Christian Magistracy which hath suppressed or punished all such offences as did f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll under Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical cognizance and censure, in the Primitive and Apostolick Churches? Or where is that Christian Magistrate that will yet undertake to punish all those offences and scandals which were censured in the Apostolick Churches? Till some such instance be given, this exception against Church-discipline and censures under a Christian Magistrate hath not so much as colour enough. <hi>Aliae sunt leges Caesarum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e Christi: aliud Papinianus, aliud Paulus noster praecipit</hi> saith <hi>Hierome in Epitaph. Fabi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>lae. Caesars Lawes, and Christs Lawes are not the same, but different. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinianus commands one thing, Paul another thing. Chrysostome Homil.</hi> 12. <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Epist. ad Cor.</hi> tells us that the best and wisest Law-givers had appointed no punishment for fornication, for consuming and trifling away of time with playing at dice, for gluttony and drunkennesse, for Stage-plaies and lascivious whorish gestures therein. Is there not some cause to apply all this (and much more of this kind) even to Christian Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Magistrates? Put the case that he who is called a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as the Apostle speaks) that is a member of the visible Church, be found grossely ignorant of the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and so far from growing in knowledge, that he loseth the knowledge of the Scriptures, and of the truth of God which he had (for this hath been diverse times observed) through ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the means: or if he be known to neglect ordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lly prayer in and with his Family, and to continue in that offence after admonition: or if he live in known or scandalous malice and envie, and refuse to be reconciled with his neighbour, or if he be a known lyar and dissembler: or if by his words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he do scandalously and manifestly shew himself covetous, drowned in sensuality, ambitious, proud: or if he give a foul scandal by filthy and obscene speeches, by lascivious, obscene, whorish-like gestures or actions, where the act it self of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:95406:191"/>
or fornication cannot be proved. I suppose that for these and such like scandals (which are causes deserving not onely the Elderships enquiry and admonition, but suspension from the Lords Table) the Christian Magistrate neither doth, nor by the civil or municipal Laws is bound to arraign and punish all such as are guilty thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift Answ. to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. pag.</hi> 114. did alledge that the Church <hi>may not be governed under a Christian Magistrate as it may under a Tyrant,</hi> which he brings as an exception against ruling Elders and Elderships, while he could not denie but such there were in the Primitive Church. Mr. <hi>Cartwrigh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in his Reply pag. 140. answereth, that if these Elders under a Tyrant had medled with any office of a Magistrate, then there had been some cause why a godly Magistrate being in the Church, that office should cease: but since they did onely assist the Pastor in matters Ecclesiastical, there is no distinction between times of persecution, and times of peace, as touching the office of Elders. The like say I of Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and discipline. If the Government of the Church by Presbyteries and Synods, if suspension and excommunication in the Apostles times had been an usurping of any thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Magistrate, then there had been some reason to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all Church-censures and Ecclesiastical Government, when the Magistrate turned Christian, and willing to do his duty. But if not, then the civil and Church-government may still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main distinct, even where the State is Christian.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Every Institution or Ordinance of Christ, must continue as a perpetual obligation, unlesse we can find in the Word that Christ hath given us a dispensation or taken off the obligation, and set a period to the Ordinance, that it shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so long and no longer. I mean every Ordinance of Christ must be perpetual, which we cannot prove from the Word to be but temporal or extraordinary. Now in the Word Christ hath not appointed the governing the Church, and correcting scandals, to be onely under a Tyrant, and to cease under a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrate: neither is there any such thing held forth in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (which yet our opposites must shew, if they will make good what they say) But contrariwise, what Christ delivered
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:95406:192"/>
to the Apostles, and they to the Churches, is to be kept and continued, till our Lord come again 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. 26. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 14. and he himself saith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 24. 25. <hi>That which ye have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, hold fast till I come.</hi> These things were not spoken to the Apostles, to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to the Churches of that time personally (for they were not to live till Christs comming again) but the charge was given to them in name of and with respect unto all the Ministery and Churches of Christ.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This exception made against Church-censures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Christian Magistrate, supposeth that such censures will make an interfering and clashing between the civil and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical power. But there is no cause for that fear, these powers being so hugely differenced in their efficient causes, matters, formes, ends, effects, objects, adjuncts, correlations, and ultimate terminations, as I have made it to appear in the particulars, Chap. 4.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Churches liberty and power is not to be infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, diminished, nor taken away; but preserved, maintained, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and augmented under a Christian Magistrate. Were it not a sad case, if there should be cause to say that the Churches of Christ have not so much liberty under a Christian Magistrate to keep themselves and the Ordinances from pollution, as they had under Pagan and Infidel Magistrates?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Why may not Christian Church-government consist with Christian Magistracy, as well as the Jewish Church government did consist with the Jewish Magistracy, being of the same Religion? Or if we please to look to later Presidents, who can be ignorant that civil government and Church-disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline have rather strengthened then destroyed each other, not onely in <hi>France</hi> where the Magistracy is not Protestant, but in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and else-where?</p>
               <p>Eightly, We have covenanted to endeavour a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-Government and discipline <hi>according to the word of God and the example of the best Reformed Churches.</hi> Now both the Word of God, and the example of the best Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, leadeth us to a Church-government distinct from civil Government: and the example of the best Reformed Churches doth undeniably lead us to a Church-discipline, even where
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:95406:192"/>
he Magistrate is Christian, neither doth the word make any exception of Christian States, but contrariwise chargeth us to keep the commandement and Ordinances till Christ come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The Magistrate hath other work to do, and such as will take up the whole man: and if he should take upon him the whole burthen of Church-Government, the enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, examining and correcting of all scandals in the Church, surely it is more then he can discharge, or give a good account to God of. It will be hard enough to Church-officers to do it, though they are set apart to that service, and <hi>ex officio</hi> do watch over peoples souls, as they that must give an account. But for the Christian Magistrate to discharge the whole corrective part of Church-Government, and to watch over the soules of all the people; so as to take care of the purging of the Church from scandals, and for that end to observe, examine, and judge all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences in the Church, and to determine that this man ought to be admitted to the Sacrament, and that man ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (for that there must be a suspension of scandalous and unworthy persons, I now take it for granted because of the Ordinance of Parliament) as it is impossible for the Magistrate to do all this, so I beleeve it will be to him <hi>durus sermo, a hard saying,</hi> to hear that he must give account to God of all these things; and that Ministers have no more to answer for but preaching, ministring the Sacraments to those to whom they are appointed to give them, catechizing, visiting the sick, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, admonishing, reproving, comforting. It was a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the Prelat; he assumed the Ecclesiastical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a whole Diocesse, and could not give account to God for so many thousands, and sometime hundreths of thousand souls. Yet Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> would have had the Parliament to be Church-Officers to the whole Kingdom in point of corrective Government, and the Ministery to have no part of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But then I ask, How shall they answer for that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Government and administration of theirs, more then the Prelat could answer for the Ecclesiastical Government of a whole Diocesse? If it be said that the Parliament is onely to settle a rule, and to give order what is to be done, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:95406:193"/>
the execution and the managing of particular cases to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Courts and inferiour Officers, then no more is said then the Prelats did plead for themselves, that they did <hi>per alium</hi> what they could not do <hi>per se.</hi> So that such principles do tend directly to involve the Parliament in the Prelatical guiltinesse, which our Principles do avoid. Was it not another Argument used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Prelats, that they could not manage both Civil and Church-government, and that an Ecclesiastical Administration could not consist with civil power and places in the Parliament or with offices of State, any one of these administrations (either the civil or the Ecclesiastical) requiring the whole man.</p>
               <p>Do not the <hi>Erastians</hi> endeavour to draw the Parliament into the very same absurdity with which the Prelats were pressed? For if any of these two administrations require the whole man, how can the civil Magistrate (though Christian) take upon him the burthen of Church-Government, more then Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers can take upon them the burthen of civil-government? <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew gives this reason why <hi>Moses</hi> did make a partition of the charge between <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> committing to the one the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to the other the Ecclesiastical administration. <hi>He conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it was impossible rightly to take care both of the supreme civil power, and of the Priesthood, since the one professeth to care for things pertaining to God, the other for men. Philo de charitate.</hi>

The reasons are taken 1. From the glory of God, <hi>vers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From the difference which ought to be made between the foul sins of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and others that are not Church-members: a blacker mark is to be put upon the former, then upon the latter: and more withdrawing there must be from a scandalous brother or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor of Christian Religion, then from a prophane Heathen, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. 10. 11.</p>
               <p>From all which it doth appear, that it is not without good reason that <hi>Martyr</hi> and <hi>Pareus</hi> upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the necessity of Excommunication, under a Christian and pious Magistrate, as well as under an Infidel and prophane Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, The end and use for which Church-censures are necessary, is not intended and endeavoured, much lesse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by the government of the Christian Magistrate. For though the Christian Magistrate punisheth many (I cannot say all) grosse and scandalous sins with corporal or civil punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yet to punish sin is one thing; to seek the salvation of the sinner is another thing: so the offender his suffering of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:95406:194"/>
and satisfying the Law of the Land is one thing; his declaring of his repentance, and publike confession of his sin, for taking away the scandal which he hath given to the Church, is another thing. Suppose a deli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Suppose also that he is by such corporal or civil punishments as by a bit and bridle over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed and restrained from committing again the like ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rnal acts: Notwithstanding he hath not the least signe of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and godly sorrow for his former foul and scandalous sins, and he is known to be not an accuser, but an excuser of himself for those faults and scandals. Such a one comes and desires to receive the Sacrament. Must his <hi>poenal satisfaction</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrate be a sufficient <hi>poenitential satisfaction</hi> to the Church? Here is a rock which the <hi>Er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>stians</hi> dash upon, unlesse they admit of a distinct Ecclesiastical Judgement, concerning the signes of repentance in a scandalous sinner, according to which, as these signes shall appear or not appear, he is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or not admitted to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, the power of binding and loosing, is not a temporary but a perpetual power, that is, appointed by Christ to continue in his Church alwaies unto the end. Now this power is given onely to Church-officers, and Christ hath not given the keyes of discipline and the power of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (of which else-where) to the Magistrate, nay not to the Christian Magistrate, more then to the Infidel Magistrate. Let the least hint be found in Scripture, where Christ hath given any such power to the Christian Magistrate, and I yeeld the cause.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, The new Testament holdeth out as little of the Ministery of the Word and Sacraments under a Chri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stian Magistrate, as it doth of a Church-government under a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrate. Shall this therefore strengthen the Socinian Tenent, That Baptisme is not a perpetual Ordinance in the Church, and that we are not obliged by that commission

which the Apostles had to baptize? God forbid.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, The German Anabaptists required an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse warrant or example in the New Testament of a Christian Magistrate, or of the sword and wars in a Christian State, yet this hath been thought no good Argument against Magistracy and wars among Christians.</p>

                  <hi>And this day also there is need of Ecclesiastical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, which being instituted in the Reformed Churches, ought to be diligently kept, lest the indulgence of Magistrates, which reignes almost every where, should render the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel suspected among those that are without, and that themselves also may be contained in their office, and may not think that any thing they will is lawful to them in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all this, let me put Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> and other <hi>Erastians</hi> in mind, that if they do acknowledge that Jesus Christ hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted or commanded that there be a Church Government and power of censures distinct from the Civil Government, when the Magistrate is Heathenish or Idolatrous, let them speak it out, and let us agree so far. Otherwise if they do not agree in this, it is but a blind for them to make use of this distinction, that where the Magistrate is Christian, there is no necessity of a distinct Church-Government.</p>
               <p>I conclude with a passage of Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> in his <hi>twelve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable serious Questions touching Church-Government.</hi> The ninth of those Questions runs thus. <hi>Whether the Independents challenge of the Presbyterians to shew them any National Church, professing Christ in our Saviours or the Apostles daies, before any one Nation totally converted to the Christian Faith, or any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral open profession made of it by the Princes, Magistrates, and major part of any Nation, Kingdom, Republick, who were then all generally Pagans and Persecutors of the Gospel, not then uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally</hi>

                  <hi>imbraced, be not a most irrational unjust demand?</hi> Sure if this hold against the Independents, it will hold as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea more strongly against the <hi>Erastians,</hi> to prove their demand to be most irrational and unjust, while they challenge us to shew them in the New-Testament a distinct Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under a Christian Magistrate, or where the State was Christian, though themselves know Magistrates and States were then generally Pagan and not Christian: Yea there was in those daies much more of a national Church then of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrate.</p>

                     <p>FUrthermore, there is another power of duty, or ministerial power limited out by him, who hath full and absolute power and authority. And this is more like a Ministry then Dominion. For we see that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:95406:196"/>
some master doth give unto the steward of his house authority and power over his House, and for that cause delivereth him his keyes, that he may admit or exclude such as his master will have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or excluded. According to this power, doth the Minister by his office, that which the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to do, and the Lord doth ratifie and confirm that which he doth, and will have the deeds of his ministers to be acknowledged and esteemed as his own deeds, unto which end are those speeches in the Gospel: <hi>I will give unto thee the keyes of the Kingdom</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>of heaven, and whatsoever thou bindest or loosest in earth, shall be bound and loosed in heaven.</hi> Again, <hi>whose sins so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi>

                        <hi>ye remit, they shall be remitted; and whose sins soever ye retain, they shall be retained.</hi> But if the minister deal not in all things as his Lord hath commanded him: but passe the limits and bounds of Faith, then the Lord doth make void that which he doth. Wherefore the Ecclesiastical power of the Ministers of the Church, is that function whereby they do indeed govern the Church of God, but yet so as they do all things in the Church as he hath prescribed in his Word; which thing being so done, the faithful do esteem them as done of the Lord himself.</p>

the holy Gospel, although they should do this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, that is, should shew forth that Word of true comfort, and the joyful message of peace, and new tydings of that favour which God offereth, but also that to the beleeving and unbeleeving, they should publikely or privately denounce and make known, to wit, to them his favour, to these his wrath, and that to all in general, or to every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that they may wisely receive some into the house of God, to the communion of Saints, and drive some out from thence, and may so through the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their Ministery, hold in their hand the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of Christ his Kingdom, and use the same to the government of Christ his Sheep.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving now by the light of Scripture and other helps asserted a Church-government distinct from civill Magistracy, both in the Old and New Testament, the last part of my present undertaking shall be to vindicate the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Ordinances of <hi>Excommunication</hi> and <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension,</hi> called by the Schoolmen <hi>Excommunicatio major &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi> Of which also I have before spoken divers things occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally;
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:95406:200"/>
for I have asserted an Excommunication and Suspension in the Jewish Church, <hi>Booke</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The nature, grounds, reasons, uses, and ends whereof, were not proper to the Old Testament, but such as concerne the Christian Church. I have also brought arguments <hi>Booke</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9, 10. which conclude not onely Church-government, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. And so much of my worke is done: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse there is more to doe. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> first in his foure grand <hi>Quaeres,</hi> and thereafter in his <hi>Vindication</hi> of the same, hath argued much, both against the Suspension from the Sacrament of a person not Excommunicated and wholly cast out of the Church, and against some of the most pregnant Scripturall proofes for Excommunication it selfe. In his <hi>Vindication</hi> he hath branched forth the controversie into ten points of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Two of these, <hi>viz.</hi> the fifth concerning suspension from the Sacrament of the Passeover, and the ninth concerning cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Synagogue, I have discussed before in the first Book. Where I have also examined other assertions of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Jewish Sanhedrin, Temple, confession of sinne. The other points of difference not handled before, I am (as the Lord will help me) now to speak to.</p>
               <p>The first point of difference is, whether in those foure Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of his he stated the Controversie aright. He is offended that I (in a Sermon of mine before the honourable House of Commons) charged the Questionist with mistakes, and that I did not take notice of the question concerning suspension from the Sacrament, as he stated it. <hi>Vindic. pag.</hi> 3. I had reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had mis-stated it; and since it pleased him to interpose in a matter depending between the Honourable houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the Reverend Assembly of Divines, and to publish a paper plainly reflecting upon a Petition of the Assembly, I hope he can not think either the Assembly, or me, tied to his stating of the question. If he will meddle with the businesse of the Assembly, he must speak to it as it is. And that it may now appeare how just cause I had to charge his Queres with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of the state of the question, (which he still mistaketh) I shall endeavour a more particular and full discovery of these his mistakes. And first, that which was desired by the Assembly
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:95406:200"/>
was, that such a rule may be established by authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as may keep off all scandalous and notorious sinners from the Sacrament. The question was not what Texts of Scripture doe warrant this thing. It did not concerne me to debate whether the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament quoted by him, prove suspension from the Lords Table. The controversie was of the practicall conclusion, and of establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a rule, as may keep off scandalous persons from the Sacrament. If the thing be done, if the conclusion be consented to, there is the greater liberty for men to abound in their own sence concerning the <hi>mediums</hi> to prove it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and if he would needs debate what Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doe prove the thing, and what precept or president in Scripture doth warrant it: me thinks he had done better to have informed himselfe, on what Scripturall proofs the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Assembly had grounded the suspension of scandalous sinners from the Sacrament, though not yet cast out of the Church; The proofes from Scripture voted in the Assembly, were these. Because the Ordinance it selfe must not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned. And because we are charged to withdraw from those who walk disorderly. And because of the great sinne and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger both to him that comes unworthily, and also to the whole Church. The Scriptures from which the Assembly did prove all this, were, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 6, 14, 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27, to the end of the Chapter, compared with <hi>Iude</hi> vers. 23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. Another proofe added by the Assembly was this. There was power and authority under the Old Testament to keep unclean persons from holy things, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 7. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 19. And the like power and authority by way of analogy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues under the new Testament, for the authoritative suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Lords Table, of a person not yet cast out of the Church. Now that which was the strength of the Assemblies proofes of the proposition, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> hath almost never touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but run out upon other particulars.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, observe that he disputes all along whether any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister can suspend one from the Sacrament. But this no body, that I know, asserts. The power is given not <hi>uni,</hi> but <hi>unitati,</hi> to the Eldership, not to any one, either Minister or Elder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="540" facs="tcp:95406:201"/>Fourthly, that which in the Preface of his Queres he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove, is, that Excommunication and suspension from the Sacrament, being a matter of great moment and much difficulty, is to be handled and established with great wisdom, caution and moderation. And his result in the close is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a limited jurisdiction in Presbyteries. As these things are not denied by any that I know, so himselfe manifestly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth by these expressions, the thing it selfe for the substance, (which yet the current of his debate runneth against<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

These and such like limitations we doe not onely admit of, but desire to be put.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he goeth about to cleare the state of the question out of <hi>Aretius,</hi> and citeth him for what himself now undertaketh to prove. Whereas <hi>Aretius</hi> holds Excommunication to be an ordinance of God both in the Old and New Testament, and that it was wanting through the injury and corruption of the times, the abuse of it in Popery having made the thing it self hatefull; and the most part in those places where he lived, loving carnall liberty so well; and taking upon them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and defence of prophane ones, and being so unwilling
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:95406:201"/>
to be brought under the yoke of Christ. For these and the like reasons, he thought it not expedient to have that discipline of Excommunication erected at that time in those parts; as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe gives the reasons: and <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Theol. probl. loc.</hi> 132.

So that this is the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it shall be stated out of <hi>Aretius;</hi> Whether Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, being an Ordinance of God, ought to be setled where prophanesse and licentiousnesse abounds, and where the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter party is like to be oppressed by the greater party: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we should wait till God send better times for the setling of it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the Author of those questions maketh a parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that power of censures now desired to be setled in Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, and the Prelaticall tyranny, as if this were the very power which heretofore was declaimed against in, denied to, and quite taken away from the Prelates. Yea in the close he makes this power now desired to be setled in Presbyteries, to be such <hi>as our very Lordly Prelates never durst to claime.</hi> Yet <hi>Ecclesiae Anglicanae politeia in tabulas digesta authore Richardo Cousin Tab.</hi> 5. tels me that the Episcopall Jurisdiction did exercise it selfe in these censures, which were common both to Lay-men and Clergy-men (as they were called.) 1. <hi>Interdictio divinorum.</hi> 2. <hi>Monitio.</hi> 3. <hi>Suspensio vel ab ingressu Ecclesiae, vel a perceptione Sacramentorum.</hi> 4. <hi>Excommunicatio.</hi> 5. <hi>Anathematisinius, &amp;c.</hi> Neverthelesse there is a truth too in that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> saith. I confesse the Prelates never durst desire that which this learned and pious Assembly hath desired in this particular. He hath said it. The Prelats never durst indeed take upon them to suspend all scandalous persons from the Sacrament; for if they had, it had been said unto most of them, <hi>Physitian cure thy selfe,</hi> besides the losing of many of their party. And moreover the very Lordly Prelates never durst make themselves to be but members of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, nor to be subject to the admonitions and censures of their brethren, which every Minister now must doe. The Lordly Prelate did (contrary to the institution of Jesus Christ) make himselfe Pastor of many Congregations, even of his whole Diocesse, and did assume sole and whole power of
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:95406:202"/>
Government and Church censures to himself, and his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling officers which were to execute the same in his name. And as the appropriating of Jurisdiction to the Lordly Prelate, so the manner and kind of his Government, and his proceedings in Ecclesiasticall censures, came neither from Christ nor from the purest antiquity, but from the Popes Canon Law. What then hath Presbytery to doe with Prelacy? as much as light with darknesse, or righteousnesse with unrighteousnesse. He that would see more of the differences between Presbyteriall and prelaticall Government, let him read a Book Printed in the Prelates times, entituled <hi>The Pastor and the Prelate.</hi> And <hi>the cleere Antithesis between Presbytery and Prelacy</hi> Printed at <hi>London anno.</hi> 1644. See also what I have said before Book. 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is evident by his fourth Question, that he states the case, as if Ministers meant to know the secrets of all mens hearts, and to be so censorious and peremptory in their Judging as to quench the smoaking Flax or to break the bruised Reed; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he askes whether the Sacrament may be denyed to a man, <hi>if he desires to receive it, in case he professe his sincere Repentance for his sinnes past, and promise newnesse of life for the time to come.</hi> God forbid we be censorious, peremptory, and rigid in our judging of mens spirituall Estate; where there is any thing of Christ, its to be cherished, not quenched. But again, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that we shut our eyes to call darknesse light, or black white.

whereby a man must judge of his own spirituall Estate. And so he that professeth his sincere Repentance for his sinnes past, and promiseth newnesse of life for the time to come, if there be nothing which (visibly and to the eye of man) giveth the lye to his profession and promise, (for instance, if it can be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that immediately before or immediately after he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed or promised the contrary to his companions in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse, or that he still continueth in the practise of that sinne) is not to be excluded as an impenitent sinner from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The third <hi>Quaere,</hi> as also the conclusion of all, runneth upon a great mistake, by reason of the confounding of things which are of a different nature. There is great weigh-laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, that there is as much sin &amp; danger to a mans soule in his unworthy and unprofitable hearing of the word, as in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving of the Sacrament; and therefore Ministers may as well refuse to Preach unto people, whom they deeme unprofitable hearers, as refuse to give them the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they judge them unmeet to receive it. Whether the sinne of unworthy hearing be as great as the sinne of unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament, I will not now debate. The <note n="d" place="margin">

But that which I intend in this place, is (for clearing a maine Principle which we goe upon) to distinguish these two things. There are some Ordinances appointed for the <hi>Conversion of Sinners.</hi> There are other Ordinances appointed for the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> The Preaching of the word and the hearing thereof, though it hath no small influence into the Communion of Saints, yet it is also appointed for converting and bringing in Sinners who have no part in the Communion of Saints. The Sacrament was not appointed for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sinners, but is peculiar to the Communion of Saints. The Apostles Preached to the unbeleiving Jewes in the Temple and Synagogues <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 11. 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 12. 42. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 20. 22. 23.

They that are suspended from the Sacrament, yea they that are excommunicate, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the hearing of the word for their conversion, as the unbeleeving Jewes and Heathens were.

But if he be known to be a Dogg or a Swine in reference to the Sacrament, that will make it a sin to me if I minister the Sacrament to him. The reason is because I am still bound to endevour his conversion (not knowing that he hath blasphemed against the holy Ghost) but I am not bound to give him the seale of remission of sinnes and salvation by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: yea it were sinne to give that Seal to him who is visibly and apparently uncapable of such sweet and comfortable application of Christ. I conclude that the suspending of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous persons from the Sacrament, is neither onely nor prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally grounded upon the sinne and guilt of eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily, which will cleave to the unworthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant: but rather (not excluding the other) upon the nature of the Ordinance which is such as cannot admit of the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously scandalous to receive, but that holy Ordinance shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be prophaned and made Common; for what can be more contrary to the na ure of that Ordinance and to the Institution of Jesus Christ, than to turne the communion of Saints, into the communion of scandalous sinners; and to make that which was instituted for the comfort of those that repent and beleeve, to be a comfort and Seal of Salvation to those who are known by their fruits to have neither Repentance nor Faith, and so to send them away with a good conceit of their spirituall Estate, and thereby to strengthen their hearts and hands in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Question is not whether all scandalous persons are to
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:95406:203"/>
be excommunicated and wholly cast out off the Church. The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies Petition was not concerning excommunicating, but concerning suspending from the Sacrament all scandalous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Yet the current of Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> Argumentation both in his Quaeries, and in his <hi>Vindication</hi> thereof, for the most part, runneth along against <hi>Excommunication and Suspension from the Sacrament,</hi> as the Tittles likewise doe promise. Which is a fallacy <hi>d conjunctis ad divisa.</hi> And when he debateth so much concerning <hi>excommunication and suspension,</hi> his <hi>and</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther copulative or exegeticall. If copulative, he opposeth no body that I know so much as himself; for I know none that would have all scandalous sinners suspended, to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated also, except himself. If exegeticall, even so he is contrary to himself, who confesseth that one may be suspended from the Sacrament before he be excommunicated. <hi>vindic. p.</hi> 50. 51. And whereas in the latter part of his first Quaere, he would drive us to this hard choice, that either a scandalous person must be excommunicated, or not suspended from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; He saith it is evident by <hi>Tertullians</hi> Apology <hi>cap.</hi> 39. <hi>&amp; lib. de poenit.</hi> that scandalous persons were ever excommunicate and wholly cast out of the Church, not barely sequestred from the Sacrament. Whence saith he all the Canonists and Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men determine that an excommunicate person is excluded from the Church and all publike Ordinances. Let the prudent reader observe, that in stead of proving that scandalous persons were wholly cast out of the Church, he tells us out of the Canonists and Schoolemen, that excommunicate persons were wholly cast out of the Church, that is, that those who were cast out of the Church, were cast out of the Church. And for his antiquity, he hath given here no small wound to the Reputation of his skill in Antiquities. Which will more fully appear <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. Meane while, how can any that hath read <hi>Tertullian</hi> or <hi>Cyprian,</hi> not know, that some failings and falls in time of persecution, and other smaller offences, were not punished by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but by suspension from the Sacrament, till after pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Declaration of Repentance and confession of the offence, the offender was admitted to the Sacrament. And for the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:95406:204"/>
places he citeth, I find in <hi>Tertullians</hi> Book <hi>de poenitentia</hi> much of that <hi>Exomologesis</hi> and publike Declaration of Repentance, but that all scandalous persons brought under Church-censures were wholly cast out of the Church, I find not; In the 39 <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Apologetick there is no such thing as is alledged, but the contrary plainly intimated, <note n="e" place="margin">Ibidem etiam exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationes, &amp; censura divina.

And as in the Antient Churches there were, and in the reformed Churches there now are different degrees of censures, according to the different degrees of offences: so in the Jewish Church the like may be observed, both concerning Ceremoniall uncleannesse, and morall offences.

               <p>Tenthly, the true state of the present Question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Parliament should establish the power of suspending scandalous persons from the Sacrament, as <hi>Iure divino,</hi> (nay, let Divines assert that, and satisfie peoples consciences in it: but let the Parliament speak in an authoritative and legislative way, in adding their civill sanction.) Nor, whether there ought to be any suspension from the Sacrament of scandalous persons, not yet excommunicated and cast out of the Church; and that the Elder-ship should doe it; for the Ordinance of Parliament hath so farre satisfied the desires of the Reverend As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly and of the generality of godly people, that there is to be a suspension of scandalous persons (not excommunicated) from the Sacrament, and power is granted to the Eldership to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend from the Sacrament for such scandals as are enumerate in the Ordinances of <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. 1645. and <hi>March.</hi> 14. 1645. Which Ordinances doe appoint that <hi>All Persons Or any Person</hi> that shall commit such or such an offence, shall be by the Eldership suspended from the Sacrament, upon confession of the party, or upon the Testimony of two credible witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. So that in truth the stream of Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> exceptions runneth against that which is agreed and resolved upon in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: and his arguments (if they prove any thing) must necessarily conclude against that power already granted by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to Elder-ships. And now if he will speak to that point which is in present publike agitation, he must lay aside his Querees and his <hi>Vindication</hi> thereof, and write another Book to prove that the Assembly and other godly ministers and people ought to rest satisfied (in point of conscience) with the power granted to Elderships to suspend from the Sacrament in the enumerate cases, and that there is not the like reason to
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:95406:205"/>
keep off scandalous persons from the Sacrament for other scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls beside these enumerate in the Ordinance of Parliament. Nay, and he must confine himself within a nearower circle, then so; for the Parliament hath been pleased to think of some course for new emergent cases, that the door may not be shut for the future upon the Remonstrances of Elderships concerning cases not expressed. I know the Gentleman is free to choose his own Theme to treat of, and he may handle what cases of Conscience he shall think fit for the Churches edification. But since he professeth in the Conclusion of his foure Questions and in the Preface before his <hi>Vindication,</hi> and in divers other passages, that his scope is to expedite a regular settlement of Church Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, without such a power of suspending the scandalous, as is now desired to be setled in the new Elderships, and manifestly reflecteth upon one of the Assemblies Petitions concerning that businesse, as hath been said; yea the first words of his Queres tell us, he spoke to the point in present publike agitation, the case standing thus; I must put him in mind (under favour) that he hath not been a little out of the way, nor a little wide from the mark.</p>
               <p>And if the Question were which of these Tenents (Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> or ours,) concerning Suspension, doth best agree with the mind of the Parliament, let us heare their own Ordinance dated <hi>March</hi> 14. 1645. the words are these: <hi>yet were the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls and substantiall parts of that Government long since setled in persons by and over whom it was to be exercised, and the nature, extent, and respective subordination of their power was limitted and defined; onely concerning the administration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, how all such persons as were guilty of notorious and scandalous Offences might be suspended from it, some difficulty arising, not so much in the Matter it self, as in the Manner, how it should be done, and who should be the Judges of the Offence: The Lords and Commons having it alwayes in their purpose and Intention, and it being accordingly declared and Resolved by them That all sorts of notorious scandalous Offenders should be suspended from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> Which is the very point so much opposed by Master <hi>Prynne;</hi> for the controversie moved by him is not so much
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:95406:205"/>
concerning the manner, or who should be the Judges, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter it selfe: he contending that all sorts of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious scandalous offenders should not be suspended from the Sacrament, but onely such as are excommunicated and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the hearing of the Word, Prayer, and all other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Having now removed so many mistakes of the true state of the question: that which is in controversie is plainly this; Whether according to the word of God there ought to be in the Elderships of Churches a spirituall power and authority, by which they that are called brethren, that is, Church members, or Officers, for the publique scandall of a prophane life, or of pernicious doctrine, or for a private offence obstinately continued in after admonitions, and so growing to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique scandall, are upon proofe of such scandall to be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Lords Table untill signes of repentance appeare in them; and if they continue contumacious, are in the name of Jesus Christ to be excommunicate and cut off from all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership and communion with the Church, and their sinnes pronounced to be bound on earth, and by consequence in Heaven, untill by true and sincere repentance they turne to God, and by the declaration of such repentance be reconciled unto the Church. The affirmative is the received doctrine of the reformed Churches, whereunto I adhere. The first part of it concerning Suspension, is utterly denyed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne,</hi> which breaketh the concatenation and order of Church discipline held forth in the question now stated. Whether he denieth also Excommunication by Elderships to be an Ordinance and Institution of Christ, and onely holdeth it to be lawfull and warrantable by the word of God, I am not certaine. If he do, then he holds the totall negative of this present question. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am sure he hath gone about to take away some of the principall Scripturall foundations and pillars upon which Excommunication is builded. <note n="*" place="margin">Yea now also it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by his <hi>Diotrephes cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised</hi> that he denieth and opposeth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it selfe, at least under a Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</note> As touching the gradation and order in the question as now stated, it is meant <hi>positively</hi> and <hi>exclusively,</hi> that such a gradation not onely may but ought to be observed ordinarily (which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>THe second point of difference is concerning <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> in the first of his foure questions told us that the words <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Let him be to thee as an Heathen man and a Publican,</hi> are meant onely of personall private tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes between man and man, not publique scandalous sinnes against the Congregation: and that tis not said, <hi>Let him be to the whole Church, but let him be to Thee, &amp;c.</hi> This I did in my Sermon retort. For if <hi>to thee,</hi> for a personall private trespasse; much more <hi>to the whole Church,</hi> for a publique scandalous sinne, whereby he trespasseth against the whole Congregation. Yea, it followeth upon his interpretation, that he may account the whole Church as Heathens and Publicans, if all the members of the Church doe him a personall injury, whereupon I left this to be considered by every man of understanding, whether if a private man may account the whole Church as Heathens and Publicans for a personall injury done to himselfe alone, it will not follow that much more the whole Church may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a man as a Heathen and Publican, for a publique scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sinne against the whole Church. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> in his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> pag. 3. glanceth at this objection, but he takes notice onely of the halfe of it, and he is so farre from turning off my retortion, that he confirmeth it; for pag. 4. he confesseth that every Christian hath free power by Gods word to esteeme not onely a particular brother, but all the members of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as Heathens and Publicans, if he or they continue impenitent in the case of private injuries, after admonition.
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:95406:206"/>
Now my exception against his <hi>Quere</hi> remains unanswered. If I may esteem the whole Church as Heathens and Publicans, when they doe me an injury and continue impenitent therein: may not the whole Church esteem me as an Heathen man and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, when I commit a publique and scandalous trespasse against the whole Church, and continues impenitent therein? Shall a private man have power to cast off the whole Church as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Publicans? and shall not the whole Church have power to cast off one man as an Heathen and Publican? I know he understands those words, <hi>Let him be to thee as a Heathen man and a Publican,</hi> in another sence then either the reformed Churches doe, or the ancient Churches did, and takes the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be of avoyding fellowship and familiarity with him, before any sentence of Excommunication passed against the offender. But however my argument from proportion will hold. If civill fellowship must be refused, because of obstinacy in a civill injury, why shall not spirituall or Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be refused to him that hath committed a spirituall injury or trespasse against the Church? If private fellowship ought to be denied unto him that will not repent of a private injury, why shall not publique fellowship in eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the Church at the Lords Table be denied unto him that will not repent of a publique scandall given to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? Are the rules of Church fellowship looser and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than the rules of civill fellowship? or are they straiter? Is the way of communion of Saints broader than the way of civill communion? or is it narrower? Peradventure he will say, that the whole Church, that is, all the members of the Church, have power to withdraw from an obstinate scandalous brother, that is, to have no fraternall converse or private Christian fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with him. Well then: If thus farre he be as a Heathen and a Publican to the whole Church distributively, how shall he be as a Christian brother to the whole Church collectively; If all the members of the Church severally withdraw fellowship from him even before he be excommunicated, how shall the whole Church together be bound to keepe fellowship with him till he be excommunicated? Instead of loosing such knots, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> undertakes to prove another thing, that this Text
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:95406:207"/>
of <hi>Matthew</hi> is not meane of Excommunication or Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and that the Church in this Text was not any Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Consistory (here he citeth <hi>Iosephus,</hi> as if he had spoken of that Text) but onely the Sanhedrin or Court of civill Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. But though all this were true which he saith, yet there may be a good argument drawn by necessary consequence from this Text to prove Excommunication. Which <hi>Grotius</hi> did well perceive: for in his annotations upon the place, after he hath told his opinion that excommunication is not meant in this Text, he addeth, that he hath elsewhere spoken of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and necessity of Excommunication: <hi>quanquam ad eam ex hoc etiam loco non absurde argumentum duci p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>sse, non negaverim: though I will not deny,</hi> saith he, <hi>that even from this place, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be drawn to excommunication without any absurdity.</hi> My argument afore-mentioned will hold good even from Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> owne exposition. Thus farre I have gone upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session: now to the confutation. Before I come to his reasons, I observe in his margent a double mistake of the testimony of <hi>Scapula.</hi> First, he sends us to <hi>Scapula</hi> to learn that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth any civill assembly or councell, as well as an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Presbytery. Yes: <hi>Scapula</hi> tels us, it hath in Heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a generall signification, to expresse any Assembly called forth. But he addeth immediately, that in the writing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians it signifieth the assembly of such as are called to eternall life and doe professe Christian Religion. Since therefore it hath not the same signification in Heathen writings, and in the New Testament, he should have shewed us where the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the new Testament doth signifie a civill Court of Justice. I hope the holy Ghost did speake so in this place as he might be understood, and to take the word <hi>Church</hi> here, in that sence which it hath nowhere else in the new Testament, doth not agree with that received maxime, That Scripture is to be expounded by Scripture. I finde indeed the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> used for a Civill assembly, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 39, 41. But as that is an Heathen assembly, so it is not the Evangelist <hi>Luke</hi> his expression other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then <hi>recitative:</hi> that is, he mentioneth an Heathen assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly under that name by which Heathens themselves called it. His other mistake of <hi>Scapula,</hi> is, the citing of him for that asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:95406:207"/>
that the Church in this Text is not an Ecclesiasticall Con sistory. Whereas <hi>Scapula</hi> doth expound the Church <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. to be meant of the Presbytery or Colledge of Elders, (as <note n="g" place="margin">

Now I proceed to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> Reasons. First, saith he, this Text <hi>speakes not at all of any publique scandalous sinne against the Church or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the proper object of Church censures, but onely of private civill trespasses between man and man, as is evident by the words, If thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault between him and thee, &amp;c. Answ.</hi> We have ever understood that place of such trespasses, which grow publique afterwards by the offenders obstinacy after admonition. Yet the trespasse here meant, may be often such as even at first is scandalous to more then one. Such a case falleth under Christs rule here, and is not excluded. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in observe <hi>Durand</hi> upon the fourth Book of the Master of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences <hi>Dist.</hi> 19. <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. <hi>But if,</hi> saith he, <hi>the sinne be not altogether secret, nor altogether knowne, that is, such as is known to many by whom he may be convict, or be is ill reported of among grave persons, though the publique fame be not against him, so the procedor which Christ hath set us in the Gospell, seemeth to have place, to wit, that first he may be secretly admonished, concerning his amendment; which if it profit not, that he may be admonished concerning his amendment before those who know the fact; but if that also doe not profit, that then he may be declared to the Church.</hi> But if we should grant that no other trespasse is meant here, but a private tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, yet I aske, is there no private trespasse but that which is civill? The Schoolmen writing <hi>de scandalo</hi> will tell him that one brother trespasseth against another when he scandalizeth him by any sinfull example, though without any civill injury. Nay its the greatest trespasse which is committed against the soule of our neighbour: scandall is soule murther. It is a breach of the Law of love, not onely by omission, but by commission. He that is commanded to edifie his brother, and then giveth scandall to him, doth he not trespasse against his brother? The like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:95406:208"/>
I return to that which he addeth, that <hi>Luke relating</hi> the same thing <hi>without any Dic Ecclesiae, Luk.</hi> 17. 3, 4 <hi>puts it out of question, if compared with Gen.</hi> 52. 31. (there is no such Scripture) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 28. What? out of question. Doth he not find scandalous sins in the two verses immediately preceding in <hi>Luke,</hi> and thereupon its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly added, <hi>Take heed to your selves, if thy brother trespasse against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him.</hi> Can not a Christian rebuke his brother who scandalizeth him, and if he repent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him? <hi>Luke</hi> needed not adde <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> because he speaks of a repenting brother, not of an impenitent brother, after private admonition. And that scandalous trespasses are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19. (as <hi>Augustine, Tostatus,</hi> and many others have observed) may thus appeare. 1. Scandals are the greatest and worst trespasses, as hath been said, and <hi>woe unto the world because of offences.</hi> Surely Jesus Christ did intend to provide a remedy against the greatest evils, rather than against the lesser. 2. Christ would not be Judge of civill injuries, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 14. How can it be then supposed that he giveth here Lawes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning civill rather then spirituall injuries? 3. Christ saith, <hi>If be shall heare</hi> (not repaire) <hi>thee, thou hast gained</hi> (not thy goods or thy good name, or the like, but) <hi>thy brother.</hi> Intimating, that its not a mans owne interest, but the rescuing of his brothers soule from sinne and scandall, which is here sought. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> himselfe confirmeth it not a little, for he takes the meaning to be of avoyding a brothers company, in the case of a civill or private injury, if he <hi>continue impenitent after admonition.</hi> Now what if he that hath done the injury make full reparation, and all reall satisfaction to the brother injured, and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue impenient shewing no symptome at all of repentance, must he not by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> exposition be esteemed as an heathen man and a Publican, because of his visible and scandalous impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency? How often hath it been seen that a man was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Law, or perswaded by friends to make a reall restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and full satisfaction for a civill or personall injury; and yet hath given very great scandall by his impenitency, not so much as confessing, but still defending and justifying his sinfull act, in his discourses? 4. The dependency upon the preceding parts of that Chapter confirmeth it: from the beginning of
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:95406:208"/>
the Chapter to this very Text, vers. 15. Christ hath been upon the doctrine of scandals, warning us not to offend so much as one of his little ones, which he presseth by divers arguments. 5. The Erastians and we doe both agree in this, that Christ here hath a respect to the Jewish Government. Now the trespasses for which men were excommunicate by the Jewish Sanhedrin were scandalous trespasses, such as the despising of any of the precepts of the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or Statutes of the Scribes: The doing of servile worke upon Easter Eve: The mentioning of the Name of God rashly, or by a vaine oath: The inducing of others to prophane the Name of God, or to eate holy things without the holy place; and the like; More of this elsewhere, in the 24 causes of the Jewish Excommunication. 6. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> expoundeth this Text in <hi>Matthew</hi> by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11, 12. but there the Apostle intends the purging of the Church from scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, whether those scandals have any private injury in them or not. Instance in Idolatry and drunkennesse, there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. 7. I can also (without yeelding the least advantage to the Erastian cause) admit and suppose that which is so much pressed both by <hi>Erastus,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne,</hi> and others, <hi>viz.</hi> that these words, <hi>If thy brother trespasse against thee,</hi> are spoken of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall injury between man and man, Though I doe not grant the thing, yet I am content, even upon their own supposition, to argue from this Text. And first, it may be answered with <hi>Aegi dius de Coninck. de actib. supernat. Disp.</hi> 28. <hi>Dub.</hi> 8. that Christ doth not speake of the case of personall injuries, as if he meant to restrict unto such cases the order of proceeding for gaining of the offenders soule from sinne; <note n="h" place="margin">Sed solùm exempli causa attulit tale ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>but onely for examples sake he brought such kind of sinne, of which it might have been most doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether in the reproofe thereof this order be to be kept, and in which it can be most hardly observed, in respect of the innate desire of revenge in many.</hi> 2. Let our opposites themselves say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought not in conscience and duty, endeavour the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an offending brothers soule, when we see him commit a trespasse against God, which is no personall injury to our selves, as well as when the trespasse is a personall injury. 3. As this order of proceeding here prescribed by Christ, is (in the case of a personall injury) the greatest triall of Christian love
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:95406:209"/>
in the person offended, so it may (by Gods blessing) be the stronger and more efficacious upon the person offending, to conquer and overcome his spirit, while he that might prosecute him in a legall and criminall way, commeth in meeknesse and love to admonish him, and to endeavour the gaining of him from sin by repentance. Which is the observation of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> upon the place, <hi>for if he that might demand punishment upon him, even that man be seen to be taking care of his salvation, this most of all other things is able to make him ashamed, and to yeeld.</hi> 4. If it be a civill and personall injury matterially, yet it comes not in here under that formall consideration, but partly as a scandall to him that hath received the injury (so that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doth rightly make this Text to hang together with that which was said before in the same Chapter concerning scandals) partly as a soul-destroying sinne upon him that doth the wrong, which doth endanger his salvation: And if under such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion private injuries be here spoken of, then what have our opposites gained? 5. The scope also is not civill but wholly spirituall; which <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doth very well explaine. <hi>Hom.</hi> 60. <hi>in Matth. What is it,</hi> if he shall heare thee? <hi>if he shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to condemne himselfe of sinne.</hi> Thou hast gained thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>he saith not thou bast a sufficient punishment or satisfaction, but thou hast gained thy brother.</hi> And after, <hi>He saith not accuse, nor censure, nor demand punishments, but convince, saith he.</hi> The Context confirmeth it; for these words are added immediately after the parable of bringing home the lost sheep. Which pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable we have also <hi>Luke</hi> 15. (where it is not applied to the reducing of such as have done private injuries, but of Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and sinners who were publiquely scandalous: this I thought good to note by the way) <hi>Ammonius Alexandrinus de Quatuor Evang. consonantia, cap.</hi> 96, 97. doth together with the parable of the lost sheep, adde also the other two, of the lost penny, and the lost sonne, immediately before these words, <hi>If thy brother trespasse against thee &amp;c.</hi> 6. And suppose that the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath its rise and beginning from a personall injury, verse 15. yet the trespasse for which the man is to be held as a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Publican, is a publique scandalous sinne against the Church or Congregation, namely his neglecting to heare the
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:95406:209"/>
Church <hi>vers.</hi> 17. for it is not his first trespasse, but his contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against the Church, which by this Text is to make him esteemed as an Heathen and a Publican.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this point, I will answer the chief Argument by which <hi>Eràstus</hi> would prove that this Text is meant only of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate civill injuries: because (saith he) the trespasse here spoken of is no other then what one brother may forgive to another. I answer, both he and Master <hi>Prynne</hi> doe suppose this Text <hi>Mat.</hi> 15, 16, 17. to be parallell to that in <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 3. 4. which they take for granted, without proof or reason. Certainly there is a great difference between the purpose and scope of the one place and of the other. It will be replyed that even in this very Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. the next thing which follows <hi>vers.</hi> 21. is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning personall injuries which one brother can and ought to forgive to another. <hi>Then came</hi> Peter <hi>to him and said, Lord how oft shall my Brother sinne against me, and I forgive him? &amp;c.</hi> To that I answer. 1. We cannot gather from the Text that <hi>Peter</hi> did propound this question immediately after or upon occasion of that which went before <hi>vers.</hi> 15, 16, 17, &amp;c. where nothing is spoken of one Brothers forgiving another. We read <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 19. <hi>Then came to him his Mother and his Brethren, &amp;c.</hi> yet the meaning is not that his Mother and his Brethren came to him immediately after his speaking of the words before mentioned by <hi>Luke</hi> in that place; for that it was not after these, but after other words, is plain from the Harmony of the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark.</hi> So here these words <hi>Then came Peter,</hi> may very well relate to a new businesse and to another time. 2. Or if it was the same time, it might be said, <hi>Then came Peter,</hi> that is, <hi>Peter</hi> being absent, and not having heard that which Christ had been before speaking, he came immediatly after, &amp; did propound a new Question. 3. Suppose also that <hi>Peter</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and heard all which had been before spoken, yet it is much doubted among Interpreters, whence <hi>Peter</hi> had the rise and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that Question. Some think it was upon his calling to minde those words in the rule of Prayer, <hi>even as we forgive those who trespasse against us.</hi> Others conceive the occasion of his Question was that which was said <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>Againe I say unto you if two of you shall agree on earth,</hi> supposing that agreement (and
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:95406:210"/>
consequently forgiving of injuries) is necessary to make our Prayers the more effectuall; for my part, I think it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that whatever the occasion of the Question was, <hi>vers.</hi> 21 beginneth a new and distinct purpose. Which I take to be the reason why the Arabik here makes an intercision, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the eight and fiftieth Section of <hi>Matthew</hi> at those words, <hi>Then came</hi> Peter <hi>and said, Lord how oft, &amp;c.</hi> 4. And if <hi>vers.</hi> 21. have a dependence upon that which went before, it may be conceived thus: Christ had said, <hi>If thy Brother trespasse against thee, goe &amp; tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone,</hi> which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth a continuance of the former Christian fellowship and fraternall familiarity, and that we must not cast off a scandalous Brother as lost, or as an Enemy, but admonish him as a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This might give occasion to <hi>Peter</hi> to aske, <hi>Lord how oft shall my Brother sinne against me,</hi> that is, scandalize me by his sinne against God, (for even in <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 3. 4. that of forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one that trespasseth against us, is added immediately after a Doctrine of scandals;) <hi>and I forgive him,</hi> that is, as <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds it, restore him to the former degree of friendship and intimate familiarity, to deale with him thus as with a Brother; Which he well distinguisheth from that other forgiving which is a not revenging. And so much of Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> first reason.</p>
               <p>His second reason is because the Mention of two or three witnesses <hi>vers.</hi> 16. relateth <hi>onely to the manner of trying civill capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall crimes (as murders and the like) before the civill Magistrates of the Jewes, &amp;c. not to any proceedings in Ecclesiasticall causes, in their Ecclesiasticall Consistories, of which we find no president.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If this hold, then the Text must not be expounded indefinitely of civill injuries (as he did before) but of civill ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall injuries, whereas <hi>Erastus</hi> takes the meaning to be of smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler offences onely, and not of Capitall crimes. 2. The Law concerning two or three witnesses is neither restricted to Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall crimes, nor to civill Judicatories. I appeale to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament dated <hi>Octo.</hi> 20. 1645. <hi>The Elder-ship of every Congregation shall judge the matter of scandall aforesaid, being not Capitall, upon the Testmiony of two credible Witnesses, at the least.</hi> That Law therefore of witnesses is alike applicable to all causes
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:95406:210"/>
and Courts Ecclesiasticall and civill <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 30. <hi>One witnesse shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sinne, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established.</hi> 3. And the same Law is in the new Testament clearly applied to proceedings in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall causes 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. &amp; again 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Against the Elder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses,</hi> which is not spoken to any civill Magistrate, but to <hi>Timothy</hi> and others joyned with him in Church Government.</p>
               <p>His third reason doth onely begge what is in Question, that by the Church is not meant any Ecclesiasticall but a civill Court of the Jewes. He needed not to cite so many places to prove that the Jewes had civill Courts. If he could but cite one place, to prove that they had no Ecclesiasticall Courts, this were to the purpose. Not that I grant that at this time the Jewes had any civill Jurisdiction or Jewish Court of Justice; for after that <hi>Herod</hi> the great did kill <hi>Hircanus</hi> and the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin,</hi> (in the opinion of many learned men) the Jewes had no more any civill Jurisdiction. Now <hi>Herod</hi> the great was dead before the time of Christs Ministery. Others think they had some civill Jurisdiction a while after <hi>Hircanus</hi> death. How ever he cannot prove, that at this time when Christ said <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> the Jewes had any civill Court of Justice, which did exercise either Criminall or Capitall Judgements. I have in the first Book shewed out of <hi>Buxtorf, L'Empereur, Casauhon,</hi> and <hi>I. Coch.</hi> (who prove what they say from the Talmudicall writers) that 40 yeeres before the destruction of the Temple (and so before Christ said <hi>Tell the Church</hi>) the Court of civill Justice at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> did cease. If Master <hi>Prynne</hi> make any thing of this Glosse of his, he must prove 1. That there was no Ecclesiasticall Court among the Jewes. (I have before proved that that Councell of the Jewes in Christs time was an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Court, though he conceives it was meerely civill) 2. That a private civill injury might not then, nor may not now, be brought before a civill Court, except after severall previous admonitions despised. 3. That Chists Rule, <hi>Tell the Church</hi> was antiquated and ceased, when a civill Court of Justice among the Jewes ceased. If he say that the same rule continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:95406:211"/>
for telling the civill Magistrate in case the offender prove obstinate after admonition, then I aske. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. how will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himself? for <hi>pag.</hi> 4. he saith the Church in this Text is <hi>onely the Sanhedrin or Court of civill Justice among the Jewes.</hi> 2. If this Text <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. was applicable to the primitive Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and when there was no Jewish <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to goe to, then the Pagan Magistracy must passe under the name of the Church, for they had no other civill Court of Justice to goe to.</p>
               <p>One thing I must needs take notice of, that whereas he would prove here that <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> is nothing, but, tell the civill Court of Justice among the Jewes, commonly called the Councell saith he, or <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> he doth hereby overthrow all that he hath been building for the Jewish <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> at that time, had not power to judge civill, nor criminall, and least of all Capitall offences, but onely causes Ecclesiasticall: The <hi>Romans</hi> having taken from them their civill Government, and left them no Government nor Jurisdiction except in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>His fourth reason is, that those words, <hi>let him be to thee as an Heathen man and a Publican,</hi> cannot signifie excommunication, <hi>because Heathen men being never members of the Church, could never be excommunicated or cast out of it, being uncapable of such a censure. As for publicans, those of them who were members of the Jewish Church, though they were execrable to the Jewes, by reason of their Tax-gatherings and oppressions, yet we never read in Scripture, that they were excommunicated or cast out of their Synagogues, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that they went up into the Temple to pray, as well as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, and were more acceptable to Christ himself, &amp;c.</hi> So likewise <hi>Sutlivius</hi> (against <hi>Beza) de pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Master <hi>Prynne</hi> p. 4. expounds these words, <hi>let him be unto thee as an Heathen man and a publican,</hi> to be meant of avoiding familiar fellowship with the Brother that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:95406:211"/>
a civill trespasse, and keeping no more civill company with him. Now I argue thus <hi>ad hominem.</hi> This cannot be the meaning which he gives, because Heathens being never admitted into familiar fellowship and company with the Jewes (who might not marry nor familiarly converse with them, as himself proveth <hi>pag.</hi> 4.) could never be cast out of their fellowship and company, being uncapable of any such thing. If our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of excommunication must drive us to acknowledge that Heathens were formerly members of the Jewish Church, his exposition of avoiding familiar fellowship, must drive him to acknowledge that formerly the Heathens were admitted into familiar fellowship with the Jewes.</p>

                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:95406:212"/>
and avoiding of fellowship with him being in the most emphaticall manner further expressed by his being as a publicans both these put together do the more fully hold forth excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. And in this sence some resolve the words.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet let us see how Master <hi>Prynne</hi> proves that the Publicans were admitted into the Temple or Synagogues. He tells us that Christ received them or conversed with them, as if the meaning had been to compare an impenitent Brother with peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent publicans, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 13. who drew neer to Christ to heare him <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 2. who left all and followed Christ to be among his disciples <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 27, 28. <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 15. who justified God <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 29. who knew themselves to be sick of soule-diseases Matth. 9. 12, 13. These very places cited by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self make against him. However the Question is how Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans were esteemed of in the Jewish Church (for that is the thing pointed at in those words, <hi>let him be unto thee as a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>) for that, he objecteth that Publicans went up into the Temple to pray. If he meane that Publicans who were neither devout Jewes nor Proselytes, went up into the Temple to pray, had accesse to and fellowship in the Sacrifices and Temple wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as well as the Jewes themselves, its more than he can prove. If he mean that publicans who were Jewes or Proselytes, went up into the Temple to pray, it helpeth him not, except he can prove that when Christ saith, <hi>let him be unto thee as an Heathen man and a publican,</hi> the meaning is of such a publican as was a devout Jew or proselyte. And if so, then he had to prove that the Jewes did not keep civill company or fellowship, so much as with the religious publicans with whom they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Temple to pray and worship. This also he hath to prove, not that religious publicans (of whom Christ means not) but that impious infamous Publicans came to the Temple.</p>
               <p>6. That passage <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 10. concerning the Publicans goe ing up to the Temple to pray; first, it is expressely declared to be a parable Vers. 9. and therefore can not prove the reality of the thing according to the letter, no more than an audible conference between <hi>Abraham</hi> and the rich man in Hell can be proved from <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 24. to the end of the Chapter, (though I believe that be a History related parabolically, as <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

proveth in his <hi>Theses:</hi>) farre lesse can a parable properly so called prove an historicall narration. The meaning may be no other but this, that if such a Publican and such a Pharisee should goe up to the Temple to pray, then the one should depart justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the other not.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I can also grant without any prejudice to the businesse of Excommunication that the Publican, yea an execrable Publican did goe up to the Temple to pray. For an excommunicate person among the Jewes (as many thinke) so long as there was hope of his repentance, had leave to come into the utter Court of the Temple, yet so that they came in at the gate of the mourners, and excommunicate persons were known by all that saw them, to be excommunicate persons.

all this which hath been said in answer to his fourth reason it appeareth that <hi>let him be to thee as an Heathen and a Publican,</hi> is more than he would make it, keepe not any familar company, or have no civill fellowship with him.

                  <hi>Erastus,</hi> who argueth thus: One brother should forgive another seventy times in a day, if the offending brother doe so oft turn againe and crave pardon: Therefore so should the Church doe to a sinner that craveth pardon, even as often as he doth crave pardon. For (saith he) there can be no just reason given wherefore the whole Church ought not to doe herein, what Church members ought to doe severally. If this be a good argument when Christ saith, <hi>If thy brother repent, forgive him, Luke</hi> 17. 334. (by which place M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

And all the <hi>odium</hi> cast upon Excommunication (as contrary to the spirituall priviledges of Christians) will fall more heavy upon his owne way, which brings any man (be he Prince, Parliament-man, Pastor, or whoever he be) under so much slavery to the lust of any private person, that he may be by that person (and by ten thousand persons more, in case of so many civill injuries, not amended after complaint to the Magistrate) esteemed, avoyded, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, as an Heathen man and a Publican. So that in the issue it may fall out, that any man how eminent or deserving soever he be in Church or State, may be looked upon as a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and a Publican by ten thousand of the people, before ever he be so judged by any Judicature. For instance, put case

that a Minister be judicially convict to have wronged his pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners in the matter of small tythes, and they conceive him to persevere in the same injury, must or may each of them flee from him as from an Heathen and a Publican? Put case a whole company thinke themselves wronged in pay or otherwise by their Captaine, or a whole Regiment by their Colonell, and after complaint made finde themselves not repaired, are they therefore free to avoyd all civill company with the Captaine or Colonell, and to flee from them as from Heathens and Publicans?

And vers. 12.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let him be to thee as an Heathen;</hi> if it be meant of keeping no civil company, he must shew us that the Jews of old were and Christians under the new Testament are forbidden to keepe civill company with Heathens and those that are without the Church. He goeth about to prove that the phrase is taken from the practice of the Jewes in that age, pag. 4. But how doth he prove it? He citeth some places to prove that the <hi>Israelites</hi> might not marry with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but he doth not prove that they might not keep civill company with any of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. There was no such favour nor fellowship permitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Israelites</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> as between the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> and other Gentiles who came among them from other Lands, as <hi>Tostatus</hi> noteth <hi>in Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>quaest.</hi> 43. The reason was because God had destinat the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to utter destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the whole Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> should be given to the children of <hi>Israel.</hi> Onely some few by speciall dispensation were spared as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> because <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Princes had sworne unto them, and <hi>Rahab</hi> with her kindred because she saved the spies.

to have so much favour as an offer of peace, which if any of their Cities had accepted, that City was not to be cut off, but the people thereof were to be tributaries, and to serve <hi>Israel,</hi> and so permitted to live among them.</p>
               <p>The last of his citations maketh very much against him, namely, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 28, 29. where the Jewes of <hi>Asia</hi> doe accuse <hi>Paul</hi> for bringing Greekes into the Temple. <hi>For they had seen before with him in the City Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the Temple.</hi> Marke here <hi>Paul</hi> is not challenged for conversing familiarly with a Greeke, but onely for bringing him into the Temple; and without all doubt the malice of his adversaries did catch at every advantage which they could have against him. I cannot but admire how M. <hi>Prynne</hi> could cite this place to prove that the Jewes might not converse nor keepe civill company with the Heathens, since it proveth the very contrary, that the Jewes might have civill, but no religious fellowship with Heathens. And whereas he addeth that the Jewes had no dealing or conversation with the <hi>Samaritans, Joh.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 52, 53. I answer, the reason was because the Jewish Church had excommnnicated and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized for ever the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who being once circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised and having received the booke of the Law, did afterward hinder the building of the house of the Lord. This Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the <hi>Cuthites</hi> or <hi>Samaritans</hi> most solemnly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you may finde in <hi>Pirke R. Ecclesiae, cap.</hi> 38. More of this elsewhere. Here I onely touch it, to shew that this also of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> makes against him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is certaine that the Jewes had civill company and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with Heathens. For <hi>Solomons</hi> servants and <hi>Hirams</hi> servants were both together. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 18. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 2. 8. yea, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 2. 17, 18. <hi>Solomon</hi> numbred of strangers or heathens in the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> a hundred fifty and three thousand and six hundred. Could there be so many of them and employed also in the building of the Temple, and yet no civill company kept with them? <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> in the Court of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in the court of <hi>Nebuchadnenar</hi> had civill company with Heathens, but religious company with them they would have none.

and <hi>Iehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. And the Merchants of <hi>Tyre</hi> were permitted to come into <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there to fell all manner of ware unto the children of <hi>Iuda,</hi> onely they were forbidden to doe it upon the Sabbath day, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 16, 20, 21. <hi>L'Empereur de legibus Ebraeorum forensibus pag.</hi> 180, 181. put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it out of controversie, that in Christs time there were many Heathens in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> with whom the Jewes did converse and dwell together; and that Christ found in those places where he preached both Jewes and Gentiles. <hi>Istis locis inter istos commorabantur Gentiles, qui magistrorum placitis se astringi passi non sunt.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Nec enim Israelitas ab alienigenarum urbibus abstinuisse, Iosephus Indicat.</hi> And that long before that time there was a mutuall conversing of Jewes and Gentiles, I gather from 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 34. <hi>Thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus as my father made in Samaria,</hi> meaning for trade and commerce.</p>
               <p>I will here anticipate a great objection which may be made against me, from <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Ye know that it is an unlawfull thing for a man that is a Jew to keepe company or come unto one of another Nation.</hi> This might seem to make more for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

civill respects, that they were forbidden to drinke Wine with the Gentiles. The same I say of their shunning to eate with them, for the Heathens used also a dedicating of their meats to Idols, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27.</p>
               <p>Secondly, observe <hi>Peter</hi> addeth immediately: <hi>but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or uncleane:</hi> meaning, so as not to keepe company with him because of his Gentilisme or uncircumcision, or because of his eating of meats which were uncleane by the ceremoniall Law, as <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus de Dieu</hi> doth rightly give the meaning, understanding, not morall, but onely ceremoniall uncleannesse to be there spoken of; for many men under the Gospell are still to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon and avoyded as morally uncleane. But God had taught <hi>Peter</hi> by abrogating the ceremoniall differences of meats in the vision, that the ceremoniall Law which was the partition wall between Jewes and Gentiles, was now to be taken away: so that the Gentiles should be no longer called <hi>dogs,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 26. neither were the Disciples to be forbidden any longer to goe into the way of the Gentiles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 5. Henc forth no man should be called holy because of his circumcision, no man uncleane because of his uncircumcision.</p>
               <p>This being the meaning, it followeth that the unlawfulnesse of eating and companying with an Heathen mentioned Act. 10. 28. must not be so understood, as if bare civill fellowship had been unlawfull; but it must be understood, first, in reference to the morall Law, that is for avoiding the danger of Idolatry in eating or drinking that which Idolatrous Heathens had sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to Idolls, as hath been just now cleared. Secondly, in reference to the Ceremoniall Law, or of such fellowship as was contrary to the ceremoniall Law, in eating together with Heathens of meats legally unclean, such as were represented to <hi>Peter</hi> in the vision, and he commanded to eate what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly unclean to him. Otherwise when the Gentiles did not eat any thing which the Jewes were forbidden to eat, it was lawfull for the Jewes to eat with the Gentiles saith <hi>Tostatus in</hi> 2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 6. <hi>Quest.</hi> 21. So likewise <hi>Grotius de Jure Belli ac pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis lib.</hi> 2. cap. 15. Sect. 9. where he referreth the Jewes their not eating with the Heathens, to the Law of meats or the <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaris</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:95406:218"/>
                  <hi>victus</hi> which was prescribed to the Jewes. But otherwise the Law did not make it unlawfull for them to eat with any of another Nation: which he thinks is proved by Christs own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample who took a drink of water from the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> being yet most observant of the Law. That the unlawfulnesse of eating with the Heathens was understood in reference to the ceremoniall Law, I prove, from <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 12. 14. <hi>Peter</hi> having before eaten with the Gentiles, to avoid the scandall of some Jewes that came from <hi>Iames,</hi> did withdraw and separate himself from the believing Gentiles: What? to keep no more any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill company with them. I hope no man will imagine that. But the Text expounds it selfe <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>If thou being a Iew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as doe the Iewes, why com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellest thou the Gentiles to live as doe the Iewes?</hi> This was <hi>Peters</hi> fault, that having formerly lived as the Gentiles, that is, eating with them all sorts of meats freely, thinking himself liberate from the Yoke of the ceremoniall Law, afterward he withdrew and separated himself from that manner of fellowship with the Centiles, and bound up himselfe to live as doe the Jewes, and to observe the distinction of meats according to the Law. And in so doing, whiles he avoided the scandall of the Jewes, he gave a greater scandall to the Gentiles in compelling them by the authority of his example to Judaize, and to thinke the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law necessary.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The foresaid place <hi>Act.</hi> 10. is to be understood of such fellowship as was not meerely civill, but religious and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred: as may appear, 1. by the exposition formerly given of these words, <hi>God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</hi> 2. by the invitation of the men that were sent from <hi>Cornelius</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> who did not call him to civill but to sacred fellowship <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>And they said,</hi> Cornelius <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, a just man and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the Nation of the Jewes, was warned from God by an holy Angell, to send for thee into his house and to heare words of thee.</hi> 3. <hi>Peter</hi> calls in the men and lodgeth them; that being a civill fellowship, he doth it freely, <hi>v.</hi> 23. but when he comes to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and those that were assembled with him, to heare words from <hi>Peter,</hi> here was the case of conscience, and here <hi>Peter</hi> beginneth to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:95406:219"/>
                  <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>ye knew how that it is an unlawfull thing, &amp;c.</hi> The Syriak hath it thus, <hi>ye know that it is not lawfull for a man that is a Jew to joyn himself unto a man that is a stranger, who is not a sonne of his generation:</hi> as it were intimating a religious and Church fellowship. 4. That which gave offence to them of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> was, that they heard <hi>Peter</hi> had so gone in to men uncircumcised, that they had also received the word of God from him <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 1. 3. And as soone as they were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in that point, that God had given unto the Gentiles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life <hi>vers.</hi> 18. they held their Peace, and made no further scruple concerning eating with them.</p>
               <p>I hope I have sufficiently answered the strongest objection which can be made against that which I did begin to prove, namely, that the Jewes might and did keep civill company and fellowship with Heathens. Which that I may now further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirme, let it be observed with <hi>Schindlerus in lexic. pentaglo p.</hi> 297. that there were two sorts of Proselytes among the Jewes. Some that were circumcised and received the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> and such a one was even as a Jew, and was called <hi>Proselytus justitiae</hi> or <hi>fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris,</hi> a righteous or a true Proselyte, or a Proselyte of the Covenant. Others, that did onely renounce ldolatry and keep the seven precepts given to the sonnes of <hi>Noah,</hi> not being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised nor keeping the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> were permitted to dwell with the Jewes, and therefore such a one was called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytus portae</hi> or <hi>Proselytus incola,</hi> a Proselyte of the Gate, or a Proselyte indweller, who dwelt within their Gates. See for the same thing <hi>L'Empereur de legibus Ebraeorum forensibus</hi> pag. 72 <hi>Buxtorflexic. Rabbin.</hi> p. 408. 409. <hi>Grotius de Jure belli acpacis lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. <hi>Henr. Vorstius observ. ad chronol. R. Ganz.</hi> pag. 279. <hi>Georgius Genzius in annot. ad Maimon. canon. Ethic.</hi> p. 91. 92. To the same purpose, Master <hi>Ainsworth annot. in Gen.</hi> 9. 4. and on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 45. and on <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 10. hath noted out of the Hebrew writers: that such of the Heathens as did observe the seven precepts given to the Sonnes of <hi>Noah,</hi> though they were not circumcised, neither did observe the Ordinances of the ceremoniall Law, nor were admitted to the holy things of the Children of Israel, yet they were permitted to cohabit and converse with the people of God in the holy Land. And
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:95406:219"/>
that it was so, may be proved from <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 6. 45. 47. (where the Chaldee hath <hi>an uncircumcised</hi> indweller) <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 21. yea, such a one might dwell in the Priests house <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 10. The Jewes receive no Proselyte now except one that undertakes to keep the whole Law to the least jote, as Doctor <hi>Buxtorf</hi> informes us in the place last cited: and so they are a great deale more strict in reference to the Gentiles then the Antient Jewes were. Notwithstanding they doe without scruple familiarly converse and keep company with Gentiles who keep not the last of the seven precepts which bind (as they think) all the Sonnes of <hi>Noah,</hi> namely that concerning the not eating of blood. How much more may we suppose that the Antient Jewes did keep civill company and fellowship with such Gentiles as did observe all these seven precepts? And this comparison the Jewes have made between themselves and the Gentiles in reference to the Law of <hi>Moses. It is our inheritance, not theirs: as for them, let them observe the seven precepts. Exc. Gem. Sanhedrin.</hi> cap. 7. Sect. 6. So that the Jewes were not scandalized at the Gentiles their not observing of the whole Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> not being circumcised, &amp;c. but at their not keeping of those seven precepts, which were also a part of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> This to me appeareth to be a chief reason (if not the reason) why the Synod of the Apostles &amp; El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at <hi>Ierusa.</hi> did impose upon the Churches of the Gentiles no other burthen of Jewish rites &amp; Ceremonies, but to abstain from blood &amp; things strangled: they did not impose circumcision, nor holy dayes, nor the like: because that which was intended was, to draw together the beleevers of the Jewes &amp; the beleevers of the Gentiles into a familiar conversation, that they might live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and eat together without scandall: and this could not be, except the beleiving Gentiles should observe the seven pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which were given not onely to the posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to the posterity of <hi>Noah;</hi> of which precepts one did forbid the eating of blood <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 4. (and under that is comprehended also the eating of things strangled) Now there was no doubt of the beleiving Gentiles their observing of the other six precepts which the Hebrewes say were observed from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah:</hi> the first against Idolatry, 2. against blasphemy, 3. against shedding of blood, 4. against uncleannesse or unlawfull copulations,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:95406:220"/>
5. against Rapine or Robbery, 6. for executing judgement and inflicting punishment upon malefactors. All the question was of the seventh and last against eating of blood, which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving Gentiles (though they knew it to be older then the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law or circumcision it self, and to belong to all the posterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> yet) knew to be temporary and not perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and so at the abrogation of the other ceremonies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Gospell to the Gentiles, thought themselves free from that, as well as other Ceremonies. On the other part, it was a principle among the Jewes, that they ought not to converse familiarly with any of the Gentiles, except such as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the seven precepts given to the Sonnes of <hi>Noah.</hi> Wherefore the Synod of the Apostles and Elders thought good that the beleiving Gentiles should so farre condescend to the weaknesse of the Jewes (not fully instructed concerning Christian liberty, and the abrogation of the old ceremonies) as to observe for a time that precept against eating blood, as well as the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts given to the Sonnes of <hi>Noah;</hi> to the intent that the Jewes and Gentiles might Peaceably and familiarly cohabite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse together: for though the Gentiles did not observe the other ordinances and ceremonies of the Jewes: yet observing those seven precepts, they were free to converse familiarly with the Jewes. <hi>Schindlerus</hi> in his <hi>Lexicon pentagl.</hi> pag. 298. land pag. 1530 seemeth to have had the same notion; for he saith the Apostles and Elders would not impose circumcision and the keeping of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but they imposed some things not unlike to the precepts given to the Sonnes of <hi>Noah.</hi> I returne to that distinction of the two sorts of Proselytes. The one had the name of <hi>Ger tzedek</hi> a Proselyte of righteousnesse, and <hi>Ger berith,</hi> a Proselyte of the Covenant. The other was called <hi>Ger toschav,</hi> a Prosclyte indweller and <hi>Ger schagnar,</hi> a Proselyte of the Gate, <hi>qui intra portas, inter Judaeos scilicet habitabat, who dwelt within the Gates, to wit among the Jewes</hi> saith <hi>Matthias Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius in Lexic. philol.</hi> pag. 2922. This Proselyte indweller was not called nor esteemed as one of the Jewes, being no Church Member, nor admitted to any religious or Church Commnnion with the Jewes, but he was still esteemed and reckoned as one of the uncircumcised Gentiles. Yet the Iewes did keep civill
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:95406:220"/>
company and fellowship with such a one, as with a neighbour and a inhabitant of the same City, or Land.</p>
               <p>And if the Jewes had not been free to keep civill company with Heathens or Infidells, yet Christians are expressely allowed to do so. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27. <hi>If any of them that beleeve not, bid you to a Feast, aud ye be disposed to go, whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake;</hi> and <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. 10. 11. 12. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle permitteth Christians to company and eat with Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Covetous, Extortioners, or Idolaters, who are no Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Members, but by no meanes with scandalous Brethren. I doe not dispute whether any more liberty of this kind is granted to Christians, then peradventure was granted to the Jewes. Yet I am sure a great measure of the liberty of civill fellowship with Heathens was granted to the Jewes also.</p>
               <p>It must needs follow from that which hath been said, that, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen man and a Publican,</hi> is not a casting out from mere civill fellowship and company, but from religious and Church-fellowship. This agreeth well with that passage in <hi>Iosephus contra Appionem lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Whoever</hi> (of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles) <hi>are willing to come and live under our Law, it doth freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them esteeming Communion to consist not onely in origination or descent, but also in choyce of life.

It is also lawfull to sell unto them, that which can not last, as green herbs or anything sodden; and that ever untill their holy day.</hi> You see it was lawfull among the Jewes to buy and sell, borrow and lend, to make contracts, with Heathens, yea with Idolatrous Heathens; onely in some (not in all) things there was a restraint upon them, and that but three daies before the Heathen sestivities.

They held it lawfll for a Jew to send a gift to an Heathen man, or to receive a gift from him, so that it were not upon the Heathenish festivity. 3.

It follows <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. <hi>It is lawfull to goe to the markets or faires of Heathens, and to buy from them beasts, men-servants, maid-servants, though they be yet Heathens: also hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses fields, vineyards.

               <p>If it be objected that <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. doth forbid an Israelite to come to the banquet of a Heathen, which he hath made for his sonne or for his daughter; I answer from that very place. For lest this should be taken for a prohibition of civill fellowship, <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> did adde these words. <hi>Now this intervall is appointed for Idolatry: for it is said, and one call thee, and thou eate of his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and thou take of their daughters unto thy sonnes, and they goe a wboring after their Gods:</hi> citing <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>From all which I conclude, that Christs words, relating to the Jewish custome, <hi>Let him be to thee as a Heathen man,</hi> cannot be meant (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> would have them) of avoyding meere civill company and fellowship; for as much as it was not held unlawfull among the Jewes to have civill company and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with Heathens. Sure the Jewes of our age are farre from holding such a thing unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Yea so farre I am unsatisfied with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> interpretation, that I verily believe (and so doe some others) a part of the intendment of these words, <hi>Let him be to thee as an Heathen man and a Publican,</hi> is to hold forth the lawfulnesse, yea the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of performing all naturall (and in diverse cases morall) duties to a person Excommunicated: I meane that the Text doth intimate thus much. As upon the one hand the contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious offender who will not heare the Church, is to be used no better than an Heathen or a prophane Publican, and is not to be admitted to any Ordinance, except such as Heathens and prophane Publicans are and may be admitted unto; So upon the other hand, let him have no worse usage and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then those very Heathens and Publicans, unto whom all naturall and some morall duties are performed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they be Heathens and Publicans. For the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth Christians to be subject even to Heathen Magistrates, servants to honour and be subject to heathen and ungodly
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:95406:223"/>
Masters, the wife not to depart from the husband because he believeth not. So that this rule of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. is so full and perfect, as to teach us, as well what fellowship is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with such a one, as what fellowship is not lawfull to be kept with him. I doe not deny but that (according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rule) fellowship with an excommunicate person in meat, drinke, familiarity, and salutations, is unlawfull, as well as in the Sacrament and prayer, according to the received rule:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Si pro delictis, anathema quis efficiatur;</l>
                  <l>Os, or are, vale, communio, mensa negatur.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And the Scripture forbidding to eate with such a one, or to have company with him, or to bid him God speed, will reach as farre. Neverthelesse there are divers excepted or reserved cases in which the performance of naturall duties unto and keeping of civill company with an excommunicate person is allowed. The exception made from the rule is this:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Haee anathema quidem faciunt, ne possit obesse:</l>
                  <l>Utile, lex, humile, res ignorata, necesse.</l>
               </lg>

                  <hi>Utile,</hi> as when a man seeketh payment of debt from an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate person. <hi>Lex,</hi> because the law alloweth husband and wife to company together, though the one of them be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. <hi>Humile,</hi> because children may and ought to doe the duties of children, and servants the duty of servants, and subjects the duty of subjects, and vassals the duty of vassals, and souldiers the duty of souldiers, in companying with submitting unto, honouring and obeying of their excommunicated Parents, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Kings, Lords, Commanders. <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All which is most agreeable to this expression, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen man and a Publican,</hi> and to the nature of Excommunication, which doth not breake asunder naturall or morall, but spirituall and ecclesiasticall bonds. If it be asked why then are we forbidden to eate with an excommunicate person, or to bid him God

speed; I answer, these things are not forbidden but under a spirituall notion and for a spirituall end, that the offender may be ashamed and humbled, that others may not be deceived by countenancing of him or companying with him, and that our eating with him or saluting of him may not be interpreted as a conniving at, or complying with his sinnes, or as a signe of Christian fellowship with a scandalous person formerly called a brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sinally that God may be the more glorified, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the more ashamed, others the more edified, the sinner the more abas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus we have the negative part of the rule of Christ. Now to the positive part. What is it to be <hi>as an Heathen and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican?</hi> He must not be worse used in naturall or civill things, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This fivefold restraint of Heathens from the Temple, from the Passeover, from eating of an Offering, from bringing an Oblation unto the Lord, and generally from all Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, did lie even upon those Heathens who did cohabit and familiarly converse with the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> who are called <hi>proselyti domicilii:</hi> and no Heathen man was free of such restraint, except <hi>proselyti justitiae,</hi> who were circumcised and made members of the Jewish Church, and had the name of Jewes.</p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen man,</hi> may have a Commentary from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 19. where <hi>David</hi> curserh his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies before the Lord, because they had made him as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man: <hi>they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Goe serve other Gods.</hi> He did not reckon his banishment, want of civill liberties, cutting off from the civill fellowship and company of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> in comparison of that which was farre worse to him, and a great deale heavier to be borne, namely, that he was rejected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiate
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:95406:225"/>
from spirituall fellowship with Gods people, from partaking in the holy Ordinances, from comming to the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, from the Church priviledges, that his persecution was materially and substantially an Excommunication, and <hi>qua</hi> Excommunication it was more grievous to him then <hi>qua</hi> persecution.</p>
               <p>I suppose it now appeares that <hi>Let him be to thee as an Heathen man,</hi> is a shutting out not from civill, but from sacred fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. The other branch, <hi>Let him be to thee as a Publican,</hi> I have before said enough of it. This onely I adde. There were among the Jewes two sorts of Publicans: some were good and just men, exacting no more then what was appointed them; others were unjust and extortioners, and thereby made infamous. The former sort the Hebrews have professed they were willing to converse civilly withall, as members of the same Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. See <hi>L'Empereur de legibus Ebraeorum forensibus,</hi> pag. 272. But when Christ saith, <hi>Let him be to thee as a Publican,</hi> he means the impious and unjust Publican onely, as the same learned Antiquary there saith. And so when our Saviour bids us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem such a one not onely as an Heathen man, but as a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, he means that he is not only to be denied fellowship in the holy things, but further made infamous among the people; for the name <hi>Publican</hi> is used to signifie the worst of men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 46, 47. and in the Gospell it is said, <hi>Publicans and Sinners, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Harlots,</hi> as was noted before. So <hi>Hierome</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. understands the name of Publicans <hi>secundum Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiam,</hi> for such as are given to unlawfull gaines, deceits, thefts, perjuries, and such like abominable wickednesses. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must not thinke that for civill respects of Tax-gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or the like the Jewes refused to keepe civill company or fellowship with the Publicans. For we read in <hi>Exc. Gem. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedrin cap.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. that though he that was a shepheard, as such, was unfit to be a witnesse, yet he that was simply a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican (that is, as <hi>I. Coch.</hi> saith in his Annotation, a Publican who is not convict of exacting more then is appointed by Law) or a Publican as a Publican is not forbidden to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Where it is also added, that the father of <hi>R. Sira</hi> had the office of a Publican thirteen yeeres. Hence we see that a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:95406:225"/>
were he a Jew or Gentile, provided he were a just Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, his testimony had faith and credit in Judgement; How then can it be supposed that the Jewes did not so much as keep any civill company with such a one? We must therefore under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the Jewes refused to have any fellowship with the impious and unjust Publicans, as with Church members, and this the Jewes did because of their scandalous ungodlinesse and unrighteousnesse.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to be esteemed as a Publican was esteemed among the Jewes, comprehendeth these three things. 1. To be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as the worst of men, impious, abominable, execrable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, and as it were <hi>publici odii victimae,</hi> for so were the Publicans esteemed among the Jewes.

Not to hold or keep with such a one, the religious Christian fellowship, which we keep with Church members; yea, and (for religious ends, and in spirituall respects, as was said before) not to keep with such a one, so much as that civill fellowship which we are permitted to keep with Pagans and unbelievers, with whom when bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to a feast, we may goe and eate together as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly resolveth, but with him that is called a brother when scandalous and obstinate, (and therefore justly made as a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican) we may not so much as eate, as the same Apostle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, wherein those are ever to be excepted, who are tied by naturall relations to performe naturall and humane duties to the party excommunicate and made as a Publican, as the wife to the husband, the children to their parents.</p>
               <p>In both these respects, Let him be as a Publican, superaddeth somewhat, and saith more then was in that other part, Let him be as an Heathen man.

               <p>AS for that other Erastian Glosse upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. that Christ meaneth of going to the orthodox Magistrate being of the same true religion, (&amp; that this is the sence of those words <hi>Tell the Church</hi>) but if the Brother who hath done us wrong will not heare nor obey that Magistrate, then <hi>let him he unto thee as an Heathen man and a publican,</hi> that is, thou mayest prosecute him, as thou wouldest prosecute an Heathen man or a Publican before an extrinsecall Tribunall, such as at that time the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours was to the Jewes.

This Glosse hath been justly rejected by many learned men. The first Argument which I bring against it, is that it is wide from the scope of the Text, yea prejudgeth and even overthroweth the great thing which is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Jesus Christ in this place, <hi>Camero Myroth. in Math.</hi> 18. thinks it is, utterly different from Christs intention in this place, which is to prescribe rules to our consciences concerning the amendment of our Brother, and the reducing of him from his sinne, not to give oeconomicall rules concerning the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our injuries or losses: Wherefore he concludes that by the Church is meant the Presbytery mentioned 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14.

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:95406:227"/>
collects from these words in the Text, <hi>thy Brother,</hi> and <hi>thou hast gained thy Brother.</hi> He doth also paralell <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 15. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Brethren, if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spirituall, restore such an one in the spirit of meeknesse.</hi> Now this as it is the surest exposition (expounding Scripture by Scripture) so it doth not concerne a Judiciall proceeding in the case of private Injuries, but the Christian duty of reclaiming and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the soule from sin.</p>
               <p>He further observeth that the thing which Christ recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth to every Christian, to be done <hi>ex Charitate Christiana,</hi> is nothing else but what is incumbent to Pastors <hi>ex officio;</hi> for Pastors ought by vertue of their publike charge and ministery to doe the same thing authoritatively, which one Christian is bidden doe to another in Christian Brotherly charity, that is to admonish, rebuke, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I am perswaded were the Lord Jesus his scope and intent in this Text rightly understood, there should need no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the Glosses given either by <hi>Erastus</hi> or by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne.</hi> They restrict to the case of private or personall injuries, and to the party injuried civilly, that which our Saviour prescribeth <note n="o" place="margin">

                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 21, 22. Hence it is that the Apostle exhorteth Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to <hi>warne them that are unruly or disorderly,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 13.

And if the offender be not reduced by more private admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rebukes, the same Law of spirituall love bindeth his Brother that knoweth his sinne and impenitency to tell the Church, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> told his Father of his Brethrens faults, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 2. <hi>and Joseph brought unto their Father their evill report,</hi> that is their scandalous sinnes which made them to have an evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. It is well noted by <hi>Pareus</hi> upon the place, that the thing which <hi>Ioseph</hi> did complaine of to his Father, was not his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns hatred against himselfe, nor any personall injury done to himself, (because their hatred of <hi>Ioseph</hi> was the effect, not the cause, of the information which he gave to his Father of their faults) but it was their sinne and scandalous life by which they brought an evill name upon themselves and the family of their Father. Wherein he doth upon good reason justifie what <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> did, because he told not his Brethrens faults to an Enemy but to a Father, nor for their evill, but for their good. It was also declared unto the Apostle by them of the house of <hi>Cloe</hi> that there were contentions among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. So it is collected from 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 11. that some in the Church of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> gave notice to the Apostle of such as walked dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly. And as he that spares the Rod hates the Child, so he that neglects to rebuke an offending Brother, or (when that cannot amend him) neglects to tell the Church, doth hate his Brothers soule, in so farre as he suffers sinne upon him.</p>
               <p>If these things be acknowledged for truths, we will be easily induced to believe that the scope of Jesus Christ <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. is to teach us, not what he permits the party injured to doe toward the party injuring, but what he commands every one that loves the soule and salvation of his Neighbour, to doe

                  </note> that which <hi>Drusius praeter. lib.</hi> 1. on <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. citeth <hi>e libro Musar.</hi> Besides, both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Schoole-men, Casuists, Commentators, Popish, and Protestant, when they handle the Questions <hi>de correptione fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna,</hi> they make Brotherly rebukes to be a common duty of love which one neighbour oweth to another, and ever and anon they cleare what they hold from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. I verily believe it is one of the wiles yea depths of Sathan in perverting that Text with the Erastian Glosses, to throw out of the Church and to drown in desuetude and oblivion, a great and necessary duty which every Christian by the law of love oweth to the soule of his Brother with whom he converseth, which were it conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably practised, I dare say, it should be a most powerfull and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall meanes (by the blessing of Christ upon his owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance) to purge the Church of scandals, to gaine soules, and to advance holinesse.</p>
               <p>Now he that can neither be reduced by more private repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions nor by publike Ecclesiasticall conviction, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen man,</hi> saith Christ, let him be esteemed as one that hath no part in the communion of the Saints, in Church-Membership, in the holy things, in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Israel, in the Covenants of promise, more then an Heathen man. Which is a spirituall, not a civill separation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>We who are Jewes by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My second Argument shall be this. That which Christ saith generally of any sinne whereby one Brother scandalizeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Brother, the Erastians restrict to private or personall inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And whereas Christs rule tendeth to the rescuing and saving of a sinner, their Glosse runnes upon a mans particular interest in the resarclating of a private injury. <hi>If thy Brother tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe against thee,</hi> that is, <hi>Cum quis coram aliquo peccaverit,</hi> saith <hi>Munsterus, when any brother sinneth in the presence of some other.</hi> Are we not oblidged to rebuke an offending Brother in Christian love; and to endeavour to bring him to repentance and to save his soule; whether he hath done to us any particular injury or not: May we suffer sinne upon his soule, because that sinne is
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:95406:228"/>
not an injury to us? Let it be well observed, the thing here aimed at, is the salvation of the offending Brother, and his turning from sinne, as <hi>Grotius</hi> rightly noteth from the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) for in that sence is the same word used 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>that I might gain them that are under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>they may be wonne by the conversation of the wives.</hi> This (saith <hi>Grotius) James</hi> doth explain <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>he which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soule from death, and shall hide a multitude of sinnes.</hi> If this then be the meaning of Christs words, thou hast gained thy Brother: then it concerneth all sinnes whereby we know our Brothers soule and salvation to be in hazard. Wherefore though <hi>Grotius</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand private injuries to be that case which the Text putteth, yet saith he, it is the manner of the Law of God, by one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and more remarkable kind of things, to intimate what ought to be done in other things according to the rule of just proportion. And it holds more true in other sinnes, then in the case of private injuries: <hi>This rebuking is necessary as well in sins which are committed against God as in those which are committed against man, and by so much the more its necessary in sinnes which are committed against God, by how much they are heavier then sinnes which are committed against man,</hi> saith <hi>Tostatus in Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>quest.</hi> 93. And <hi>Grotius</hi> himself citeth out of <hi>Mimus,</hi>

               <q>Amici vitia si feras faeias tua.</q>
               <p>And whereas the <hi>Erastian</hi> take much hold of the words <hi>against thee. If thy Brother trespasse against thee.</hi> I have before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that any sinne against God which is committed in my sight, hearing, or knowledge, and so becommeth a scandall or stumbling Block to me, is a trespasse committed against me, because he that ought to edifie me doth scandalize me. So that the words <hi>against thee</hi> are added, to signifie, not a civill injury, bnt rather a spirituall injury or scandall. <hi>Augustine regul.</hi> 3. <hi>in fine Tom.</hi> 1. applieth the rule and method of proceeding menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. to lascivious or adulterous behaviour, which one Brother observing in another, ought to admonish him, first secretly, then to take witnesses, then to tell the Church, and if he be contumacious, <hi>de vestra societate projiciatur, let him</hi>

                  <hi>be cast out of your society</hi> saith he, and the context carrieth it to any scandall whereby one Brother scandalizeth another: whereof much was spoken in the preceding part of the Chapter. <hi>Erastus</hi> pag. 154. <hi>Scopus Christi est in hoc capite docere, quantum malum sit scandalum. The scope of Christ is in this Chapter to teach how great an evill scandall is.</hi> Wherefore I adhere to the resolution of <hi>Tosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in Math.</hi> 18. <hi>quaest.</hi> 84, <hi>sive sit peccatum directè contra deum, sive contra proximum, si fit nobis scientibus, fit contra nos, cum nos scandalizet.</hi> Both <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi> upon <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 15. observe this cohesion, that Christ having before spoken against those that give scandall, now he gives a rule to the person scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that exposition which now I argue against, tendeth to make one Scripture contradict another, and to make that lawfull by one Scripture, which another Scripture makes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull even some of themselves being Judges. They so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>Matth.</hi> 1 <hi>S.</hi> that they make it lawfull (and as such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Christ himself) for a Christian to pursue his Brother for a civill injury before Infidell or Heathnish Judges, even as he would pursue an Heathen or Infidell, if such an one had done him the in ury. <note n="r" place="margin">

                  <hi>Erast,</hi> saith freely (yet foully) that if a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the faithfull be under the Turke or the Pope, one of them may pursue another for an injury (when the offender will not hearken to his own Assembly) before those Judges who are aliens, and Enemies to the true Religion. His exposition of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. doth plainly lead hereunto. So saith Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> (a great follower of <hi>Erastus</hi>) in this debate upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. in the place before cited, <hi>let him be to thee as an Heathen man and a publican, that is pursue him in those courts, where thou wouldest a Pagan and Publican that should do thee wrong.</hi> But how doth this agree with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. (the place which <hi>Erastus thes.</hi> 41. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth to be a Commentary upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.) doth not the Apostle expressely condemne it, as being utterly a fault that one brother went to Law with another for the things of this life or civill causes, before the unjust and unbeleevers? Nay, let us heare Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> himself in that very place. <hi>Paul saith he by no means permitted them to pursue their Brethren at the Tribunals of Infidels.</hi> What then? will they set <hi>Paul</hi> against Christ? or will

they make 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. contrary to <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. As for that whereby <hi>Erastus</hi> would reconcile this difference, it is as good as nothing. He saith pag. 183. that <hi>Paul</hi> requireth them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to arbitrators within the Church it self, only the smallest matters and things pertaining to this life, but not crimes or weighty matters which he would reserve to the Magistrates, otherwise he had detracted much from those to whom he every where commandeth to give obedience. And so (saith he) that which <hi>Paul</hi> saith is nothing but what Christ saith, <hi>Tell the Church.</hi> Besides <hi>Paul</hi> himself appealed to <hi>Cesar.</hi> let all men judge (saith he) whether the Apostle would make it unlawfull to other wronged persons, which he thought lawfull for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? I answer, 1. If it was a shame and foule scandall for Christians to pursue one another for smaller matters pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this life, how much more for crimes and weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? for then the unbeleevers might cast the heavier load of reproaches upon the Christian religion. 2. This might have opened a door to elude that which the Apostle so earnestly presseth; for one would be ready to say, this cause of mine is a weighty one, it is an injury and crime that can not be born, therefore I am free to pursue it before unbelievers. Whereas the Apostle saith, <hi>Why do ye not rather take wrong? why doe ye not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer your selves to be defrauded?</hi> 3. The judging of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest matters, and of the things pertaining to this life, is by the Apostle opposed, not to weighty civill injuries, but to the judging of the world and of Angells, as is manifest by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis</hi> in the Text. But he maketh no intimation of the least distinction of civill injuries, as if some might be pursued before unbeleiving Judges, some not: he speaketh generally <hi>vers.</hi> 1. <hi>Dare any of you having a matter against another.</hi> vers. 4. <hi>If then ye have judgements of things pertaining to this life</hi> vers. 7. <hi>Why doe ye not rather take wrong?</hi> 4. If that which <hi>Paul</hi> saith, be the same with that which Christ saith <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> and if it was <hi>Pauls</hi> mind that he who would not hearken to chosen arbitrators among the Saints might be pursued before the unbeleiving Judges (as <hi>Erastus</hi> tells us both here and <hi>Thes.</hi> 47.) then <hi>Tell the Church</hi> cannot be meant of telling the Magistrate of the same religion; for <hi>Paul</hi> sends them to no Christian Magistrate (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:95406:230"/>
there was none such then and there) but to arbitrators chosen among the Saints. Tis most strange to me that so acute a disputant could expound the Telling of the Church <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. by the reference to arbitrators 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. and yet understand the Church <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. to be the civill Magistate. 5. There might be subjection and obedience to the Heathen Magistrates, although the Saints should not go to Law one against another before them 6. <hi>Paul</hi> did but appeal from <hi>Caesars</hi> Deputy to <hi>Caesar</hi> himself. He was drawne by the Jewes before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Festus</hi> (wherein <hi>Paul</hi> was a sufferer) and finding <hi>Festus</hi> unjust and partiall, and that he endeavoured to deliver him to the Jewes, who had a mind to have him put to death, thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he appealeth from <hi>Festus</hi> to <hi>Caesar.</hi> So that if <hi>Erastus</hi> had made the paralell right, all that he could conclude from <hi>Pauls</hi> example, had been this, that when a Christian is drawne and compelled by his accusers and Enemies (not being Christians) before the Tribunall of an inferiour Heathen Judge, if he there find himself in danger of his life, he may appeale in his just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to an higher Heathen Judge. Wherefore I yet conclude that by the Erastian principles Christ and <hi>Paul</hi> cannot be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These three Arguments doe militate not onely against <hi>Erastus</hi> and <hi>Bilson,</hi> but likewise against <hi>Sutlivius de Presb. Cap.</hi> 9. where he gives this sence of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. that we ought to take heed we give no scandall in the pursuing of injuries, and for that end ought to give admonition first privately, then before witnesses, and in case of obstinacy in the brother that hath done the injury, to tell the Rulers of the Church (meaning the Prelates) and if he will not hear them, then to go to Law with that Brother, as with an Heathen or Publican. The other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which are to follow, (the last excepted) strike not at his Interpretation, but at those other Glosses, of <hi>Erastus, Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and Master <hi>Prynne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, this <hi>Erastian</hi> exposition makes these words, <hi>but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen man and a publican,</hi> to be applicable onely to such Christians as live under unbelieving Magistrates, and not to all Christians. This consequence <hi>Erastus</hi> foresaw, that it would needs follow from his Interpretation, therefore he plainly owneth it <hi>Thes.</hi> 47. He
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:95406:230"/>
confesseth that the former part concerning rebuking and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gaine the offending Brother, belongs to all Christians; What a boldnesse is here to rent asunder this passage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was uttered as it were with one breath? And why doth not the latter part also belong unto all Christians? Must Christians that live under an Infidell Magistrate have more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall meanes and wayes to use towards an offending Brother, and may they go a step further in putting him to shame or in humbling him, then those Christians can doe who live under a Christian Magistrate? How well doth this hang together? I should have thought the ballance must rather fall to this hand. But to make the condition of those, who live under a Christian Magistrate to be more privative, and the condition of those who live under an Infidell Magistrate to be more cumulative, is too great a paradoxe for me.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Whereas they say that the way prescribed by Christ <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. is such as is agreeable to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and they understand by <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> Tell the Magistrate, I aske what Magistrate? If the Judges and Magistrates of the Cities, as Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> thinkes, then he who did not hearken to those Judges might appeale to the great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or the Judges themselves might referre and transmit the case thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so that the man was not to be straight way accounted as an Heathen man and a Publican. But if by the Church they understand the great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> it self, he that would not hearken to it was to be put to death by the Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. So that it had not been agreeable to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> to teach that he who will not hearken to the great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> is to be esteemed as an Heathen man and a Publican; for this supposeth that he shall not dye but be suffered to live.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the Erastian principles do plainly contradict and confute themselves. For both <hi>Erastus,</hi> Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> and Master <hi>Prynne</hi> hold that he Jewish Sanhedrin in Christs time was a temporall Magistracy and a civill Court of justice, which had power to scourge, imprison, torture, and outlaw offenders, yea to put to death as the first two doe positively averre. <note n="s" place="margin">Sutliviks de Presbyteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

imprison, scourge, torture, outlaw, yea to put him to death? Surely if he neglect to heare the Church, doth intimate that the Church hath not used nor cannot use any externall coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power. <hi>Erastus</hi> findes himselfe so mightily puzled with this difficulty, that to make out his interpretation of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. he confesseth <hi>Thes.</hi> 53. and <hi>confirm. Thes. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish Sanhedrin had no power under the <hi>Romans</hi> to judge of civill causes and injuries, but of things pertaining to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion onely, <note n="t" place="margin">Pag. 158. <hi>Proinde impunè poterat, qui vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebat judicium Synedtii contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere in civilibus rebus.</hi>
                  </note> so that at that time (saith he) a man might <hi>impune</hi> without punishment contemne the judgement of the Sanhedrin in civill things. And thus while he seeketh a <hi>Salvo</hi> for his Glosse upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. he overthroweth the great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which he and his followers endeavour to prove that there was no other Sanhedrin in Christs time, but a civill Court of justice, because say they, that Sanhedrin had the power of the Sword and other temporall punishments.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, observe the gradation in the Text, 1. a private conviction or rebuke. 2. Conviction before two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. 3. Conviction before the Church, and the Churches declaring the thing to be an offence, and commanding the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender to turn from his evill way. 4. If he will not heare the Church (which implieth that the Church hath spoken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to doe somewhat which he refuseth to doe) then <hi>Let him be as an Heathen man and a Publican.</hi> This last is heavier then all that went before, and is the punishment of his not hearing the Church now this gradation is in consistent with the Interpretation which <hi>Erastus</hi> giveth; for by his owne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the Sanh drin of the Jewes at that time had not power to judge of civill causes nor to punish any man for a civill injury, but for a matter of religion onely. (yet they are not matters of Religion, but civill trespasses which he understands to be meant <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.) Here is an intercision in the third step of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. And if it were an offence in the matter of religion, it had not been a greater punishment, but a greater ease to the offender, to draw him before the Roman tribunals, for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans cared for none of those things, of which the Jewish Sanhedrin was most zealous. The gradation in the Text is as inconsistent with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> interpretation; for imagine the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:95406:231"/>
offender to be after previous admonitions publiquely accused and convict before the Church (that is, in his opinion) the civill Court of justice which had power to imprison, scourge, torture, and outlaw offenders, if not to condemne, and put to death) what should be done with such an one? can we goe no higher? yes: thus it is in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> sence. He that will not submit to the Magistrate, and cannot be reduced by stripes and imprisonment, torturing and outlawing, yea peradventure by condemnation to die the death; let this be the last remedy for such an one, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an beathen man and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,</hi> that is, withdraw familiar civill company from him.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, that interpretation of <hi>Erastus</hi> leaneth to a false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, namely that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>as a Publican,</hi> are meant universally of all Publicans good or bad, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were. To prove this he takes an argument pag. 189, 190, 195. from the Article <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for with the Grecians, saith he, the Article being joyned to the predicate, noteth the nature and consequently the universality of the thing; whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifieth a Publican <hi>qua</hi> Publican, and so every Publican. Now what can be the sence of Christs words in reference to every Publican (saith he) unlesse this be it, that it was lawfull to pursue any Publican at a Tribunall of the <hi>Romans?</hi> I answer, his argument goeth upon a most false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which I cleare by the like instances, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Use not vaine repetitions as the Heathen doe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Shall we thence conclude that the Heathens as Heathens, and so all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens without exception did use repetitions in prayer, or that they were all so devout in their way as to make long prayers? <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 11. <hi>I am not as other men are</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c.</hi> Did the Pharisee meane that every man <hi>eo ipso</hi> that he was another man, and so the rest of the Pharisees as well as others, were extortioners, &amp;c. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 6. <hi>he is cast forth as a branch</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If the rule of <hi>Erastus</hi> hold, then a branch as a branch, and so every branch is cast out. Many such instances might be given. If in these Texts there must be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction of the sence, notwithstanding of the prepositive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, so that by <hi>Heathens</hi> we must understand devout or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:95406:232"/>
Heathens: by <hi>other men,</hi> vulgar men, or the common sort of men; by <hi>a branch,</hi> a fruitlesse or withered branch. Why shall we not also understand by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the prophane loose or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Publican, and as <hi>Grotius</hi> doth rightly expound it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Let him be esteemed, saith he, as an Heathen man, that is, as an alien from religion, or as a Publican; that is, if he be a Jew, esteeme him as an infamous sinner, or one of a flagitious life. Since therefore <hi>Erastus</hi> confesseth pag. 194. that as the office of the Publicans was lawfull, so likewise many Publicans were honest, chast, religious, and pious men, I may safely conclude, that <hi>Let him be unto thee as a Publican,</hi> cannot be meant univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally of all Publicans. For how can it be supposed that Christ would tacitely allow of alienation from or severity to pious Publicans?</p>
               <p>Tenthly, whereas the Erastians lay great waight upon that forme of speech, <hi>Let him be to thee,</hi> (not to the whole Church) as an Heathen man and a Publican, (which is also one of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livius</hi> his exceptions <hi>de Presbyterio, cap.</hi> 9.) in this also they do abuse the Text, for 1. The same offence which is a sufficient ground to one Church-member to esteem another Church member as an Heathen man or a Publican, being a publique and known scandall (such as is contumacy and disobedience to the Church) must needs be a sufficient ground to all other Church members, or to the whole Church to esteem so of him. Surely Christ would not have contradictory judgements in his Church concerning so high a point, as is the esteeming of a Church member to be as a Heathen man and a Publican. 2. The Erastians herein argue no better than the Papists: Christ said to <hi>Peter, I will give unto thee the keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Therefore unto <hi>Peter</hi> alone. Peradventure Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> was so sagacious as to prevent this objection with his popish conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: <hi>these Keyes were never given to any of the Apostles but to Peter,</hi> saith he, in his <hi>plea for Christian magistracy,</hi> pag. 9. It seems he will farre lesse sticke to grant the Prelaticall argument, <hi>Timothy</hi> laid on hands, and <hi>Titus</hi> ordained Elders, therefore each of these had the power of ordination by himselfe alone. 3. It is a good observation of <hi>Luther Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Resolv. super propos.</hi> 13. <hi>de potest. Papae. fol.</hi> 299. in the sixteenth of <hi>Matthew</hi> Christ begins with

               <p>That interpretation of the word <hi>Church</hi> is no better. But that I may reject nothing without reason, I desire it may be considered, 1. Whether either in Scripture, or in any Greeke Lexicon, or in any Classick author, it can be found that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was ever used to signifie meerly a greater number or company then two or three, not called out and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied together for government or worship.

with a kisse. But since the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. doth signifie a lawfull assembly, (as all doe confesse) I desire some testimony of Scripture or approved authors, where this name is given to a lawfull assembly, which was not imbodied for worship or government, but had the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>4. The Church mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. hath a forensicall or juridicall power, as appeareth by that of the two or three witnesses vers. 16. which relateth to a Juridicall proceeding in the trying and punishing of offences, as M. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Peradventure some man will say, that the two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses here are brought in onely to be witnesses to the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to make the admonition the more effectuall, and the more to be regarded, but not as if any use were to be made of these witnesses, to prove the fact or offence it selfe before the Church, if there be occasion. I answer, either it must be supposed here that the trespasse was seen or knowne onely by him that gives the first rebuke privately, or that it was also seen or known by those two or three witnesses. If the former, it is much disputed among Schoolmen whether he that rebukes his offending brother be to proceed any further than a private rebuke for a private offence, or whether he is to stop at pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate rebukes, and not to take witnesses with him (which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thinke to be unfit and disallowed, as being an officious and unnecessary irritation of the offending brother by the sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his shame, a making of a private sinne to become scandalous to others, as likewise an engaging of witnesses to
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:95406:234"/>
assist in the admonition and rebuke by a blinde and implicite faith) for my part I shall not need here to dispute this point: for what ever ought to be done, or ought not to be done in this case, when the trespasse is known to one onely: yet in the other case when besides him that rebukes there are two or three more which can be witnesses of the fact or trespasse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (the trespasse being yet not publiquely divulged) it can not be denied, that these witnesses of the fact are to be brought unto and confronted with the offender, when he cannot be gained by private rebuke, and (if need be) prove it afterward before the Church.

                  <hi>Aegidius de Coninck</hi> tels us (in whatsoever other case witnesses are to be taken, or are not to be taken) in this case all doe consent that witnesses are to be taken.</p>
               <p>Concerning the taking of witnesses, when the trespasse is known to me alone, there are three different opinions. 1. That when I have rebuked the offender privately, and cannot gaine him, I am to proceed no further, but have done my duty and must leave the event to God. 2. That when a secret admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not effectuall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> witnesses are to be taken, in case the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender so admonished continue in his sinne, or in case his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse be feared and expected, that the witnesses may observe such continuing or relapse in sinne, and then assist and joyne in rebuking him, and if need be (that is, in case of his contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy) to prove the fact before the Church. 3. That even when his continuance or relapse in sinne can not be observed, (and so can not be afterward proved by witnesses) yet the second admonition is to be given before witn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sses, when the first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition given privately hath not gained the offender. Of these let the Reader judge. Tis enough for the point now in hand, that when witnesses can be had to prove the trespasse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:95406:234"/>
they ought to be brought, first before the offender, and then (if he continue obstinate) before the Church to prove the fact: and they must be three, or two at the least, which I doe not see how it can be thought necessary, if we suppose that the sinne is not known to any but to me alone who give tho first rebuke; for if there must be a witnesse of my second ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, why may not one witnesse joyn with me as well as two, when I can not have two, but one onely, willing and ready to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oyn with me. But now a necessity of precept lies on me, that I must have two witnesses at least, which cannot be otherwise understood, but in reference to a forensicall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding afterwards, if need be.</p>
               <p>5. That interpretation which now I speak against, while it goeth about to avoyd a power of Jurisdiction and Censure in this Text, it doth subject him that is reproved by another, to a heavier yoke, and brings him into a greater servitude. For though a man be not disobedient nor contumacious unto any Court Civill or Ecclesiasticall, yet if he doth not hearken to such a number, as the party offended shall declare the case unto (being a greater number then two or three) he must be by and by esteemed and avoyded as an Heathen man and a Publican.</p>
               <p>6. This interpretation, as it is fathered upon <hi>Grotius,</hi> so it may be confuted out of <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the very place. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds <hi>Tell it unto the Church</hi> by the same words which <hi>Drusius</hi> citeth, è <hi>libro Musar.</hi> declare it <hi>coram multis,</hi> before many. But is this any other then <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>before all,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. Now these were acts of Ecclesiasticall power and authority, not simply the acts of a greater number. He tels us also it was the manner among the Jewes to referre the businesse <hi>ad multitudinem</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to the assembly of those who were of the same way, or followed the same rites, the judgements of which multitude (saith he) <hi>seniores tanquam praesides moderabantur, the Elders as Presidents did moderate.</hi> He further cleares it out of <hi>Tertullian apol. cap.</hi> 39. where speaking of the Churches or assemblies of Christians, he saith: <hi>ibidem etiam exhortationes, castigationes &amp; censura divina &amp;c. praesident probati quique seniores.

               <p>I hope I may now conclude that <hi>Tell the Church</hi> is neither meant of the civill Magistrate, nor simply of a greater number, but of the Elders or (as others expresse it better) of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or Assembly of Elders; So <hi>Stephanus, Scapula,</hi> and <hi>Pasor</hi> in the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As binding and loosing are Acts of authority and power, such as doth not belong to any single person or brother offended, so the binding and loosing mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. are Acts of Ecclesiasticall and spirituall authority, belonging to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Government of Christ in his Church, but not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the civill Magistrate. And as the authority is Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and spirituall, so it is more than Doctrinall, it is a power of inflicting or taking off Church Censures. These two things I will endeavour to prove. 1. That this power of binding and loosing belongeth neither to private Christians nor to civill Magistrates, but to Church Officers. 2. That this power is juridicall or forensicall, and not Doctrinall onely; that is, that Church-Officers are here authorised to bind with censures, or to loose from censures, as there shall be cause. In both which we have Antiquity for us. Which I doe the rather observe because <hi>Erastus</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> alledge some of the Antients, for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 18. that this binding or loosing is by the offended brother.

Nor can I passe <hi>Chrysostome</hi> upon this very Text, where he tells that Christ will have such a one to be punished <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, he cuts not off immediately, but after admonitions.</p>
               <p>I will now proceed to a further confirmation of the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions afore mentioned. Touching the first, That this binding and loosing <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. belongeth nei her to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians, nor to civill Magistrates, but to Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, I clear it thus. There are two things by which (as Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men observe) mens soules and consciences are bound, 1. They are bound by their sinnes. Prov. 5. 22. <hi>His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, &amp; he shall be holden with the cords of his sins,</hi> Act. 8. 23. <hi>thou art in the bond of iniquity.</hi> 2. Men are bound by precepts <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 4. <hi>They bind heavy burthens and grievous to be born, and lay them on mens shoulders.</hi> This binding by precept or law, some take to be meant <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>O Sonne of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they shal put bands upon thee, &amp; shall bind thee with them,</hi> that is, thou shalt in vision see thy self bound with bands upon thee, to signifie that I have forbidden thee to be a reprover to the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us house. So the Chaldee paraphrase. <hi>But thou a Sonne of man, behold I have put my word upon thee, as a band of cords with which they bind, and thou shalt not goe forth into the midst of them.</hi> Now in both these respects the Scripture elsewhere doth ascribe to Church-Officers a power of binding and loosing. 1 In respect of sinne <hi>Io.</hi> 20. 23. <hi>Whosesoever sins ye remit they are remitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and whosesoever sin s ye retaine they are retained.</hi> It is spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the Apostles and their successors in the Ministery of the Gospell. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>I will give unto thee the Keyes of the Kingdome of heaven: and whatsoever thou shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</hi> Where the power of binding and loosing is
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:95406:238"/>
given to the Apostles, &amp; <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place cleareth it from 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. 20. <hi>God hath committed unto us the word of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now then we are Ambassadours for Christ.</hi> So that we find in Scripture Church Officers inabled and authorised <hi>ex officio</hi> as the Heraulds and Ambassadours of the King of <hi>Zion,</hi> to loose from the bands of sinne all repenting and beleiving sinners, and to bind over to eternall justice and wrath the impenitent and unbeleevers. 2 They are also authorised, dogmatically and authoritatively to declare and impose the will of Christ, and to bind his precepts upon the shoulders of his peeple <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. as likewise to loose them and pronounce them free from such burthens, as men would impose upon them contrary or beside the word of God 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. An example of both we have Act. 15. 28. The Synod of the Apostles and Elders bindeth upon the Churches such Burthens, as were necessary by the Law of love for the avoiding of scandall, but did pronounce the Churches to be free and loosed from other burthens which the Judaizing Teachers would have bound upon them. Now therefore if we will expound <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. by other Scriptures (it being the onely surest way to expound Scripture by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) it is manifest and undeniable, that Church-Officers are by other Scriptures inabled and authorised to bind &amp; loose in both those respects afore-mentioned. But we no where find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Christ hath given either to all private Christians, or to the civill Magistrate, a Commission and Authority to bind or loose sinners; I know a private Christian may and ought to convince an impenitent brother, and to comfort a repenting brother, <hi>ex charitate Christiana:</hi> But the Scripture doth not say, that God hath committed to every private Christian the word of reconciliation, and that all Christians are Ambassadours for Christ, nor is there a promise to ratifie in heaven the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or comforts given by a private Christian: No more then a King doth ingage himself <hi>in verbo principis</hi> to pardon such as any of his good Subjects shall pardon, or to condemne such as any of his good Subjects shall condemne: but a King ingageth himself to ratifie what his Ambassadours, Commissioners or Ministers shall doe in his name and according to the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which he hath given them to pardon or condemne. Besides
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:95406:238"/>
all this, if Christ had meant here of the brother to whom the injury was don, his private binding or loosing, not condemning or forgiving, then he had kept the phrase in the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which <hi>Erastus</hi> observeth diligently all along the Text vers. 15, 16, 17. But he might have also observed, that vers. 18. carries the power of binding and loosing to a plurality, <hi>VVhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever ye bind, &amp;c.</hi> As for the Magistrate, it belongeth to him to bind with the cords of corporall or civill punishments, or to loose and liberat from the same, as he shall see cause according to law and justice. But this doth n t belong to the spirituall Kingdome of Jesus Christ; for his Kingdome is not of this world, neither are the weapons thereof carnall but spirituall. And beside the Magistrate may lawfully and sometime doth bind on punishment, when the soule is loosed in Heaven, and the sinne remitted. Again, the Magistrate may lawfully, and sometime doth loose and absolve from punishment, when a mans soule is impenitent, and sinne is still bound upon his conscience. There is no such promise that God will forgive whom the Magistrate forgiveth, or condemne whom the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate condemneth. Neither hath God any where in Scripture committed to the Magistrate the Keyes of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the word of reconciliation, as to the Ambassadours of Christ.</p>
               <p>Binding and loosing in the other sence by a dogmaticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative declaration of the will of Christ, is not so princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally or directy intended <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. as that other binding and loosing in respect of sinne. Howbeit it is not to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, because the words preceding Vers. 17. mention not onely the execution of Excommunication, <hi>Let him be to thee as an Heathen man and a Publican;</hi> but also the Churches judgement, and determination of the case, <hi>if he neglect to heare the Church,</hi> which words implie, that the Church hath declared the will of Christ in such a case, and required the offender to doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, but he shewing himselfe unwilling and contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as it were saying in his heart, I will breake their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from me, thereupon the promise reacheth to this also, that what the Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined or imposed according to the will of Christ shall be
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:95406:239"/>

               <p>My second proposition that the power of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. is juridicall or forensicall, and meant of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting or taking off Ecclesiasticall Censures; this I will make good in the next place against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

That these words have no coherence with, or dependence upon the former. 2. That this binding and loosing is meant one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of preaching the Gospell. Touching the first of these, I confesse if by the <hi>Church,</hi> vers. 17. be meant a civill Court of Justice; and by those words, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen, &amp;c.</hi> be meant no more but keepe no civill fellowship with him (which is his sence of the Text) I cannot marvell that he could finde no coherence between vers. 17. and vers. 18. yet if there be no coherence between these verses, the generality of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters have gone upon a great mistake of the Text, conceiving that Christ doth here anticipate a great objection, and adde a great encouragement in point of Church discipline; for when the offender is excommunicated, (that is all the Church can doe to humble and reduce him) put the case he or others despise the censures of the Church, <hi>What will your censure doe?</hi> saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hussey:</hi> To that very thing Christ answereth, It shall be ratified in Heaven, and it shall doe more then the binding of the offenders in fetters of Iron could doe. But let us heare what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> saith against the coherence of Text: because (saith he) that of binding and loosing is <hi>spoken onely to and of Christs disciples, as is evident by the parallel Text of Joh.</hi> 20. 23. <hi>not of the Jewish Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It maketh the more against him (I am sure) that its spoken
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:95406:239"/>
to and of Christs Disciples, for this proveth that the <hi>Church</hi> vers. 17. is not the Jewish Sanhedrin, but the Christian Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, then instituted, and afterwards erected: and that the thing which makes one as an Heathen and a Publican, is bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his sinnes upon him. And for the context, immediatly after Christ had said, <hi>If he neglect to heare the Church, let him be unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> he addeth, <hi>Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, &amp;c.</hi> The dependency is very cleare. A Christian ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first admonished his brother in private, then having taken two or three witnesses, after this having brought it to the publique cognizance of the Ecclesiasticall Consistory, and after all that, the offender being for his obstinacy excommunicate; here is the last step, no further progresse. Now might one thinke, what of all this? what shall follow upon it? Nay, saith Christ, it shall not be in vaine, it shall be ratisied in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And as the purpose cohereth, so that forme of words, <hi>Verily I say unto you,</hi> is ordinarily used by Christ to signifie his continuing and pressing home the same purpose which he had last mentioned, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 23, 28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 36. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 34, 47. <hi>Marke</hi> 10. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 43. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 30. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 37. and many the like passages. To my best observation, I have found no place where Christs <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I say unto you,</hi> begins a new purpose which hath no cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with nor dependency upon the former.</p>
               <p>This coherence of the Text and the dependency of vers. 18. upon that which went before (which dependency is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Erastus,</hi> who perceiving that he could not deny the dependency, fancieth that the binding and loosing is meant of the offended brothers pardoning or not pardoning of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Confirm. Thes. pag.</hi> 157.) doth also quite overthrow Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> other answer, that this binding and loosing is onely meant of preaching the Gospell, and of denouncing remission of sinnes to the penitent, and wrath to the impenitent.</p>
               <p>Nay, That <hi>potestas clavium conoionalis</hi> is instituted in other places: but here its <hi>potestas cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>vium disciplinalis,</hi> as is evident: First, by the coherence of the Text, and by the taking of two or three more, and then telling of the thing to the Church; all
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:95406:240"/>
which intimateth a rising as from one or two or three more, so from them to the Church, which cannot be meant of one man, as hath been argued against both Pope and Prelate, for no one man can be called a Church: neither hath one man the power of jurisdiction; but one man hath the power of preaching.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apostles, and those who succeed them in the worke of the Ministery have the same power of the Keys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from Christ to them ministerially, which Christ hath committed from the father to him (as Mediator) authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. For in the parallel place, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. v. 21, 23. where he gives them power of remitting or retaining sinnes, he saith, <hi>As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</hi> But the Father gave Christ such a power of the Keyes, as comprehends a power of Government, and not meerely doctrinall, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 21, 22. <hi>I will commit the government into his hand, &amp;c. And the Keyes of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It may be proved also by that which immediately followeth, vers. 19. <hi>Againe I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth &amp;c.</hi> which cannot be meant of the power of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; for neither the efficacy of preaching, nor the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in Heaven, nor the fruit of it on Earth, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this, that two preachers must needs agree in the same thing. But it agreeth well to the power of Discipline, concerning which it answereth these two objections. First, it might be said, the Apostles and other Church-governours may fall to be very few in this or that Church where the offence riseth; shall we in that case execute any Church-discipline? Yes, saith Christ, if there were but two Church-officers in a Church (where no more can be had) they are to exercise Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and it shall not be in vaine. Againe, it might be objected, be they two or three, or more, what if they doe not agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves? To that he answereth, there must be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of two Church-officers at least, otherwise the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence shall be null; we can not say the like of the doctrinall power of binding or loosing, that it is of no force nor validity unlesse two at least agree in the same doctrine, as hath been said; two must agree in that sentence or censure, which is desired to
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:95406:240"/>
be ratified in Heaven, and then they binding on Earth, and unanimously calling upon God to ratifie it in Heaven, it shall be done.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this binding and loosing can not goe without the Church, it is applicable to none but a Church member or a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So the threed of the Text goes along from vers. 15. <hi>If thy Brother trespasse against thee,</hi> and vers. 16. <hi>thou hast gained thy Brother.</hi> And when it is said, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> it is supposed that the offender is a member of the Church, over whom the Church hath authority, and of whom there is hope that he will heare the Church. And when it is said, <hi>Let him be unto thee as an Heathen man and a Publican,</hi> it is supposed that formerly he was not unto us as an Heathen man and a Publican. For these and the like reasons <hi>Tostatus in Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>quaest.</hi> 91. and divers others hold that this rule of Christ is not applicable to those who are without the Church. But if the binding and loosing be meant onely of preaching the Gospell, as Master <hi>Prynne</hi> would have it, then it were applicable to those that are not yet baptised nor made Church members, for unto such the Gospell hath been and may be preached. The binding and loosing which is proper to a Brother or to a Church member, must be a juridicall power of censures, of which the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>What have I to doe to judge them also that are without? Doe not ye judge them that are within?</hi> Therefore <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome Hom.</hi> 61. <hi>in Matth.</hi> (according to the Greeke <hi>Hom.</hi> 60.) doth parallel <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. proving that this rule of Christ is not applicable to one that is without, but onely to a brother. <hi>Which Paul also saith in these words, What have I to doe to judge them also that are without? But he commandeth us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and reduce brethren,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>and to cut off the disobedient: this he (Christ) doth also in this place. Theophylact</hi> also on <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. noteth the same restriction of this rule of Christ to a Christian Brother.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, this binding power is not to be made use of, till all other meanes have been essayed, <hi>ante tentanda omnia</hi> saith <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterus,</hi> first a private admonition, then before witnesses, then the matter is brought to the Church, the Church declareth and judgeth, the offender neglecteth to heare the Church, then
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:95406:241"/>
after all this commeth the binding, which must needs be a binding with censures; for that binding which Master <hi>Prynne</hi> speakes of, the denouncing of the wrath of God against the impenitent, by the preaching of the Gospell, is not, neither ought to be suspended or delayed upon such degrees of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, this binding and loosing is not without two or three witnesses, vers. 16. But that of two or three witnesses relateth to a forensicall or judiciall proceeding, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> himselfe tels us. These witnesses may be brought before the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call court, either to prove the offenders contumacy being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, or to prove the scandalous fact it selfe, which was from the beginning knowne to two or three witnesses, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sence of Schoolmen, expressed in the precedent Chapter.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, this phrase of binding and loosing is taken both from the Hebrews, and from the Grecians. But both the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews and the Grecians used these words in a juridicall sence, as I observed in the beginning.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, that the binding and loosing <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. is juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall, not doctrinall, belonging to the power of jurisdiction, not of order, is the sence of the ancients above cited, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of <hi>Scotus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Sent. Dist.</hi> 19. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 5. <hi>Tostatus in Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Quest.</hi> 113. yea the current both of Schoolmen and of Interpreters, as well Protestant, as Popish, runneth that way. It were too long to cite all. Yea further <hi>Salmasius in appar. ad lib. de primatu p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>p.</hi> 296. understands the binding and loosing <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 23. of Discipline. So <hi>Walaeus Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 92. So divers others. From the same places <hi>Aretius Theol. probl. loc.</hi> 133. <hi>de excom.</hi> draws Excommunication as an Ordinance of Christ. From the same two Texts <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 23. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Dionysius Areop agita de Ecclesiastica Hierarchia cap.</hi> 7. <hi>sect.</hi> 7. doth prove that Christ hath committed unto the Ministers of the Church <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. His ancient Scholiast <hi>Maximus</hi> upon that place tels us, that he speaks <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>of excommunications and separations,</hi> or (as he there further explaineth) the judging and separating between the righteous and the wicked. <hi>Salmeron</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. thinks that the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:95406:241"/>
latter part of that verse, <hi>And whatsoever thou shalt binde on Earth, &amp;c.</hi> doth belong to the power of jurisdiction and censure: <hi>Hugo de S. Victore de Sacramentis lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. doth also expound <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. of the forensicall power of Excommunication. Now if in these places binding and loosing, remitting and retaining sinnes comprehend a juridicall power of laying on or taking off Church censures; how much more must this Juridicall power be comprehended <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. where the context and circumstances will much more enforce this sence, then in the other two places? this binding and loosing being also in the plurall number, <hi>Whatsoever ye bind, &amp;c.</hi> not in the singular, as the phrase is <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Whatsoever thou shalt bind &amp;c.</hi> One Minister may bind doctrinally, but one alone can not bind juridically.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, the very doctrinall or concionall binding which is yeelded by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne,</hi> is voyded and contradicted by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of known scandalous impenitent sinners to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for he that is admitted to the Sacrament is loosed, not bound; remission, not condemnation is supposed to be sealed up to him, as is manifest by the words of the Institution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 27, 28. <hi>Drinke ye all of it, for this is my blood of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is shed for many for the remission of sinnes.</hi> So that without a power of binding by censures, and namely by sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension from the Sacrament, one and the same scandalous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent person shall be bound by the word, and loosed by the Sacrament. Surely he that is to be bound by the word, ought also to be bound by suspension from the Sacrament, unlesse we make one publique Ordinance to contradict another.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> believe that Jesus Christ hath any where given to Church-officers a forensicall or juridicall power of binding by Excommunication, and loosing by Absolution or receiving againe into the communion of the Church? If he doth believe it, then I aske where hath Christ committed that power unto them, if not <hi>Matth.</hi> 18? If he doth not believe that Christ hath given any such power, then why doth he hold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication to be lawfull and warrantable by the Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Most certaine it is, that neither King, nor Parliament, nor Eldership, nor Synod, nor any power on earth, may or
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:95406:242"/>
ought to prohibite or keepe backe from the Sacrament such as Christ hath not commanded to be kept backe, or to bind sinners by Excommunication, if Christ hath given no such commission to bind in that kind.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, it may give us some light in this present Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to compare the phrase of binding and loosing <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19. with <hi>Psalm</hi> 149. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged Sword in their hand, to execute vengeance upon the Heathen and pnnishments upon the people. To bind their Kings with chaines, and their Nobles with fetters of Iron, To execute upon them the judgement written: This honour have all his Saints.</hi> Which both Jewish and Christian Interpreters referre to the Kingdome of Christ, out of whose mouth proceedeth a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged Sword, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 12. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the phrase used in the Greeke version of <hi>Psalm</hi> 149. If it should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of temporall or externall victories and conquests of the Nations and their Kings, so it was not fulfilled to the Jews in the old Testament; and the Jewes doe now but in vaine flatter themselves with the expectation of such a thing to come. There are but two expositions which are most received and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The first is, that the Saints shall judge the world toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Christ 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. and then vengeance shall be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the wicked, and all they who would not have Christ to reigne over them shall be bound hand and foot and cast into utter darknesse. This is the sence of <hi>Arnobius</hi> upon the place, and the Jesuits of <hi>Doway, Emmanuel Sa, Jansenius, Lorinus, Menochius</hi> goe that way. The other Exposition holds an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the thing in this same world, and this in a Spirituall sence, concerning the Kingdome of Christ in this world, is holden by <hi>Calvin, Bucer, VVestmeherus, Heshusius, Gesuerus, Fabritius,</hi> and others. So the Dutch Annotations, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> and <hi>Hierome,</hi> both of them upon the place, take the sword, and the chaine, and fetters to be meant of the word of God conquering and overcomming aliens, and Hereticks, and the mightiest enemies; which others cleare from <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 14. <hi>Men of stature shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine, they shall come after thee, in chaines they shall come over.</hi> But because the Psalmist maketh mention of a corrective or punitive judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:95406:242"/>
power, therefore others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adde for making the sence more full, the power of excommunication; for which <hi>Lorinus</hi> citeth <hi>Bruno,</hi> and <hi>Hugo Victorinus.</hi> Of the Protestant Interpreters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, <hi>Gesnerus,</hi> applieth it to the power of the Keyes, to be made use of according to that which is written <hi>Math.</hi> 18. <hi>Fabritius</hi> conceiveth the Text to comprehend <hi>castigationes spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuales,</hi> and he citeth <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Io.</hi> 20. 23. <hi>Heshusius</hi> cleareth it by the Instance of <hi>Theodosius excommunicated by Ambrose,</hi> Master <hi>Cotton</hi> in his <hi>Keyes of the Kingdom of heaven</hi> pag. 53. applyeth it to the Ecclesiasticall power of the Keyes. <hi>Bartholomaeus Coppen</hi> understands it of the spirituall rule and Kingdom of Christ, and makes it paralell to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>the weapons of our warrefare are not carnall but mighty through God, to the pulling downe of strong holds,</hi> vers. 6. <hi>and having in readinesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge all disobedience.</hi> This judiciary Ecclesiasticall power is to be executed upon all such of the nations as fall under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church according to the rule of Christ. And this honour have all his Saints, that their Ministers are armed with a power. They that follow this latter exposition will be easily induced to beleive that the binding and loosing <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 19. is also judiciall or juridicall: They that follow the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exposition, will also observe that the phrase of binding in Scripture, even where it is ascribed to the Church or Saints, is used in a judiciary sence, and therefore it is most sutable to the Scripture phrase to understand <hi>Mat.</hi> 18, 19. in that sence.</p>
               <p>As touching that other Exposition of the binding and loosing, that the object it is exercised about, is not a person, but a thing or Doctrine, for it is not said <hi>Whomsoever</hi> but <hi>whatsoever ye bind:</hi> It is sufficiently confuted by <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>much of that which hath been said already, proving a forensicall binding and loosing even of persons. Onely I shall adde these further considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. First, the binding and loosing are Acts of the power of the Keyes, and are exercised about the same object, about which the power of the Keyes is exercised <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 19. Now the power of the Keyes is exercised about persons, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is opened or shut to persons, not to Doctrines. If it be said that the Keyes are for opening and shutting, not for binding and loosing, to this I answer with <hi>Alexr. Alensis part</hi>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:95406:243"/>
4. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 20. <hi>Membr.</hi> 5. <hi>that these Keyes are as well for binding and loosing as for shutting and opening; but the Act of binding and loosing doth agree to the Keyes immediately and in respect of the subject; but the act of opening in reference to the last end. Ibid. Membr.</hi> 2. He had given this reason why the power of the Keyes is called the power of binding and loosing, <hi>because although to open and shut be the more proper Acts of the Keyes themselves, yet neverthelesse to loose and bind are the more proper Acts in reference to those who are to enter into the Kingdome, or to be excluded from the same; for the persons themselves which doe repent, are the subject of loosing: and they that repent not, of binding. Which is not so of opening and shutting; for although the opening be to those that are loosed, and the shutting to those that are bound; yet those that are loosed are not the subject of opening (as to the manner of speaking) nor those that are bound, the Subject of shutting.</hi> So then <hi>antecedently</hi> binding and loosing are Acts of the power of the Keyes, because a man is bound before he be shut up, and loosed before the door be opened to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Glosse which now I despute against, doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose one of these two things: either that binding and loosing cannot be exercised upon the same object at different times, and that the binding is such as can never be loosed againe; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that one and the same doctrine may be condemned at one time, and approved at another time. Both which are absurd, and contrary to the generality of Divines.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, seeing the Scripture speaketh of binding and loosing in reference to persons, as corporally, so spiritually, which I have before proved. Why then, shall persons be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from being the object of binding and loosing <hi>Matth.</hi> 18?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that of binding and loosing <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. doth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here with and is added by occasion of that which went before, as is also before proved. If this concerning the context be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, it will carry it to persons; for it was an offending bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not a false Doctrine, which was spoken of in the verses preceding.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, binding and loosing here doth at least reach as farre as retaining or remitting of sinnes <hi>Io.</hi> 20. 23. but there it is <hi>Whosoever sinnes ye remit, &amp;c.</hi> They whose sinnes are retained, are bound.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That <hi>1 Cor. 5.</hi> proveth Excommunication and (by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequence even from the Erastian Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) Suspension from the Sacrament of a person unexcommunicated.</head>
               <p>MAster <hi>Prynne</hi> in his first <hi>Quaere</hi> did aske whether that phrase 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>To deliver such a one to Sathan,</hi> be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly meant of excommunication or suspension from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely. This, he saith, I did in my Sermon wave with a rhetoricall preterition. I answer for the latter part of the <hi>Quaere,</hi> I know not the least ground, for who did ever expound it of suspension from the Sacrament onely? for the former part of it, its not necessary to be debated, therefore for husbanding time and not to multiply <hi>Questions</hi> unnecessarily, I said in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that the Question ought to be whether that Chapter (not whether that phrase) prove excommunication; and that we have a shorter way to prove excommunication from the last words of that Chapter as Doctor <hi>Moulin</hi> doth in his <hi>Vates lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. And if I should grant that delivering such a one to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than signifieth either of those things which Master <hi>Prynne</hi> conceiveth, that is, a bodily possession, torture, or vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Sathan, inflicted either by the apostolicall power of miracles, or by Gods immediate permission: yet that will not prove that it signifieth no more. Therefore <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> upon the place, thinks that the Apostles delivering of the man to Sathan by a miraculous act, and the Churches deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him to Sathan by Excommunication, doe very well stand together. So <hi>Synop. pur. Theol. disp.</hi> 48. <hi>Thes.</hi> 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:95406:244"/>
of both these expositions; and afterward in his common place of excommunication he speaketh of Gods cooperating with the Church censure, by punishing the Excommunicate person with diabolicall vexations. Sure I am an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate person may truly be said to be delivered to Sathan, who is the God and Prince of this world and reigneth in the Children of disobedience. But Master <hi>Prynne</hi> will find himself difficulted to prove that <hi>tradere Satanae</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. is onely meant of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous or extraordinary act, or to shew how or why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle requireth the Assembling of the Church and their consent to the working of a miracle. Which (if there were no more) may discover the weaknesse of Master <hi>Prynnes</hi> notions concerning delivering to Sathan 6, 7, 8. But as the full debate were long, so it were not necessary, since Master <hi>Prynne</hi> doth now himself acknowledge that the last verse of that Chapter proveth excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>vindic. pag.</hi> 2. I come therefore to the next, which he calls the fourth difference, whether 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>with such an one no not to eat,</hi> be properly meant of excommunication or suspension from the Sacrament. But (whatsoever be properly meant by that phrase) that which his debate driveth at, is, that this verse doth neither prove excommunication nor suspension from the Sacrament so much as by necessary consequence.</p>
               <p>But let us see whether his reasons can weaken the proof of Suspension from vers. 11. first he saith there is not one syllable of receiving or eating of the Lords Supper in this Chapter. I answer, the question is neither of syllables nor words but of things, and how will he prove that <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>Let us keep the feast, not with old leavon, &amp;c.</hi> is not applicable to the Lords Supper, I say not to it onely, yet surely it cannot be excluded, but must needs becomprehended as one part, yea, a principall part of the meaning, the better to answer the Analogy of the passeover, (there much insisted upon.) He may be pleased also to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he himself pag. 24. proving the passeover and the Lords Supper to be the same for the substance, for proof hereof citeth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. and that <hi>Aretius Theol probl. loc.</hi> 80. expoundeth our Feast of the Passeover 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. to be meant of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>But he further objecteth from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. <hi>We are all</hi>

                  <hi>partakers of that one Bread; if all were then partakers of this Bread, certainly none were excluded from it in the Church of Corinth; but at the Israelites under the Law, did all eat the same spirituall Meat, and all Drinke the same spirituall Drinke though God were displeased with many of them who were Idolaters, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, fornicators, murmurers, and were destroyed in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 1. to 12. <hi>so all under the Gospell who were visible members of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>he Church of Corinth, did eat and drink the Lords Supper to which some drunkards whiles drunken did then resort, as is clear by</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 20. 21. <hi>Which Paul indeed reprehends</hi> vers. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 When <hi>Paul saith, we being many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread,</hi> he speaketh of the communion of Saints, &amp; the word <hi>all</hi> can be of no larger extent then visible Saints, to whom the Epistle is directed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. and cannot be applyed to visible workers of iniquity, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue impenitent and obstinate in so doing. As we may joyn in communion with a visible Church, which hath the externall markes of a Church, though it be not a true invisible Church; so we joyne with visible Saints to become one body with them in externall Church communion and to be partakers of one bread with them, though they be not true or invisible Saints in the hid man of the heart. But if these be visibly no Church, we cannot joyne in Church Communion; and if a man be visibly no Saint, he ought not to be admitted to the communion of Saints. I shall never be perswaded, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> would say of himselfe and the Saints at <hi>Corinth, We are one body with known Idolaters, Fornicators, Drunkards and the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 If all in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> (none excluded) even drunkards whiles drunken, and if all under the Gospell who are visible members of the Church ought to be admitted to eat the same spirituall meat and drinke the same spirituall drink at the Lords Table, as he supposeth that in the wildernesse all the Israelites did the like, who were Idolaters, Fornicators, &amp;c. Then I beseech you observe how Master <hi>Prynne</hi> doth by all this overthrow his owne rules; for pag. 2. and elsewhere he tells us he would have notorious scandalous sinners who after admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion persevere in their iniquities without remorse of conscience or amendment to be excommunicated from the Church and
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:95406:245"/>
from the society of the faithfull in all publike Ordinances? If both in the Church of Israel and in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> all were admitted and none excluded, even those who were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or drunkards, whiles actually such without repentance or amendment; how can Master <hi>Prynne</hi> straiten Christians, now more then <hi>Moses</hi> did the Jewes, or <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Corinthians?</hi> Since therefore his Arguments drive at it, its best he should speak it out, that all manner of persons who professe themselves to be Christians, be they never so scandalous, never so obstinate, though they persevere in their iniquity after admonition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out amendment, yet ought to be admitted to the Lords Table.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He shall never be able to prove either that those drunken persons 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 21. were drunken when they did resort to the Church, (for it was in the Church and in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, that they made themselves drunke) nor yet that the Idolaters and Fornic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tors in the wildernesse their eating of the spirituall meat and drinking of the spirituall drinke mentioned by the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. was after their Idolat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: But of this latter, I have elsewhere spoken distinctly and by it self.</p>
               <p n="4">4 To say that all who were visible members of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were admitted, and none excluded, and to say it with a <hi>certainly</hi> is to make too bold with Scripture. And the contrary will sooner be proved from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of Devills: ye cannot be partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Lords Table and of the Table of Devills.</hi> So much for his first exception.</p>
               <p>His second is concerning persons (but not to the purpose) that if we looke upon the catalogue of those with whom we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to eat, not onely shall most of the Anabaptisticall and Independent Congregations, but too many Presbyterian mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Elders, who are most foreward to excommunicate others for Idolatry, Fornication, Drunkennesse, must first be excommunicated themselves for their owne covetousnesse. <hi>Answ.</hi> Let it light where it may, Ministers doe not stand nor fall to his Judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but where just proof can fasten either covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or any other scandalous sinne upon them, its all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

in the world they be censured with the first. If I had fallen upon this passage of his book without knowing the author, I had presently imagined it to be a peece from <hi>Oxford,</hi> it calls to my thoughts so many expressions in Pamphlets from thence, aspersing <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> as more full of covetousnesse, lying, hypocrisie, then <hi>Oxford</hi> of bloody Oathes, Masses and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is as clear as the noone day sunne, that, no not to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> doth plainly intimate that the Apostle argueth from the lesse to the greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that there is some other fellowship and company with such a one, which is more than eating together and so much lesse permitted: and what is that? (eating together being as Master <hi>Prynne</hi> saith one of the highest expressions of outward friendship and familiarity.) Must it not be communion in the holy things, and especially the receiving such a one to the Lords Table? as if he had said, If scandalous brethren be spots in your common, how much more in your sacred Feasts? for which cause the mixture of scandalous persons in Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship is extreamly blamed 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Iude v.</hi> 12. Put case that a Parliament man or a Divine of the Assembly were known (as God forbid) to be an Incendiary, an active malignant, a traytor, a blasphemer, so that no raher Parliament man or Member of the Assembly would eat or company with him, were it not strange, if for all that such a one should be permitted to sit in Parliament or in Assembly? Is it not as strange if the whole Church distributively shall not so much as eat with a scandalous person, and yet the whole Church Collectively shall eat with him, in that very action which is a symbole of the communion of Saints? So that if I should now admit that sence, that these
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:95406:246"/>
words <hi>no not to eat,</hi> amount to no more then <hi>not to keep company, or hold civill familiarity with such,</hi> (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi> expresseth it) yet the Argument will stand firme and strong in regard of this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequence. If a private Christian ought not to hold so much as civill fellowship with a scandalous brother not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, much lesse ought the Church to admit him to Church communion in all publike Ordinances; (there being lesse latitude, &amp; the rule much stricter in this Communion than in private civill fellowship,) &amp; if we be forbidden to do so much as to eat with such a one at a common meal, <hi>quanto magis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victu sacro</hi> saith <hi>Pareus</hi> upon the place, how much more is the Church forbidden to receive him to the Lords Table? for if the end of avoiding private company with such a one be to make him ashamed, as the Erastians themselves doe confesse from 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 14. were it not contrary to that end to countenance and embolden him by receiving him to publike Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion at the Lords Table? Surely the refusing of the private could not so much put him to shame, as the admission to the publike should put respects upon him. Wherefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. as it is interpreted by Master <hi>Prynne</hi> proveth by a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence the Suspension from the Sacrament of a scandalous Church-Member not excommunicated.</p>
               <p>If his next reason help him not, surely his sun will go down at noon, He citeth some paralell Texts, which interpret <hi>not to eat</hi> here, of avoiding them, turning away from and rejecting them, &amp;c. which are no judiciall acts of the Presbytery, but morall or prudentiall acts of particular Christians. <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a judiciall Presbyteriall act, (as very many conceive) in some of those paralell Texts cited by him 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. and so his proof is no lesse questionable, then the thing he would prove by it. And here the Apostle intendeth more then a voluntary prudentiall withdrawing of particular Christians, even a judiciall act, in the very next words, <hi>What have I to doe to judge them also that are without? doe not ye judge them that are within?</hi> where he gives the reason of what he had said before, that he had written to them not to be mixed with scandalous brethren, permitting them to keep company with Pagans though guity of the same faults. The reason, because Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censures
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:95406:246"/>
are onely for those that are Church-members not for aliens.</p>
               <p>After M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> hath put forth his strength to prove that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication or Suspension from the Sacrament is not meant 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. he comes in the next place to answer the argument drawn by consequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If we may not so much as eate with such a one at our owne Tables, farre lesse at the Lords Table. Whereunto his answer is, The argument is fallacions, saith he, <hi>because it varieth in the kinde of eating, the one being civill, the other spirituall; the one private in ones owne house, or anothers, where he hath absolute freedome or liberty to eate or not to eate with another, the other publike in the Church, &amp;c.</hi> But all this (say I) maketh our argument the stronger; for if it be sinne to a private man to eate in his owne house with a scandalous brother, though this be but a civill fellowship in which there is more liberty and lesse latitude than in religious fellowship; how much more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is it for Church-officers to admit such a one to Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eating with the Church?</p>
               <p>And for that first rule of his, that arguments from the lesse t the greater are not conclusive, except in the same kind of action, its utterly untrue. For the holy Scripture it selfe hath divers arguments from the lesse to the greater, where the kind is no lesse different, if not more, than private civill eating together is from publique eating together at the Table of the Lord, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 14. If <hi>Miriams</hi> father had spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven daies? how much more when God hath smitten her with leprosie for speaking against his servant <hi>Moses?

               </p>
               <p>His second exception is, that <hi>they fall not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

Its a sinne to reproach a mans name, how much more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Gods Name? These doe not fall under the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:95406:247"/>
precept? shall such arguments be therefore inconcludent? Whence comes all this new logick which the world never knew before?</p>
               <p>His third condition (let it be remembred he saith, if either of these three conditions faile, the argument is inconseqent) is, that it must be within the compasse of the same power. If it be so, how shall that hold universally true? <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>w much better is it to get wisdome then Gold? and to get understanding rather to be chosen then Silver?</hi> By M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> rule it must onely hold true in this case, when it fals within the compasse of the same power to get both Wisdome and Gold? However if he had apprehended out argument aright, he had perceived that the Iesser thing, and the greater thing are both within the compasse of the same power. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ought not to eate with such a one at common Tables: therefore not at the Lords Table. For this refusing to eate with such a one at common Tables, was by vertue of a judiciall Ecclesiasticall sentence passed against the scandalous person. So that when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> saith <hi>We have free power not to eate Bread with those at our own Tables, with whom we have no power or liberty left us by Christ, to refuse to eate with them at the Lords Table,</hi> and thereupon supposeth that our argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from that Text is one principall cause and prop of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, yea of separation, not onely from Sacraments, but from Churches: he doth altogether misapprehend the businesse. For 1. Separation from Churches is properly a renouncing of membership as unlawfull: our argument concerneth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse of a particular act, not of a membership in such a Church. 2. The causes and motives of separation suppose either an unlawfull constitution of Churches, or an unlawfull govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Churches, or both, so farre, that they who separate hold it unlawfnll to continue their membership in Churches so constituted and governed, or so much as to communicate and partake in the Sacrament with such Churches, though they know no scandalous person admitted to the Sacrament. 3. The great mistake lieth in this, that our present controversie is apprehended to be whether every particular Christian hath power or liberty from Christ to withdraw from the Sacrament, because of the admission of a scandalous person. Whereas our
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:95406:247"/>
Question is onely of the Churches power to suspend a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous person from the Sacrament, and when the Apostle vers. 9. 10, 11. forbiddeth to be mixed or so much as to eate with such and such scandalous members of the Church, he meaneth of Church-discipline and Excommunication, which he had begun to speak of, and so he comes to shew them what kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<note n="c" place="margin">

And long before all these <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> plainly expound the Apostles words of a publique Ecclesiasticall Judgement, past upon one who hath either confessed his offence or is formally accused and convict thereof; and as they conceive, that Text doth not at all justifie but doth rather condemne private Christians their separating from the Church, because of a mixture of scandalons persons. I know we ought prudently and cautiously to endeavour the avoyding of the company and fellowship of scandalous bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though not yet censured in the Church, (which may be proved from other Scriptures) but that is not the point the Apostle is here upon: he meanes by <hi>no not to eate</hi> synecdochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, the whole casting off of an excommunicate person, and all that separation or withdrawing which is commanded to be made from him, or if you will (by a metonimy of the effect for the cause) he meanes excommunication it selfe: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the words immediately following prove that a publique judiciall act is intended as hath been said before.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The Apostle upon occasion of that offenders case, puts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in remembrance, that they ought likewise to purge the Church from the mixture of other scandalous sinners, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11, 12. The Chapter both begins and ends with
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:95406:249"/>
the case of the incestuous man and his punishment; which makes interpreters conceive, that what is enterlaced concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning other scandalous sinners in the Church, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of such as the Apostle would have to be censured in the same manner as that incestuous man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He instanceth in six cases, (not intending an enumeration of all the particular cases of Excommunication) fornication, covetousnesse, (meaning covetousnesse scandalously and grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifested, or practicall covetousnesse, for of the heart God onely judgeth) idolatry, railing, drunkennesse, extortion. His instancing in these, tels us he intends not the case of private civill injuries, but of scandals, yea though the scandall be without the mixture of any civill or private injury, as in the case of an Idolater or a drunkard.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And even where there is a private injury wrapt up in the bosome of the scandall, as in railing and extortion, yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle there looketh upon them not <hi>qua</hi> injuries, but <hi>qua</hi> scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals; and in that notion, he will have not onely the party par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly interrested and injured, but the other members of the Church also to withdraw communion from the offender; for he writeth to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> not to keepe company with such.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When he saith, <hi>with such a one no not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ate,</hi> he intimates by <hi>No not</hi> some further and greater punishment than not eating with him, as hath been said before: If not so much as eating with him, then muchlesse Church communion with him at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He meanes not of that withdrawing whereby each Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may and ought to withdraw familiarity and fellowship from such a notorious scandalous sinner, whose sinne is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest before hand, that he may keep himselfe pure, and not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of another mans sinne: In which case a member of one Church may withdraw familiar conversing with a scandalous member of another Church. But he speakes of such a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from and avoyding of the fellowship of a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Brother, as is done not by one or some few private Christians, but by the whole Church (for hee writeth to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> not to company nor eate
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:95406:249"/>
with such a one) I say, by the whole Church, whereof the offender was a member: and that not without a judiciall or consistoriall sentence, vers. 12. <hi>Doe not ye judge them that are within?</hi> which can not be restricted to the judgement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian discretion and prudence (for so both the Apostles and they did judge those that were without, to walke circumspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward them, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 5. and to beware of their evill.) But tis meant of censures and punishments inflicted by many, that is, by the Presbyters of that Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And so I have touched upon the last consideration, which is this. That as the fault was a scandall given to the Church, and the judgement and censure was Ecclesiasticall, not civill, so that censure for that offence was inflicted onely upon Church members, not upon unbelievers. If an unbeliever did a civill injury to a Christian, the Christian was free to accuse the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer (if he saw it good) before the civill Magistrate, and there to seeke judgement and justice. Or the Christian was free to withdraw civill fellowship from the unbeliever, which did him a civill injury, which I suppose M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> will easily grant. But this way of censuring and punishing a scandalous Church member, did not agree to an Heathen who was an Idolater, or drunkard, or extortioner, &amp;c. Vers. 10, 11, 12, 13. Thus I have proved Church censure from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. compared with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. without laying the weight of any argument upon <hi>Tradere Sathanae.</hi> Which I would not have to be understood, as if I yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our opposites, that the delivering to Satan is not meant of Excommunication. My meaning is onely to make the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worke of the Erastian <hi>Antithesis.</hi> The weight of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not of ours, is laid upon <hi>Tradere Sathanae.</hi> But for my sence of the word, I am of their opinion who interpret it of Excommunication; and so doth <hi>Gualther</hi> himselfe. So doth the Syriack, which readeth, <hi>That you</hi> (Corinthians) <hi>may deliver such a one to Satan.</hi> If it was an an act of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> then it was a Church censure, not a miracle. The Greeke doth also carry it to be an act of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> assembled together.

               <p>I begin with the matter of fact, whether <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as well as the other Apostles, which is the question by him stated. For decision whereof, I hold it necessary, first of all that these two things be premised, concerning the harmony of the Evangelists in that matter of <hi>Iudas,</hi> the use whereof we shall see afterwards. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> tell us Christs discourse of the Traytor at Table, and the discovery of <hi>Iudas,</hi> before the institution of the Sacrament. <hi>Luke</hi> hath the same thing after the institution and distribution of the Sacrament. So that either <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> speak by anticipation, or <hi>Luke</hi> speaketh by a recapitulation; that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> put before what was done after, or
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:95406:250"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> puts after what was done before. Now that there is in <hi>Luke</hi> an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a narration of that after the institution which was indeed before the institution of the Sacrament, may thus appeare. 1. That very thing which <hi>Luke</hi> placeth after the institution and distribution of the Sacrament, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the Table. And truly the sonne of man goeth as it was determined, but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed. And they began to enquire among themselves which of them it was that should doe this thing.</hi> The very same thing doe <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> record before the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 21. to 26. <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 18. to 22. and it is more credible that one of the Evangelists is to be reduced to the order of two, rather than two to the order of one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Especially considering that <hi>Luke</hi> doth not relate the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the last supper according to that order wherein things were acted or spoken, as is manifest by <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 17. 18. <hi>And he tooke the cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your selves.</hi> This though related before the taking and breaking of the bread, yet it is but by an anticipation or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupation, occasioned by that which had preceded vers. 16. so to joyne the protestation of not drinking againe, with that of not eating againe the Passeover with his Disciples: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Beza, Salmeron, Maldonat,</hi> and others following <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Euthymius</hi> doe resolve it is an anticipation, even as <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth the cup before the bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>I</hi> know some understand the cup mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 17. to be the Paschall cup; others, to be the cup in the ordinary supper; but to me its plaine that it was the Eucharisticall cup; yea M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> takes it so pag. 25. because that which <hi>Luke</hi> saith of that cup, that Christ tooke it, and gave thankes, and gave it to the Disciples, that they might all drinke of it, and told them he would not drinke with them any more of the fruit of the Vine till the Kingdome of God should come; all this is the very same which <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> record of the Eucharisticall cup. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Non-conformists were wont to argue from that place, that the Minister ought not to give the Sacramentall elements to each communicant out of his owne hand, but that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ought to divide the elements among themselves, because Christ saith in that place, of the cup, <hi>Divide it among your selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Luke</hi> saith not that after Supper, or after they had done with the Sacrament, Christ told his Disciples that one of them should betray him; onely he addeth, after the History of the Sacrament, what Chrst said concerning the Traytor.

with such as think <hi>Iudas</hi> did eate of the Paschalll Supper, and that Christs words concerning him were spoken at the Paschall Supper, which I greatly doubt of.</p>
               <p n="5">5. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> pag. 18. doth in effect grant the same thing that I say; for he saith, <hi>that Matthew and Marke record that immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the institution of the Sacrament, as they sate at meat Jesus said unto the twelve, Verily one of you shall betray me, whereupon they began to be sorrowfull and to say unto him, &amp;c.</hi> He addeth, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was <hi>the last man that said, Is it I? immediately before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> as <hi>Matthew records.</hi> But of <hi>Luke</hi> he saith onely thus much, that he <hi>placeth these words of Christ concerning Judas his betraying him, after the institution and distribution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not before it.</hi> If it be thus as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> acknowledgeth, that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> record, that Christ had that discourse concerning <hi>Iudas</hi> before the institution of the Sacrament, then most certainly it was before the institution of the Sacrament, because it must needs be true which <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> say. Whence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t will necessarily follow that <hi>Luke</hi> doth not mention that discourse concerning <hi>Iudas</hi> in its proper place, and this doth not offer the least violence to the Text in <hi>Luke,</hi> because he doth not say that Christ spake these words after the Sacrament, onely he placeth these words after the Sacrament, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> saith rightly. When Scripture saith that such a thing was done at such a time, it must be so believed. But when Scripture mentioneth one thing after another, that will not prove that the thing last mentioned was last done. More plainly Master <hi>Prynne</hi> pag. 26, 27. tels us that the Sacrament was given after Christ had particularly informed his Disciples that one of them should betray him, which he proves from <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 18. to 28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 20. to 36. <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 18. to 22. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 21, 22, 23. Whence it follows inevitably by his owne confession, that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> recording that discourse about <hi>Iudas</hi> after the Sacrament, doe place it in the proper order; and that <hi>Luke</hi> mentioning that discourse about <hi>Iudas</hi> after the Sacrament, doth not place it in its owne place. This is the first thing which I thought good to premise, which will easily take off the strongest argument which ever I heard alledged for <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving of the Sacrament, namely this, that <hi>Luke</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:95406:252"/>
after the institution and distribution of the Sacrament addeth, <hi>But behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me at the Table.</hi> If these words were not uttered by Christ in that order wherein <hi>Luke</hi> placeth them (which I have proved) then the argument is not conclusive.</p>
               <p>The second thing to be premised, is this: that the story which we have <hi>Ioh</hi> 13. from the beginning to verse 31. concerning the Supper at which Christ discoursed of <hi>Iudas</hi> and gave him the sop, after which he went immediately out, was neither in <hi>Bethany</hi> two daies before the Passeover, as the <hi>Antidote Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adverted</hi> tels us pag 5. nor yet after the institution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> tels us, <hi>Vindic.</hi> pag. 25. herein differing either from himselfe or his friend. That Supper in <hi>Bethany,</hi> the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet saith, was two daies before the Passeover; but some Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters collect from <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 1, 2. it was longer before; Christ having come to <hi>Bethany</hi> six daies before, and after that Supper the next day Christ did ride into <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on a young Asse, and the people cried <hi>Hosanna, Joh.</hi> 12. 12. the very story which we have <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>Marke</hi> saith that two daies before the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the chiefe Priests and Scribes sought how to put Christ to death, but he doth not say that the Supper in <hi>Bethany</hi> was two daies before the Passeover. But of this I will not contend, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, it is not much materiall to the present question, there was nothing at that Supper concerning <hi>Iudas,</hi> but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking of him for having indignation at the spending of the Alabaster box of Oyntment, and from that he sought oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to betray Christ: But the discourse between Christ and his Apostles concerning one of them that should betray him, and their asking him one by one <hi>Is it I?</hi> was in the very night of the Passeover, as is cleare <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 19, 20, to 26. <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 16, to 22. So that the story <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 18. to 30. being the same with that in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> could not be two daies before the Passeover. And if two daies before Christ had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to <hi>Iohn</hi> who should betray him, by giving the sop to <hi>Iudas,</hi> how could every one of the Disciples (and so <hi>Iohn</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest) be ignorant of it two daies after, which made every one of them to aske <hi>Is it I?</hi> Finally, that very night in which the Lord Jesus did institue the Sacrament, the Disciples
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:95406:252"/>
began to be sorrowfull, and began to enquire which of them it was that should betray him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 22. <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 23. But if Christ had told them two daies before that one of themselves who did sit at Table with him should betray him, surely they had at that time begun to be sorrowfull and to aske every one <hi>Is it I?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which hath been said doth also discover that other mistake that the discourse at Table concerning the Traytor, and the giving of the sop to <hi>Iudas Ioh.</hi> 13. was after the institution of the Sacrament. If it were after, then either that in <hi>Iohn</hi> is not the same with the discourse concerning the Traytor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke;</hi> or otherwise <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> speake by anticipation. But I have proved both that the true order is in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> and that the discourse concerning the Traytor mentioned by <hi>Iohn</hi> must be in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall harmony put together with that in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> as making one and the same story. And if this in <hi>Iohn</hi> had been posterior to that in <hi>Matthew,</hi> then why doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> himselfe joyn these together as one, pag. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>These things premised, I come to the arguments which prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>The first argument (which was by me touched in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon so much quarrelled by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi>) is this. It is said of <hi>Iudas, Ioh.</hi> 13. 30. <hi>He then having received the sop went immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out.</hi> But this sop or morsell was given him before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiles they were yet eating the other Supper, at the end whereof Christ did institute the Sacrament. Therefore <hi>Iudas</hi> went away before the Sacrament. Let us heare M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> four answers to this argument, pag. 24, 25. First, saith he, <hi>Iudas</hi> went not out till after Supper, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 2. <hi>and Supper being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp;c.</hi> Answ. <gap reason="foreign">

The Centurists <hi>Gent.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. explaine <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 2. thus, <hi>Magnâ caenae hujus parte peractâ, A great part of this Supper being done;</hi> yea the Greek may be as well turned thus, <hi>When they were at Supper,</hi> as the late English Annotations have it. <hi>Ludovicus de Dieu</hi> chooseth this sence. <hi>Salmeron</hi> and others proue it from verse 4. <hi>He riseth from Supper,</hi> with vers. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

he sate down againe to Supper, and dipped the sop. Take but two like instances in this same story of the passion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Now when the even was come,</hi> not, <hi>when the even was ended.</hi> His second answer, that all the other three Evangelists prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> was present at the Sacrament, is but <hi>petitio principii.</hi> Thirdly (saith he) the Sacrament was not instituted after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but as they sat at Supper. <hi>Answ.</hi> It was indeed instituted while they were sitting at supper, or before they rose from supper, so that they were still continuing in a Table gesture; yet the actions must needs be distinguished, for they did not at the same instant receive the Sacrament, and eate of another supper too. And though it be said of the bread, that <hi>as they did eate, Jesus tooke bread,</hi> yet of the cup <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> say, that Jesus tooke it <hi>after Supper,</hi> that is, after they had done eating; therefore certainly after <hi>Iudas</hi> got the sop and went away, at which instant they had not done eating. Neither is there any ground at all <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 17. to prove that he tooke the cup during supper, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

He saith that Christ did indeed give the Sacrament after supper, and that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did also take it after supper: but that the Scripture hath not tied us to follow these examples, but left us at liberty. And upon this ground he defendeth the Churches custome at that time of taking the Sacrament fasting, for greater reverence to the Ordinance. But in this he speakes plainly, <note n="h" place="margin">Cum sero factum esset, recumbebat cum duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cim, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducantibus ois dixit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam unus ex vobis me tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det.

With <hi>Augustines</hi> judgement agreeth that Epistle of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> where answering an objection which had been made against him, that he had given the Sacrament to some that were not fasting, he denieth the fact, but addeth, if he had done so, it had been no sinne, because Christ gave the Sacrament to the Apostles after they had supped. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:95406:254"/>I conclude therefore that when <hi>Luke</hi> saith <hi>after supper he took the cup,</hi> the meaning is, after both paschall and common supper, and that there was no other eating after the Sacrament that night, and so consequently the giving of the sop to <hi>Iudas</hi> must needs be before the Sacrament; and his going out imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the sop proves that he did not receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> gives us a fourth answer, which is the last (but a very weake) refuge. The word <hi>immediately,</hi> saith he, <hi>many times in our common speech signifieth soon after, or not long after, as we usually say we will doe this or that immediately, instantly, presently, whenas we mean onely speedily, within a short time. Answ.</hi> 1. This is no good report which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> brings upon the English tongue, that men promise to doe a thing <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,</hi> when they do not mean to doe it <hi>immediately.</hi> I hope every conscientious man will be loath to say <hi>immediately,</hi> except when he meanes <hi>immediately,</hi> (for I know not how to explaine <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,</hi> but by <hi>immediately</hi>) and for an usuall forme of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which is not according to the rule of the word, its a very bad commentary to the language of the holy Ghost. 2. And if that forme of speech be usuall in making of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet I have never known it usuall in writing of Histories, to say that such a thing was done <hi>immediately</hi> after such a thing, and yet divers other things intervened between them. If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Iudas</hi> his getting of the sop and his going out did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veene the instituting of the Sacrament, the taking, blessing, breaking, distributing, and eating of the bread, also the taking and giving of the cup, and their dividing it among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and drinking all of it; how can it then be a true nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that <hi>Iudas</hi> went out immediately after his receiving of the sop. 3. Neither is it likely that Satan would suffer <hi>Iudas</hi> to stay any space after he was once discovered, lest the company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conference of Christ and his Apostles should take him off from his wicked purpose. 4. <hi>Gerard</hi> having in his common places given that answer, that the word <hi>immediately</hi> may suffer this sence, that shortly thereafter <hi>Iudas</hi> went forth; he doth professedly recall that answer in his Cotinuation of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <hi>cap.</hi> 171. p. 453. and that upon this ground, because
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:95406:255"/>
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> being mightily irritated and exasperated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both by the sop, and by Christs answer, (for when <hi>Iudas</hi> asked <hi>Is it I?</hi> Christ answered <hi>Thou hast said</hi>) would certainly breake away abruptly and very immediately. So much of the first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The second argument (which I also touched in my Sermon) was this. As Christ said to the Communicants, <hi>Drinke ye all of it, Matth.</hi> 26. 27. <hi>and they all dranke, Matth.</hi> 14. 23. so he saith to them all, <hi>This is my Body which is broken for you, This is the cup of the new covenant in my Blood, which is shed for you, Luke</hi> 22. 19. 20. But if <hi>Iudas</hi> had been one of the communicants, it is not credible that Christ would have said so in reference to him, as well as to the other Apostles. This argument M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> p. 25. doth quite mistake, as if the strength of it lay in a supposed particular application of the words of the institution to each communicant, which I never meant, but dislike it as much as he: The words were directed to all, in the plurall. <hi>This is my Body broken for you, &amp;c. my Blood shed for you, &amp;c.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> conceives that it might have been said to <hi>Iudas,</hi> being meant by Christ, <hi>onely conditionally, that his Body was broken, and his Blood was shed for him, if he would really receive them by faith. Jonas Schlich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingius a</hi> Socinian in his booke against <hi>Meisnerus</hi> pag. 803. though he supposeth as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> doth that <hi>Iudas</hi> was present at the giving of the Sacrament, yet he holds that it is not to be imagined, that Christ would have said to <hi>Iudas,</hi> that his body was broken for him. And shall we then who believe that the death of Jesus Christ was a satisfaction to the justice of God for sinne (which the Socini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> believe not) admit that Christ meant to comprehend <hi>Iudas</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mong others, when he said <hi>this is my body which is broken for you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ministers doe indeed offer Christ to all upon condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, being commanded to preach the Gospell to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not knowing who are reprobates: but that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe (knowing that the sonne of perdition was now lost, that the Scripture might be fulfilled <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 12.) would in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (which is more applicative then the word, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularizeth the promises to the receivers) so speake, as that in any sence those words might be applied to <hi>Iudas,</hi> that even for
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:95406:255"/>
him his body was broken and his blood shed; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the seales should be given him, to me is not at all credible; and I prove the negative by foure arguments: (though I might give many more) 1. If Christ did in reference to <hi>Iudas</hi> meane conditionally that his body was broken, and his blood shed for him, if he would believe (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> holds) then he meant conditionally to save the sonne of perdition whom he knew infallibly to be lost, and that he should be certainly damned and goe to Hell, and that in eating the Sacrament he would certainly eate and drinke judgement to himselfe (all which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> himselfe pag. 26. saith Christ infallibly knew) But who dare thinke or say so of Jesus Christ? Suppose a Minister knew infallibly that such a one hath blasphemed against the holy Ghost, (which sinne the Centurists and others thinke to have been committed by <hi>Iudas,</hi> which could not be hid from Christ) and is irrecoverably lost, and will be most certainly damned, durst that Minister admit that person to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make those words applicable to him so much as conditionally; <hi>This is the Lords body broken for you: This is the blood of the new Covenant shed for you unto remission of sinne?</hi> How much lesse would Christ himselfe say so, or mean so in reference to <hi>Iudas?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If Christ would not pray for <hi>Iudas,</hi> but for his elect Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles onely, and such as should believe through the word of the Gospell, then he meant not so much as conditionally to give his body and blood for <hi>Iudas.</hi> (for if he meant any good to <hi>Iudas,</hi> so much as conditionally, he would not have excluded him from having any part at all in his prayers to God.) But Christ doth exclude <hi>Iudas</hi> from his prayer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. not onely as one of the reprobate world vers. 9. but even by name vers. 12. giving him over for lost, and one that was not to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Love and hatred in God and in his sonne Jesus Christ, being eternall and unchangeable, (for <hi>actus Dei immanentes sunt aeterni</hi>) it followeth that if there was such a decree of God, or any such meaning or intention in Christ, as to give his body and blood for <hi>Iudas,</hi> whom he knew infallibly to be lost: and since that same conditionall meaning or intention could
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95406:256"/>
not be without a conditionall love of God and of Christ to <hi>Iudas</hi> and his salvation: this love doth still continue in God, and in Christ, to save <hi>Iudas</hi> now in Hell upon condition of his believing, which every Christian I thinke will abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That conditionall love and conditionall intention or meaning, could not have place in the Sonne of God. For as <hi>Spanhemius</hi> doth rightly argue in his late learned Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations <hi>de gratia universali</hi> pag. 746. it doth not become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wisdome or goodnesse of God to will and intend a thing upon such a condition as neither is nor can be. And pag. 829. he saith, that this conditionall destination or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be conceived, as being incident onely to such as doe neither foreknow nor direct and order the event, and in whose hand it is not to give the faculty and will of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the thing. Which can not without impiety be thought or said of God. Thus he.</p>
               <p>The third argument (which I shall now adde) is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Hilarius Can.</hi> 30. <hi>in Matth.</hi> and <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de mysterio miss. cap.</hi> 13. prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> received not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither was present at the receiving of it. Because that night while <hi>Iudas</hi> was present, Christ in his gracious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable expressions to his Apostles did make an exception, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 10, 11. <hi>Ye are cleane, but not all. For he knew who should betray him, therefore said he, ye are not all cleane,</hi> vers. 18. <hi>I speak not of you all, I know whom I have chosen.</hi> So vers. 21. even as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Joh. 6. 70. <hi>Have not I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a divell.</hi> But at the Sacrament all his sweet and gracious spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are without any such exception, <hi>This is my body which is given for you, &amp;c.</hi> Yea he saith positively of all the Apostles to whom he gave the Sacrament, <hi>I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the Vine, untill that day when I drinke it new with you in my Fathers Kingdome, Matth.</hi> 26. 29. and this he saith nnto them all, as it is cleare from vers. 27. <hi>Drinke ye all of it.</hi> Againe, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 28, 29, 30. <hi>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptatoons. And I appoint unto you a Kingdome as my Father hath appointed unto me. That ye may eate and drinke at my Table in my Kingdome, and sit on Thrones judging the twelve Tribes</hi>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:95406:256"/>
                  <hi>of Israel.</hi> Would not Christ much more have excepted <hi>Iudas</hi> in these expressions, if he had been present, seeing he had so often excepted him before?</p>
               <p>As for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> reasons from Scripture to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive the Sacrament, they are extreamely inconcludent. First, he saith, that <hi>Matthew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> are all expresse <hi>in terminis,</hi> that Christ sate down to eate the Passeover, and the twelve Apostles with him; that <hi>Iudas</hi> was one of those twelv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and present at the Table; that as they sate at meat together, Jesus tooke Bread, &amp;c. that he said of the cup, drinke ye all of it; and <hi>Marke</hi> saith they all dranke of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The three Evangelists are all expresse <hi>in terminis,</hi> that when Even was come, Christ sate down with the twelve; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that the twelve did eate with him that night; but that the twelve Apostles were with him in the eating of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they are not expresse <hi>in terminis,</hi> and I have some reasons which move me to thinke that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not eate so much as of the Passeover that night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof in the proper place. 2. And if he had been at the Passeover, that proves not he was at the Lords Supper. When Christ tooke the cup and said, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> it was after supper, that is, after the Paschall supper, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> himselfe gives the sence. 3. When <hi>Marke</hi> saith, <hi>They all dranke of it,</hi> he means all that were present, but <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone forth. His argument supposeth that <hi>Iudas</hi> was present, which being before disproved, there remaines no more strength nor life in his argument.</p>
               <p>That which he addeth pag. 18, 19. if it have either strength or good sence, I confesse the dulnesse of my conception. He would prove from <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> that immediately before the institution of the Sacrament, Christ told his Disciples that one of them should betray him, and they all asked <hi>Is it I?</hi> and that therefore certainly the Sacrament was given to <hi>Iudas,</hi> because he was the last man that said <hi>Is it I?</hi> immediately before the institution. And further (saith he) <hi>Luke</hi> placeth these words of Christ concerning <hi>Iudas</hi> his betraying of him, after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, which manifesteth that <hi>Iudas</hi> was present at the Sacrament. His inference is this, that seeing <hi>Iohn</hi> averreth, Chap. 13. v. 2. that all this discourse, and the giving of the sop to
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:95406:257"/>
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> was after supper, and the other three Evangelists agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Christ instituted and distributed the Sacrament, as they did eate, before supper quite ended, it must follow that <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. But how doth this hang together, first to argue that <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Sacrament, because Christs discourse concerning <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> his question <hi>Is it I?</hi> were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the institution of the Sacrament: and againe to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive the Sacrament, because Christs discourse about <hi>Iudas</hi> was after supper ended, and after the Sacrament which was instituted before supper ended? the one way of arguing destroyeth the other. 2. For that in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> that Christ discoursed of the Traytor, and that <hi>Iudas</hi> said <hi>Is it I?</hi> before the institution of the Sacrament, I confesse; but that it was immediately before the institution of the Sacrament the Evangelists doe not say, neither doth he prove it. <hi>Iudas</hi> went out after that discourse and the sop, and how much of the consolatory and valedictory Sermon (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 31.) was spent before the distribution of the Sacrament, who is so wise as to know? 3. For that in <hi>Luke,</hi> I have proved that though he sets down the things, yet not in that order wherein they were done: which is also the opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi> upon that place. And for that <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Supper being ended,</hi> I have answered before.</p>
               <p>Shall we in the next place have a heape of humane testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies concerning <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving of the Sacrament? I see so much light from Scripture to the contrary, that I shall not be easily shaken with the authority of men: yet it shall not be amisse a little to trie whether it be altogether so as he would make us believe. He saith we goe <hi>against all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> pag. 18. and against the most and best of Protestant writers, pag. 23. yea, that all ages have received it as an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable verity that <hi>Iudis</hi> received the Sacrament, pag. 19. No Sir, soft a little. The truth is the thing hath been very much controverted both among the Fathers, and among Papists, and among Protestant writers. I have found none so unanimous for <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving of the Sacrament as the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Adde hereunto the Testimony of <hi>Georgius Pachymeres,</hi> who lived in the thirteenth Century: in his Paraphrase upon that same place of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> he saith that Christ himselfe the author and institutor of this Sacrament, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Christ <hi>doth cast out and separate or excommunicate most justly Judas, who bad not holily supped together with him.

               </p>
               <p>By the mysteries which <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Pachimeres</hi> speake of, and which they say Christ gave to his Disciples, after <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone forth., I can understand nothing, but the Eucharisticall supper, the Elements whereof are very frequently called <hi>the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi> by the ancients, as hath been said. And if any man shall understand by these mysteries the inward graces or things signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Lords Supper, then what senoe can there be in that which <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Pachimeres</hi> say? for Christ could as easily keepe backe from <hi>Iudas,</hi> and give to his other Disciples, those graces and operations of his Spirit, when <hi>Iudas</hi> was present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as when he was cast out. So that it could not be said that Christ did cast out <hi>Iudas</hi> in order to the restraining from him, and giving to the other Disciples, the invisible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace signified in the Sacrament, as if the other Apostles

The sence must therefore be this, that <hi>Iudas</hi> as an unworthy person was cast out by Christ, before he thought fit to give the Sacrament of his Supper unto his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostles.</p>

               <p>As for those Ancients cited by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne,</hi> some of them (as <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi>) did goe upon this great mistake that the sop which Christ gave to <hi>Iudas,</hi> was the Sacrament; which errour of theirs is observed by Interpreters upon the place. No marvell that they who thought so, were also of opinion that <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; for how could they choose to thinke otherwise, upon that supposition? But now the later Interpreters, yea M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> himselfe having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away that which was the ground of their opinion, their Testimonies will weigh the lesse in this particular. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> thinks indeed that <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Sacrament, but he takes it to be no warrant at all for the admission of scandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: for in one and the same Homily, <hi>Hom.</hi> 83. in <hi>Matth.</hi> he both tels us of <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving of the Sacrament, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth at large against the admission of scandalous persons. As for <hi>Bernard</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> doth not cite his words nor quote the place. <hi>Oecumenius</hi> (in the passage cited by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi>) saith that the other Apostles and <hi>Iudas</hi> did eate together <hi>communi mensa,</hi> at a common Table; But he saith not <hi>at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi> That which <hi>Oecumenius</hi> in that place argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against, is the contempt of the poore in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the secluding of them from the love feasts of the richer sort. Now, saith he, if Christ himselfe admitted <hi>Iudas</hi> to eate at one and the same Table, with his other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ought not we much more admit the poore to eate at our Tables? M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> tels us also that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his <hi>Christus patiens</hi> agreeth that <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive the Lords Supper toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other Apostles. I answer, first I finde no such thing in that place. Next, those verses so entituled, are thought to be done by some late author, and not by <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> as <hi>Io. NeW enklaius</hi> in his Censure upon them noteth, and giveth reason for it. <hi>Cyprians</hi> Sermon <hi>de ablutione pedum,</hi> as it is doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of whether it be <hi>Cyprians,</hi> so the words cited by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> doe not prove the point in controverfie. The other Testimony cited out of <hi>Cyprians</hi> Sermon <hi>de caena Domini,</hi> as it is not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> citations of the Ancients. Peradventure it were not hard to finde as great flaws in some other of those citations. But it is not worth the while to stay so long upon it. Among the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> pag. 23. citeth out of the two confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Belgia,</hi> doth not assert that for which he citeth them. For neither of them saith that <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

That Chapter is of Sacraments in generall, and that which is added, is concerning <hi>Ananias</hi> and his wife, their being baptised of the Apostles. However the very same Chapter saith that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters must throughly looke to it, and take diligent heed <hi>lest they give holy things to dogs, or cast Pearles before swine.</hi> Which is there applied to the Sacraments, and is not understood of preaching and admonishing onely as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Finally, whereas M. <hi>Prynne</hi> citeth a passage of the antiquated Common prayer Booke, as it hath lost the authority which once it had, so that passage doth not by any necessary inference hold forth that <hi>Iudas</hi> received the Sacrament, as D. <hi>Kellet</hi> sheweth at some length in his <hi>Tricaenium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The citation in which M. <hi>Prynne</hi> is most large, is that of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Alensis part. 4.

First, <hi>Alexander Alensis</hi> is of opinion that the precept <hi>Matth. 7. 6. Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast ye Pearles before swine,</hi> doth extend to the denying the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:95406:262"/>
to known prophane Christians; for both in that Section which hath been cited, and <hi>art. 3. sect. 1.</hi> answering objections from that Text, he doth not say, that it is meant of the word, not of the Sacrament, and of Infidels, Hereticks, Persecutors, not of prophane ones: but he ever supposeth, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are forbidden by that Text, to consent to give the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prophane scandalous sinners. Secondly, <hi>Alexander Alensis</hi> holds, that Christs giving of the Sacrament to <hi>Iudas,</hi> is no warrant to Ministers to give the Sacrament to publique notorious scandalous sinners, though they doe desire it. And thus he resolveth <hi>Ib. art. 3. sect. 1. If the Priest know any man by confession to be in a mortall sinne; he ought to admonish him in secret, that he approach not to the Table of the Lord: and he ought to deny unto such a one the body of Christ, if he desire it in secret. But if he desire it in publique, then either his sinne is publique or secret. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> publique, he ought to deny it unto him; neither so doth he reveale sinne because it is publique: If private, he must give it, lest a worse thing fall out.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Alexander Alensis</hi> holds the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, not to be a converting, but a confirming and conserving Ordinance <hi>Ibid. art. 2. sect. 2.</hi> His words I shall cite in the debating of that controversie.</p>

The resolution of this question depends upon another, whether Christ and his Apostles did eate the Passeover before that supper at which he did wash his Disciples feet, and gave the sop to <hi>Iudas</hi> (after the receiving whereof <hi>Iudas</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went out) or whether that supper was before the eating of the Passeover.

supper mentioned <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 2, 4, 12, 18. and not at the Paschall Supper (as M <hi>Prynne</hi> also acknowledgeth,) This is cleare, that <hi>Ammonius</hi> placeth the common supper at which Christ did wash his Disciples feet, and told them of the Traitor, to have been before the Paschall supper. I will first tell the reasons that incline me this way, and then answer the objections which may seem to be against it. The reasons are these:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The orientall custome was to wash before meal, not after they had begun to eate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Supper (in which the sop was given to <hi>Iudas,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he went away) was <hi>before the Feast of the Passeover, Joh.</hi> 13. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, meaning immediately before the feast of the Passeover, it being reckoned from the time of eating the Paschall Lambe, and so <hi>before the Feast of the Passeover,</hi> hath the same sence as <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 38. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Pharisee wondred that Christ had not washed <hi>before dinner,</hi> that is immediately before dinner. So here I undestand <hi>before the Feast of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> that is immediately before the time of eating the Paschall Lambe, which was the beginning of the Feast of the Passeover. You will say perhaps that Christ did not eate the Passeover upon the same day that the Jewes did, and so those words <hi>before the Feast of Passeover,</hi> may be understood before the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of the Jewes, not before the Passeover of Christ. I answer, whether Christ and the Jewes kept the Passeover at one time, is much debated among Interpreters. <hi>Baronius, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus,</hi> and divers others hold that Christ did eate the Paschall Lambe upon the same day with the Jewes. <hi>Scaliger, Causabon,</hi> and others hold the contrary. The question hath been pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly debated between <hi>Ioh. Cloppenburgius,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus,</hi> yet so that <hi>Capellus</hi> (who followes <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Casau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>) acknowledgeth that both opinions have considerable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and both are straitned with some inconveniencies. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>de ultimo Christi paschate</hi> pag. 6. &amp; 22. For my part, I shall not contend: but admit the distinction of Christs Passeover and the Jewes Passeover; yet saith <hi>Maldonat</hi> upon <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 1. I doubt not but <hi>Iohn</hi> understands Christs Passe-over; for all the Evangelists in the story of the last Supper when they
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:95406:263"/>
speake of the Passeover, they mean Christs Passeover, and it was the true Passeover according to the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which makes many to thinke that Christ did eate the Passeover before that other Supper in which he gave the sop to <hi>Iudas,</hi> is a mistake of the Jewish custome, which as they conceive was to eate other meat after, but none before the Paschall Lambe. Now to me the contrary appeareth, namely, that whatsoever the Jewes did eate before the Paschall Supper, in the night of the Passeover, was eaten before the Paschall Supper, and it was among them forbidden to eate any thing after the Paschall Supper. Which may be proved not onely by that Talmudicall Canon (cited by <hi>D.

               <p>But there are two arguments which may be brought to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> did eate the Passeover with Christ and the Apostles. 1. Because that Supper at which <hi>Iudas</hi> got the sop, was after the Paschall supper, for it is said <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Supper being ended.</hi> Which must be meant of the Paschall supper. I answer these words may very well be understood not of the Paschall supper, but of that other supper at which the sop was given to <hi>Iudas.</hi> And as for <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: some Greeke copies have <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: so the sence were as <hi>Augustine</hi> expounds, Supper being prepared and ready and set on Table. But be it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the matter is not great; for there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of expounding <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may very well be translated, <hi>when supper was begun,</hi> or <hi>when they were at Supper,</hi> as I have before shewed by like instances in the New Testament, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 6. 20.

This sence is given by <hi>Osiander, Erasmus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The other argument may be this. <hi>Matthew, Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> after they have told of the making ready of the Passeover, adde that Christ <hi>sate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> with the Twelve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It cannot be proved, that this is meant of sitting down to eate the Passeover; nay, it rather appeareth from the Text, that it was to eate that other supper, at which the sop was given to <hi>Iudas;</hi> The same discourse and questioning concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Traytor, which <hi>Iohn</hi> sets down before <hi>Iudas</hi> his getting of the sop and going out; is recorded by <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>thew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> to have been in that first supper, unto which Christ sate down with the twelve when even was come. Therefore Christs sitting down with the twelve <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 20, 21. <hi>Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 14. 17, 18. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eing spoken of that supper at which Christ told his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that one of them should betray him, and every one asked <hi>Is it I?</hi> (which by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> confession was not the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:95406:264"/>
Paschall, but the ordinary supper.) It followeth that the sitting down with the twelve is not meant of the Passeover, but of an ordinary supper before the Passeover.</p>
               <p>2. The same words of Christs sitting down with the twelve are expounded (though upon other considerations) as spoken in reference not to the Paschall, but the ordinary or common sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, by <hi>Lorinus in Psal.</hi> 101. 6. following <hi>Maldonat,</hi> and by <hi>Gerhard. Harm. Evang. cap</hi> 170. p. 403. Their reason is, because according to the Law, the Passeover was to be eaten standing, not sitting: but that is more then can be proved from the Law which doth not so much as speake of standing at the first Passeover. It is no necessary consequence: they had their stav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s in their hands, <hi>ergo</hi> they were standing. This by the way.</p>
               <p>3. Granting that Christs sitting downe with the twelve were spoken of the Paschall supper, yet the paschall supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the other supper, at which <hi>Iudas</hi> got the sop and went away (which I now suppose for the reasons before-mentioned till I see better reasons to the contrary.) It might be said, after <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone, that Christ sate down with the twelve, as well as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 5. it is said of Christ risen from the dead, <hi>he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve,</hi> though he was seen onely of the eleven, and <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone to his place. Which answers all that can be said from <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>If I have not said so much, as to put it out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not eate of the Passeover with Christ and his Apostles, yet I am sure I have cleared so much as this, that Master <hi>Prynne</hi> will not be able to prove convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly that <hi>Iudas</hi> did eate of the Passeover that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight with Christ.</p>
               <p>I will conclude with the pious observation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cartwright:</hi> that it was not a vaine or idle question, which the Disciples propounded, (being commanded to prepare the Passeover) they aske, <hi>where wilt thou that we prepare? Luke</hi> 22. 8, 9. for Christ having commanded them, that into whatsoever City they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, they should enquire who were godly therein, and turne in to such, to lodge and to eate there; They did thereby easily
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:95406:265"/>
understand, that if in common and ordinary eating together, then much more in this sacred feast, they must turne in to the families of the godly, and avoyd the prophane; especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that they who were of that houshold were to eate the Passeover with Christ and his Disciples, according to the Law. From this very example of the Passeover he drawes an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for keeping off all ungodly and prophane persons from the Sacrament, so farre as is possible. Thus <hi>Cartwright Harm. Evang. lib. 3. pag. 162.</hi> The like observation <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath upon <hi>Matth. 26. 18. I will keepe the Passeover at thy house with my Disciples.</hi> He bids us marke those words <hi>with my Disciples:</hi> not with prophane or scandalous ones, but <hi>with my Disciples.</hi> To the like purpose <hi>Titus Bostrorum Episcopus in Luke</hi> 22. hath this observation. <hi>Non manducat autem hoc pascha cum Judaeis, sed tantum cum Discipulis suis: Siquidem Judaei, propter obstinatam incredulitatem, hoc paschate indigni erant. Yet he eateth not this Passeover with the Jewes, but onely with his own Disciples: for as much as the Jews, because of their obstinate incred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Prynne</hi> whose grounds are oftimes weakest where his asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are strongest.</p>
               <p>I proceed to the second answer. Granting that <hi>Iud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> did receive the Sacrament, that can make nothing for the admission of scandalons sinners whose prophannesse and ungodly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is knowne, and maketh their name to stinke in the Church. For <hi>Iudas</hi> his wickednesse was not publique nor knowne before he had got the sop and gone out, and left the company of Christ and the Apostles. And moreover he who argueth from Christs receiving of <hi>Iudas</hi> to the Sacrament, when though his sinne was yet secret, yet Christ knew him to be a divell; to prove that the Eldership may and ought to admit one to the Sacrament, whom they know to be a <hi>Iudas,</hi> a Divell: may as well argue from Christs choosing of <hi>Iudas</hi> to be an Apostle when he knew him to be a Divell, to prove the lawfulnesse of the Elderships choosing of a Minister whom they know to be a divell. But now for that point of the scandall or secresie of <hi>Iudas</hi> his sinne, let us heare M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> reply, pag. 26, 27. He gives it foure feet to runne upon. But the truth
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:95406:266"/>
is, it hath but two (the same things being twice told) and those how foundered you shall see by and by.</p>
               <p>First he saith, that at the time when Christ instituted the Sacrament he foretold the Disciples that <hi>Iudas</hi> should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 18. to 28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 20. to 26. <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 18. to 22. <hi>Luk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> 22. 21, 22, 23. More plainly pag. 27. he saith, Christ did admit <hi>Iudas, to eate the Passeover and Sacrament with his other Disciples, and they made not any s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>

And more expressely he told us out of <hi>Iohn</hi> that Christs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about <hi>Iudas,</hi> and his informing of the Disciples that one of them should betray him, and his giving the sop to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> was after the Sacrament, because it was after supper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, the Sacrament being instituted and distributed before supper ended <hi>Vindic.</hi> pag. 18, 19. &amp; 25. The same thing which before he made to be after the Sacrament, to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive the Sacrament, the very same he now makes to be before the Sacrament, that he may prove <hi>Iudas</hi> a scandalous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inner and a known Traitor, even before his receiving of the Sacrament. And shall he thus abuse not onely his Reader, but the Word of God it selfe with palpable and grosse contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? I shall beseech him in the feare of God to looke to it, and never more to take this liberty to put contrary sences upon the holy Scripture, so as may seeme to serve most for his present advantage. Surely such lucubrations are not onely <hi>subitane</hi> but <hi>sinfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. His answer which now he gives us doth clearely yeeld these two things: 1. That the Discourse about the Traytor, and the giving of the sop, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>hn</hi> 13. 8. to vers. 28. was before the Sacrament; Now <hi>Iudas</hi> having gone out immediately after the sop, hereby Master <hi>Prynne</hi> strengthneth my argument which I brought to prove that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not receive the Sacrament;
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:95406:266"/>
which argument in this very particular he formerly opposed. 2. He hath here also yeelded that these words <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 21, 22, 23. <hi>But behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the Table, &amp;c.</hi> though mentioned after the Sacrament (which is the most colourable argument for <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving of the Sacrament) yet were spoken before the Sacrament, and that the order of time is not to be gathered from <hi>Luke</hi> but from <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> who record that discourse about <hi>Iudas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament. And in yeelding this, he takes off his own strongest argument, and confirmes what I have before taken pains to prove.</p>
               <p>3. Those Divines that hold <hi>Iudas</hi> did receive the Sacrament, doe conceive that those words, <hi>But behold the hand of him that betrayeth me, &amp;c.</hi> were indeed spoken after the Sacrament, and that <hi>Luke</hi> placeth them in their proper place. And so holding that the discourse about the Traytor was after the Sacrament, they doe thereby intimate that <hi>Iudas</hi> was not knowne to be the Traytor, till after the Sacrament. Wherefore either a man must quit the most considerable argument for <hi>Iudas</hi> his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, or else acknowledge that <hi>Iudas</hi> was not knowne by the Disciples to be the Traytor till after the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>4. When after the giving of the sop Christ said to <hi>Iudas,</hi> That thou dost, doe quickly, <hi>No man at the Table knew for what intent he spake this unto him, John</hi> 13. 28. But if Christ had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly informed them that <hi>Iudas</hi> was the Traytor, how is it that they could have been so altogether ignorant of Christs intent, as to thinke that he was still trusting <hi>Iudas</hi> with the buying of what they had need of against the Feast, or with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the poore? Hence <hi>Lud.

But he moves this doubt: when <hi>Iudas</hi> had said <hi>Is it I?</hi> he did not affirme the thing, but doubted of it. How then did Christ returne such an answer as agreeth to that which <hi>Iudas</hi> had said, as if it had been a positive truth. He gives this soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Christ as searcher of the heart did speake it to <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was in his conscience convinced that he was the man, and so assenteth to the truth of that testimony of his Conscience.

For otherwise he
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:95406:268"/>
could not in any reason argue thus against the Independents: because if this supposition be not laid downe that <hi>Iudas</hi> was an unregenerate yet not a scandalous person: then the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents had this obvious answer, that if his Argument prove any thing, it doth conclude the admission not onely of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerated and unsanctified, but of scandalous persons, to the Sacrament; whereas he brings it to prove against them, that persons not scandalous, though unregenerate, ought not to be refused the Sacrament. And now he brings the same thing against us to prove that scandalous persons ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, if not excommunicated, and desirous to receive the Sacrament. He tels us by the way of <hi>Iudas his theevish, covetous, as well as traiterous disposition Iohn 12. 6. both which did make him scandalous.</hi> But he might have observed, that the holy Ghost sheweth plainly that in that act <hi>Iudas</hi> was not a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sinner in the esteeme of the other Disciples; for his theevish covetous disposition was not known to the Disciples; yea the pretext of his care for the poore was so plausible to them (though abominable to Christ who knew his heart) that it is said, not onely of <hi>Iudas,</hi> but of the Disciples (by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation) <hi>they had indignation</hi> at the wasting of that which might have been sold for much and given to the poore, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 8.</p>

So should a Minister (if he see one in the Congregation whom he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows to be a <hi>Iudas,</hi> and to be living in some abominable wickednesse, even whiles he comes with a professed desire to receive the Sacrament) tell the Congregation, that he knows and sees one amongst them whom he certainly knows to be guilty of such a particular secret horrible sinne, and (if it be possible) make the sinner himselfe to know by such or such a signe, that he is the man whom he speakes of, and not to leave off powerfull checks, sharpe rebukes, terrible comminations, till by the blessing of God and the power of the word, he get such a one terrified and chased away.</p>

Whereunto <note n="y" place="margin">Respondemus id nobis revera esse illicitum, &amp; peccare Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistros qui dant Sacramenta in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignis, quando fine scandalo denegare pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt, attamen Deum his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus non te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neri, cum sit supremus Dominus, qui suis donis utitur, prout voluerit, quemadmodum etiam Deus non peccat permittendo hominum peccata, imò &amp; ad peccati substantiam concurrendo; nobis verò, nec concurrere licet nec permittere aliquod peccatum, quando sufficienter &amp; moraliter id im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedire possumus.</note> he answereth, that it is indeed unlawfull to Ministers to give the Sacrament to the unworthy, when they can refuse them without scandall (a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction which I suppose M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> dare not owne; for if the lawfulnesse or unlawfulnesse of the thing must be determined by the scandall, they goe upon a very slippery ground.) He addeth that it is unlawfull to us to follow Gods example in giving holy things to the unworthy, as it is unlawfull to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his example in the permitting of sinne when we can hinder it.

Unto this objection his answer is, that this prohibition lieth indeed upon the Ministers, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencers of the Sacraments, but bindeth not Christ himselfe the Law-maker. As long therefore as we are able to prove from Scripture, that scandalous persons ought to be keep back from the Sacrament, and that it is unlawfull for Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> officers to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such; the Erastians doe but weakly helpe themselves by arguing from Christs giving the Sacrament to <hi>Iudas.</hi> Which I have said by way of concession: for my opinion is, that Christ did upon the matter excommunicate <hi>Iudas,</hi> and that his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in this very particular is a patterne to us, which I hope I have made evident.</p>

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:95406:270"/>
                  <hi>by any Minister or Presbytery</hi> as pag. 29, 30, 31. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he argueth that <hi>no Ministers private judgement or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ought to be the rule of his admitting any to, or suspending them from the Sacrament,</hi> as pag. 32. Which is a confounding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of two most different points. Thirdly, and if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion should be stated of the Minister his duty, that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> affirmeth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Minister hath fully discharged his duty and conscience, if he give warning to unworthy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants of the danger they incurre by their unworthy approaches, to the Lords Table, and seriously dehort them from comming to it, unlesse they repent, reforme and come preparedly;</hi> is erroneous and false: for there are other necessary duties incumbent to the Minister, in this businesse: as 1. he must be earnest in his prayers to God, for the conversion and reformation of such unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, else that God would give his Spirit and assistance to the Eldership, and others to whom the case shall be brought, that they may faithfully doe their duty in restraining such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: or (if not so) that God would by his owne providence keepe backe such persons, or hedge up their way with thornes, and make a wall, that they shall not finde their pathes to come and prophane the Lords Table. 2. The Minister must deale seriously with the Eldership by informations, exhortations, and admonitions, to move them to doe their duty. 3. The Minister must give his owne vote and sentence in the Eldership against the admission of such persons. 4. If (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) the Eldership be not willing to doe their duty, but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglect it, the Minister ought to addresse himselfe with his complaints to the superiour Ecclesiasticall assemblies (as they lie in their order) that they may interpose by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to rectifie the mal-administration of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Eldership. 5. And if it should fall out that a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous unworthy person should finde so much favour in the higher assemblies also, as that they shall judge him fit to be admitted to the Sacrament; yet if the Minister know him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be a scandalous abominable person, and be also cleere in his conscience, that the matter of scandall is sufficiently proved, he must not doe an unlawfull act in obedience to men,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:95406:271"/>
but walke by that Apostolicall rule, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Be not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of other mens sinnes; Keep thy selfe pure.</hi> In doing whereof, he doth not make his conscience the rule of inflicting any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and particularly of suspending from the Sacrament (which must be done <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>by many</hi>) but yet his conscience so sarre as it is informed and illuminate by the word of God, is a rule to him of his owne personall acting or not acting, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of which the offender stands <hi>rectus in curia,</hi> and is not excluded by the sentence of any Ecclesiasticall Court. I confesse a Minister ought to be very cleare in his conscience, and be perswaded (not upon suspicions, surmises, or such like sleight motives, but) upon very certaine grounds, that the sentence of an Eldership, Classis, or Synod is contrary to the Word of God, before he refuse to doe the thing.</p>
               <p>But what may be the reason why M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> is so large upon this point from pag. 28. to 35? I take not upon me to judge <hi>de intentione operantis.</hi> But the <hi>intentio operis</hi> is to yeeld some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in lieu of suspension from the Sacrament, which yet shall be no Church censure nor act of jurisdiction, and so to make the discipline of Suspension (yea and Excommunication too) to be of no necessary use in the Church. For if it be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and a full discharge of duty, to admonish unworthy scandalous persons, not to come to the Lords Table, unlesse they repent and reforme, this cuts off the necessity of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, whether Suspension or Excommunication. As for that admonition or warning to be given, it is no Church censure, nor act of Jurisdiction, especially when given by the Minister alone; for no Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction can be excercised, or Censure inflicted by any one man, how eminent soever in the Church. Yea when it is a Consistoriall or Presbyteriall Admonition, it is not properly a Censure, but a Degree to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. 1. Because Admonition doth not exclude a person from any Church priviledge nor from communion in any Ordinance. And how can one be said to be under Church censure, who still enjoyeth all Church priviledges? 2. If Consistoriall admonition be a binding, where is the loosing of that bond? Every cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure consistorially inflicted, must be also consistorially taken

                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> doctrine tendeth to strip Elderships out of all jurisdiction or power of Censures. Now come we to the particulars, wheren I doe not finde any great matter to insist long upon.</p>
               <p>He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irst premiseth six conclusions. Supposed conclusions he may make them, but proved Conclusions they are not. The first of them is indeed ushered in syllogistically, but very weakly, as shall appeare. The strength of his discourse he contracteth into this argument.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Those who have a true right to the Sacrament, as visible members of the visible Church, ought not in justice or conscience to be deprived of it, in case they demand it, by any Minister or Presbytery.</p>
                  <p>But all unexcommunicate Christians, who are able to examine themselves, as visible members of the visible Church, have a true right to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in case they doe demand it, when publiquely administred.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, they ought not in justice or conscience be deprived of it, by any Minister or Presbytery, when publiquely administred, if they shall require it.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, this is <hi>fallacia plurium interrogationum;</hi> for these words, <hi>as visible members of the visible Church,</hi> both in the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> clogge and confound the argument, and patch up two distinct propositions into one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his <hi>Major</hi> cannot be admitted without a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is <hi>Ius ad rem,</hi> and <hi>Ius in re.</hi> There is a remote right, or a right <hi>in actu primo,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is, such a right, relation, or habitude as entitleth a person to such a priviledge or benefit, to be enjoyed and possessed by him when he shall be capable and fit to enjoy it: Such is the right of a Minor to his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Such was the right of lepers of old to their T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts, Houses, and Goods, when themselves were put out of the Camp, and might not (during their leprosie) actually enjoy their
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:95406:272"/>
own habitations: Such is the right which a man hath in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to his sequestred Estate, Lands, and Houses; he doth not lose but retaine his Right, Title, Charters and Deeds (as valid in Law, and not made voyd or null) and may be againe admitted to the actuall possession upon satisfaction given to the State: and a huge difference there is between Sequestration, and forfeiture or Outlawry. There is againe a proxime right, or a right <hi>in actu secundo,</hi> which rendereth a person actually and presently capable of that thing which he is entituled unto. If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes major</hi> be understood of the first kind of right, I deny it. If of the second kind of right, I admit it, and it doth not help his opinion, nor hurt mine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, yea himselfe must needs admit an exception from his <hi>major</hi> proposition, for by his owne principles, those that have a true right to the Sacrament, as visible members of the visible Church, may be excommunicated and so deprived, not onely of the Sacrament, but of all other publique Ordinances. When he tels us here that <hi>nothing but an actuall excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can suspend them from this their right,</hi> he doth but begge that which is in question. And if his Argument conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a lesser Suspension from their right, why not also against the greater?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he hath not proved his <hi>minor,</hi> especially being understood of the second kind of right, which renders me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> actually and presently capable of the thing. He saith that the Sacraments were bequeathed by Christ, <hi>to his visible Church on Earth, and all visible members of it.</hi> Which he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and I deny it, except it have this limitation, <hi>all visible members of the visible Church, which are (visibly or in externall profession and conversation) qualified according to the rule of Christ, and against whose admission to the Sacrament there is no just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, when he concludeth, that no unexcommunicated Christians who are able to examine themselves (that is, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath explained, who are not naturally disabled as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and fooles: though he shall finde it a very hard taske to prove, that all other unexcommunicate Christians besides these,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:95406:272"/>
are able to examine themselves) ought in justice or conscience to be deprived of the Sacrament by any Minister or Presbytery: he doth upon the matter conclude, that the Ordinances of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. 1645. and <hi>March</hi> 14. 1645. authorising Presbyteries to suspend from the Sacrament scandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unexcommunicated, are contrary to all justice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. N. B.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, as touching that limitation yeelded by himselfe, that they must be such as are able to examine themselves, I aske, 1. Are persons grossely ignorant able to examine themselves? 2. Are drunken persons able to examine themselves? 3. Are men of corrupt minds and erroneous, yea prophane principles, who call evill good, and pervert Scripture to the defending of some grosse sinnes, are these able to examine themselves? 4. Are those who are known that they had never any worke of the law upon their consciences to convince or humble them (<hi>for by the Law is the knowledge of sinne</hi>) able to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? If the answers be affirmative, then surely this selfe-examination is not ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>htly apprehended what it is. If the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers be negative; then those who in their address<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to the Lords Table are found ignorant, or drunke, or defenders of sinne, or presumptuous and unconvinced, and doe manifestly appeare such, though they be not excommunicated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing professed Christians, and desiring the Sacrament, yet ought not to be admitted.</p>
               <p>I proceed to his second conclusion, the strength whereof (so farre as I am able to gather from his discourse) may be drawn together into this Argument. Such as in all ages, yea by the very Apostles themselves, have been deemed fit to receive, and could not be denied the Sacrament of Baptisme, ought to be (being baptised and unexcommunicated, and willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate) admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. But in all Churches from Christs time till this present, all externall professors of Christ, even carnall persons, <hi>onely upon a bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall profession of faith and repentance,</hi> were deemed fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and were never denied the Sacrament of Baptisme (yea, saith he, <hi>we read in the very Apostles times that a meere externall sleight confession of sinne, and profession of the Christian faith, was</hi>
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:95406:273"/>
                  <hi>sufficient to enable sinners to be baptized Ergo,</hi> all externall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christ, &amp;c. ought to be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I retort the Argument thus. Such as have been dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Apostles and by all well constituted Churches, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be admitted to Baptisme, ought also to be deemed unworthy though baptised) to be admitted to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But all known wicked and prophane livers, how able and willing so ever to make confession of the true Christian faith, have been by the Apostles and all w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ituted Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches deemed unworthy to be admitted to Baptisme. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all known wicked, &amp;c. More of this afterward <hi>Chap</hi> 13. and <hi>Chap</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I answer directly, I distinguish the <hi>Major,</hi> I deny the <hi>Minor.</hi> I distinguish the <hi>Major:</hi> Those who have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Baptisme ought to be admitted to the Lords Supper <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> if the proportion hold in the particulars, and if they be as free of scandalous sines now when they desire to receive the Lords Supper, as they were when they desired to receive Baptisme. He needed not make so great a matter of our suspending from the Sacrament a person formerly deemed fit to receive Baptisme. For why? the person is a scandalous person now which he was not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n. My limitation of <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> he himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must admit; otherwise how will he defend his owne Principle, that the flagicious, abominable and obstinate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who cannot be reduced by Admonitions, may and ought to be excommunicated, and so to be cut off from the Lords Supper, and all other publike Ordinances, although formerly deemed sit to receive baptisme? The <hi>Minor</hi> I utterly deny as most false and as a reproach ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon the Apostles themselves. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynnes</hi> Rule is so large, that Turkes or Pagans who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically live in Idolatry, common swearing, adultery, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, murthering, stealing, or the like, and are known to live in those abominable scandalous sinnes, ought neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n a meere externall sleight confession of sinne, and profession of the Christian faith,</hi> be baptised. When I expected his proofe from the Apostles times, he onely tels us that <hi>Philip</hi> baptized <hi>Simon Magus though he were in the gall of bitternesse and bond of</hi>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:95406:273"/>
                  <hi>iniquity, Acts 8. Yea,</hi> saith he, <hi>many other who turned Wolves, Apostates, Hereticks were baptised by the very Apostles, Acts 20. 2. Tim.</hi> 3. If he had proved that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was known to be in the gall of bitternesse and bond of iniquity when <hi>Philip</hi> did baptize him, or that the Apostles did baptise any (upon a sleight externall profession) who were then known to be Wolves, Apostates, and Hereticks, he had said more for his cause then all his booke saith beside. But to tell us that some persons baptized (he might as well have said that some persons who received the Lords Supper did appeare afterward to be in the gall of bitternesse, Wolves, Apostates, Heretickes, is as much as to travell, and to bring forth nothing. For how shall ever this reach the admission of known prophane persons to the Lords Supper? That which he had to prove was the admission (not of hypocrites, but) of knowne scandalous profane persons to Baptisme.</p>
               <p>His third conclusion <hi>that it is the Ministers bounden duty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Sacraments to their people, as well as to preach and pray;</hi> no man will deny it, so that the Ministers doe it <hi>debito modo,</hi> and according to the rule of Christ: they are <hi>stewards of the mysteries of God: moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithfull, 1 Cor.</hi> 4 1, 2. It is the bounden duty of Stewards to give the childrens bread to children and not to dogges and swine. It is not the duty of Ministers to preach peace to the wicked, and much lesse to seale it to them who are knowne to be such.</p>
               <p>The fourth conclusion, that the Word and Sacraments are set accidentally for the fall and ruine, as wel as for the salvation of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maketh nothing to the purpose in hand. Whatever the secret intention of God be, and his unsearchable judgement upon the soule of this or that man, it is no rule of duty to the Minister or Eldership. <hi>To the Law and to the Testimony. Secret things belong to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth, <hi>that God onely infallibly knows the hearts, and present state of all men,</hi> is no whit neerer the point The Eldership <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>udg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>works, professions</hi> and <hi>practises. By their fruits ye shall know them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:95406:274"/>The sixth, <hi>that no Ministers private judgement or conscience ought to be the rule of his admitting any to, or suspending them from the Sacrament,</hi> is also wide from the controversie in hand, which is concerning the Elderships (not the Ministers) power. Of the Ministers personall duty I have spoken before.</p>
               <p>These six conclusions premised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> proceeds to prove, <hi>that a Minister in delivering the Sacrament to a scandalous unexcommunicated person, who after admonition of the danger, doth earnestly desire to receive it, &amp;c. becomes no way guilty of his sinne or punish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Erastus</hi> as one of his arguments against Excommunication, that the Apostle saith, <hi>Let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eate of that bread, and drink of that cup. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 28. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a mans fitnesse or unfitnesse for the Sacrament, is not to be judged by others, but by himselfe onely, and if he judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe fit, the Eldership hath no power to exclude him. The same Scripture is here pressed against us by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Prynne</hi> to prove, that if a man <hi>judge himselfe fitly prepared, joynes with others in the publique confession of his sinnes, and promiseth newnesse of life, the Minister</hi> (he should say the Eldership) <hi>ought in point of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to deem him so, and hath no commission from Christ to exclude him, &amp;c. Let a man therefore examine himselfe, not others, or others him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, 1. The self-examination there spoken of, is not
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:95406:274"/>
mentioned as exclusive: for it is not said, <hi>Let a man examine himselfe onely.</hi> 2. Yet I can grant it to be exclusive, it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of that judging of a mans selfe, which prevents the judgement of God vers. 31. no mans examining of another can doe this, but his examining of himselfe. That which can give us confidence and boldnesse before God, and <hi>assure our hearts before him, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 19. is not the examination or approbation of others, but of our owne conscience; <hi>for what man knowes the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 11. The Pastors and Elders of <hi>Corinth</hi> had admitted some to the Lords Table, whom they judged sit and worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, but God judged otherwise of them. Therefore saith the Apostle, let a man make a narrow search of his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and not rest upon the judgement of others. 3. If it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a man to examine himselfe, by what warrant doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

It is not enough for a notorious scandalous sinner to judge himselfe, nor yet to joyne with others in publique confession: but he must publiquely and particularly confesse his owne sinne, which he must doe personally, or for his own part, and others can not doe it with him. 5. <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.

before or in the act of receiving change the heart and life of such a Heathen or excommunicate person. 2.

               <p>Seventhly, he argueth from our Concessions that Ministers may administer the Sacrament to masked hypocrites, and yet are not guilty of their unworthy receiving. This he saith is a yeelding our objection false in the case of scandalous persons too. But his reason is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ust as if he had said, Ministers are not guilty when they give the Sacrament to those who are not scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not guilty when they give the Sacrament to those that are scandalous.

               <p>Eighthly, (for he hath given his seventh already) he tels us, that <hi>the Minister onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The ninth concerning Christs giving of the Sacrament to <hi>Iudas</hi> is answered before.</p>

The Minister is a sweet savour of Christ, as well in those that perish by the Sacrament, as in those that are benefited by it, with this <hi>proviso,</hi> that he hath done his duty, as a faithfull Steward, and that he hath not given that which is holy to dogs, else God shall require it at his hands.</p>
               <p>Finally, he argueth from 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 29. He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh</hi> (not condemnation but) <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Whatever be meant by judgement in this place, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is a punishment of sinne, and such a thing as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from Gods displeasure: and it is as certaine that unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving maketh a person lyable to a greater judgement then that which is temporall. 2. If <hi>to himselfe</hi> be restrictive and exclusive in the case of close hypocrites, such as are by Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers (judging according to outward appearance) admitted to the Sacrament; yet how will it be made to appeare that the Apostle meant those words as restrictive and exclusive in the case of scandalous and knowne unworthy communicants. 3. Such a scandalous person doth indeed eate and drink judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himselfe; but this can neither in whole nor in part excuse but rather greatly aggravate the sinne of the Minister: for when a wicked man dieth in his iniquity, yet his blood God will require at the hands of the unfaithfull Minister, who did strengthen his hands in his sinne.</p>

               <p>I Had in answer to Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> third <hi>Quaere,</hi> given this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why prophane and scandalous persons are to be kept off from the Sacrament, and yet not from hearing the Word: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the word is not onely a confirming and comforting, but a converting Ordinance, and is a mean appointed of God to turn sinners from darknes to light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than to God: Whereas the Sacrament is not a converting, but a confirming and sealing Ordinance, which is not given to the Church for <hi>the conversion of Sinners,</hi> but for <hi>the Communion of Saints:</hi> It is not appointed to put a man in the state of grace, but to seal unto a man that interest in Christ and in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace which he already hath. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> doth with much eagernesse contradict me in this, and argue at length the contrary. (Which is the marrow and fatnesse (if there be any) in his debate concerning the eighth point of difference) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth not onely contradict me, but himself too (as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) yea and joyn not onely with the more rigid <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but with the Papists themselves against the Writers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. For the very same thing which is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted between him and me, is controverted between Papists and Protestants.

as the School-men speak. Our Divines hold that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are appointed of God, and delivered to the Church as sealing Ordinances, not to give, but to testifie what is given, not to make but confirm Saints. And they do not onely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Papists <hi>opus operatum:</hi> but they simply deny this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentality of the Sacraments, that they are appointed of God for working or giving grace, where it is not. This is so well known to all who have studied the Sacramentarian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, that I should not need to prove it.

               <p>You will say peradventure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Protestant Writers hold the Sacraments to be 1. Significant or declarative signes. 2. Obsignative or confirming signes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Exhibitive signes, so that the thing signified is given and exhibite to the soul. I answer, That exhibition which they speak of, is not the giving of grace where it is not (as is manifest by the afore quoted Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies) but an exhibition to beleevers, a real effectual lively application of Christ and of all his benefits to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, for the staying, strengthening, confirming, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting of the soul. <hi>Chamierus contractus.

               <p>By this time it may appear (I suppose) that the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between us and the Papists concerning the effect of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments (setting aside the <hi>opus operatum,</hi> which is a distinct
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:95406:280"/>
controversie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is distinctly spoken to by our Writers, setting aside also the <hi>casualitas phisica</hi> and <hi>insita,</hi> by which some of the Papists say the Sacraments give grace, though diverse others of them hold the Sacraments to be onely moral causes of grace) is thus far the same with the present controversie between Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> and me, that Protestant Writers do not onely oppose the <hi>opus operatum,</hi> and the <hi>casualitas physica &amp; insita,</hi> but they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (as is manifest by the Testimonies already cited) all casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality or working of the first grace of conversion and faith in or by the Sacraments, supposing alwaies a man to be a beleever and within the Covenant of grace before the Sacrament, and that he is not made such, nor translated to the state of grace in or by the Sacrament. This the Papists contradict, and therein Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> joyneth with them. When <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Argument: The Sacraments (saith he) have not the same relation to faith which the Word hath: <hi>Nam verbum Dei praecedit fidem, Sacramenta autem sequuntur, saltem in adultis. The Word of God doth go before faith, but the Sacraments follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, at least in those who are of age. Dr. Ames Bell. enerv.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> assertion is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Lords Supper is a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as well as a sealing Ordinance; for clearing whereof h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> premiseth two distinctions. There are two sorts both of conversion and sealing, which he saith his Antagonists <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the vulgar have ignorantly, wilfully, or injudiciously confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Whether such language beseems a man fearing God, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring them that do fear God, let every one judge who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing of Christian moderation. See now if there be any reason for this grievous charge. <hi>First</hi> (saith he) <hi>there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conversion of men from Paganisme or Gentilisme to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profession of the faith of Christ.</hi> This (he saith) is wrought by the Word or by Miracles, and effected by Baptisme in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to infants of Christian Parents. But how the Baptism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:95406:281"/>
of such Infants is brought under the head of conversion from Paganisme to the external profession of Christ, I am yet to learn. <hi>Secondly</hi> saith he, <hi>There is a conversion from a meer external formal profession of the Doctrine and Faith of Christ, to an inward spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al embracing and application of Christ with his merits and promises to our souls, by the saving grace of Faith, and to an holy Christian real change of heart and life: In this last conversion, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is not onely a sealing or confirming, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a regenerating and converting Ordinance as well as the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He might upon as good reason have made a third sort of conversion from a scandalous and prophane life to the external obedience of the will and commandements of God. But all this is to seek a knot in the rush; for there is but one sort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version which is a saving conversion, and that is a conversion from nature to grace, from sin to sanctification, from the power of Sathan to God, whether it be from paganisme, or from prophanenesse, or from an external formal profession. Now that conversion which Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> ascribes to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a true sanctifying and saving conversion. The other conversion which he ascribes not to the Sacrament, is not a saving conversion, for the <hi>external conversion of men from Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme or Gentilisme to the external profession of the faith of Christ,</hi> without the other conversion to an inward spiritual embracing of Christ, doth but make men seven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fold more the children of Hell. So that Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> hath more opened his sore when he thought to cover and patch it.</p>
               <p>The other distinction which he gives us, is of a twofold sealing. But by the way he tells us that Baptisme and the Lords Supper are termed Sacraments and Seals, without any Text of Scripture to warrant it.

Wherefore though he leaneth much that way, both here, and pag. 30. yet I shall expect he will rectifie himself in this particular. His words are these. <hi>There is a double sealing (if we admit this Sacrament or Baptisme to be seals, though never once stiled seals in any Scripture Text</hi>) And in the Margent, <hi>they are termed Sacraments and seals of the Covenant, without any Text to warra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:95406:282"/>
need not seek it in Scripture, because it is a Latin Word, and there is not either in the Hebrew or Greek (the languages in which Scripture was written) any word which properly, closely and fully answereth to the Word Sacrament.

When the Lords Supper is called a sealing Ordinance; did ever any man understand this of a sealing to our outward sences onely, or of receiving the outward Elements and no more? Who can mistake the thing so far as to think that Christ hath instituted and ordained this Sacrament to be a meer external seal and no more? When he grants that in the second sence this Sacrament is a seal, <hi>onely to worthy, penitent, beleeving receivers, who receive the inward invisible grace, as well as the outward signes:</hi> He grants that which I require, that is, that it is a sealing Ordinance intended for worthy penitent beleeving receivers, not for the scandalous and unworthy. God forbid we should make a sealing Ordinance to be an empty Ordinance. The truth is, his first kind of sealing without the second, is no sealing, yea worse then no sealing. Where there is no charter, how can there be a sealing, except we seal blank paper? and as we shall hear anon from <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> we have not so much as the seal, except we have that which is sealed. I know it will be answered, there is somewhat to be sealed even to the scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and unworthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, the pardon of all their sins condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:95406:282"/>
if they truly repent, beleeve, lay hold on Christ. In this very place Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> tells us, that all Gods promises and a free pardon is sealed, even to scandalous and unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers conditionally; that is, as he explicates himself pag 37. upon condition that they <hi>become penitent and beleeving receivers.</hi> But then (say I) he must upon as good reason grant, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be given to Pagans and Turks, at least the first day of preaching the Gospel to them; May it not be said to Pagans and Turks, that if they repent and beleeve on Christ, they shall have pardon of sin? Here is the thing to be sealed in Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi>'s opinion. What then should hinder the sealing? He shunneth to call the Sacrament a converting ordinance in reference to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; and now behold his principles will admit the giving of the Sacrament even to Pagans as a sealing Ordinance, how much more then as a converting Ordinance?</p>
               <p>We have now heard his two distinctions, which if they have given any clearing to his assertion, it is such as is little to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. I will now premise some distinctions of my owne to clear that which I hold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Question is not <hi>de potentia Dei absoluta,</hi> Whether God by his omnipotency can give the first grace of conversion in the instant of receiving the Sacrament. But the Question is of the revealed will of God, and the way of the dispensation of grace made known to us in the Gospel, which must be the rule to us to walk by. <hi>A peradventure it may be,</hi> and <hi>who knoweth</hi> but the scandalous sinner <hi>may</hi> be converted, is no warrantable ground to go upon in this case, as Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> would make it pag. 47. for we may as well adventure to delay repentance, upon a <hi>peradventure it may be.</hi> There is an example in the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one who got repentance and mercy at his end, and if we beleeve the Hebrews and divers Christian Interpreters; there is another example of the same kind in the Old Testament, which is the example of <hi>Achan.</hi> Whereas there is no example in all the Scripture of any converted by the Sacrament. But if a thing be contrary to the revealed will and commandement of God (as both these are, the delaying of repentance, and the admission of scandalous persons to the Sacrament) we may not dare to go upon <hi>peradventures. To the Law, and to the Testimony. Search the</hi>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:95406:283"/>
                  <hi>Scriptures.</hi> If the Word do not shew us any thing of conversion by the Sacrament, we must not think of any such thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We must distinguish between the Sacrament it self, and those things that do accompany the Sacrament, powerful preaching, exhortation, prayer, or the like before or after the Sacrament. Put case a sinner be effectually converted by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or a prayer, which he heareth at the Ordination of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, will any man therefore say that Ordination is a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance? So if by most serious powerful exhortations, convictions, promises, threatnings, by prayer, by Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference by reading or meditation before or after the Sacrament, the Lord be pleased to touch the Conscience and convert the soul of an impenitent prophane wicked liver, nothing of this kind can make the Sacrament a converting Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We must distinguish even in conversion between <hi>gratia praeveniens &amp; subs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>quens, operans &amp; co-operans, excitans &amp; adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans,</hi> or rather, between <hi>habitual</hi> and <hi>actual</hi> conversion. <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> conversion I call the first infusion of the life and habits of grace; <hi>actual</hi> conversion is the souls beginning to act from that life and from those habits. The first or habitual conversion in which the sinner is passive, and not at all active, it being wholy the work of preventing, exciting, quickning grace, is that which never is to be looked for in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which is enough to overthrow that opinion, that scandalous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent sinners (having an external formal profession, but known by a wicked abominable conversation to be dead in sins and trespasses, in whom the holy Ghost hath never yet breathed the first breath of the life of grace) may be admitted to the Lords Supper (if they desire it, not being excommunicated) upon hopes, that it may prove a converting Ordinance to them. As for <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia subsequens co-operans &amp; adjuvans,</hi> by which the sinner (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now a spiritual life created in him and supernatural habits infused in his soul) is said actually to convert, repent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. I consider even in this actual conversion, repenting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, these two things. 1. The inchoation. 2. The progresse of the work. Where the work is begun, if it were but faith like a grain of mustard seed, and where there is any thing of conversion which is true and sound; the Sacrament is a blessed powerful
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:95406:283"/>
means to help forward the work. But I peremptorily deny that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is appointed or instituted by Christ as a regenerating converting Ordinance, as well as the word, or as a means of beginning <hi>actual,</hi> much lesse <hi>habitual</hi> conversion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When I hold the Lords Supper not to be a converting but a sealing Ordinance, the meaning is not as if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I beleeved that all who are permitted to come to the Lords Table are truly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or that they are such as the seals of the Covenant of Grace do indeed and of right belong unto (for we speak of visible Churches and visible Saints) But my meaning is that Christ hath intended this Sacrament to be the childrens read onely (though the hired servants of the house have other bread enough and to spare) and he alloweth this portion to none but such as are already conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and do beleeve: and that they who are the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God ought to admit none to this Sacrament, except such as are quallified and fit (so far as can be judged by their profession, knowledge, and practice, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and examined by the Eldership according to the rules of the Word, no humane court being infallible) to have part and portion in the communion of Saints, and to receive the seals of the Covenant of Grace, at least that they may not dare to admit any man whose known and scandalous wickednesse continued in without signes of repentance, saith within their heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.</p>
               <p>These things premised (which are to be remembred by the Reader, but need not be repeated by me as we go along) I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Arguments which prove my assertion, that the Lords Supper is not a converting but a sealing Ordinance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I shall answer Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> Arguments brought to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THat which is an institute significant signe, to declare and testifie the being of that thing which is thereby signified, is not an operating cause or mean which makes that thing si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified to begin to be where it was not. But the Sacrament is an instituted signe to declare and testifie the being of that thing which is thereby signified. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an Argument used by <note n="r" place="margin">Chamier. contract.

                  </note> Protestant writers against Papists. The <hi>Sacraments</hi> being by their definition <hi>Signes,</hi> are not causes of that which they signifie, neither are the things si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified the effects of the Sacraments. Wherefore the Sacrament of the Lords Supper being a signe of our spiritual life, faith, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ, and remission of sins, is not instituted to convey these spiritual blessings to such as have them not. <hi>Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy</hi> is one thing, <hi>efficiency</hi> another. You will say by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument there is no grace exhibited nor given to beleevers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Growth in grace and confirmation of Faith is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to beleevers in the Sacrament, which the significancy hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, because the Sacrament doth not signifie nor declare
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:95406:284"/>
that the receiver hath much grace and a strong faith; but that he hath some life of grace and some faith. The very state of grace or spiritual life, regeneration, faith and remission of sins are si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified, declared, testified, and sealed, but not wrought or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Sacrament. The strengthening of faith and a further degree of communion with Christ is not signified in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I mean, its not signified that we have it, but that we shall have it, or at most that we do then receive it. So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers may truly be said to receive at the Sacrament a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or strengthening of their faith, or a further degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ: but it cannot be said that the very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental act of eating or drinking, being a signe of spiritual life and union with Christ (as that which we have, not which we shall have, or at that instant receive) is a mean or instrumental cause to make a man have that which it testifieth or signifieth he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. There is no evasion here, for one who acknowledgeth the Sacrament to be a signe, declaring or shewing forth that we have faith in Christ, remission of sins by him, and union with him. Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> must either make blank the signification of the Sacrament <hi>à parte ante,</hi> though not <hi>à parte post,</hi> or else hold that the signification of the Sacrament, is not applicable to many of those whom he thinks fit to be admitted to receive it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which necessarily supposeth conversion and faith, doth not work conversion and faith. But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper necessarily supposeth conversion and faith. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition is so certain, that either it must be yeelded, or a contradiction must be yeelded: for that which worketh conversion and faith, cannot suppose that they are, but that they are not. Therefore that which supposeth conversion and faith, cannot work conversion and faith, because then the same thing should be supposed both to be and not to be. The Assumption I prove from Scripture. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that beleeveth and is baptized shall be saved. Act.</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Repent and be baptized. vers.</hi> 41. <hi>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized.

                     </gap>nuch said, See here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou beleevest with all thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="506" facs="tcp:95406:285"/>
                  <hi>these should not be baptized which have received the holy Ghost as well as we?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if Baptisme it self (which is the Sacrament of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiation) supposeth (according to the tenor and meaning of Christs institution) that the party baptized (if of age) doth actually convert and beleeve, and (if an infant) supposeth an interest in Jesus Christ and in the Covenant of grace (for if he be a child of an Heathen or an Infidel although taken into a Christian Family, yet the Synod of <hi>Dort. Sess.</hi> 19. adviseth not to baptize such a child, till it come to such age as to be instructed in the principles of Christian Religion.) How much more doth the Lords Supper, necessarily, by Christs institution, suppose that the receivers are not unconverted and unbeleeving persons? The previous qualifications which are supposed in Baptisme, must be much more supposed in the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That which gives us the new food, supposeth that we have the new birth and spiritual life, and that we are not still dead in sins and trespasses. But the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gives us the new food. <hi>Ergo</hi> it supposeth we have the new birth. The proposition I prove thus. <note n="s" place="margin">Synops. Pur. Theol. Disp. 43. Thes. 35.

                  </note> A man must first be born by the new birth, before he can be fed with the new food: and how can a man eat the flesh, and drink the blood of Christ, and yet be supposed not to have a spiritual life before that act, but to get a spiritual life in that very act? Doth a man get life because he eats and drinks, or doth he not rather eat and drink because he lives? The Assumption is a received and uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted truth. And hence do Divines give this reason why we are but once baptized, but do many times receive the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Supper; because it is enough to be once born, but not enough to be once nourished or strengthened. See the <hi>Belgick</hi> confession. <hi>Art.</hi> 34. and D. <hi>Parei Miscellanea Catechetica pag.</hi> 79. I shall strengthen my Argument by the Confession of <hi>Bohemia Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>The Sacraments cannot give to any such</hi> (which before was not inwardly quickened by the holy Ghost) <hi>either grace or justifying and quickening faith, and therefore they cannot justifie any man,</hi>
                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:95406:285"/>
                  <hi>nor inwardly quicken or regenerate any mans Spirit: for faith must go before.</hi> And after. <hi>For if a dead man or one that is unworthy do come to the Sacraments, certainly they do not give him life and worthinesse. &amp;c.</hi> See the <hi>Harmony of Confessions</hi> printed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> 1643. <hi>pag.</hi> 280. 281. To what end then is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper instituted? For that, see the Confession of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Ibid. pag.</hi> 320. <hi>We beleeve and confesse that Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour hath instituted the holy Sacrament of his Supper, that in it he might nourish and sustain those whom he hath regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ingrafted into his Family, which is the Church.</hi> Both these Chapters did Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> cite in the Question of <hi>Iudas</hi> (which yet prove not what he affirmeth in that point, as I have noted before) but it seems he did not observe these passages, which make directly against him in this Question of conversion or conferring of grace by the Sacrament. I add also Mr. <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in his Christian disections for receiving the Sacrament. <hi>The Sacrament</hi> saith he <hi>is appointed for our nourishment in grace; where we grow not by it, it is a signe this food was not digested but vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up again</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, That Ordinance which is instituted onely for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers and justified persons, is no converting but sealing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is instituted onely for beleevers and justified persons. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Proposition hath light enough in it self; for converting Ordinances do belong even to unjustified and unconverted persons. Therefore that which is instituted onely for beleevers is no converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. All the Question will be of the Assumption, which I shall the rather confirm, because it is the very principle from which  <hi>Polanus</hi> and others argue for the suspension of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

persons from the Lords Table. Now I prove the Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption thus. Every Sacrament, even a Sacrament of initiation, is <hi>a seal of the righteousnesse of Faith.</hi> If Circumcision was <hi>a seal of the righteousnesse of faith.

                  </gap>. <hi>For</hi> (faith he) <hi>if it be a signe of righteousnesse, and thou hast not righteousnesse, neither hast thou the signe.</hi> If therefore a Sacrament be a seal of the righteousnesse of faith, then it is insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted onely for beleevers and justified persons, because to such onely it can seal the righteousnesse of faith. Upon this ground saith <note n="u" place="margin">Ubi supra pag. 395.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Apostle argues that <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull, and whose justification is as it were a pattern of ours, was not justified by Circumcision, or (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> confesseth upon the place) that Circumcision was not the <hi>cause</hi> but the <hi>signe</hi> of Justification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9. 10. 11. <hi>We say that faith was recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Abraham for righteousnesse.

as the Sacrament of initiation, till after he was justified and sanctified, how shall we think of receiving, not onely the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of initiation, but the Sacrament of spiritual nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while unjustified and unsanctified?

               <p>Sixthly, That Ordinance which is appointed onely for such as can and do rightly examine themselves concerning their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual estate, regeneration, repentance, faith, and conversation: is no converting Ordinance.

And here that which Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> did object, maketh against himself; the Apostle saith, <hi>Let a man examine himself,</hi> not others; for the examination there spoken of belongs to the Court of a mans own Conscience, and to the inward man saith <hi>Martyr</hi> upon the place, not to the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Court. But a natural unconverted man may possibly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine others and espie a mote in his brothers eye, he cannot in any right or acceptable manner examine his own Conscience, nor go about the taking of the beam out of his own eye. <note n="z" place="margin">Ursinus Tract.

                  </note> He therefore who either cannot through ignorance, or doth not through impenitency and hardnesse of heart, examine himself, and is known to be such a one by his excusing, justifying, or not confessing his scandalous sin, or continuing in the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ought not to be admitted to that holy Ordinance which is instituted onely for such as can and do humbly and soundly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themselves, and consequently not intended for unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted impenitent persons.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Ordinance unto which one may not come without a wedding garment, is no converting Ordinance. But the Supper of the Lord, the marriage feast of the Kings son, is an Ordinance unto which one may not come without a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Proposition hath this reason for it. If a man must needs have a wedding garment that comes, then he must needs be converted that comes; for what-ever ye call the wedding garment, sure it is a thing proper to the Saints, and not common to unconverted sinners, and the want of it doth condemn a man into utter darknes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 13. The Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 11. 12. <hi>When the King came in to see the Guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment? and he was speechlesse.</hi> If he had been of Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> opinion he needed not be speechlesse; for Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> divinity might have put this answer in his mouth.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:95406:287"/>
Lord I thought this to be a converting Ordinance, and that thou wouldest not reject those that come in without a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, provided that here at the marriage feast they get one. But we see the King condemneth the man for comming in thither without a wedding garment.</p>
               <p>Eightly, That Ordinance which is not appointed to work faith is no converting ordinance. But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is not appointed to work faith. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The proposition must be granted, unlesse a man will say that conversion may be without faith. The Assumption is proved by <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. men cannot pray if they do not beleeve, and they cannot beleeve if they do not hear the Word, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>So then faith commeth by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> If faith commeth by hearing, then not by seeing; if by the word, then not by the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, That Ordinance which hath neither a promise of the grace of conversion annexed to it, nor any example in the Word of God of any converted by it, is no converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper hath neither a promise of the grace of conversion annexed to it, nor is there any example in all the Scripture of any ever converted by it. Therefore it is no converting Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, That Ordinance whereof Christ would have no unworthy person to partake is not a converting Ordinance. But the Lords Supper is an Ordinance whereof Christ would have no unworthy person to partake. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The proposition I prove thus. It is not the will of Christ that converting Ordinances should be dispenced to no unworthy person (for else how should they be converted) but onely he hath forbidden to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence unto unworthy persons such Ordinances as belong to the Communion Saints. The Assumption I prove from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Whosoever</hi> (though otherwise a worthy person &amp; one conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the state of grace) <hi>shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shal be guilty of the body &amp; blood of the Lord.</hi> v. 29. <hi>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himself, not discerning the Lords body.</hi> If the unworthines of that particular act, in respect of the manner of doing it, make a man so guilty and liable to such judgement, how much more the unworthinesse of the person that eats and drinks? For a
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:95406:288"/>
mans state, the course of his life, and the frame of his Spirit, is more then one single act. This therefore doth prove that he that is an unworthy person (if he come to the Lords Table) doth eat and drink unworthily (Whence is that where the Apostle saith <hi>vers.</hi> 29. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily,</hi> the Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack Interpreter hath it, <hi>he that eateth and drinketh thereof being unworthy,</hi> or <hi>indignus existens:</hi>) Which may be also gathered from the interweaving of vers. 28. between vers. 27. and vers. 29. He that eats and drinks, not having before rightly examined himself, eats and drinks unworthily. But he that is an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy person, and comes to the Lords Table unworthily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedly, eats and drinks not having before rightly examined himself. <hi>Ergo.</hi> What of that? will you say. <note n="a" place="margin">Magdeb. Cent. lib. cap. 4. pag. 278. <hi>Indigne eos uti docet (Paulus) qui sine vera poenitentia &amp; fide accedunt. &amp;c.</hi> Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius <hi>upon</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11. <hi>fixeth the sin of eating and drinking unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily upon the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>in regard of their contempt of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> Much to the point. Every unconverted and unregenerate person is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy person (as the Scripture distinguisheth worthy persons and unworthy) and comes unworthily and unpreparedly (if he come while such) to the Lords Table; Therefore such a one if he come, eats and drinks unworthily, and so eats and drinks judgement to himself. <note n="b" place="margin">De Tempore Scrm. 244. <hi>Et cum nullus homo velit cum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Augustine</hi> argueth promiscuously against those who come unworthily, and those that eat and drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, and applyeth the Apostles words of eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily, to all who come with polluted souls, such as all unconverted have. And <hi>Gualther, Martyr,</hi> and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters upon the place, the Centurists also in the place last cited, reckon those to eat and drink unworthily, who come without the wedding garment, and without faith, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of conversation, which intimateth that they who live unworthily, do also eat the Lords Supper unworthily, which is most plainly intimate in the <hi>Directory</hi> pag. 50. where igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, scandalous, and prophane persons are warned not to come to that holy Table, upon this reason, because he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgement to himself, which
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:95406:288"/>
necessarily implyeth that unworthy persons and prophane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, if they come to the Sacrament, are not converted, but sin more in eating and drinking unworthily. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the prohibition of eating and drinking unworthily doth necessarily imply a prohibition of unconverted, unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, impenitent persons, to come to the Lords Table, and by consequence that it is no converting Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, That Ordinance which is Eucharistical and consolatory, supposeth that such as partake of it have part and portion in that thing for which thanks are given, and are such as are fit to be comforted. But the Lords Supper is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Eucharistical and consolatory. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Proposition needs no other proof but the third Commandement; <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.</hi> Shall a man be called to give thanks for redemption, reconciliation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, and to take comfort in Jesus Christ, even while he is such a one of whom God hath said, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked: High talk becommeth not a fool. Psal.</hi> 33. 1. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord O ye righteous, for praise is comely for the upright. Psal.</hi> 50. 14. 16. <hi>Offer unto God thanksgiving &amp;c.

                  </gap>, so is the nature of it. It is also a consolatory Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in which we are called to spiritual joy and gladnesse, it being a feast of fat things full of marrow, and of wines on the lees well refined. At this Ordinance of the holy Supper Christ spake many a sweet and consolatory word to the disciples, and did not rebuke them nor chide them, as he had done at other times. Is it not then a healing slightly of the malady of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent unconverted sinners, yea a betraying of their souls to bring them to joy and comfort and thanksgivings and songs of praise, to eat of the marrow and fatnesse, and to drink of the rivers of pleasure which are in the house of God, when we ought rather call them to weeping and to mourning, to make their peace with God, and to flee from the wrath to come?</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, That Ordinance unto which Christ calleth none but such as have spiritual gracious qualifications, is not a
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:95406:289"/>
converting but a sealing Ordinance. But the Lords Supper is an Ordinance unto which Christ calleth none but such as have spiritual and gracious qualifications. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proposition I hope needs no proof, because uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted persons dead in sins and trespasses, have no spiritual graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualifications. The Assumption may be proved by many Scriptures. If of any Ordinance, chiefly of this; it holds true that Christ inviteth and calleth none but such as labour and are heavie loaden, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. such as are athirst for the water of life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 37. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. such as have the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 12. such as examine themselves 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. such as are Christs friends, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Eat O friends, drink yea drink abundantly O beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, That Ordinance which is instituted for the Communion of Saints, is intended onely for such as are Saints, and not for unconverted sinners. But the Lords Supper is an Ordinance instituted for the Communion of Saints, and of those who are members of the same body of Christ 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. 17. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin Bucer de Regno Christi lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. conceiveth that this Sacrament doth so far belong to the Communion of Saints, that wicked and unworthy persons are not onely to be kept back from partaking, but from the very beholding or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present in the Church at the giving of the Sacrament: which yet is more then we have affirmed.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, If Baptisme it self (at least when mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to those that are of age) is not a regenerating or convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance, far lesse is the Lords Supper a regenerating or converting Ordinance. But Baptisme it self (at least when mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to those that are of age) is not a regenerating or convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground of the Proposition is, because Baptisme hath a nearer relation to regeneration then the Lords Supper, and therefore hath the name of the laver of regeneration. The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption I prove thus. 1. Because we read of no persons of age baptized by the Apostles, except such as did professe faith in Christ, gladly received the Word, and in whom some begun work of the Spirit of grace did appear (I say not that it really
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:95406:289"/>
was in all, but somewhat of it did appear in all.) 2. If the Baptisme of those who are of age be a regenerating Ordinance, then you suppose the person to be baptized an unregenerated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (even as when a Minister first preacheth the Gospel to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, he cannot but suppose them to be unregenerated:) But I beleeve no consciencious Minister would adventure to baptize one who hath manifest and infallible signes of unregeneration. Sure, we cannot be answerable to God if we should minister Baptisme to a man whose works and words do manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be an unregenerated unconverted person. And if we may not initiate such a one, how shall we bring him to the Lords Table?</p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, If the Baptisme even of those who are of age must necessarily precede their receiving of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then the Lords Supper is not a converting but a sealing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. But the Baptisme even of those who are of age must necessarily precede their receiving of the Lords Supper. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Assumption is without controversie, it being the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der observed by Christ and by the Apostles, and by all Christian Churches. The Proposition I prove thus. 1. <note n="d" place="margin">Hutterus Disp. 17. de Coena Dom. Thes. 1. <hi>Sacramentum initiationis novi Test. puta Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisinum, ordine convenientissimo excipit Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationis, quod est sacra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> What better reason of the necessity of this precedency of Baptisme, than that Baptisme is the Sacrament of regeneration, the Lords Supper the Sacrament of our spiritual nourishment, and one must be borne before he eat and drink. 2. The Apostle saith <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>As many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. Rom.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>We are buried with him by Baptisme into death. Col.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Buried with him in Baptisme, wherein also you are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen with him through the faith of the operation of God.</hi> Therefore if the Sacrament of the Lords Supper be intended onely for the baptized, then it is intended onely for such as are supposed to have put on Christ, are buried and raised again with him through faith, and consequently, it is not intended for unconverted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to convert them, but for converted persons to confirme them.</p>
               <p>Sixteenthly, The Method of the parable of the forlorne
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:95406:290"/>
Son maketh very much against Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> opinion. The Lord is indeed ready to forgive, and hath compassion upon the poor sinner, and falls on his neck and kisseth him, and saith to his servants, <hi>Bring forth the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet, and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry. Luke</hi> 15. 20. 22, 23. And this is done in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and more manifestly then in any other Ordinance. But when? not while the man is yet playing the prodigal, wasting his substance with riotous living, nor yet while he is filling his belly in a far Countrey with the husks which the Swine did eat. But it was <hi>when he came to himself,</hi> when he <hi>came to his Father</hi> and said, <hi>Father I have sinned against Heaven and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> Then, and not till then, doth the father bestow upon him the best robe and the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted calf. <hi>For this my son was dead</hi> (saith the Father) <hi>and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live again, was lost and is found.</hi> Had the best robe and the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted calf been given him before he repented and came to himself, he had (belike) been so much the more carelesse of comming home to his father. But we see these love tokens, this feast, and this mirth, is for entertaining a poor penitent, not for convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an impenitent sinner.</p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, I shall draw another Argument both out of the <hi>Directory</hi> for the publike Worship of God throughout the three Kingdoms, and out of Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> himself. Thus it is. That Ordinance from which the Minister in the Name of Christ ought <hi>concionaliter</hi> or Doctrinally to excommunicate all impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent prophane persons, is not a converting but a sealing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But the Lords Supper is an Ordinance from which the Minister ought in the Name of Christ <hi>concionaliter</hi> or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally to excommunicate all impenitent prophane persons, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proposition ariseth from this ground, we ought not to dehort impenitent prophane men from converting Ordinances, but rather exhort them to come and partake thereof. The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption I prove, First, from the <hi>Directory</hi> in the head of the Lords Supper, which speaketh of the Minister thus, <hi>Next, he is, in the Name of Christ on the one part to warn all such as are</hi>
                  <pb n="517" facs="tcp:95406:290"/>
                  <hi>ignorant, scandalous, prophane, or that live in any sin or offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their knowledge or Conscience, that they presume not to come to that holy Table, shewing them that he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgement to himself. And on the other part he is in especial manner to invite and encourage all that labour under the sence of the burthen of their sins, and fear of wrath, and desire to reach out unto a greater progresse in grace then yet they can attain unto, to come to the Lords Tàble.</hi> Is it not here held forth as the will of Christ, that no prophane impenitent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted person ought or may come to the Lords Table, but onely such as have somewhat of the work of grace in them? But let us hear Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> himself. The seventh difference which he stateth between his Antagonists and himself <hi>pag.</hi> 28. is this. <hi>Whether the Minister hath not fully discharged his Duty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science if he give warning to unworthy Communicants of the danger they incurr by their unworthy approaches to the Lords Table, and seriously dehort them from comming to it, unlesse they repent, reform, and come prepared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be a right stating of that difference (and if it be true which Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> in his Epistle to the Parliament <hi>pag.</hi> 7. saith, that <hi>it is a very great and dangerous sin, if they come without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, and charity, wherein the Minister must instruct his people publikely and privatly.</hi>) Then I suppose that Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> will not deny that a Minister ought in duty and conscience to do all this, to admonish a scandalous unworthy person, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously dehort &amp;c. Onely he contends that the Minister is not bound in duty and conscience after all this to keep back such from the Sacrament. Well: I take for the present what he grants: and even by that I prove the Lords Supper is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance; for if it were. 1. How dare any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster seriously dehort any unworthy person from approaching to it? May we forbid sinners to use the means of their conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, especially if they be such as are not excommunicated nor cast out of the Church, and do desire to receive the Sacrament? (which are the cases often put by Mr. <hi>Prynn.</hi>) 2. How can the Minister warn such persons not to come to the Sacrament <hi>unlesse they repent, reform, and come prepared?</hi> If it be not a sealing Ordinance intended onely for such as do repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:95406:291"/>
the Minister may not say so. 3. And otherwise the sence were this, that such persons ought not to come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance, unlesse they be converted; for to repent, reform, and come prepared, are things which none can do who are not converted. Finally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> his principles, we may as well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea rather, dehort men from comming to hear the Word unlesse they repent and reform. For <hi>pag.</hi> 44. he saith that the Sacrament is <hi>as converting, yea a more humbling, regenerating, converting Ordinance then the Word.</hi> Which if it be so, then we may more warrantably and with lesse danger to the souls of those who do not repent and reform, dehort them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Word, then from comming to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Eighteenthly, That Ordinance which is not communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Heathens or Pagans, nor to excommunicated Christians, for their conversion from darknesse to light, from the power of Sathan to God, from the state of sin to the state of repentance, is not a converting Ordinance. But the Lords Supper is such. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reason of the Proposition is, because converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are communicable to Heathens: and thence proceeded the general Commission to preach the Gospel to every creature, and to teach all Nations <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19 <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. which accordingly the Apostles did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 6. And if the Sacrament be a converting Ordinance for known impenitent scandalous prophane persons within the Church, what reason is there imaginable why it is not also a converting Ordinance for Heathens, Pagans, Turks, Jews? Or where have we the least hint in Scripture that an Ordinance which may convert the prophanest unexcommunicated person within the Church, cannot convert both Heathens and excommunicated Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?</p>
               <p>The Assumption I prove from Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. <hi>though the Sacrament</hi> saith he <hi>must not be administred to Heathens, to whom the Gospel may and must be preached, before they beleeve and professe Christ: yet it must be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to them as well as Baptisme, after their beleef and profession of Christ.</hi> Where he clearly grants both Sacraments, Baptisme and the Lords Supper, to be onely sealing and confirming (not
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:95406:291"/>
converting) Ordinances to Heathens, and therefore not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to them, till after they beleeve and professe Christ.</p>
               <p>Nineteenthly, That Ordinance which is not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable nor lawful to be administred to any known impenitent sinner under that notion, but onely as penitent sinners, truly repenting of their sins past, is not a converting but a sealing Ordinance. But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is such. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proposition I prove thus. A converting Ordinance may be administred to known impenitent sinners under that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or lookt upon as such, wallowing in their blood and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse. Yea a converting Ordinance <hi>qua</hi> converting, is not (nor indeed can be) administred to penitent sinners <hi>qua</hi> peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or lookt upon as truly converted. For as every effect is in order of nature posterior to its cause, so a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance being the instrumental cause of conversion, regeneration, and repentance, it must needs be supposed that conversion and repentance doth not in order of nature precede but follow after the administration of the converting Ordinance.</p>
               <p>The Assumption is granted by Mr. <hi>Prynn pag.</hi> 37. <hi>The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> (saith he) <hi>doth not</hi> (I suppose he will also say <hi>ought not) administer the Sacrament to any known impenitent sinners under that notion, but onely as penitent sinners, truly repenting of their sins past, and promising, purposing to lead a new life for the future.</hi> Therefore yet again by some of his own principles, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not administred as instrumental to the first conversion of scandalous unworthy persons in the Church: for where there is in any Ordinance an instrumental causality toward the conversion of a scandalous person, that Ordinance must needs be administred to that person under the notion of an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted person, and the effect of conversion lookt upon as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, not as antecedent.</p>
               <p>The twentieth Argument and the last is this. As I have before shewed that Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> in holding the Sacrament to be a converting Ordinance, unto which unregenerate impenitent and unbeleeving persons (not being excommunicated) ought to be admitted, doth joyn issue with Papists, and dissenteth
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:95406:292"/>
from the Protestant writers in a very special point, and that the controversie draweth very deep: So I will now make it to appear that he dissenteth as much from the Ancients in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. <hi>Dionysius Areopagita de Eccles. Hierarch. Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Part.</hi> 3. speaking of the nature of this Ordinance of the Lords Supper, tells us that it doth not admit those scandalous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who were in the condition of penitents, before they had fully manifested their repentance, much lesse prophane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean persons in whom no signe of repentance appeareth; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>not admitting him who is not altogether most holy. Just in Martyr Apol.</hi> 2. lets us know that in his time the Lords Supper was given to none, but to such a person as was lookt upon as a beleever, and washed in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of regeneration, and lived according to the rule of Christ. <hi>Chrysostome Hom.</hi> 83. <hi>in Matth. Augustine de side &amp; operibus Cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Isidorus Pelusiota lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 143. and others might be here added. But I shall bring their full testimonies chap. 17. where I will shew Antiquity to be for the suspension of scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons unexcommunicated. Beside these, I add also <note n="e" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Beda</hi> upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. who tells us both out of <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> that none ought to come to the Lords Table but a justified person, and such a one as abideth in Christ and Christ in him. <hi>Isidorus de Ecclesiast. offic. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. citing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles words, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily,</hi> addeth. <note n="f" place="margin">Hoc est enim indignè accipere, si eo tempore quis accipiat, quo debet agere poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam.</note> 
                  <hi>For this is to receive unworthily, if any man receive at that time in which he should be repenting.</hi> The same words hath <hi>Rabanus Maurus de Instit. Cleric. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. Which plainly sheweth us that in their Judgement, the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per doth suppose conversion and repentance to be already wrought, and if it be not wrought, the receiving is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving.</p>
               <p>Moreover that the Lords Supper was not anciently esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a converting Ordinance, but a sealing Ordinance, supposing conversion, is more then apparent by the distinction of <hi>Missa</hi>
                  <pb n="521" facs="tcp:95406:292"/>
                  <hi>Catechumenorum</hi> and <hi>Missa fidellum:</hi> and by that proclamation in the Church before the Sacrament, <hi>Sancta Sanctis,</hi> the sence whereof <hi>Durantus de ritibus, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 55. <hi>num.</hi> 15. giveth out of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that <hi>Sancta Sanstis</hi> was as much as to say: <hi>Si quis non est sanctus, non accedat: If any man be not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let him not approach.</hi> Or as if it had been said to them, The Sacrament is a holy thing, <hi>sancti &amp; vos cum sitis sancto Spiritu donati; and seeing you also are holy, the holy Spirit being given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; atque ita sancta sanctis conveniant, and so holy things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to holy persons.</hi> If the Lords Supper be a holy thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended onely for holy persons, then (sure) it is no converting Ordinance.</p>
               <p>I might also cite divers School-men against Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> in this particular. I shall instance but in two for the present. <hi>Scotus in lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Sent. dist.</hi> 9. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 1. proveth from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. that it is a mortal sin for a man to come to the Sacrament at that time when he is living in a mortal sin; and that he who is not spiritually a member of Christ, ought not to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is a signe of incorporation into Christ. <hi>Alexander Alensis part</hi> 4. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 11. <hi>Membr.</hi> 2. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. saith thus. <hi>As there is a double bodily medicine</hi> (curativa &amp; conservativa) <hi>one for cure, another for conservation, so there is a double spiritual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, to wit</hi> (curativa &amp; conservativa) <hi>one for cure, another for conservation; repentance for the cure, the Eucharist for conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIIII.</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> his twelve Arguments brought to prove that the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is a converting Ordinance, discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and answered.</head>
               <p>IT shall be now no hard businesse to answer Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> twelve Arguments, brought by him to refute my assertion, that that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is no converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. See <hi>Vindic. pag.</hi> 41. to 45.</p>
               <p>First he tells us we grant that moral carnal Christians, and all such as are not convicted of scandalous sins, are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Sacrament. <hi>Thrrefore doubtlesse</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is and was intended by Christ for a converting Ordinance to all such as these, to turn them from their evil waies, and work saving grace within their hearts, since it can have no other proper primary effect in such. Certainly God and Christ bestow no Ordinances upon men in vain; therefore their intentions in instituting this Supper, even for such visible, moral, unregenerate Christian, as well as real Saints, must necessarily be for their conversion, not their confirmation and sealing onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ. Lapsus in initio mali augurii est.</hi> He confoundeth here things most different. 1. He confoundeth our admitting of Communicants, with Gods intention to do good to their souls: and his Argument runs upon this mistake, that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth good to the souls of all who come to the Lords Table,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:95406:293"/>
though wicked close Hypocrites; and since this good cannot be sealing onely, it must be conversion. But it is neither sealing, nor conversion, nor any good at all which God intends by that Ordinance to them that perish: yet it is not in vain: for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells us <hi>pag.</hi> 34. that even in these, the Minister administring the Sacrament, is a sweet savour to God, who hath appointed the Sacrament <hi>secundarily and contingently, to be a means of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating mens sins and condemnation, to magnifie his justice.</hi> 2. There is a most dangerous mistake in that which he saith of the intentions of God and of Christ. If he mean of what God intendeth or purposeth in the Councel of his own will, that in this sence God intendeth the conversion of those that perish, is to make void and frustraneous the decree, will, and intention of God, which is grosse Arminianisme and Jesuitisme. But if he mean <hi>finis operis,</hi> the proper end for which the Sacrament was instituted, and the good which the Word of God tells us we ought to seek, and may through the grace of God find in the Sacrament: Then in that sence, to say that Christs intention in instituting this Sacrament was for conversion of moral unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Christians, is meerly a begging of what is in question. The like I say of that proper primary effect of the Sacrament in such. If he mean the proper primary effect decreed in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret counsel of God, he myres himself in Arminianisme. If he mean the proper primary effect of the Sacrament in respect of its own nature, this is but <hi>petere principium.</hi> 3. All who pretend right to the Sacrament are either visible Saints, qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the rule of Christ, and such as the Eldership (examining their profession and practice according to the rules of the word) judgeth fit to be admitted to the Sacrament; or they are not such. If they be such, then the end and use of the Sacrament in reference to them, is to be a sealing Ordinance. for the Eldership judgeth and supposeth them fit to be sealed and confirmed, so far as they can understand, and in that capacity do admit them: God onely being able to judge close Hypocrites. If they be not qualified, as I have said, then we do not grant that they ought to be admitted.</p>
               <p>His second Argument hath no strength at all. All Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es which strengthen grace do more or lesse begin or beget it, and
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:95406:294"/>
the Directory it self calls the Sacraments means of grace <hi>pag.</hi> 52. What then? The Directory calls this Sacrament means of grace, because by it <hi>Christ and all his benefits are applied and sealed up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us,</hi> and we <hi>are sealed up by his Spirit to an assurance of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and everlasting life.</hi> But (saith he) why may not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments convert as well as confirm. I have given many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for it. If he could prove that what confirms doth also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, why did he not do it? If he could not prove it, why brings he a strong affirmation instead of an Argument? As for that which he addeth, that the Lords Supper is received not once as Baptism, but frequently. <hi>For this very end, that those who often fall into sin through infirmity, may likewise by this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per often rise again, be refreshed, comforted, and get strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their corruptions and sins: and is it not then a converting as well as a confirming Ordinance?</hi> What a wavering is here? Is the raising, refressiing, and comforting of those who often fall through infirmity, the conversion or first grace which now we dispute of? Or whether doth he not here yeeld the cause? For the refreshing and comforting and strengthening of those that fall through infirmity, is the effect of a confirming not of a converting Ordinance. And in this sence Divines have given a reason, why we are but once baptized, but do often receive the Lords Supper, because Baptisme is the Sacrament of our initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the laver of regeneration; (I mean not that which hath been called <hi>Baptismal regeneration,</hi> fancied to be common to all the baptized, but I mean that which is wrought in and sealed to the Elect baptized) the Lords Supper is the Sacrament of our spiritual nourishment and strengthening: and it is enough to be once born, once regenerate, but we must be often nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and strengthened.</p>
               <p>His third Argument is this. The very receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <hi>even in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nregenerate persons,</hi> is accompanied with such things <hi>as are most effectual to convert.</hi> As 1. <hi>With a previous external serious examination of their own hearts and estates between God and their own Consciences. 2. A solemn searching out of all their open or secret sins and corruptions, past or present, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a serious particular privat confession of them, a hearty contrition and humiliation for them &amp;c. 3. Pious soul ravishing</hi>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:95406:294"/>
                  <hi>meditations &amp;c. which make deep temporary impressions on their hearts 4. Flexanimous exhortations, admonitions, commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, directions, prayers by the Ministers in the Congregation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in, and after this dutie.</hi> Whereupon he leaveth it to every mans Conscience to judge whether this Sacrament is not <hi>more likelie to regenerate and change their hearts, and lives, then the bare Word preached, or any other Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Here is a lump of wild, uncouth, and most erroneous Divinity. Who ever heard of an external examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mens hearts between God and their own Consciences? Or 2. That unregenerate persons can and do seriously examine their own hearts, and search out all their sins with a hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and humiliation for them? &amp;c. Or 3. That <hi>deep temporary impressions on their hearts</hi> are most effectual to convert and regenerate (for he doth enumerate all these as particulars most effectual to convert.) Or 4. That in the very receiving of the Sacrament, men hear the Ministers prayers in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. 5. That this Sacrament <hi>is more likely to regenerate then the bare Word preached</hi> (I suppose he means not the word without the Spirit (for nobody holds the bare word in that sence to regenerate) but preaching without other concurring Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance) <hi>or any other Ordinance.</hi> Which if it be, he cannot choose but allow to give the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to excommunicated persons, and to the unbaptized, whether Heathens or Jews, being of age, and desiring to receive it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If all the whole Antecedent part of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were granted, the consequence is naught: for this must be the consequence, If examination of mens hearts, the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of all their sins, confession, contrition, prayers, vowes, meditations, exhortations, which do accompany the Sacrament, be most effectual to convert and to beget grace, then the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a converting Ordinance. Which consequence he will never prove. Put the case that self-examination, confession, prayers, vowes, meditations, exhortations, at the calling of a Parliament, at the going out of an Army, at the choosing of Magistrates or Ministers, at the death of Parents, friends, &amp;c. prove effectual to conversion; Shall we therefore say that the calling of a Parliament, the going out of the Army, the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:95406:295"/>
of Ministers or Magistrates, the death of Parents or friends, are converting Ordinances?</p>
               <p>His fourth Argument alone is syllogistical (I wish all his Arguments throughout his whole book had been such, that the strength or weaknesse thereof might the sooner appear) <hi>That Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n we most immedietly converse with God and Christ, and have more intimate visible sensible communion with them, then in any other, is certainly the most powerful and effectual Ordinance of all others, to humble, regenerate, convert, and beget true grace within us. &amp;c. But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper by our Antagonists own confession is such. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I retort his Argument against himself. That Ordinance wherein we most immediatly converse with God and Christ, and have more intimate communion with them then in any other, is a sealing, confirming, but not a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance. For they who are converting have not such intimate communion and immediat conversing with God and Christ, as they who are already converted and do walk with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did and are filled <hi>with all joy and peace in beleeving, Rom.</hi> 15. 13. even with joy unspeakable and full of glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. The daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> being sick of love for Christ, yet are far from that communion with him, which his Spouse longer acquainted with him did enjoy, therefore they ask at her, whither her beloved was gone that they might seek him with her. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6 1. Hath the child fed with milk more communion and conversing with his father, then the son come to years, who eateth and drinketh at his fathers Table? Do we not see often a servent convert like <hi>Apollos,</hi> whom an <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> must take and expound unto him the way of God more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>2. I deny his Proposition as he frames it, for the plain English of it is this; If it be a sealing, comforting, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance, then it is a converting Ordinance, which I clear thus. He takes his <hi>Medium</hi> from his Antagonists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, for they accord (saith he) that we have more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate communion with God in this Ordinance then in any other, for as much as in this Sacrament Christ is <hi>more particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and the remission of our sins more sensibly sealed to us then in</hi>
                  <pb n="527" facs="tcp:95406:295"/>
                  <hi>any other Ordinance: from whence I thus infallibly conclude against these opposites.</hi> Then follows his Argument, which is no other then a putting of the converted in the condition of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or the unconverted in the capacity of the converted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to prove it converts, because it seals.</p>
               <p>3. If this Sacrament be <hi>the most powerful and effectual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of all others, to humble, regenerate, convert, and beget true grace:</hi> it will follow that we ought (at least may) give the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament not onely to the most ignorant and scandalous within the Church, but to Turks, Pagans, Jews, and to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated persons, as I said before.</p>
               <p>4. He challengeth his Antagonists for crying up and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifying this Sacrament above the Word preached, and by way of opposition tells them that he hath in some former Tractates proved <hi>Gods presence and Spirit to be as much, as really present in other Ordinances as in this. Vindic. pag.</hi> 37 yet now I see no man who doth so much as himself, magnifie the Sacrament above the Word.</p>
               <p>5. Whereas he brings this proof for his <hi>Major</hi> Proposition: <hi>because the manifestation, revelation, and proximity of God and Christ to the soul, is that which doth most of all humble and convert it.</hi> If this hold true in the generality as he propounds it, then the Spirits of just men made perfect and glorified, are converted by the revelation and proximity of God and of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have unconceaveably more then the Saints on earth. But neither in this world doth the manifestation and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God and of Christ, prove conversion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation to be <hi>in fieri</hi> at that instant when God so manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth and revealeth himself, which is the thing he had to prove. I give instance in divers of those Scriptures cited by himself: Gods revealing of himself to <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 38. and 42. to <hi>Isaiah, chap.</hi> 6. Christs manifesting of his power to <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 5. was after, not at their conversion, so that <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. 14. But heteregeneous impertinent quotations of Scripture are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with him: I am sorry I have cause to say it. Some other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which here he citeth may be expounded of Gods proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to us, and ours to God in Conversion, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 6. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 7. But that this kind of proximity
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:95406:296"/>
which doth convert, is in the Sacrament, he hath supposed, but not proved.</p>
               <p>His fifth Argument is taken from the converting power of the Word: that which makes conversion by the Word is the particular application of Christ and the promises. Now the Sacrament doth most particularly and effectually apply Christ and the promises <hi>unto every Communicants eyes, ears, heart, and soul, far livelier then the Word preached.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This is a meer fallacy, <hi>à dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter:</hi> and easily discovered. The Sacrament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth Christ, but to whom? not to the unconverted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers (for that were to give a seal without a charter) but to those that are supposed to be converted and beleevers. He had this to prove, That the Sacrament doth apply Christs death, passion, and merits to unconverted persons, and to unbeleevers, yea to their heart and soul. 2. That the Sacrament doth apply the death, passion, and merits of Christ to the Communicants <hi>ears,</hi> and that far livelier than the word preached, is to me a riddle which I think will trouble Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> himself to expound. 3. A great controversie there hath been about the orall or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral manducation of the body of Christ in the Sacrament. But Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> out-runneth here all <hi>Ubiquitaries</hi> in the World, for he hath said no lesse then that every Communicant eateth spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and by faith the body of Christ, even unconverted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for he saith, that this Sacrament <hi>doth most particularly, fully, lively, and sensibly apply the promises, yea the death, passion, and merits of Christ unto EVERY Communicants eyes, ears, HEART and SOUL.</hi> Which is plainly universal grace to all who ever received this Sacrament (and so to <hi>Iudas,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his principles) and to all who ever shall receive it. 4. Whereas he would confirm this which he saith, by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonists Confession; I do not think he can give any conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous account of that word. Who said it, or where? He must needs hold universal grace, hold it who will. 5. Here lies the strength of his Argument: The Word converts by applying Christ, therefore the Sacrament, which doth more lively apply Christ to every Communicant, must be a converting Ordinance. Which necessarily implyeth, that all who receive the Sacrament
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:95406:296"/>
are converted. Yea if application inferre conversion, as the effect of the Application, the Saints and Beleevers themselves must be again constituted in the first Article of Conversion, and transition from the estate of nature and unregeneration. 6. The Application of Christ in the Word unto Conversion, is a thing of another nature than the Sacramental application of Christ, and therefore like effects ought not to be ascribed unto these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: For the Application of Christ made in the Word preached to the unconverted to convert them, is <hi>per influxum Physicum,</hi> by a most efficacious life-giving influence, as when <hi>Elisha</hi> applyed himself to the <hi>Shunnamites</hi> dead child, or like that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 25. and 11. 43. But this manner of influence or causality is denied to the Sacrament by many of the Schoolmen and Papists themselves. So much of his fifth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I thought to answer in two words, if the many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities in it had given me leave.</p>
               <p>His sixth Argument is this, All grant that God doth as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually convert by the eye as by the ear. <hi>All grant.</hi> I deny it. and I verily beleeve he can produce very few Authors (if any) for it. He ought not to speak so great words without good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, which here I am sure he hath not. Well: but he will prove the thing it self. First he tells us of the book of Nature, and of the Creatures, by which we are instructed &amp;c. But either he means that the very book of Nature can and doth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and savingly convert to Faith in Christ and to true san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or not. If the affirmative, then the Heathens who lived and died in Paganisme had sufficient means and helps to conversion and faith in Christ: (for those Pagans had the book of the Creatures to instruct them, as is expressed in some Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures cited by himself) and so there may be salvation and the means thereof without the Church. If this be not his meaning, but that the book of Nature instructeth us concerning many things of God, yet doth not teach us to know Christ and all things necessary to salvation, far lesse doth effectually and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly convert: then he hath said nothing to that point which he had to prove. 2. He saith that all the Sacrifices of the old Law, and Circumcision, and the Passeover did teach Gods people who participated of them, or were present at them, by the eye, and
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:95406:297"/>
were converting Ordinances, <hi>as all do and must acknowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here is another tinckling Cymbal. Do all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Sacraments of the Old Testament were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinances? There can be no rational account given here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Certainly our Writers before cited, and diverse others who denie the Sacraments of the New Testament to be converting Ordinances, never meant to admit that the Sacraments of the old Testament were converting Ordinances. 2. How Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision did teach by the eye those who did participate of that Ordinance, and so Infants, is another riddle. 3. If Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Law had been converting Ordinances, yet that cannot be a just parallel to Sacraments, except seeking to make the Lords Supper a converting Ordinance we convert it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Sacrifice for sin, as Papists do. But neither doth he offer the least colour of reason to prove that all the external Sacrifices of the old Law were converting Ordinances, which here he affirmeth. The Apostle speaketh otherwise of the Legal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which he saith <hi>could not make him that did the service per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as pertaining to the Conscience: Heb.</hi> 99. and therefore calls all those rites <hi>carnal Ordinances, vers.</hi> 10. for though they were spiritual in respect of their signification and typifying of Christ, and sealing the Covenant of grace to the faithful in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, yet they were not spiritual in regard of their giving of grace or working conversion or purging the Conscience, for they had no such operation nor effect.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> confirms his present Argument by the miracles of the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, <hi>which</hi> (saith he) <hi>converted thousands without preaching, did convert and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men by the eye without the ear.</hi> For proof whereof he cites abundance of Texts of Scripture which do not prove what he saith, nay some of them prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>Some of the Scriptures cited, do not prove conversion and regeneration by miracles, but either confirmation as <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 11. after the miracle, it is added, <hi>and his Disciples beleeved on him.</hi> Or some preparatory initial work before regeneration, as that <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 2. Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> will hardly prove that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready regenerated at that instant, when he knew not what rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration was: Or that those <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 23. who beleeved on Christ
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:95406:297"/>
when they saw his miracles at the feast, had any more then a temporary faith, it being said of them, that <hi>Iesus did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself unto them, because he knew all men. Act.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 25. 26. tell us of some who at the sight of miracles were stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with fear and amazement, and gave glory to God, which proves not that miracles did convert, but convince. The like I say of 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 38. 39. Other Texts cited by him make expresse mention of the Word as a mean of the conversion which was wrought, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 50. <hi>the man beleeved the Word that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus had spoken,</hi> and this was before the miracle. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 31. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beleeved, but they heard Christ preach <hi>vers.</hi> 14. So <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 45. those Jewes who beleeved on Christ after they had seen the miracle, did also hear that which Christ said, yea their beleeving is mentioned as an effect of their hearing, <hi>vers.</hi> 41. 42. So <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Stephen</hi> did indeed great miracles, but the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the number of the Disciples, is referred to the Word, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 6. it is expressely said, <hi>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. Quâ fide</hi> hath Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> cited this very Text to prove that men were converted by miracles without the Word, by the eye without the ear. Some other Scriptures by him quoted prove onely a popular confluence and the multitudes following of Christ. Having seen his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 2. <hi>and</hi> 11. 47. 48. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 30. 31. For <hi>the people were inclined to hearken to doctrine by miracles, which moveth natural men to flock together to see strange things</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Hussey. Plea for Christian Magistracy, pag.</hi> 30. which he is pleased to clear by peoples flocking to a Mountebank. Other Texts which he citeth, speak of miracles, but not a syllable of conversion or regeneration wrought by miracles, as <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 11. 12. Among the rest of the Texts he citeth <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 26. <hi>Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.</hi> And hence forsooth he will prove that miracles did convert and regenerate men. I had not touched these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, were it not that I desire Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> himself in the fear of God may be convinced of his making too bold with the Scripture in citing and applying it very far amisse: and that for the future his Reader may be wary, and not take from him upon
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:95406:298"/>
trust a heap of Scriptural quotations, such as often he bringeth.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, he tells us, That <hi>the things we see with our eyes do more affect, and beget deeper impressions in our hearts, then the things we hear.</hi> He means (I think) do more effectually convert, for so he makes the Application, that <hi>the very beholding of Christs Person, passion, without the Word, were the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual means of working contrition, conversion, &amp;c.</hi> Well: What is his proof? He citeth Christs words to his Disciples, <hi>Blessed are your eyes for they see:</hi> (without adding the rest, <hi>and your ears, for they hear</hi>) and <hi>Simeons</hi> words, <hi>Mine eyes have seen thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> as if forsooth either <hi>Simeon</hi> or the Apostles had been converted and regenerated by the seeing of Christs person. He cites also <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 46, 47, 48. as if all who (beholding Christs pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and death) smote upon their breasts, had been by that sight converted and regenerated. That the things we behold with our eyes, if they be great or strange things work deep impressions, there can be no doubt of it. But that the hearing of great things may not work as deep impressions, or that seeing without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth convert and regenerate, hath been strongly affirmed by Mr. <hi>Prynn,</hi> but not yet proved.</p>
               <p>I proceed to his seventh Argument which is this. The most melting soul-changing meditation is the serious contemplation of Christs death and Passion. No meditation comparable to this, to <hi>regenerate and convert a carnal heart.</hi> And is not this <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally represented to our eyes, hearts, in this very Sacrament in a more powerful prevailing manner then in the Word alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That which he had to subsume and prove is, that this Sacrament worketh in a unregenerate carnal heart such soul changing meditations of the death and passion of Christ, as it never had before (the soul having never before been regenerate) Which being the point to be proved, why did he not prove it, if he could? No doubt the Sacrament is a most powerful mean to beget in the hearts of beleevers and regenerate persons most humbling and melting meditations concerning the death of Christ. But that it begetteth any soul changing or regenerating meditations in those in whom the Word hath never yet begun the work of regeneration and conversion; I do as much disagree in this, as I agree in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="533" facs="tcp:95406:298"/>The eighth Argument which he brings is from comparing the Sacrament with afflictions. <hi>Our own corporal external affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are many times without the Word the means of our repentance and conversion unto God, &amp;c. Then much more the Sacrament, wherein the afflictions of Christ himself are so visibly set forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is a very bad consequence, for the strength resolves into this principle, an unregenerate carnal man will be more affected and moved with the representation of Christs afflictions, than with the feeling of his own corporal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 2. Affliction doth not convert without the Word either going before or accompanying it (unlesse we say that Pagans or Turks may be converted savingly by affliction before ever they hear the Word.) <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 12. <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenest and teachest him out of thy Law. Job.</hi> 36. 9. 10. 11. <hi>And if they be bound in fetters, and holden in cords of affliction. Then he sheweth them their work and their transgression that they have exceeded. He openeth also their ear to Discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</hi> Behold conversion by afflictions, but not without the Word. While Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> goeth about to prove that afflictions convert without the Word, the first Text he citeth is <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 67. 71. where expresse mention is made of the Word.</p>
               <p>3 As for <hi>Manasseh</hi> his conversion 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 11. 12. it was wrought by the means of affliction, setting home upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that Word of God mentioned in the verse imediatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, which saith <hi>and the Lord spake to Manasseh and to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but they would not hearken.</hi> Let him shew the like instance of the conversion by the Sacrament of such as would not hearken to the Word, and I shall yeeld the cause. The Word is expresse, that affliction is one special powerful mean of conversion, but it no where saith any such thing of the Sacrament. 4. It was also incumbent to him to prove that afflictions do convert without the Word, not onely at such times and in such places as do sequester a person from the liberty of hearing the Word preached, but also when and where the Word is freely enjoyed. Otherwise how far is he from concluding by Analogy the point he had to prove? which is, that an unregenerate person living
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:95406:299"/>
under the Ministery of the Gospel, and being an ordinary hearer, never converted by the Word, may neverthelesse (according to the dispensation of the grace of God revealed in Scripture) be converted by the Sacrament received?</p>
               <p>His ninth Argument is this. <hi>That Ordinance whose unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy participation is a means of our spiritual obduration, must by the rule of contraries when worthily received, be the instrument of our mortification, conversion, salvation. But the unworthy receiving of the Sacrament is a means &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Argument doth necessarily suppose, that an unconverted, unmortified, unworthy person, while such, may yet worthily receive (and so by that means be converted) the contrary whereof I have demonstrated in my tenth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. If the Sacrament be not worthily received, without repentance, faith, and self-examination (for which cause men are dehorted to come, except they repent &amp;c.) then there is perfect non-sence in the Argument, for to say that the Sacrament when worthily received is the instrument of conversion, is as much as this; The Sacrament is an instrument of conversion to those who are already converted. 3. That rule of Contraries is extremely mis-applyed. The rule is <hi>Oppositorum, quatenus talia, opposita sunt attributa, Contraries have contrary attributes.</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Vide Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerm. System. log. lib. 3. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0.</note> The comparison must be made <hi>secundum differentias quibus dissident,</hi> Otherwise that old fallacy were a good Argument. A single life is good, therefore Marriage is evil; Virginity is pure, therefore Marriage is impure: Whereas Marriage and single life are not opposed in the point of good and evil, purity and impurity, but in the point of immunity from worldly cares and troubles. So it is a bad consequence (at least against us) unworthy receiving of the Sacrament is an instrument of obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Ergo</hi> Worthy receiving of it is a mean of conversion. For we hold that worthy receiving and unworthy receiving are not opposed in point of conversion, but in point of sealing: the worthy receiving seals remission and salvation: the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving seals judgement. But Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> still takes for granted what he had to prove; <hi>viz.</hi> That this particular is one of those <hi>differentiae quibus dissident ista Opposita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come on to his tenth Argument. Its taken from the ends
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:95406:299"/>
for which this Sacrament was ordained. 1. The keeping in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory Christs death. 2. <hi>The ratification and sealing of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and Covenant of grace unto the receivers souls.</hi> 2. <hi>To be a pledge and symbole of that most neer and effectual communion which Christians have with Christ, and that spiritual union which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy with him.</hi> 4. <hi>To feed the communicants souls in assured hope of eternal life.</hi> 5. To be a pledge of their resurrection. 6. <hi>To seal unto them the assurance of everlasting life.</hi> 7. To binde them as it were by an oath of fidelity to Christ, Whereupon he asketh how it is possible that this Sacrament <hi>should not both in Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Christs ordination, be a converting as well as a sealing Ordinance, since that which doth seal all these particulars to mens souls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>must needs more powerfully perswade, pierce, melt, relent, convert an obdurate heart and unregenerate sinner then the Word it self?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. His Argument may be strongly retorted against himself, divers of these ends of the Sacrament being such as are incompetent and unapplicable to obdurate and unregenerate sinners: How did he imagine that even to such as these, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth ratifie and seal to their souls all the promises and Covenant of grace, they not having yet closed with Christ in the Covenant? Or how will he make it to appear, that this Sacrament is a pledge of a most neer union and communion with Christ, even to those who are yet far from any union with Christ? Or how shall they be fed in hope and sealed in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of everlasting life, who are yet under the curse of the Law and state of condemnation? Surely Master <hi>Prynne</hi> granting here that the Sacrament is ordained of Christ to seal, and that it <hi>doth seal all these particulars to mens souls,</hi> doth thereby yeeld the whole cause. For that which doth seal all these particulars to mens souls, most certainly doth not convert, but presuppose conversion. 2. If this Sacrament be by Gods intention a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance, and Gods intention being by him distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from Christs ordination, whether doth it not necessarily follow both from this and from his first Argument (unto which this gives more light) that God did in the secret counsel of his Will intend and decree the Conversion of <hi>the flintiest heart and obdurest spirit,</hi> as he speaketh; and that either this effect is
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:95406:300"/>
wrought by the Sacrament in the flintiest heart and obduratest spirit (which I believe he dare not say) or that Gods decree and intention is frustrate? 3. And if the Sacrament <hi>must needs more powerfully perswade, pierce, melt, relent, convert an obdurate heart and unregenerate sinner then the Word it self;</hi> how then can he either seclude Pagans, or dehort impenitent unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>His eleventh Argument is the grossest and palpablest <hi>petitio principii</hi> of any that ever I met with, and to be offered to none except such as cannot distinguish between that which is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that which is proved. First he tells us what true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version is, and then asks if any thing be so prevalent to effect this as the Sacrament. This therefore I passe.</p>
               <p>His twelfth and last Argument is an appealing to the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christians. But a part of his appeal is of no use; that is, Whether this Sacrament doth not strengthen against corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tentations, which doth not touch this present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie. It is as little to the purpose which he saith of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version by preparations to the Sacrament, which may be by the Word, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that many thousands of converted Christians will experimentally affirm, that the receiving of the Sacrament was the first effectual means of their conversion, <hi>yea, that they had not been converted had they been debarred from it for their former scandalous sins,</hi> I do as confidently deny it as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it: and if any who hath been a scandalous liver, whose heart was never yet turned, humbled, broken, changed by the Word, nor by any other mean of grace, should affirm that his very receiving of the Sacrament did effectually convert him, I durst not herein give credit to him. For <hi>to the Law and to the Testimony; If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</hi> And whereas he concludes, <hi>For shame therefore disclaim this absurd irreligious paradox, for which there is not the least shadow of Scripture or solid reason:</hi> I shall wish him for shame to disclaim this and many such like expressions more bold and arrogant, then either prudent or conscientious. And the intelligent Reader who considereth my twenty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that which he calls so absurd, and my Answers to all his twelve Arguments, will easily judge where the shame and
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:95406:300"/>
irreligiousnesse will lie. If at his door, let him look to it. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba ligustra cadunt, vaccin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>All that he addeth pag. 45, 46, 47, being at best rhetorical, not rational, and a superstructure upon that foundation, that the Lords Supper is a Converting Ordinance; it needs no batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but falls of it self, the foundation being taken away. And as we ought not nor cannot without sin suspend scandalous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the Sacrament, if it be a Converting Ordinance (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which supposition also both the Advice of the Assembly of Divines, and the Ordinance of Parliament concerning Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Sacrament, were most sinful and unlawful) So if it be not a converting but a sealing Ordinance (which I hope is now <hi>luce clarius</hi>) there needs no other Argument for the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension of scandalous sinners living in grosse reigning sins, but this, That the end and use for which this Sacrament was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is not conversion which these need, but sealing and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, of which they are incapable, they being such as ought to be kept back <hi>à signis gratiae divinae,</hi> as Divines speak. For how shall these that in words professe God, but in their works deny him, be sealed with the seals or marked with the marks of the favour and grace of God? Most certainly this Question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature, end, and use of the Sacrament, casts the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the whole Controversie concerning Suspension: which I have therefore been the larger upon.</p>
               <p>And whereas Master <hi>Prynne</hi> concludeth, pag. 47, with a large citation out of <hi>Lucas Osiander Enchir. contra Anabapt. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>quaest.</hi> 3. for that he shall have this return. First, all that <hi>Osiander</hi> there saith, is brought to prove this point against the Anabaptists, <hi>quod et si unum aut alterum videamus in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia aliqua flagitiosum, propterea neque secessionem faciendam, neque à sacris congressibus, aut Coena Domini Christiano abstinendum. That although in some Church we see some one or other flagitious person, yet a Christian is not therefore either to make a separation, or to abstain from the sacred Assemblies or the Lords Supper.</hi> Which is not the Question now agitated between us. Secondly, after that passage cited against us, Master <hi>Prynne</hi> might have taken notice of another passage which maketh against himself. Where the Anabaptists did object to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:95406:301"/>
of scandalous persons to the Sacrament, <hi>Osiander</hi> denieth it: for (saith he) although we cannot help hypocrites their coming to the Lords Table; <hi>nos tamen scienter neminem admitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, nisi peccatores poenitentes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet we admit none willingly, except penitent sinners who confesse their sins and sorrow for them.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Osiander, ibid. Quaest.</hi> 2. holdeth Excommunication to be an Ordinance of God, and groundeth it upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. Therefore Master <hi>Prynne</hi> must seek another Patron then <hi>Osiander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the nature of the Ordinance being cleared, there needeth no more to confute Master <hi>Prynne</hi> in that which he makes the eighth thing in controversie between him and his Antagonists, namely, <hi>Whether Ministers may not as well refuse to preach the Word to such unexcommunicated, grosse, impenitent, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Christians, whom they would suspend from the Sacrament.</hi> Certainly it is not lawful but commanded as a duty to preach both to the converted and to the unconverted, without exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the most scandalous impenitent sinners whosoever. But the Lords Supper being (according to its institution and the minde of Jesus Christ) a sealing or confirming Ordinance onely, it cannot without a violation of the Institution be given to known impenitent scandalous persons. Other particulars in his Debate concerning this eighth point of difference, which do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any Answer, I will take occasion to speak unto them in the next Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Whether the admission of scandalous and notorious sinners to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, be a pollution and profanation of that holy Ordinance; And in what respects it may be so called?</head>
               <p>MAster <hi>Hussey</hi> in his <hi>Plea,</hi> pag. 2. doth very much mistake his mark, when in opposition to what I had said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the polluting of the Sacrament by the admission of the scandalous, he tells me out of <hi>Beza,</hi> that the Sacraments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main effectual to the good, though evil men come to them: and thereupon concludeth, that the Sacrament is holy and pure to the believer, notwithstanding the unpreparednesse of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: Which is not the thing in question: much lesse is it the Question, Whether there be any such thing as a pollution of the Sacrament: for this Master <hi>Coleman</hi> hath yeelded (though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he quarrelled that phrase of polluting the Ordinances) giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instance in the using of Cheese instead of Bread, <hi>Male dicis,</hi> pag. 12. But the true state of the Controversie may be laid open in these few distinctions.</p>
               <p>First, as <hi>Scotus in lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Sent. Dist.</hi> 3. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 2. distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two sorts of things which may be called necessary to a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:95406:302"/>
                  <hi>necessarium simpliciter,</hi> and <hi>necessarium aliqualiter:</hi> the former he calls that without which the Sacrament is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the later, that without which they that give the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot avoid sin, or the want whereof maketh the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery guilty; so do I distinguish two sorts of pollution of the Sacrament, one which makes the Sacrament no Sacrament, but a common or unhallowed thing to those that do receive it, as (for instance) if the Sacrament were given by those that are no Ministers, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to those that are no Church, or without the blessing and breaking of bread: Another which makes the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and with such circumstances to be sinful, and those that do so administer it to be guilty: and so whatsoever is done in the ministration of the Sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the revealed will of God, is a pollution of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The present Question is of the later, not of the former.</p>
               <p>Secondly, some wicked men by their receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do onely draw judgement upon themselves, and these are close hypocrites: Others by their receiving of the Sacrament do involve not themselves onely, but others also into sin and Gods displeasure; and these are scandalous notorious sinners.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the sin of those who pollute the Sacrament by using it contrary to the nature and institution of it, may be the sin of others, and those others accessary to such pollution of the Sacrament two ways: either it is the sin of the whole Church, none excepted, so that none that communicateth then and there can be free of the sin, as where the bread is elevated and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, all the communicants are <hi>eo ipso</hi> that they joyn in the Sacrament then and there, partakers of the sin of bread-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, though perhaps some of them do not joyn in the act of worshipping the bread, but have done what they could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or hinder it. Or it is the sin onely of so many as have not done what they ought and might have done for observing the Institution, rule and example of Jesus Christ. And of this sort is the sin of communicating with scandalous and profane men. If private Christians have interposed, by admonitions given to the offender, and by petitions put up to those that have authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power for restraining the scandalous from the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they have discharged their consciences, and may without
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:95406:302"/>
sin communicate though some scandalous members be admitted: for such persons sin in taking the Sacrament, but worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants are not partakers of their sin. But if Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers who have a charge and authority from Jesus Christ, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none whom they know to be unworthy, profane and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, shall not withstanding admit such persons, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by partakers of their sin, so that their receiving, or rather pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting of the Sacrament, is imputed not to themselves onely, but to the Church-officers who had authority to keep them back, and did it not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the suffering of a mixture of known wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons among the godly in the Church, doth sometime defile us with sin, sometime not. It doth not defile us, when we use all lawful and possible remedies against it, and namely, when we exercise the Discipline of Excommunication, and other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censures, saith <hi>Augustine, lib. contra Donatistas, post collatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Tom.</hi> 7. But it doth defile us, and we do incur sin and wrath, when the means of redressing such known evils are neglected, <hi>indisciplinata patientia</hi> (it is <hi>Augustines</hi> word) so to bear with wicked men, as not to execute discipline against them, that certainly makes us partakers of their sin. I mean in a reformed and well constituted Church, where the thing is feasible. But where it cannot be done, because of persecution, or because of the invincible opposition either of authority, or of a prevalent profane multitude, in that case we have onely this comfort left us, <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse;</hi> and, <hi>in magnis voluisse sat est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, neither doth this Question concerning the pollution or profanation, or abuse of the Sacrament, concern those <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta quotidianae incursionis,</hi> such sins of infirmity as all the godly, or at least the generallay of the godly, are subject unto and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, as long as they are in the world (for then the Sacrament should be polluted to all; for, <hi>Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sins?)</hi> but onely grosse and scandalous sins, such as make the Name of God and the profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be evil spoken of and reproached, those roots of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse which spring up, whereby many are like to be defiled; those that are guilty of such sins, and have given no evidence of
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:95406:303"/>
true Repentance, if they be received to the Sacrament, it is a profaning of the Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Now that the admission of scandalous and notorious sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Sacrament in a reformed and constituted Church, is a profanation or pollution of that Ordinance, may be thus proved.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Paraeus</hi> upon the 82 Question in the <hi>Heidelberg</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism, where it is affirmed, that by the admission of scandalous sinners to the Sacrament, the Covenant of God is profaned, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this reason for it, Because as they who having no Faith nor Repentance, if they take the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>als of the Covenant, do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by profane the Covenant; so they who consent to known wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and scandalous persons their taking of the seals, or to their coming to the Sacrament, do by such consenting make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves guilty of profaning the Covenant of God (for the doer and the consenter fall under the same breach of law) yea, so far do they sin by such consenting, as that they do thereby acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the children of the devil to be the children of God, and the enemies of God to be in Covenant and to have fellowship with God. He distinguisheth these two things, who ought to come to the Sacrament, and who ought to be admitted. None ought to come, except those who truely believe and repent: None ought to be admitted, except such as are supposed to be believers and penitent, there being nothing known to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. If any impenitent sinner take the Sacrament, he profanes the Covenant of God. If the Church admit to the Sacrament any known to live in wickednesse without repentance, the Church profaneth the Covenant of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Ordinance which is not a converting but a sealing Ordinance, which is not appointed for the conversion of sinners but for the communion of Saints, is certainly profaned and abused contrary to the nature, institution, and proper end thereof, if those who are manifestly ungodly, profane, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and unconverted, be admitted to the participation thereof. But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is not a converting but a sealing Ordinance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I have proved by infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That use of the Sacrament which is repugnant
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:95406:303"/>
and contradictory to the Word truly and faithfully preached in the name of Christ, is a prophaning of the Sacrament. But to give the Sacrament to those who are known to live in grosse sins without repentance, is an use of the Sacrament which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant and contradictory to the Word truly and faithfully preached in the Name of Christ. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I suppose no man will denie, that if we truly and faithfully preach the Word, we may and ought to pronounce and declare such as live in sin impenitent and unconverted, to be under Gods wrath and displeasure as long as they continue in that estate. <hi>Be not deceived</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor theeves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. 10. See the like <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 5, 6, 7. Whence it is, that doctrinally we warn the ignorant and scandalous, and all such as live in known sins without repentance, that they presume not to come and prophane that holy Table. Of which Ministers are appointed by the Directory to give warning. How then can we by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament to such as these, give the lye to the Word? <note n="h" place="margin">Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch. Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin. Judicium de disciplina Ecclesiastica. Tom. 3. pag. 806. <hi>Haec enim Dei voluntas non erit in aeternum, ut Ecclesia Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiana alicui gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Christi &amp; remissionem pec catorum, annun ciatione verbi divini deneget, &amp; eidem exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitione Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat.</hi>
                  </note> For what other thing shall we do; if those whom the Word pronounceth to have no part in the Kingdom of God nor of Christ, shall be admitted as well as the Godly to eat and drink at the Lords Table, while known to continue in the committing of their damnable sins, or while it is known that <hi>they have not repented of the uncleannesse, and fernication, and lasciviousnesse which they have committed? 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 21. What is this but to absolve in the Sacrament those who are condemned in the Word, and to open the Kingdom of Heaven in the Sacrament unto those on whom the Word shutteth it?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That use of the Sacrament which strengtheneth the hands of the wicked, so that he turneth not from his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, is an abuse and profanation of the Sacrament. But the giving of the Sacrament to any known prophane impenitent person is such an use of the Sacrament as strengtheneth the hands of the wicked, so that he turneth not from his wickednesse. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I appeal to the experience of all godly and faithful ministers,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:95406:304"/>
whether they have not found it a great deal more difficult to convince or convert such prophane men as have been usually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sacrament, then to convince or convert such as have been kept back from the Sacrament? No marvel that such prophane ones as have usually received the seals of the Covenant of grace, and joyned in the highest act of Church-communion, live in a good opinion of their souls estate, and trust in lying words, <hi>Have we not eaten and drunken at thy Table? The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, The Sacrament,</hi> as of old <hi>The Temple, The Temple.</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> thinks, that the Minister hath fully discharged his duty and conscience, if he give warning to unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants of the danger they incurre by their unworthy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the Lords Table. <hi>Vindic. pag.</hi> 28, 29. But he may be pleased to receive an answer from himself, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. <hi>The things we see with our eyes do more affect and beget deeper impressions in our hearts, then the things we hear.</hi> The Word preached is <hi>Verbum audibile,</hi> the Sacrament is <hi>Verbum visibile.</hi> How shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ones be perswaded by their ears to beleeve that whereof they see the contrary with their eyes? they will give more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> own opinion to the visible Word, then to the audible Word.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If it were a prophanation of the Sacrament of Baptisme to baptize a Catechumene, a Jew, or a Pagan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing a resolution to turn Christian, he being manifestly under the power of abominable reigning sins, and being still a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and wicked liver, although he were able to give a sound and Orthodox Confession of Faith: then it is also a prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper to admit unto it abominable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane livers. But it were a prophanation of the Sacrament of Baptisme &amp;c. <hi>Augustine lib. de fide &amp; operibus cap.</hi> 18. tells us, that the Church did not admit whores and such other scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons to Baptisme. <hi>Et nisi egerint ab his mortuis operibus poenitentiam, accedere ad Baptismum non sinuntur. And except they repent</hi> (saith he) <hi>from these dead works, they are not suffered to come unto Baptisme.</hi> Divers Arguments he brings in that Book for this thing, as 1. That <hi>Peter</hi> saith (<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38.) <hi>Repent and be baptized.</hi> 2. That the Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. joyneth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from dead works with Baptisme. 3. That <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:95406:304"/>
preached the Baptisme of Repentance. 4. That fornicators, adulterers, theeves, &amp;c. shall not inherit the Kingdom of God: therefore such as are known to live in these sins without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ought not to be baptized. 5. He argueth from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16. &amp;c. Now I offer this <hi>Quaere.</hi> Shall an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wicked life, murther, adultery, swearing, cursing, lying, or the like keep back a man from so much as entering into the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church by the door of Baptism, and shall not the like abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations keep back a man from Fellowship with the Saints at the Lords Table? Is there more evidenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Saintship required in those who come to be baptized, then in those who come to the Lords Table? If there be, let our Opposites speak it out, and open up the riddle. If there be not, then how can their Tenent avoid the prophanation of the Lords Table?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That Ordinance which is prophaned by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Infants and Idiots who can make no good use of it, is much more prophaned by admitting abominable and known pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane persons who make a very bad use of it. But the Lords Supper is prophaned by admitting Infants and Idiots who can make no good use of it. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prynn pag.</hi> 29. yeeldeth that children, fools, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted men, are by a natural disability made uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lords Supper, because unable to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to which (saith he) not withstanding they have been admitted in some Churches. In what Churches fools and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted men have been admitted to the Lords Supper, I should have willingly learned from him, for as yet I know not any such thing Children I know were somtime admitted by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients who did afterward discover their own great error in that particular. However, He yeelds as I take it, children and fools to be uncapable of the Lords Supper. And why? because unable to examine themselves, in regard of natural disability. But where there is no disability in the natural faculties, may not a sinful disability which a man hath drawn upon himself (as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, drunkennesse, corrupt and atheistical opinions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous excusing or defending of sin) make him unable to examine himself? Shall men that are unable to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be admitted to the Sacrament, because not disabled by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:95406:305"/>
natural disability? Sure this was far from <hi>Pauls</hi> thoughts when he delivered that rule concerning examining our selves before the Sacrament. Whoever they be who are unable to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themselves, whether naturally or sinfully, much more they who manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nous prophanation of that Ordinance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prosecute my Argument, Why do we exclude Infants and Idiots? because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now a positive prophanation of the Sacrament, is worse then a negative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of it: <hi>abuti</hi> is more then <hi>non bene uti.</hi> We know that prophane impenitent sinners will not onely make no good use of the Sacrament, nor examine themselves aright, but will abuse it to the worst use that can be, even to slatter themselves in their wickednesse, and to harden themselves in sin and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency. Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> will tell us, we know not but God may convert such at the Sacrament. But there is not the least hint in all the Word of God of any impenitent sinner converted by the Sacrament. And beside, it is as easie for God to give an Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot or distracted man his right wits, and to illuminate him with a self-examining knowledge and light in the very instant of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to or sitting down at the Table; And if <hi>a possibility, a per adventure it may be, and who knoweth but it may convert and do them good;</hi> be a warrantable ground for Ministers to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Sacrament to prophane and scandalous persons as Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> holds, <hi>pag.</hi> 47. why shall not the same ground be as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable for admitting Idiots.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If the Temple was polluted and prophaned by the comming of prophane and abominable persons into it, then is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper also profaned by such persons their participation of it. But the Temple was polluted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned &amp;c. The reason of the consequence in the Proposition is, because as the Temple had a Sacramental signification of Christ, and a certain Ceremonial holinesse, as well as the Lords Table, so it will be <hi>dur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s sermo</hi> (and I presume none of our Opposites will adventure to say it) that such prophanesse as did of old
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:95406:305"/>
keep back men from the Temple, cannot now exclude them from the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The Assumption is largely proved in the first Book, both from Scripture and from Jewish writers. That one place <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 23. 38. 39. (beside divers others) cleareth it. <hi>Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my Sanctuary in the same day, and have prophaned my Sabbaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For when they had slain their children to their Idols, then they came the same day into my Sanctuary to prophane it.</hi> You see the Temple was propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and polluted, not onely by those that were ceremonially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, but by Idolaters and Murtherers when any such presumed to come into the Temple.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, I desire the scope of that place <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14. may be considered. The Lord is teaching his people, that a thing legally holy, could not by the touch thereof sanctifie that which by the Law was common and not holy, yet he which was legally unclean, did defile whatsoever he touched, yea though it were legally holy. <hi>So is this people, and so is this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before me, saith the Lord, and so is every work of their hands, and that which they offer there is unclean.</hi> The legal holinesse and uncleannesse were significant ceremonies to teach the people the hecessity of moral holinesse, and the evil or danger of moral un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse: Hence God himself argues from the significant ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony to the morality, so as the place holds forth by necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain consequence these three propositions. 1. The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial uncleannesse did signifie the moral uncleannesse, and the effect of the former did signifie the effect of the latter. 2. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy persons are not sanctified by their approaching to, or joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in holy Ordinances: but he that is filthy will be filthy still, and he that is unjust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unjust still. If God do not give them his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to sanctifie them, the Ordinances cannot do it. 3. Yet unholy persons, while such, do defile holy Ordinances, and that by moral as well as by ceremonial uncleannesse: therefore the people themselves, and every work of their hands being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the Lord for that cause reckoneth their sacrifices to be unclean. Did prophane persons defile the Sacrifices of old, and do they not defile our Sacraments? Nay, I should think this, much more then that, there being more of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:95406:306"/>
of Saints in our Sacraments, then in their Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>The ninth Argument which alone may conclude the point, shall be taken from <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. <hi>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine.</hi> If the Sacrament be a holy thing, and if prophane scandalous impenitent sinners be dogs and swyne, then to give the Sacrament to such, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and pollute the Sacrament, and indeed no better but worse then to give pearls to swine. Mr. <hi>Prynns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> reply <hi>vindic. pag.</hi> 39. doth not take off this Argument. For without any proof, he restricteth to certain particulars that which the Text saith generally both of the things and of the persons. First for the things, He saith the Text is principally intended of not preaching the Gospel to such, so that we must seclude them from the Word as well as from the Sacrament. But I ask, is it meant onely of the Word? He hath not said so, nor will (I think) say so. <hi>Erastus</hi> himself <hi>pag.</hi> 207. confesseth it is meant also of the Sacraments. The Text saith not, <hi>the holy thing,</hi> and <hi>the pearl,</hi> but <hi>holy things, pearls.</hi> It must therefore be understood <hi>respecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve.</hi> Some are so vile, and so abominably prodigiously prophane, blasphe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Others are such as I may preach unto, yet ought not to pray or give thanks with them, nor to admonish them (and much lesse give them the Sacrament) Others I may admonish and pray with them, yet ought not to give them the Sacrament. And all these by reason of that rule, <hi>Give not that which is holy to dogs,</hi> &amp;c. So that we are not bound up by this Text, either to seclude men from the Word, or otherwise from no holy: thing.

And upon the Text it self, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. he applieth it to a suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all such as were not acknowledged for visible Saints, not onely from receiving but from beholding the Sacrament. Hence was that in the ancient Church, <hi>Sancta Sanctis;</hi> at which word all others were dismissed before the receiving of the Sacrament, who were not accounted visible Saints. Hence came the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>duplex missa,</hi> that is, <hi>duplex dimissio.

               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine, lib. de fide &amp; operibus, cap.</hi> 6. so applieth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of giving holy things to doggs, that he thence argueth against the administration of Baptism to persons living in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery (although such as have embraced the Orthodox Doctrine) which is also the scope of that whole Book. Now if persons of a profane Conversation, though orthodox in their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Profession, be such doggs as ought to be refused Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism when they desire it, surely they are also such doggs as ought to be refused the Lords Supper.</p>

                  <pb n="551" facs="tcp:95406:307"/>Moreover, the onely seeming advantage which Master <hi>Prynne</hi> catcheth, is from the word <hi>doggs</hi> (which yet is no advantage; for that is applied generally to wicked and profane persons in the Scriptures above cited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 15.) but he shall do well to observe the word <hi>swine</hi> too: for (as <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place, following <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> doth make the distinction) the doggs are such as bark and contradict; the swine such as do not bark and contradict, but by an impure life (saith he) declare how little esteem they have of the holy things. Which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (as he conceives) the Text it self doth hint: for it menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth not onely the turning again to rent, which is the dogges part, but the trampling of Pearls under feet, which is the swines part.</p>

For the holy Ghost having said of the people, that they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Iordan,</hi> confessing their sins, he saith no such thing of the Pharisees, but onely that they came to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme (whether to see the fashion and the new Ceremony, or whether with an intention to be baptized) after which we read no more but that <hi>Iohn</hi> gave them a most sharp admonition, and called them a generation of vipers, and told them that they should not glory in being <hi>Abrahams</hi> children: Whereupon it may seem they went away displeased and unbaptized. But
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:95406:309"/>
when I compare the Evangelists together, that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be meant <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 7. concerning many of the Pharisees comming to the Baptisme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> is that they were sent from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with a message to ask <hi>Iohn, Who art thou?</hi> For they who were sent upon that message were of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 24. and they were sent to <hi>Bethabara</hi> beyond <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> was baptizing, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 28. and a part of <hi>Iohns</hi> answer to them was, <hi>I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not:</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 26. In both passages <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks of him that was to come after him, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth before himself. In both, he professeth that he could do no more but baptize with Water or Ministerially. In both, he saith he was not worthy to unloose the latchet of Christs shoe. So that many of the circumstances do agree with the story, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. and the other circumstances are not inconsistent. In the other Evangelists it is, <hi>I baptize you with water:</hi> But that proves not that the Pharisees who were sent to <hi>Iohn,</hi> were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, for <hi>Luke</hi> doth plainly apply those words to the people <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 15. 16. 18. But when the Pharisees asked <hi>Iohn, Why baptizest thou &amp;c.</hi> the answer to them was not <hi>I baptize you with Water,</hi> but <hi>I baptize with Water.</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Cent. 1. lib. 1. cap. 10.</note> The Centurists think that the Pharisees who were sent from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Iohn</hi> to ask him <hi>Who art thou?

This they prove because <hi>Iohn</hi> saith to them <hi>O Generation of Vipers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> Which insinuateth a coincidency of these two stories related <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <note n="p" place="margin">Tom. 4. part. 1.

                  <hi>Salmeron</hi> himself doth in another place observe divers coincidencies between the story of that which passed between <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Pharisees that came to his baptism; and the story of that which passed between <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees that were sent to him from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

               <p>MR. <hi>Prynn</hi> in his first <hi>Quaere</hi> would have us beleeve that in the primitive times scandalous sinners were ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and wholy cast out of the Church, and sequestred from all other Ordinances, as well as from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; <hi>And since</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the primitive times (as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by Tertullians Apologie</hi> cap. 39. De poenitentia lib. <hi>and others) scandalous persons were ever excommunicated and wholy cast out of the Church</hi> (extra gregem dati) <hi>not barely sequestred from the Sacrament.</hi> But for further clearing of the ancient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline concerning suspension, I have thought good here to take notice of the particulars following.</p>
               <p>First, That great Antiquary <note n="s" place="margin">Observat. lib. 1. cap. 1. <hi>Nam eorum in lapsos Judicium ad Eucharistiam referri nequit, quibus post ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod tempus omnia cum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Albaspinaeus,</hi> proving that Church communion or fellowship was anciently larger than partaking of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; he proves it by this Argument, because many of those who had scandalously fallen, were admitted to communion with the Church in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and all other Ordinances, the Eucharist onely excepted.</p>

                  <pb n="557" facs="tcp:95406:310"/>Next, It is well known to the searchers of Antiquity, that there were four degrees of publike declaration of repentance, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the participation of the Sacrament, which they were at last admitted unto, and is therefore mentioned by some as the fifth degree, though (to speak properly) it was not poenal, nor any degree of censure as the other four were. First, The peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was kept weeping at the Church door, beseeching those that went in to pray for him: thereafter he was admitted to hear the Word afar off among the Catechumens: In the third place there was a preparatory reconciliation or reception into the Church, with prayer and imposition of hands, which being done, the man was in some sort admitted into Christian fellowship, and acknowledged for a brother, yet after the Word and Prayer. he went forth with the Catechumens before the Sacrament. But there was a fourth degree after all this; he might stay in the Church, and see and hear in the celebration of the Sacrament, after the Catechumens and the three first sort of penitents were dismissed, yet still he was suspended from partaking of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, for a certain time after he was brought to this fourth and last step: <note n="t" place="margin">Albaspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus Observ. lib. 2.

approve the too great severity of this ancient Discipline, nor do I hold it agreeable to the Will of Christ, that such as give good signes of true Repentance, and do humbly confesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forsake their sin, having also made publike declaration of their Repentance to the Church for removing the publike scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, ought notwithstanding of all this, to be suspended from the Sacrament when they desire to receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the Word doth not warrant the suspending of scandalous sinners from the Sacrament, until such a set determinate time be expired, but onely till they give sufficient evidence of Repentance. But set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aside this and such like circumstances, the thing it self, the suspending of a scandalous person from the Sacrament, who is not nor ought not to be suspended from assembling, hearing, and praying with the Church, is the Will of Christ, as I have proved, and was the commendable practice of the Ancient Church, which is the point I now prove against Mr. <hi>Prynne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Councel of <hi>Ancyra Can.</hi> 5. 16. doth also appoint the time of suspension from the Sacrament to be made shorter or longer, according as the signes of true Repentance should sooner or later, more or lesse appear in the offender.

                  </gap>ct against me and say; Peradventure the Penitents before spoken of, were onely such as did manifest their repentance after excommunication, and these several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees afore-mentioned, were but the degrees of their reception or admission into the Church, so that all this shall not prove the suspension from the Sacrament of persons not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. I answer, he that will think so, will be found in a great mistake: and my Argument from Antiquity will yet stand good, for suspending from the Sacrament persons not excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For first, neither do the Canons of the Councels of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra,</hi> and <hi>Nice,</hi> nor of <hi>Gregorius Thaumaturgus</hi> and <hi>Basilius magnus,</hi> nor yet the Commentators <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Balsamon,</hi> apply these five degrees above mentioned to persons who had been excommunicated, but they speak generally of persons who had committed scandalous sins, and afterward were converted and appeared penitent: for instance, those who did backslide and
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:95406:312"/>
fall in time of persecution, as multitudes did under <hi>Licinius</hi> and other persecuters, when they converted and professed repentance, they were received again into the Church by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain steps and degrees, some more, some fewer, according to the quality of their offence; No man that hath searched anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity will say that all who did fall in time of persecution were excommunicated for that offence, nor yet that they were all put to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to the weeping at the Church door, but yet all of them, even those whose offence was least (as the <hi>Libellatici</hi> who had taken Writs of protection from the Enemy or Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter) were put to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>consistentia,</hi> which was a suspension or abstention from the Sacrament, even when the person was admitted to hear and pray with the Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the degrees afore-mentioned were degrees of receiving into the Communion of the Church scandalous persons professing repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The 61. Canon of <hi>Basil</hi> to <hi>Amphilochius</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus. <hi>He that hath stolen, if repenting of his own accord he accuse himself, shall be for a year restrained from the Communion of the holy Mysteries onely. But if he be convict, the space of two yeers shall be divided to him unto substration and consistency: then let him be thought worthy of the Communion.</hi> Will any man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that a penitent theef accusing himself, was excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? It is more then manifest that here was a suspension of an offender not excommunicated. For assoon as the offence was known by the offenders accusing of himself, he was suspended from the Sacrament alone for a year, and then admitted to the Sacrament. Yea he that was convict of theft, was not by this Canon excommunicated, nor yet put either to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but onely to the third and fourth degrees.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By the 13th. Canon of <hi>Basil</hi> to <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> he that had killed another though in a lawful war, was (for the greater reverence to the Sacrament) suspended for three yeers; and by the 55. Canon, he also that killed a Robber was suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Sacrament. I do not justifie these Canons, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I cite them to prove, that by the Ancient Discipline Persons not excommunicated were suspended from the Sacrament: for no man can imagine that a Souldier shedding blood in a lawful
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:95406:313"/>
war, or a man killing a Robber on the high way was therefor excommunicated.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The eighth general Councel called <hi>Synodus prima &amp; secunds,</hi> held about the yeer 869. in the thirteenth Canon, speaking of certain turbulent Schismaticks (not being of the Clergie as the Canon speaketh, but Laicks or Monks) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth this censure, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Let them be totally or altogether separated from the Church.</hi> Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth that there was a lesser degree of being separated or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from communion with the Church. <hi>Zonaras</hi> upon that Canon doth so understand it, and distinguisheth a double <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>For it is also a separation</hi> (saith he) <hi>to be excluded or restrained from the receiving of the Divine Mysteries onely. But there is another separation, which is to be cast out of the Church, which the Canon calleth a total separation, as being the heavier or greater Censure.</hi> Which is the very same distinction with that which was afterward expressed under the terms of <hi>major &amp; minor,</hi> the greater and lesser excommunication. For which also I shall give you another proof as clear and older too, taken from the 61. Canon of the sixth general Councel, where it is decreed that those who resort to Magicians, Charmers, Fortune-tellers, and such others who professe curious and unlawful arts, shall fall under the Canon of six years separation. <hi>But as for those who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>is greatly punished. For here also he that commeth and confesseth the sin, is to be punished with six yeers segregation: but he that persevereth in the evil</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>is to be east out or expelled from the Church:</hi> adde what he had said before, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and shall not thenceforth converse with the Orthodox.</hi> Which intimateth as plainly as any thing can be, that there was an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a segre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:95406:313"/>
or sequestration used in the ancient Church, which was a lesser censure than casting out of the Church and from the company of Church-members. <hi>Zonaras</hi> seemeth to understand the Canon otherwise. (for he saith nothing of the offenders converting and confessing his sin before the six years segregation; but that for the offence it self (committed, not confessed) a man was segregated six years, and afterward if he did not repent but continue in the offence, that then he was to be cut off, and cast out of the Church: wherein as I take it, he did explain the mind of the Councel, better then <hi>Balsamon.</hi> However in that point which I now prove, they are most harmonious, namely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a greater and lesser excommunication. <hi>Wherefore also the Fathers of this Synod</hi> (saith <hi>Zonaras) did ordain those who do such a thing,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to be segregated for six years, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>but if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue therein, to be also cut off from the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, To suppose that there were no <hi>Poenitentes</hi> in the Ancient Church but such as were <hi>Excommunicati,</hi> were a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter error then that it should need any Confutation. Yea there were some poenitents who did of their own accord confesse their offences which could not have been otherwise known but by such voluntary confession: and those saith <hi>Zonaras Annot. in Conc. Carth. Can.</hi> 46. were most properly called Poenitents, I hope no man will imagine that such were excommunicated. But so it was that all the Poenitents (even such as had neither been excommunicated nor yet forensically convict by proof of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, but did voluntarily confesse and convert) were for some sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son kept back from the Sacrament, as is manifest by that instance given out of <hi>Basilius magnus,</hi> of theft voluntarily confessed, for which notwithstanding the offender was for a year suspended from the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is manifest that there were several degrees of censure upon Bishops and Presbyters. They were sometime sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from giving the Sacrament, and as it were sequestred from the exercise of their Ministery, which suspension or seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration is sometimes called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be separate, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be sequestred from communion, to wit in the exercise of the Ministery, or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, not to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:95406:314"/>
There was a higher censure then this, which was depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or degradation, called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, they are deposed from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. These two censures, a suspension or sequestration from the Ministery, and a total deposition from the Ministery are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by the eighteenth Canon of the Councel of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and the sixteenth Canon of the Councel of <hi>Nic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> compared with the fifteenth Canon of those called the Apostles, (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were not the Apostles, yet are ancient) See also <hi>Zonaras in Can. 11. Apost.</hi> Likewise both him and <hi>Balsamon in Conc. Nic. Can.</hi> 16. Again there was somthing beyond all this, which was excommunication or to be wholy cast out of the Church, a censure sometime not inflicted when the former were: For a Minister might be suspended, yea deposed from his Ministery, yet permitted to communicate or receive the Sacrament among the people, as is plainly determined <hi>Can.</hi> 15. <hi>Apost.</hi> and <hi>Can.</hi> 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Basilii ad Amphil.</hi> If there were such degrees of censure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Bishops and Presbyters, how shall we suppose that there was no lesse censure for Church-members then excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication? For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to a Minister, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to one of the people, were paralel. Whence it is that you will often find in the ancient Canons, and namely of the sixth general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, He that committeth such a fault, if he be one of the laity, let him be segregated, if one of the Clergie, let him be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. As therefore a further censure after <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> might fall upon a minister; so a further censure after that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> might be inflicted upon one of the people.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Whence it will certainly follow, that all who were excluded from the Lords Table were not excommunicated persons: For first, The Church did keep back such scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons upon this ground, because those who are known to live without repentance in any of those sins, of which the Apostle saith that they who do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, are not fit to be admittrd unto the Sacrament (for this were to give the Seals of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to those whom the Word pronounceth to be in a state of damnation.) Secondly, <hi>Augustine</hi> is there confuting the opinion of some (whom he calls <hi>Fratres qui aliter sapiunt,</hi> Brethren who otherwise understood themselves well) whose Principles did admit to the Sacraments all uncleane and scandalous persons: which cannot be meant of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated persons; For there was never any such opinion maintained in the Church, that all excommunicated persons
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:95406:317"/>

               <p n="3">3. I throw back an Argument from the same Parable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself, for the King sheweth his servants that he will have unworthy persons kept back from the marriage feast, vers. 8. <hi>Then saith he to his servants, the Wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy, Luk.</hi> 14. 24. <hi>For I say unto unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall tast of my Supper.</hi> The King makes it also known that he alloweth none to come in to this Mariage Feast, except such onely as have the <hi>Wedding garment</hi> (or as the Syriak <hi>Wedding garments</hi>) upon them. All which is inconsistent with Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> principles concerning the admission of known scandalous unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the Sacrament, as to a converting Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if all must be brought in or let in to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, both bad and good promiseuously and without distinction, then it should follow that the Ordinances of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the suspension <hi>of all sorts of scandalous persons</hi> from the Sacrament are contrary to the Will of Christ: And that Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> himself in yeelding <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And so I come to that which I have here proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> the instability and loosenesse of Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> principles in this controversie.</p>
               <p>By comparing divers passages together, I find that he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and pretend to yeeld the Question, which yet he doth not yeeld really and indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="574" facs="tcp:95406:319"/>First, It is to be observed that he deserteth <hi>Erastus</hi> and that party in the point of Excommunication. For in the <hi>vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his four Questions <hi>pag.</hi> 2. he readily yeeldeth <hi>that grosse notorious scandalous obstinate sinners, who presumptuously perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in their iniquities, after private and publike admonitions, without remorse of Conscience or AMENDMENT, may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly excommunicated from the Church, the society of the faithful, and all publike Ordinances, after due proof and legal conviction of their scandalous lives: and that</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>warrants thus much. The Antidote animadverted by P.</hi> in the first page yeeldeth that excommunication is an Ordinance of God. And indeed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. doth not onely warrant excommunication as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but injoyn and command it as necessary; for the Apostles words are praeceptive and peremptory: <hi>Therefore put away from among your selves that wicked person.</hi> The thing was not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but necessary and such as could not without sin be omitted. However Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> his asserting from that place that it may be, is a deserting of the Erastian party.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the 50. page of his <hi>vindication</hi> he professeth that his Antagonists do contend for that which he granteth them with advantage. They would have scandalous sinners suspended from the Sacrament. He will have them not onely suspended from the Sacrament, but excommunicated from all other publike Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He confesseth <hi>ibid.</hi> that in some cases a person not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated may be suspended from the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But whatever his Concessions may seem to be, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as good as nothing. For 1. He will have none to be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Sacrament except such as are ripe for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and against whom the sentence of excommunication is ready to be pronounced as persons incorrigible. 2. He admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no suspension from the Sacrament till after several solemn previous publike admonitions, reprehensions, rebukes contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or neglected. See both these pag. 50. Whence you see that with Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> consent all the votes of Parliament concerning several causes of suspension from the Lords Table, shall be of no use to Presbyteries, until after a long processe of time, and after many previous publike admonitions, So that if one in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:95406:319"/>
commit a notorious incest or murther a day or two, or a week before the celebration of the Sacrament, and the thing be undeniably certified and proved before the Eldership, yet the Eldership cannot suspend such an abominable scandalous sinner from the Sacrament, <hi>hac vice:</hi> but must first go through all those preparatory steps which are necessary and requisite before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</p>
               <p>Well: but after all those publike previous admonitions, shall the sentence of excommunication follow? Nay, here also he will have Presbyteries to go through a very narrow lane: for in the same place he thus describeth the persons whom he would have to be excommunicated; They are <hi>scandalous, obstinate, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, incorrigible, notorious sinners, who desperately and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly persevere in their grosse scandalous sins, &amp;c.</hi> But I beseech you, what if they persevere in their grosse scandalous sins nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desperately nor professedly? Must they not then be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate? Shall not the offender be cast out of the Church after clear proof of the offence, and several previous publike admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions contemned or neglected? Must we wait till the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer professe that he will persevere in his adultery; and till the blasphemer professe that he will persevere in his blasphemy? Nay further, What if the offender do neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> nor actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally persevere in his grosse scandalous sin? Put case he that hath blasphemed once do not blaspheme the second time: and that he who grossely and scandalously prophaned the Lords day, did it but once, and hath not done it again since he was reproved. Must this hinder the sentence of excommunication, when that one grosse scandal is not confessed, nor any signe of repentance appearing in the offender?</p>
               <p>Moreover whereas Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> in his fourth <hi>Quare,</hi> and in several places of his <hi>Vindication</hi> seemeth to allow none to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Table except such as professe sincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for sins past, and promise newnesse of life for time to come. If we expound his meaning by his own expressions in other places, that which he granteth bordereth upon nothing: for pag. 13. speaking of scandalous sinners their admission to the Sacrament, if they professe sincere repentance for their sins past, and reformation of their lives for time to come, he addeth,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:95406:320"/>
                  <hi>as all do at least in their general confessions before the Sacrament, if not in their private meditations, prayers, &amp;c.</hi> and a little after he saith, that <hi>all who come to receive, do alwaies make a general and joynt confession of their sins before God and the Congregation &amp;c.</hi> And then he addeth pag. 14. <hi>Yea I dare presume, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver so desperate, that dares professe when he comes to receive, he is not heartily sorry for his sins past, but resolves to persevere impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently in them for the future, though afterward he relapse into them, as the best Saints do to their old infirmities &amp;c.</hi> I know the best Saints have their sinful infirmities, but whether the BEST do relapse to their OLD infirmities may be a Question. And however he doth open a wide door for receiving to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament all scandalous sinners not excommunicated, if they do but tacitely joyn in the general Confession of sins made by the whole Church, or do not contradict those general Confessions, and professe impenitency and persevering in wickednesse, though in the mean time there be manifest real symptomes of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and no confession made of that particular sin which hath given publike scandal. Wherefore I say plainly with the Professors of <hi>Leyden, Synops. Pur. Theol. Disp.</hi> 48. <hi>Thes.</hi> 35. The administration of this censure of suspension from the Lords Table hath place in these two different cases, <hi>either when one that is called a Brother hath given some hainous scandal of life or Doctrine, who after admonition doth indeed by word of mouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse repentance, but yet doth not sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>w the fruits meet for repentance, that so the scandal might be taken away from the Church: or when he doth not so much as in words promise or professe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp;c. Martin Bucer</hi> hath a notable speech to this purpose <hi>de Regno Christi, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>To hold it enough that one do professe by Word onely repentance of sins, and say that he is sorry for his sins, and that he will amend his life, the necessarie signes and works of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance not being joyned with such profession, It is the part of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs priests, not of Christs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place it is to be taken notice of, how palpably and grossely Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> contradicteth himself in divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: Which being observed, may peradventure make himself more attentive in writing, and others more attentive in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such subitane lucubrations.

Foxi,</hi> the eighth Chapter of which Treatise is here translated out of Latin into English. What the are chief obstacles hindering Excommunication?</head>
                  <p>THat the thought and care of excommunication hath now so far waxed cold almost in all the Churches, is to be ascribed (as appeareth) unto three sorts of men. The first is of those whose minds the wealth of this world and high advancement of dignity do so lift up, that they are ashamed to submit the neck to the obedience of Christ. What (say these) shall that poor fellow lay a yoke on me? What, should I be subject to this naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rude Pastor? But let go, good Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your vain swelling empty words; how rude soever he be, yet if he be your Pastor, you must needs be a sheep of the flock, whom if he doth rightly instruct, so much the more dutifully you must submit. But if otherwise, it is the fault of the man, not of the Ministry; To those at least yeeld thy self to be ruled, whom thou knowest to
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:95406:326"/>
be more learned. But go to, thou which canst not suffer a man to be thy Pastor, to whom then wilt thou submit thy self? unto Christ himself (thou sayest:) very well forsooth. This then is of such importance, that Christ for thy cause must again leave the heavens, or by his Angels or Arch-Angels feed and govern thee, whom these mean men the Pastors do not satisfie: But what if it so pleased the Lord by these mean Pastors, as thou cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest them, to cast down and conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>und all the highest statelynesse and pride of this World, even as of old by a few and comtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Fishers he subdued not onely the high and conceited opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Philosophers, but even the Scepters of Kings also? Now what will thy boasting magnificence say? But hear what Christ himself saith of them, whom thou from thy high loftinesse look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>st down upon as unworthy. <hi>He that despiseth you despiseth me</hi> (saith he.) And moreover who so despiseth Christ, despiseth him from whom he is sent, and who said unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee: Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmost ends of the earth for thy possission: Thou shalt rule them with a rod of yron, and break them in pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>tters vessel.</hi> Wherefore seeing thou dost acknowledge so great a Lord, so many wayes above all Maiesty whatsoever can be named; let it not be grievous to thee (my brother whosoever thou art, or with how great power soever thou art highly advanced) laying aside thy high looks and pride, to be humbled under his mighty hand; And do not think it a light matter (whereas thou entertainest with so great applause and honourable respect an earthly Kings Ambassadors) that thou shouldest disdain the Ambassadors of him, who alone hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all Kings and Lords. If thou yeeldest unto a mortal Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian thy wounds to be handled, yea to be cut also, and to be burned and seared (if need be) how commeth it, that thou canst lesse endure the same thing also in the curing of the diseases of the soul from the spiritual Physitian, especially seeing in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny respects better is the health of the soul then of the body? Nor do thou so account any whit in this regard to be impared of thy honour, if unto thy Bishop or Pastor, yea rather herein to Christ thou be subjected. Yea contrariwise, so account as the thing is indeed, that there is no true glory but in Christ and in his sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds;
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:95406:326"/>
that none do more prosperously reigne, then they which every way do serve him, without whom as there is no glory, so is there no safety and salvation. Neither let it seem disgraceful to thee, what so many ages ago the most high Monarchs of the world and most potent Emperors have done before thee: amongst whom <hi>Philip,</hi> as he was the first of all the Emperors who was made a Christian; so I meet with no other more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous example, and more worthy of all mens imitation. He willing to be present at the solemn Assemblies of the Church on Easter, and to communicate of the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when as yet he was judged not worthy of admission; It is reported that <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Bishop withstood him, neither did receive him before he confessed his sins, and stood among the Penitentiaries. What would those our proud gyants, fighters against God do here, if they had stood in the like condition and high place? But this no lesse mild then most mighty Emperor was nothing ashamed (forgetting in the mean while his Imperial Majesty) of his own accord to submit himself to the obedience of his Pastor, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going every thing whatsoever in the Name of Christ was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon him. O truly noble Emperor, and no lesse worthy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop! But these examples in both are too rare amongst us this day.</p>
                  <p>Another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sort is of those which would be Christians but in name and title onely, they promise an honest enough shew of Christian profession; they dispute both learnedly, and every where with grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> endeavour, of Christ; they carry about in their hands the Gospel; they frequent sacred Sermons; have cast off all superstition; they feed with the perfect; they marry, eat, and are clothed, so as they hold no difference either of times or of places. Finally, Whatsoever is pleasing in Christ they take and stiffely hold. But if ye look into their life, they are Epicures, Wasters, Ravenous, Covetous, Sons of Belial; Not Christs servants, but slaves of their belly; who according to the Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, think vertue to be but words, as the wood to be but trees. And of these there is a great store every where, who seeing onely for their belly they follow Christ, they leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devised and uninterprised to hinder Excommunication, that so they may the more freely satisfie and serve their own lusts. So
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:95406:327"/>
the Covetous man feareth that his Covetousnesse be called in question, which he will not forsake. The Adulterer, he that buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or selleth men into slavery, the dycer, the whoremonger, the drunkard would rather his intemperance to be concealed. So the Robber, the Murderer, the Incendiary is afraid to be laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen or made known. So he that delighteth to be fatted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with the dammages of the Common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wealth, is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have any bridle to curb and restrain him: The Cheater that with false wares beguileth the people; the seller that with unjust gain outeth counterfeit wares; the deceiver who cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and circumventeth his Neighbour. Last of all whosoever are thus affected that they savour or follow nothing but their belly, their ambition, and the purse, they do not willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that their liberty of sinning should be stopped to them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover after these, others not much unlike them, come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same account, which out of some places of Scripture per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versely wrested, if they find out ought that may flatter their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, hence forthwith do they promise a wicked liberty of sinning to themselves and others, whence follows a very great corruption of life, together with injury of the Scripture. While these men are not sufficiently shaken and stricken with the sence of their sin, and force the Scripture violently wrested to defend and maintain their perverse affections, from which Scripture it had been meet to seek all medicines of their vices. But little do these men in the mean while consider how dear it cost Christ, which they make so small account of. They do not mark and weigh how horrible a thing sin is before God, which no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise could be expiate and purged but by the death of his onely begotten Son; which hath utterly rui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Which things if these and all other Epicures did more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently think of, it would come to passe I suppose, that neither the custome of sin would so much like them, and withall the matter it self would so far draw them, that more willingly they would have recourse unto these so many waies wholsom reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Church, as unto the onely medicine of mans life.</p>
