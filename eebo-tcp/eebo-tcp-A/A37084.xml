            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Having then, upon a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by ſome, made my ſelf Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to draw forth from others theſe following Directions, towards the Reforming of Schools, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Piety and Learning therein; I thought it expedient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thee with them, Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that if thou doeſt think thy ſelf any way concerned either in furthering the benefits of ſuch a way of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards others; or in partaki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb facs="tcp:50670:3"/>
thereof for thine own, thou mayeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think thy ſelf how to do that which is fitting and conſcionable; that ſuch an Endeavour as this may be ſet forward towards the Publick Good. For mine own part, I ſhall confeſſe freely, that amongſt all the Objects whereunto I have dedicated my thoughts and pains (whereof the extent is as large as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Good and Rationall Work in the whole life of Chriſtianity) there is not any one which doth lie nearer my heart then this of the Education of Children in the way of Chriſtianity. For, all things being rightly weighed, we ſhall perceive that this Endeavour alone, or nothing, will be able to work a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in this our Age. For whiles the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry is made an Object of violent Contradictions, and thereby almoſt wholly put out of frame and made uſeleleſſe, as to the Reforming of Vices in Church and Commonwealth; it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:50670:4"/>
although they be never ſo knowing and willing, that in the execution of their places, they ſhould be able to bring matters to perfection. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to meddle directly with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Aged people (the Objects of their charges) who are now ſettled and habituated in the way of their own chooſing, and to think to draw them from it, is to attempt, <hi>without diſcretion,</hi> an impoſſibilitie. For it is not poſſible, that the extraordinary ſtrains and diſtempers, whereinto we are fallen in theſe times, can be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ſome extraordinary abilitie, either of outward Authority and Power to reſtrain exemplary diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; or of inward Conviction, to leade men captive under the yoke of Chriſt, which are things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, now adayes, amongſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of men. Seeing then, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of thoſe that are of age, are too ſtrong and ſturdy to be conquered
<pb facs="tcp:50670:4"/>
by ordinary and weak means, and none extraordinary or ſtrong enough, are apparent; it followeth, that there is none other way left, but to deal with the young ones, before any corrupt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and perverſe engagements be confirmed upon them; that they may be trained up from their Infancy, to a courſe of Reformation, both of Virtue and Learning. But becauſe the train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Schollars in one School or two, though very great and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly Reformed, will be but an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable matter, in reſpect of a whole Nation, and have no great influence upon the youth thereof, where ſo many Schools remain unreformed, &amp; propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate corruptions; therefore the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of reformed Schools is mainly aimed at; and to that effect, the train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Reformed School-Maſters, is one of the Chief parts of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. Now to endeavour to make out this, that the readieſt way to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb facs="tcp:50670:5"/>
both Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o reform the Schools of Education therein; and that the way to Reform theſe, is to ſend forth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed School-Maſters amongſt them, is, as I ſuppoſe, altogether ſuperfluous: For it cannot be thought, that any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall man ſhould be ſuch a ſtranger unto the affairs of humane Societies, as not to ſee, that from the ordinary Schools, all Magiſtrates, and Miniſters, and Officers of State are taken throughout the Nations of the World, to be ſet over others; and that the impreſſions both of vice and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which they have received in the Schools, are exerciſed, and become effectuall, for good or evil, afterward, in their places towards the Church and Common-wealth: ſo that the Schools are to be looked upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Naturall fountains of a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as of our Corruption, ſo of our Reformation; if God will bleſſe us
<pb facs="tcp:50670:5"/>
with any. And the School-Maſter in a well ordered Common-wealth, is no leſſe conſiderable then either the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or the Magiſtrate; becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other will proſper or ſubſiſt long without him. I ſhall not need to adde any thing further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſubject, to make thee ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, either of the Uſefulneſſe of the undertaking, or of the Scope of my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This onely I would have thee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obſerve, judicious and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian Reader (for none but ſuch can ſee any thing in this buſineſſe) that the Authour of this new Model of ſchooling was intreated to put it to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, upon a ſerious motion made to him, and to ſome Friends of his, by others; for the entertaining and regulating of a Chriſtian Aſſociation, whereof all the Members might be ſerviceable to each other, and to the Publick: therefore he ſpeaks not in his own name alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:50670:6"/>
the Aſſociation, but in the name of thoſe, who were jointly called upon to give their aſſent thereunto, who agreed with him in theſe Propoſals. The Motion is not as yet come to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie in the Reſolution of thoſe that firſt made it, and the cauſe is of ſome Conveniences to effect it, and the fears of unſettlement, after that it ſhall be ſet upon: and till there be a further ground laid for the proſecuting of this Deſigne; it is needleſſe to give the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory concerning the Education of Girls. In the mean time, I have thought good to publiſh this, with an addition of ſome directions for teaching of Logick; that ſuch as can judge, may ſee that there is an eaſier and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier way to attain the perfection of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Happineſſe, known and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, then as yet hath been publiſhed to the World, or put in practice by any; and that to ſet theſe wheels agoing, nothing is wanting, but a quiet place of abode,
<pb facs="tcp:50670:6"/>
and ſome aſſurance of neceſſary Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let thy prayer go along with it, to ſupply theſe wants, if thou haſt any Rationall or Spirituall apprehenſion of the good ſought thereby unto all: and if thou canſt, ſay with the Prophet Pſal. 14. v. 7. <hi>O that the ſalvation of Iſrael were come out of Sion! when the Lord bringeth back the Captivitie of his people, Jacob ſhall rejoice, and Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſhall be glad.</hi> To the expectation and accompliſhment of this hope and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, I leave thee, in him who is <hi>the God of our Salvation, and the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afarre off upon the Sea,</hi> Pſal. 65. ver. 5. in whom I reſt,</p>

               <p>From the ſubordination of theſe Means to one another, and their properties to advance us unto Learning; we ſhall gather theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules of teaching Arts and Sciences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Arts or Sciences which may be received by meer Senſe ſhould not be taught any other way: for it is no wiſdome to make work to our ſelves: <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatſoever in any Art or Science can be made obvious unto Senſe, is firſt to be made Uſe of, as a Precognition unto that which is to be delivered by way of Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Rationall precept.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As in Nature Senſe is the ſervant of Imagination; Imagination of Memory; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Reaſon: ſo in teaching Arts and Sciences we muſt ſet theſe Faculties a work in this Order towards their proper Objects in every thing, which is to be taught: whence this will follow, that as the Faculties of Mans ſoul naturally perfect each other by their mutuall ſubordination: ſo the Arts which perfect thoſe Faculties ſhould bee gradually ſuggeſted, and the Objects wherewith the Faculties are to be converſant according to the Rules of Art ſhould be offered in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is anſwerable to their proper ends
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50670:23"/>
and uſes and not otherwiſe: for the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every thing to its owne end, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the order and place wherin we are to make uſe of it: for nothing is truly Uſefull, but as it is, in its naturall place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As Childrens Faculties break forth in them, by degrees to be vigorous with their years and the grouth of their Bodyes; ſo they are to be filled with Objects whereof they are capable, and plyed with Arts: whence followeth that while Children are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Acts of Reaſoning; the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of filling their Senſes and Imaginations with outward Objects ſhould be plyed: Nor is their Memory at this time to be charged further with any Objects then their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation rightly ordered and fixed, doth of it ſelf impreſſe the ſame upon them. Moreover hence followeth, that no Generall Rules are to be given unto any, concerning any thing either to be known or practiſed according to the Rule of any Art or Science; till Senſe Imagination and Memory have received their Impreſſions concerning that wherunto the Rule is to be applyed; and ſo farre as thoſe faculties are ſtored with matters of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo farre Rules may be given to direct the mind in the uſe of the ſame and no further. Laſtly hence followeth, That the Arts or Sciences which flow not immediatly from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50670:24"/>
particular and ſenſuall objects, but tend im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to direct the univerſall Acts of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, muſt be taught after all the reſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Uſe is to Regulat that, which is to make Uſe of all the reſt, viz. the Rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; therefore it is a very abſurd and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Courſe to teach Logick and Metaphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks before or with other Humane Sciences, which depend more upon Senſe and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then Reaſoning.</p>

               <head>Concerning the Parts of Learning.</head>
               <p>The Parts of Humane Learning wherin Children are to be exerciſed are firſt the grounds and precepts of profitable Arts and Sciences. Secondly, the Tongues which are moſt uſefull to enlarge the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>By profitable Arts and Sciences, we meane all matters of knowledge which direct man to the right uſe of all Creatures, and the ordering of his owne Faculties about them.</p>
               <p>The Tongues which are ordinarily moſt uſefull to enlarge the knowledge of theſe Arts and Sciences, are Latin and Greek; and that which in an extraordinary way will in due time be uſefull heerunto, is Hebrew, and the other Orientall Tongues which are a kinne unto it.</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe parts of Learning,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50670:24"/>
we lay down theſe Maximes as grounds of teaching the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Arts and Sciences are immediatly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by themſelves to reſtore the defects of our nature by the Creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tongues are no further finally uſefull then to enlarge Traditionall Learning; and without their ſubordination unto Arts and Sciences, they are worth nothing towards the advancement of our Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Immediat Uſe of Tongues is only to Underſtand what others ſay to us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their cuſtome of ſpeaking; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our mind unto them ſignificantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our cuſtome.</p>
               <p>From theſe Maximes we gather theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules of Teaching.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The teaching of Arts and Sciences ought not to be ſuſpended upon the teaching of unknown Tongues, but made familiar unto the childrens capacity in their Mother-Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue firſt; and afterward enlarged by the Uſe of other Tongues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Arts and Sciences which lead us moſt directly unto the Uſe of the creatures without any reflexion upon our own Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are firſt to be taught; becauſe they may be taken up by the ſimple Acts of Senſe, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Memory, without much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50670:25"/>3. The Arts and Sciences which lead us to reflect upon the uſe of our owne Faculties, are not to be taught, till we are fully acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their proper Objects, and the direct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cts of the Faculties about them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The knowledge of Tongues is the proper effect of Memory, and not of any Reaſoning abilitie, becauſe they depend upon the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation only of that which is the conſtant cuſtome of people; and not upon any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inducement why they do ſo. whence follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. 1. That thoſe things which are moſt helpfull and ſubſervient unto memory, are to be ſet a work in teaching Languages; rather then thoſe that employ the Judgement. 2. That the wayes which fix and order the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt effectually towards the ſound of the words and the thing ſignified therby, are moſt advantageous to this way of teaching. 3. That the teaching of words, is no further Uſefull then the things ſignified therby are familiar to the Imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Rules before the Materiall ſenſe of the words is known, or before the formall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of things which their conſtruction is to repreſent in a Sentence, can be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; is wholly prepoſterous and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Memory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So farre as children are capable of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall knowledge: ſo farre in every degree
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50670:25"/>
of Science they may be taught the Tongues which ſerve for that Uſe; but till they be fitted for the one, the other is Uſeleſs to them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whatſoever in the teaching of Tongues doth not tend to make them a help unto Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall knowledge, by the manifeſtation of Reall Truths in Sciences, is ſuperfluous, and not to be inſiſted upon, eſpecially towards Children. whence followeth that the Curious ſtudy of Criticiſmes, and obſervation of Styles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here I would let him know what a Conſequence is, How many wayes Conſequences may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from premiſes, and what the Principles are, from which Conſequences are raiſed, and by which they are to be tryed, and may be made Concluſions. In this part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as in the former, I would ſhew him by examples of every kind, how men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding make uſe of their thoughts, analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their diſcourſes wherein ſuch Acts of Reaſoning are expreſſed, whereof he ſhould have received Precepts; and then according to the pattern of Meditation, which I ſhould have given him in this kind, I would oblige him to exerciſe himſelf by certain diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes containing Principles and Conſequences drawn from them in ſome Authours, which he ſhould be put to reſolve, as to the matter of Conſequentiall Inferences, and the Acts of drawing Concluſions from Premiſes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; how theſe that uſe to diſcourſe ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally do order their thoughts and expreſſe the ſame to the capacitie of others.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50670:43"/>
to the fourth and laſt degree of Analyticall Doctrine, which is to learn to conſider the whole Body of a diſcourſe, and to obſerve all the Acts of Reaſon, which a man of underſtanding doth make uſe of therein. Here then he is to be taught what a Rationall Diſcourſe is, what is to be obſerved in it. <hi>viz.</hi> the Subject whereof it ſpeaketh: the Scope and Purpoſe whereto it ſpeaketh; the Parts whereof it is made up; their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence and Diſtinction, as well in reſpect of the main Body, as of every particular member of this Diſcourſe, and the order of every thing contained in it, with a reference to the matter and ſcope, that the whole wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Authour may be diſcovered. And to inſtruct him to obſerve all this in an Authour I would Analyſe a Diſcourſe to ſhew him, How he ſhould proceed in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his thoughts to reflect upon all theſe things in his Authour; and having both by Precept and Example ſhewed him what he ought to do: I would give him a task to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his mind to do the like, and wherein he ſhould fail, I would rectifie him till he ſhould be complete in this Act, and uſe of his Reaſon alſo.</p>

the Practiſe and uſe of Reaſon; I woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> then bring him to exerciſe his Reaſon Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, that is by a way of begetting an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> producing Notions within himſelf concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Subject which ſhould be given him to Meditate on Rationally. Here then he ſhould be taught what the Difference and uſe is of Analyſis and Geneſis: <hi>viz.</hi> that by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the former we reflect upon the Acts of other mens Reaſoning, and by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the latter we ſtirre up our own Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to make uſe of it, to produce Acts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Rules which we have been taught. And to make him complete in this way alſo, Firſt the Precepts belonging to the way are to be delivered, and then an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of thoſe Precepts is to be given, and according to theſe Precepts and Example he is to be exerciſed, firſt to meditate upon a ſimple <hi>thema.</hi> (as they call it) Genetically, and then upon a compound <hi>thema.</hi> By a <hi>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> is meant a Matter of Meditation, which is either a ſingle Notion or a Propoſition, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimple or compound: of which things it is needleſſe now to ſpeak at large. The ſumme of all is this: that the Right uſe of Reaſon is to be taught firſt in the Practiſe, before it be taught in the Theorie, and the Analyticall way of Practice is to go before the Geneticall, and in this teaching the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50670:44"/>
degrees of every Practice are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and in every degree, whether the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts directing the to mind obſerve the Rules of Practice, go before the Example which the Teacher is to propoſe; or whether they follow the ſame as obſervations, to cauſe the mind reflect upon the things to be imitated in the example, or whether ſome Precepts be given by way of <hi>Praecognita</hi> before, or ſome by way of obſervation after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; it is not greatly materiall: if they never be ſeparate, but go in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of exerciſe together, the one alwayes giving light to the other, and both fitted by the Prudencie of the Teacher to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Scholar. And when the uſe of Reaſon hath been thus fully taught in a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall way; then the Scientificall and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Precepts thereof are to be delivered reflexively upon the Rules of Practice, which have been fully conceived. For the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect knowledge muſt be propoſed before the reflex be offered, becauſe none can reflect upon his way of knowing before he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it; therefore the way of knowing Actually muſt be experimentally propoſed, before the Theoreticall way of apprehending matters be reflexively taught; which is quite oppoſite to the Practice of thoſe that teach Logick in an ordinary way: who deliver all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50670:45"/>
even to Children Reflexively and Scientifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: before they exerciſe them in any point of Practice, except in that of a confuſed, endleſſe, unprofitable way of diſputing about Notions which is falſly called Logick, by which means thoſe that ſhould be made Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Right Reaſon, are made habitually wranglers about the Terms of an Art, which they never have been taught: and in ſtead of making uſe of their Rationall Facultie, to ſet it in a way to order their Imaginations aright, they are onely directed and exerciſed to ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize their Imaginations, and pride themſelves in this mainly to have ſuch conceptions, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
