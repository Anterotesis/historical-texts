            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He number is so great of those, who, in these times, drinke <hi>Chocolate,</hi> that not onely in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where this kinde of Drinke hath its orignall; but it is also much used in <hi>Spaine, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and particularly at the Court. And many doe speake diversly of it, according to the benefit, or hurt, they receive from it: Some saying, that it is stopping: Others, and those the greater part, that it makes one fat: Others, that the use of it strengthens the stomacke: Others, that it heats, and burnes them: And others say, that although they take it every houre, and in the Dog-dayes, yet they finde themselves well with it. And therefore my desire is, to take this paines, for the pleasure, and profit of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke; endeavouring to accommodate it to the content of all, according to the variety of those things, where with it may be mixt; that so every man may make choise of that, which shall be most agreeable to his disposition. I have not seen any, who hath written any thing, concerning this drinke; but onely a Physitian of <hi>Marchena,</hi> who (as it seemes) writ onely by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; holding an opinion, that the <hi>Chocolate</hi> is stopping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that <hi>Cacao</hi> (the principall Ingredient of which it is made) is cold, and dry. But because this onely reason, may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8957:5"/>
not have power to keepe some from the use of it, who are troubled with Opilations. I thinke fit to defend this <hi>Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> with Philosophicall Reasons, against any, whosoever will condemne this Drinke, which is so wholesome, and so good, knowing how to make the Paste in that manner, that it may be agreeable to divers dispositions, in the moderate drinking of it. And so, with all possible brevity, I shall distinguish and divide this Treatise into foure poynts, or Heads. In the first place I shall declare, what <hi>Chocolate</hi> is; and what are the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of <hi>Cacao,</hi> and the other Ingredients of this <hi>Confection;</hi> where I shall treate of the Receipt set downe by the aforesaid Author of <hi>Marchena,</hi> and declare my opinion concerning the same. The second point shall treat of the Quality, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulteth out of the mixture of these Simples, which are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. In the third place, the manner of Compounding; and how many wayes they use to drinke it in the <hi>Indies.</hi> In the fourth, and last place, I shall treate of the Quantity; and how it ought to be taken; at what Time; and by what Persons.</p>

            <head>The first Point.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the first Point, I say, that <hi>Chocolate</hi> is a Name of the <hi>Indians;</hi> which in our vulgar <hi>Castili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> we may call a certaine <hi>Confection,</hi> in which (amongst other Ingredients) the principall <hi>Basis,</hi> and Foundation, is the <hi>Cacao;</hi> of whose Nature and Quality it is necessary first to treat: And therefore I say, according to the common received opinion, that it is cold, and dry, <hi>à prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominio;</hi> that is to say, that though it be true, that every Simple containes in it the Qualities of the foure Elements, in the action, and re-action, which it hath in it, yet there results
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8957:5"/>
another distinct Quality, which we call Complexion.</p>
            <p>This Quality, or Complexion, which ariseth of this Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not alwayes one, and the same; neither hath it the effect, in all the mixtures, but they may be varied nine wayes; foure <hi>Simple,</hi> from whence one onely quality doth abound; and foure <hi>Compounded,</hi> from whence two Symbolizing qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are predominant, and one other, which we call <hi>ad pondus,</hi> which is of all these fore-said qualities, which are in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> that is to say in equall measure and degree.</p>
            <p>Of all these, the Complexion of <hi>Cacao</hi> is composed, since there arise two qualities, which are cold, and dry; and in the substance, that rules them, hath it <hi>restringent</hi> and <hi>obstructive,</hi> of the nature of the Element of the <hi>Earth.</hi> And then, as it is a Mixe, and not a simple Element, it must needes have parts correspondent to the rest of the Elements; and particularly, it partakes (and that, not a little) of those, which correspond with the Element of Aire, that is, Heat and Moysture, which are governed by the Unctuous parts; there being drawne out of the <hi>Cacao</hi> much Butter, which, in the <hi>Indies</hi> I have seene drawne out of it, for the Face, by the <hi>Criollas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may Philosophically be objected, in this manner: <hi>Two contrary Qualities, and Disagreeing, cannot be,</hi> in gradu inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>in one and the same Subject:</hi> Cacao <hi>is cold and drie, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominency: Therefore, it cannot have the qualities contrary to those; which are Heate, and Moysture. The first Proposition is most certaine, and grounded upon good Philosophy: The second is consented unto, by all: The third, which is the Conclusion, is regular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denyed, but that the <hi>Argument</hi> is very strong, and these reasons being considered by him of <hi>Marchena,</hi> have made him affirme, that <hi>Chocolate</hi> is Obstructive; it seeming to be contrary to Philosophy, that it there should bee found <hi>Heate</hi> and <hi>Moysture, in gradu intenso;</hi> and to be so likewise in <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Dry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:8957:6"/>
To this, there are two things to be answered: One, that he never saw the experience of drawing out the Butter, which I have done; and that when the <hi>Chocolate</hi> is made without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing to the dryed Powder, which is incorporated, onely by beating it well together, and is united, and made into a Paste, which is a signe that there is a moist, and glutinous part, which, of necessity, must correspond with the Element of Aire.</p>
            <p>The other reason, we will draw from Philosophy; affirming that, in the <hi>Cacao,</hi> there are different Substances. In the one, that is to say, in that, which is not so fat, it hath a greater quantity of the Oylie, then of the earthy substance; and in the fatter parts, it hath more of the earthy than of the Oily substance. In these there is Heat and Moysture in predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy and in the other cold and dry.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that it is hard to be believed, that in one and the same substance, and so little of the <hi>Cacao,</hi> it can have substances so different: To the end that it may appeare more easie, cleare, and evident, first we see it in the <hi>Rubarbe,</hi> which hath in it hot and soluble parts, and parts which are Binding, Cold and Dry which have a vertue to strengthen, binde, and stop the loosenesse of the Belly: I say also, that hee that sees, and considers the steele, so much of the Nature of the earth, as being heavy, thicke, cold, and dry; it seemes to be thought unproper for the caring of Opilations, but rather to be apt, to encrease them; and yet it is given for a proper remedy against them.</p>
            <p>This difficulty is cleared thus, that though it be true, that it hath much of the Earthy part; yet it hath also parts of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and of Quick-silver, which doe open, and disopilate; neither doth it so, untill it be helped by Art, as it is ground, stirred, and made fine, in the preparing of it; the Sulphurous parts, and those of Quick-silver, being thinne, active, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrative, they mingle, at the last with those parts, which are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8957:6"/>
Earthy and astringent: Insomuch, that they being mingled after this manner, one with another, we cannot now say, that the steele is astringent, but rather, that it is penetrative, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating, and opening. Let us prove this Doctrine by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities; and let the first be from <hi>Gallen, lib.</hi> 3. of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Simples, <hi>cap.</hi> 14. Where, first of all he teacheth, that almost all those Medicines, which, to our sence, seeme to bee <hi>simple,</hi> are notwithstanding naturally <hi>Compounded,</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in themselves contrary qualities; and that is to say, a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to expell, and to retaine; to incrassate, and attenuate; to rarifie, and to condense. Neither are we to wonder at it, it being understood, that in every fore-said Medicine, there is a quality to heate, and to coole; to moisten and to dry. And whatsoever Medicine it bee, it hath in it, thicke, and thinne parts; rare, and dense; soft, and hard. And in the fifteenth Chapter following, in the same Booke, hee puts an example of the Broth of a Cocke, which moves the Belly; and the Flesh hath the vertue to binde. He puts also the example of the <hi>Aloes,</hi> which if it be washt, looseth the Purgative vertue; or that which it hath, is but weake.</p>
            <p>That this differing vertue, and faculty, is found in divers substances, or parts of simple Medicaments, <hi>Gallen</hi> shewes in the first Booke of his simple Medicines, and the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, bringing the example of Milke; in which, three substances are found, and separated, that is to say, the substance of Cheese, which hath the vertue to stop the Fluxe of the Belly; and the substance of Whay, which is Purging; and Butter, as it is expressed in the said <hi>Gallen, Cap.</hi> 15. Also we finde in Wine which is in the Must, three substances, that is to say, earth, which is the chiefe; and a thinner sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which is the flower, and may be called the scum, or froath: and a third substance, which we properly call Wine; And every one of these substances, containes in it selfe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers qualities, and vertues; in the colour, in the smell, and in other Accidents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:8957:7"/>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the fourth Booke of the Meteors and the first Chapter, treating of Putrifaction, hee found the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; and in the second Chapter next following, where he that is curious, may read it. And also by the doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> and of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> divers substances are attributed to every of the mixt under one and the same forme and quantity; which is very conformable to reason, if we consider, that every Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be it never so simple, begets, and produceth in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, foure humours, not onely differing in temper, but also in substance; and begets more or lesse of that humour, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as that Aliment hath more or fewer parts correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the substance of that humour, which is most ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. And so in cold diseases, we give warme nourishment; and cold nourishment, in hot diseases.</p>
            <p>From which evident examples, and many others, which we might produce to this purpose, wee may gather, that, when we grinde, and stirre the <hi>Cacao,</hi> the divers parts, which Nature hath given it, doe artificially, and intimately mixe themselves one with an other; and so the uuctuous, warme, and moist parts, mingled with the earthy (as we have said of the steele) represses, and leaves them not so binding, as they were before; but rather with a mediocritie, more inclining to the warme, and moist temper of the Aire, then to the cold and dry of the Earth; as it doth appeare when it is made fit to drinke; that you scarce give it two turnes with the Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net when there riseth a fatty scumme: by which you may see, how much it partaketh of the Oylie part.</p>
            <p>From which doctrine I gather, that the Author of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chena,</hi> was in an errour; who, writing of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> saith, that it causeth Opilations, because <hi>Cacao</hi> is astringent; as if that astriction were not corrected, by the intimate mixing of one part with an other, by meanes of the grinding, as is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Besides, it having so many ingredients, which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally hot, it must of necessity have this effect; that is to say,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8957:7"/>
to open, attenuate, and not to binde, and, indeed, there is no cause of bringing more examples, or producing more reasons, for this truth, then that which we see in the <hi>Cacao</hi> it selfe: which, if it be not stirred, and compounded, as aforesaid, to make the <hi>Chocolate.</hi> But eating of it, as it is in the fruite, as the <hi>Criollas</hi> eate it in the <hi>Indies,</hi> it doth notably obstruct, and cause stoppings; for no other cause but this, that the divers substances which it containes, are not perfectly mingled by the mastication onely, but require the artificiall mixture, which we have spoken of before.</p>
            <p>Besides, our Adversary should have considered, and called to his memory, the first rudiments of Philosophy, That, <hi>à dicto secundum quid, ad dictum simpliciter, non valet conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia;</hi> As it is not enough to say, the Black-a-Moore is white, because his teeth are white; for hee may bee blacke, though he have white teeth; and so it is not enough io say, that the <hi>Cacao</hi> is stopping; and therefore the Confection, which is made of it, is also stopping.</p>
            <p>The Tree, which beares this fruit, is so delicate; and the earth, where it growes, is so extreame hot, that to keepe the tree from being consumed by the Sun, they first plant other trees; and when they are growne up, to a good heighth, then they plant the <hi>Cacao-</hi>trees; that when it first shewes it selfe above the ground, those trees, which are already growne, may shelter it from the Sunne; and the fruit doth not grow naked, but ten or twelue of them are in one Gorde or Codde, which is of the bignes of a great blacke Figge, or bigger, and of the same forme, and colour.</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of <hi>Cacao;</hi> the one is common, which is of a gray colour, inclining towards red; the other is broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and bigger, which they call <hi>Patlaxte,</hi> and this is white, and more drying; whereby it causeth watchfulnes, and drives away sleepe, and therefore it is not so usefull, as the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This shall suffice to be said of the <hi>Cacao.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:8957:8"/>
And as for the rest of the ingredients, which make our <hi>Chocolaticall</hi> Confection, there is notable variety; because some doe put into it blacke Pepper, and also <hi>Tauasco;</hi> which is not proper, because is is so hot and dry; but onely for one, <note place="margin">A red roote like Madder.</note> who hath a very cold Liver. And of this opinion, was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Doctor of the Universite of <hi>Mexico,</hi> of whom a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man of good credit told me, that he finding the ordinary round Pepper was not fit to bring his purpose about; and to the end, he might discover, whether the long red pepper were more proper, he made triall upon the liver of a Sheepe; and putting the ordinary pepper on one side, and the red pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <note place="margin">Chile.</note> on the other, after 24. houres, the part, where the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pepperlay, was dryed up; and the other part continued moist, as if nothing had bin throwen upon it.</p>
            <p>The Receipt of him who wrote at <hi>Marchena,</hi> is this: Of <hi>Cacaos,</hi> 700; of white Sugar, one pound and a halfe; Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, 2. ounces; of long red pepper, 14. of Cloves, halfe an ounce: Three Cods of the Logwood or Campeche tree; or in stead of that, the weight of 2. Reals, or a shilling of Annis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds; as much of <hi>Achiote,</hi> as will give it the colour, which is about the quantity of a Hasell-nut. Some put in Almons, kernels of Nuts, and Orenge-flower-water.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Receipt, I shall first say, This shooe will not fit every foote; but for those, who have diseases, or are inclining to be infirme, you may either adde, or take away, according to the necessity, and temperature of every one: and I hold it not amisse, that Sugar bee put into it, when it is drunke, so that it be according to the quantity I shall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter set downe. And sometimes they make Tablets of the Sugar, and the <hi>Chocolate</hi> together; which they doe onely to please the Pallats, as the Dames of <hi>Mexico</hi> doe use it; and they are there sold in shops, and are confected and eaten like other sweet-meats. For the Cloves, which are put into this drinke, by the Author aforesaid, the best Writers of this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8957:8"/>
Composition use them not; peradventure upon this reason: that although they take away the ill savour of the mouth, they binde; as a learned Writer hath exprest in these verses:</p>

            <p>The husks or Cods of Logwood, or Campeche, are very good, and smell like Fennell; and every one puts in of these, because they are not very hot; though it excuse not the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of Annis-seed, as sayes the Author of this Receipt; for there is no <hi>Chocolate</hi> without it, because it is good for many cold diseases, being hot in the third degree; and to temper the coldnesse of the <hi>Cacao;</hi> and that it may appeare, it helpes the indisposition of cold parts, I will cite the Verses of one, curious in this Art:</p>

            <p>The quantity of a Nut of the <hi>Achiote</hi> is too little to colour the quantity made according to his Receipt; and therefore, <note place="margin">Tabasco.</note> he that makes it, may put it in, as much as he thinkes fit.</p>
            <p>Those, who adde Almons, and Nuts, doe not ill; because they give it more body and substance then <hi>Maiz,</hi> or <hi>Paniso,</hi> which others use; and for my part, I should alwayes put it in to <note place="margin">A graine like Millet</note> 
               <hi>Chocolate,</hi> for Almonds (besides what I have said of them before) are moderately hot, and have a thin juice; but you must not use new Almons, as a learned Author sayes in these Verses.</p>

And the small Nuts are not ill for our purpose; for they have almost the temper, which the Almons have; onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are dryer, they come nearer the temper of Choler; and doe therefore strengthen the Belly, and the Stomacke, being dryed: for so they must be used for the Confection; and they preserve the head from those vapours, which rise from the Belly: as it appeares by the said Author in these Verses.</p>

            <p>Those who mixe <hi>Maiz,</hi> or <hi>Paniso,</hi> in the <hi>Chocolate</hi> doe very ill; because those graines doe beget a very melancholy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: as the same Author expresseth in these verses.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Cinamon</hi> is hot and dry in the third degree; it provokes Urine, and helpes the Kidneys and Reynes of those who are troubled with cold diseases; and it is good for the eyes; and in effect, it is cordiall; as appeares by the Author of these verses.</p>

Patients, to cut, and attenuate the grosse humours, which do cause shortnesse of breath, and stopping of urine; and so it may be used for any kind of Opilations; for we give it for the stoppings, which are in the breast, or in the Region of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or any other part of the Body.</p>
            <p>And concerning the long red Peper, there are foure sorts of it. One is called <hi>Chilchotes:</hi> the other very little, which they call <hi>Chilterpin;</hi> and these two kindes, are very quicke and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The other two are called <hi>Tonalchiles,</hi> and these are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately hot; for they are eaten with bread, as they eate other fruits, and they are of a yellow colour; and they grow onely about the Townes, which are in, and adjoyning to the Lake of <hi>Mexico.</hi> The other Pepper is called <hi>Chilpaclagua,</hi> which hath a broad huske; and this is not so biting as the first; nor so gentle as the last: and is that, which is usually put into the <hi>Chocolate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are also other ingredients, which are used in this <hi>Confection.</hi> One called <hi>Mechasuchil;</hi> and another which they call <hi>Vinecaxtli,</hi> which in the <hi>Spanish</hi> they call <hi>Orejuelas,</hi> which are sweet smelling Flowers, Aromaticall and hot. And the <hi>Mechasuchil</hi> hath a Purgative quality; for in the <hi>Indies</hi> they make a purging potion of it. In stead of this, in <hi>Spaine</hi> they put into the <hi>Confection,</hi> powder of Roses of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for opening the Belly.</p>
            <p>I have spoken of all these Ingredients, that every one may make choise of those which please him best, or are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for his infirmities.</p>

            <head>The second Point.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S concerning the second poynt, I say, as I have said before, that though it be true, that the <hi>Cacao</hi> is mingled with all these Ingedients, which are hot; yet there is to be a greater quantity of <hi>Cacao;</hi> then of all the rest of the Ingredients, which serve to temper the coldnesse of the <hi>Cacao:</hi> Just as when wee seeke, of two Medicines of contrary qualities, to compound one, which shall be of a modera te temper: In the same manner doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the same action and re-action of the cold parts of the <hi>Cacao,</hi> and of the hot parts of the other ingredients, which makes the <hi>Chocolate</hi> of so moderate a quality, that it differs very little from a mediocrity; and when there is not put in any ordinary pepper, or Cloves, but onely a little Annis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seede (as I shall shew hereafter) we may boldly say, that it is very temperate. And this may be proved by reason, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: (supposing that which <hi>Gallen</hi> sayes, to be true, that every mixt medicine, warmeth the cold, and cooleth the hot; bringing the example of Oyle of Roses.) By experience, I say, that in the <hi>Indies</hi> (as is the custome of that Countrey) I comming in a heat to visit a sicke person, and asking water to refresh me, they perswaded me to take a *Draught of <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate;</hi> which quencht my thirst: and in the morning (if I <note place="margin">Hicara; the shell of a Nut to drinke in.</note> tooke it fasting) it did warme and comfort my stomacke. Now let us prove it by reason. We have already proved, that all the parts of the <hi>Cacao</hi> are not cold. For wee have made it appeare that the unctuous parts, which are many, be all hot, or temperate: then, though it be true, that the quantity of the <hi>Cacao</hi> is greater than of all the rest of the Ingredients,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8957:10"/>
yet the cold parts are at the most, not halse so many as the hot; and if for all this they should be more, yet by stirring, &amp; ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the warme unctuous parts, they are much qualified. And, on the other side, it being mixt with the other Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which are hot in the second and third degree, being the predominant quality, it must needes be brought to a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity. Like as two men, who shake hands, the one being hot, and the other cold, the one hand borrowes heat, and the other is made colder; and in conclusion, neither hand retains the cold, or heat it had before, but both of them remaine more temperate. So like wise two men, who goe to wrestle, at the first they are in their full vigour and strength; but after they have strugled a while, their force lessens by degrees, till at last they are both much weaker, than when they beganne to wrestle. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> was also of this opinion in his fourth Booke of the Nature of Beasts, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Where he sayes, that every Agent suffers with the patient; as that which cuts, is made dull by the thing it cuts; that which warmes, cooles it selfe; and that which thrusts, or forceth forward, is in some sort driven backe it selfe.</p>
            <p>From whence I gather that it is better to use <hi>Chocolate,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath beene made some time, a Moneth at the least. I believe this time to be necessary, for breaking the contrary qualities of the severall Ingredients, and to bring the Drinke to a moderate temper. For, as it alwayes falls out at the first, that every contrary will have it predominancy, and will work his owne, Nature not liking well to be heated and cooled, at the same time. And this is the cause why <hi>Gallen</hi> in his twelfth Booke of <hi>Method,</hi> doth advise not to use <hi>Philonium,</hi> till after a yeare, or, at the least, sixe moneths; because it is a composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of <hi>Opium</hi> (which is cold in the fourth degree) and of Pepper, and other Ingredients, which are hot in the third degree. This Theorum, and Doctrine, is made good by the practise, which some have made, of whom I have asked, what 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8957:11"/>
               <hi>Chocolate</hi> did best agree with them: and they have affirmed, that the best is that which hath beene made some moneths; and that the new doth hurt by loosening the Stomack; And; in my opinion, the reason of it is, that the unctuous or fat parts, are not altogether corrected, by the earthy parts of the <hi>Cacao.</hi> And this I shall thus prove; for, as I shall declare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if you make the <hi>Chocolate</hi> boyle, when you drinke it, the boyling of it divides the fat and oyly part; and that makes a relaxation in the Stomacke in the old <hi>Chocolate,</hi> as well as if it were new.</p>
            <p>So that I conclude in this second poynt, that the <hi>Chocolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Consection</hi> is not so cold as the <hi>Cacao,</hi> nor so hot as the rest of the Ingredients; but there results from the action and re-action of these Ingredients, a moderate temper which may be good, both for the cold and hot stomacks, being taken mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, as shall be declared hereafter; and it having beene made a moneth at the least; as is already proved. And so I know not, why any man having made experience of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> (which is composed, as it ought to be, for every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular) should speake ill of it. Besides, where it is so much used, the most, if not all, as well in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as in <hi>Spaine,</hi> find, it agreeth wel with them. He of <hi>Marchena</hi> had no ground in saying, that it did cause Opilations. For, if it were so, the Liver being obstructed, it would extenuate its subject; and by experience; we see to the contrary, that it makes fat; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof I shall shew hereafter. And this shall suffice for the second Poynt.</p>

Almons, and Hasle-Nuts, of each one Dozen: Of white Sugar, halfe a pound: Of <hi>Achiote,</hi> enough to give it the colour. And if you cannot have those things, which come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> you may make it with the rest.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Cacao,</hi> and the other Ingredients must be beaten in a Morter of Stone, or ground upon a broad stone, which the <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Metate,</hi> and is onely made for that use: But the first thing that is to be done, is to dry the Ingredients, all except the <hi>Achiote;</hi> with care that they may be beaten to powder, keeping them still in stirring, that they be not burnt, or become blacke; and if they be over-dried, they will be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and lose their vertue. The Cinamon, and the long red Pepper are to be first beaten, with the Annis-seed; and then beate the <hi>Cacao,</hi> which you must beate by a little and, little, till it be all powdred; and sometimes turne it round in the beating, that it may mixe the better: And every one of these Ingredients, must be beaten by it selfe; and then put all the Ingredients into the Vessell, where the <hi>Cacao</hi> is; which you must stirre together with a spoone, and then take out that Paste, and put it into the Morter, under which you must lay a little fire, after the <hi>Confection</hi> is made. But you must be very carefull, not to put more fire, than will warme it, that the unctuous part doe not dry away. And you must also take care, to put in the <hi>Achiote</hi> in the beating; that it may the better take the colour. You must Searse all the Ingredients, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Cacao;</hi> and if you take the shell from the <hi>Cacao,</hi> it is the better; and when you shall find it to be well beaten, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated (which you shall know by the shortnesse of it) then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8957:12"/>
with a spoone take up some of the Paste, which will be almost liquid; and so either make it into Tablets; or put it into Boxes, and when it is cold it will be hard. To make the Tablets, you must put a spoonefull of the paste upon a piece of paper, the <hi>Indians</hi> put it upon the leaf of a <hi>Planten-tree;</hi> where, being put into the shade, it growes hard; and then bowing the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Tablet falls off, by reason of the fatnesse of the paste. But if you put it into any thing of earth, or wood, it sticks fast, and will not come off, but with scraping, or breaking. In the <hi>Indies</hi> they take it two severall waies: The one, being the common way, is to take it hot, with <hi>Atolle,</hi> which was the Drinke of the Ancient <hi>Indians</hi> (the <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Atolle</hi> pappe, made of the flower of <hi>Maiz,</hi> and so they mingle it with the <hi>Chocolate;</hi> and that the <hi>Atolle</hi> may be more wholsome, they take off the Huskes of the <hi>Maiz,</hi> which is windy, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; and so there remaines onely the best and most substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall part.) Now, to returne to the matter, I say, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moderne drinke, which the Spaniards use so much, is of two sorts. The one is, that the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> being dissolved with cold water, and the scumme taken off, and put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vessell, the remainder is put upon the fire, with Sugar; and when it is warme, then powre it upon the Scumme you tooke off before, and so drinke it. The other is to warme the water; and then, when you have put it into a pot, or dish, as much <hi>Chocolate</hi> as you thinke fit, put in a little of the warme water, and then grind it well with the molinet; and when it is well ground, put the rest of the warme water to it; and so drinke it with Sugar.</p>
               <p>Besides these former wayes, there is one other way; which is, to put the <hi>Chocolate</hi> into a pipkin, with a little water; and let it boyle well, till it be dissolved; and then put in sufficient water and sugar, according to the quantity of the <hi>Chocolate;</hi> and then boyle it againe, untill there comes an oyly summe upon it; and then drinke it. But if you put too much fire, it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8957:13"/>
will runne over, and spoyle. But, in my opinion, this last way is not so wholsome, though it pleaseth the pallate better; because, when the Oily is divided from the earthy part, which remaines at the bottome, it causeth Melancholy; and the oily part loosens the stomacke, and takes away the appetite. There is another way to drinke <hi>Chocolate,</hi> which is cold; and it takes its name from the principall Ingredient, and is called <hi>Cacao;</hi> which they use at feasts, to refresh themselves; and it is made afrer this manner. The <hi>Chocolate</hi> being dissolved in water with the <hi>Molinet,</hi> take off the scumme, or crassy part, which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in greater quantity, when the <hi>Cacao</hi> is older, and more putrified. The scumme is laid aside by it selfe in a little dish; and then put sugar into that part, from whence you took the scumme; and powre it from on high into the scumme; and so drinke it cold. And this drinke is so cold, that it agreeth not with all mens stomacks; for by experience we finde the hurt it doth, by causing paines in the stomacke, and especially to Women. I could deliver the reason of it; but I avoyd it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I will not be tedious.</p>
               <p>There is another way to drinke it cold, which is called <hi>Cacao Penoli;</hi> and it is done, by adding to the same <hi>Chocolate</hi> (having made the <hi>Confection,</hi> as is before set downe) so much <hi>Maiz,</hi> dryed, and well ground, and taken from the Huske, and then well mingled, in the Morter, with the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> it falls all into flowre, or dust: And so these things being mingled, as is said before, there riseth the Scum; and so you take and drink it, as before.</p>
               <p>There is another way, which is a shorter and quicker way of making it, for men of businesse, who cannot stay long about it; and it is more wholsome; and it is that, which I use. That is, first to set some water to warm; and while it warms, you throw a Tablet, or some <hi>Chocolate,</hi> scraped, and mingled with sugar, into a little Cup; and when the water is hot, you power the water to the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> and then dissolve it with 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8957:13"/>
the Molinet; and then, without taking off the scum, drinke it, as is before directed.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here remaines to be handled in the last Poynt, of the Quantity, which is to be drunke: at what Time; and by what persons: because if it be drunk beyond measure, not onely of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> but of all other drinkes; or meates, though of themselves they are good and wholsome, they may be hurtfull. And if any finde it Opilative, it comes by the too much use of it; as when one drinkes over much Wine, in stead of comforting, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himselfe, he breedes, and nourisheth cold diseases; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Nature cannot overcome it, nor turne so great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity into good nourishment. So he that drinks much <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> which hath fat parts, cannot make distribution of so great a quantity to all the parts; and that part which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in the slender veines of the Liver, must needs cause Opilations, and Obstructions.</p>
            <p>To avoyd this inconvenience; you must onely take five or sixe ounces, in the morning, if it be in winter; and if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who takes it, be Cholericke, in stead of ordinary water, let him take the distilled water of Endive. The same reason serves in Summer, for those, who take it physically, having the Liver hot and obstructed. If his Liver be cold and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, then to use the water of <hi>Rubarb.</hi> And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, you may take it till the Moneth of <hi>May;</hi> especially in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8957:14"/>
temperate dayes. But I doe not approve, that, in the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, it should be taken in <hi>Spaine,</hi> unlesse it bee one, who by custome of taking it, receives no prejudice by it. And if he be of a hot Constitution, and that hee have neede to take it in that season, let it, as is said before, be mingled with water of <hi>Endive;</hi> and once in foure dayes, and chiefely when he finds his stomacke in the morning to be weake and fainting. And though it be true, that, in the <hi>Indies,</hi> they use it all the yeare long, it being a very hot Countrey, and so it may seeme by the same reason it may be taken in <hi>Spaine:</hi> First, I say, that Custome may allow it: Secondly, that, as there is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary proportion of heat, so there is also of moisture; which helpes; with the exorbitant heate, to open the pores; and so dissipates, and impoverisheth our substance, or naturall vigor: by reason wherof, not only in the morning; but at any time of the day, they use it without prejudice. And this is most true, that the excessive heate of the Countrey, drawes out the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat, and disperseth that of the stomacke, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts: Insomuch, that though the weather be never so hot, yet the stomacke being cold, it usually doth good. I do not onely say this of the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> which; as I have proved, hath a moderate heat. But if you drink pure wine, be the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never so hot, it hurts not, but rather comforts the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack; and if in hot weather you drinke water, the hurt it doth is apparent, in that it cooles the stomacke too much; from whence comes a viciated Concoction, and a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconveniences.</p>
            <p>You must also observe, that it being granted, as I have said, that there are earthy parts in the <hi>Cacao,</hi> which fall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Cup, when you make the drinke, divers are of the opinion, that, that which remaines, is the best and more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall; and they hurt them selves not a little, by drinking of it. For besides, that it is an earthy substance, thick, and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, it is of a melancholy Nature; and therefore you must
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8957:14"/>
avoyd the drinking of it, contenting your selfe with the best, which is the most substantiall.</p>
            <p>Last of all, there rests one difficulty to be resolved, formerly poynted at; namely, what is the cause, why <hi>Chocolate</hi> makes most of them that drinke it, fat. For, considering that all of the Ingredients, except the <hi>Cacao,</hi> doe rather extenuate, than make fat, because they are hot and drye in the third degree. For we have already said, that the qualities which doe predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in <hi>Cacao,</hi> are cold, and dry; which are very unfit to adde any substance to the body. Neverthelesse, I say, that the many unctuous parts, which I have proved to be in the <hi>Cacao,</hi> are those, which pinguifie, and make fat; and the hotter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of this Composition, serve for a guide, or vehicall, to passe to the Liver, and the other parts, untill they come to the fleshy parts; and there finding a like substance, which is hot and moyst, as is the unctuous part, converting it selfe into the same substance, it doth augment and pinguifie. Much more might bee said from the grounds of Philosophy, and Physicke; but because that is fitter for the Schooles, than for this discourse, I leave it, &amp; only give this Caution, that in my Receipt, you may adde Mellon-seeds, and seeds of Pompions of <hi>Valencia,</hi> dryed, and beaten into powder, where there is any heat of the Liver or Kidnyes. And if there be any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of the Liver, or Spleene, with any cold distemper, you may mixe the powder of <hi>Ceterach;</hi> to which you may adde Amber, or Muske, to please the scent.</p>
            <p>And it will be no small matter, to have pleased all, with this Discourse.</p>
