            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>BISHOP GOOD MAN His Propoſition:</hi> In diſcharge of his own Dutie and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence both to God and Man.</head>
            <p>PRivate intereſts, as they work the deepeſt impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo are they uſually the firſt motives and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of great Publick deſignes; though I am not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of ſome ſecrecies, and cloſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of buſineſs in theſe times; yet here, I will onely take notice of ſuch things as did manifeſtly appear to the Publick view.</p>
            <p>The beginning of our late troubles and wars, was upon this occaſion: K. <hi>Charles</hi> ſent down the Common-Prayer Book to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>K.</hi> Charles.</note> be uſed in the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Church; and as the <hi>L. Archbiſhop of S. Andrews,</hi> then Chancellour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, If it had been recommended to an <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> there to have been diſcuſſed; or if it had been ſent <hi>to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> there to have been confirmed, it is thought it might have taken good effect. I doe therefore much commend the practice of former times. That K. <hi>James</hi> began his Reigne <note place="margin">
                  <hi>K.</hi> James.</note> with the Conference <hi>at Hampton Court,</hi> which did much ſettle and paciſie the controverſies then in the <hi>Church of England.</hi> Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> began her Reigne with a <hi>ſolemne Diſputation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</note> 
               <hi>the Biſhops, and thoſe other Divines, who had fled for Religion beyond Seas.</hi> So in Q. <hi>Maries time,</hi> there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Mary.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:172639:2"/>
Diſputations concerning Religion, as appears in Mr. <hi>Fox his Acts and Monuments.</hi> In K. <hi>Edward the 6. time,</hi> came ſome <note place="margin">Edward 6.</note> Divines out of <hi>Germany,</hi> as <hi>Bucer, Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rtir, Fabius,</hi> who were ſent to both the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> there to diſpute and determine controverſies in Religion. <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. did his beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Henry</hi> 8, Head of the Church</note> to procure <hi>Philip Melanchthon</hi> to come over; and though he fayled therein, yet <hi>Agents came from the ſeverall Princes of Germany,</hi> who together with the <hi>Kings Commiſſioners might <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for the ſetling of Religion:</hi> I have ſeen the Originalls as they were copied out by the Clerks; the <hi>Engliſh Commiſſioners</hi> did acquaint the <hi>Forain Agents,</hi> that K. <hi>Henry</hi> had aſſumed the Title, <hi>to be Head of his Church,</hi> and for ſupport of that great honour, he had Firſt fruits, Tenths, Subſidies, and other pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Clergy; he had likewiſe the diſpoſing of <hi>Church preferments,</hi> whereby he was abſolute in the Government both <hi>of Church and State,</hi> and none of his Subjects had any forain dependance, or could appeal to the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Relations did little pleaſe the <hi>forain Agents,</hi> for they did conſider, That if the King ſhould be the ſupreme Head of his Church; then it would follow, That the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſhould be the Supreme Head of the <hi>Church of Germany,</hi> whom they hated ten times more then the <hi>Pope;</hi> and therefore, their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was, that as <hi>Scripture</hi> was the onely <hi>judge of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> in Religion, to determine them; ſo <hi>Scripture ſhould be the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Scripture head of the Church.</note> 
               <hi>head of their Church,</hi> they would be wholly govesned by <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> they would obey none but <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and acknowledge no other head: It ſhould ſeem their wiſedom proceeded not ſo far, as to demand who ſhould <hi>interpret Scriptures,</hi> or who ſhould <hi>judge of the Expoſition of Scriptures?</hi> In default, and for want of ſuch conference to ſettle Religion, <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. made no other change in Religion, but onely took upon himſelf the <hi>Government,</hi> and in right thereof, he diſpoſed of the <hi>Revenewes;</hi> and to this <hi>Church Government</hi> did belong <hi>Matrimoniall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:172639:2"/>
to proceed againſt his own Wife, <hi>Anne of Cleeves</hi> in point of Hereſie, and ſo to have burnt her in ſtead of a divorce, had ſhe not very wiſely (though falſly) accuſed her ſelf to have been formerly precontracted, whereby the Delegates (ſuch as had their power from the King) adjudged the Marriage to be void, and both parties to be at liberty to match where they pleaſed; and that <hi>principall Chaplain,</hi> who was ſo much imployed in the Divorce, was now as much imployed to find out Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the lawfulneſſe of Polygamie, ſo to ſatisfie his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <note place="margin">Polygamie,</note> appetite with variety, and to give him greater hopes of Iſſue: and had it not been that the King was now grown in years, and his body exhauſted and tyred out with his own luſt, it is not unlike but he might have conſented thereunto; and then being an approved Doctrine by the <hi>head of the Church,</hi> it might have paſt <hi>for very ſound and Orthodox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to dwell altogether at home, if we look abroad, we ſhall find that very lately <hi>the Synod at Dort did ſettle the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Synod of Dort,</note> 
               <hi>of Religion in the Low-Countries,</hi> which together with the ſacrificing of old <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> did procure their peace; and not onely in <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> but <hi>in the Church of Rome,</hi> the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> did much ſettle the <hi>Controverſies in that</hi>

               </note> where every man might give an account of his Faith; but this were to expoſe the truth to great inconveniences <hi>choler and paſſion</hi> doe therein uſually prevail, there would be a needleſſe multiplying of words; and ſomtimes in a hot purſuit (the Hare would he loſt) we might loſe the ſtate of the queſtion: and commonly, men contend not ſo much for Truth, as for Victory. If then, in diſcharge of mine own duty both to God and man, I <hi>ſhould propoſe a courſe,</hi> I hope it could not be offenſive.</p>
            <p>For I ſee as mean men as my ſelf in the City, who have their private Congregations, their ſet times of meetings on the week dayes; they have their conferences, private faſts, and thankſgivings; and even in Churches they have Lectures ſet up without any licence, or publick authority; then why ſhould <note place="margin">The reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving doubtt in <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </note> I be afraid to ſet up an Exerciſe to ſatisfie mens doubts and ſcruples in Religion? no man is bound to beleeve, but wholly left <hi>to God and his own Conſcience,</hi> that when he finds <hi>better reaſons</hi> to perſwade him, he may alter and change his opinion: Thus as there are temporall Courts to determine controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies concerning the right of Inheritance, and other differences between men; ſo there may be a little power left in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Court, onely to ſatisfie the doubts and ſeruples made in Religion; and ſuch a courſe (God willing) I doe propoſe to my ſelf, to undertake towards the end of <hi>May;</hi> I give long warning before-hand, that if I ſhould be forbidden, I might deſiſt.</p>
            <p>The Order which I ſhall obſerve is this, That he who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the doubts, muſt preſent them in Writing, and the <note place="margin">Modeſty in preſenting the doubts.</note> Writing not to exceed half a ſheet of Paper Writen on both ſides; he muſt preſent them in <hi>modeſty,</hi> giving every man that due <hi>reſpect and honour</hi> which belongs to his <hi>place and calling;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:172639:3"/>
he muſt ſubſcribe his name, his age, the condition and courſe of his life, the place of his dwelling; and it were to be wiſhed, that ſome others would teſtifie their knowledge of him. His doubts ſhall then be publikely read, and in due time they ſhall be anſwered. I doe not herein preſume on mine own weakneſs, but upon <hi>Gods great mercy and goodneſſe,</hi> who never will be wanting in his own cauſe, and in defence of the truth; neither will I neglect the means under God, but I will adviſe and hold correſpondency with the beſt <hi>learned men in England,</hi> and I <hi>doubt not but God will aſſiſt.</hi> I am now paſt the age of man, and conſequently paſt as the joyes and hopes of this world, ſo paſt the fears and terrours of this world; and ſo let God be mercifull unto my ſoul at the laſt day, as I ſhall deliver no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what I conceive to be Gods truth; the World hath been now long deluded and abuſed with controverſies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in ſo much, that there is little Religion left amongſt us: I hope to diſcover ſome ſecrefies, and to make it appear who are and were the <hi>great Impoſtere;</hi> And here I doe make this <note place="margin">Achallenge.</note> 
               <hi>profer and challenge,</hi> Let any man bring me the body or ſyſtem of his Religion, together with all the ſeverall members and branches thereof, and if I ſhall not make it plainly appear, that his Religion is a <hi>ſelf-homicide deſtroying it ſelfe;</hi> (i.) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits contradictories in it ſelf, I will be of that Religion. 2. If any man ſhall bring me a Religion which ſhall ſubſiſt with <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning,</hi> (which in <hi>effect</hi> is onely reaſon improved) I will be of that Religion. How wonderfully are we bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, for that great certainty of our Religion, which is not onely grounded upon the divine teſtimony revealed, confirmed by miracles, and wonders, far above all naturall power, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our hearts by Gods <hi>ſanctifying Spirit;</hi> together with the infuſion of grace, whereby we beleeve Miſteries above our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall capacity; but likewiſe that our Faith and Religion ſhould have thoſe ſpeciall properties of truth, that it ſhould <hi>cohaerere ſibi,</hi> agree with it ſelf, like a well governed City, or a well compacted body, <hi>paeem habens ad invicem:</hi> and as it agrees
<pb facs="tcp:172639:4"/>
with it ſelf, ſo it ſhould ſubſiſt with all humane learning, which ſerves onely to <hi>adorn Religion.</hi>

Though I commend this method, yet I will forbear to uſe it, as being not ſo fitted to every <hi>mans capacity:</hi> I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe mine now method, which is a little more eaſie: Firſt, I will uſe two or three quotations out of Scripture, and no more. 2. I will ſhew the analogy, or correſpondency which it with other Texts of Scriptute, and other Articles of our Faith. 3. I will ſhew how it was implyed in the ſtate of Nature before the giving of the Law. 4. How it was ſhadowed forth in the types, figures, and ceremonies of the Moſaicall Law. 5, How it received ripeneſs and perfection in the ſtate of the Goſpel. 6. How it hath been continued in the Church in the Primitive age, and in all ſucceeding times; and this to appear eſpecially by the ancient Liturgies, not by ſtragling words taken out of Fathers, which being ſpoken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeverall occaſions, might be variouſly interpreted. 7. The great inconveniences and abſurdities which would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, if any other Doctrine ſhould be admitted. I doe the rather acquaint you with this my method, that ſuch as ſhall have any doubts or arguments to propoſe, they may doe it according to this method, if they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>When I have anſwered Objections, then I will reduce all <note place="margin">Religion ſettled by Lavves.</note> to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is ſetled by the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

I never did regard any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Opinions; for all my time the Profeſſors in <hi>Cambridge</hi> did differ in their Opinions; the firſt difference began between Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> and Dr. <hi>Barow;</hi> then in their Succeſſors, Dr. <hi>Ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> and Dr. <hi>Playford;</hi> and then in Dr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>

while the Temporall Judges were onely aſſiſtants, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeak but when they were demanded; beſides the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Prieſt-hood, which is not to be incroached upon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of his own ſphere; thus <hi>I</hi> ſhall reduce all Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as it is ſettled by Laws.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>name of Proteſtant Religion,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> may confeſs my own weakneſs, <hi>I</hi> never yet underſtood what was meant by it; <note place="margin">Proteſtant Religion.</note> yet <hi>I</hi> have read <hi>Sleydon</hi> and <hi>Florimond</hi> both very wiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Authors, though different in their <hi>Opinions, Factions,</hi> and in all their wayes and courſes; yet they agree <hi>in the name of Proteſtant;</hi> for 1529. there was a Diet held in <hi>Germany,</hi> where many Princes, Free States, and others, did enter a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proteſtation: 1.

            <p>Now that the Church hath loſt all her Temporalties, the
<pb facs="tcp:172639:5"/>
Revenues are gone, the Juriſdiction is gone, the Honour and Eſteem is gone, and nothing left for further or future Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; it may pleaſe God to uſe this as a means that our Eyes <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moungers.</note> may be opened, and without any temporall obſtacles, we may diſcern the naked truth, and ſo agree in one Faith, while the controverſie-moungers who were the Incendiaries in the nature of Buffoones, moſt contemptible in themſelves, they muſt find out ſome other trade to thrive by; for their Patrones and Supporters have now their own ends, and ſwallowed up their morſell, and have no further uſe of them; and now they muſt fall to ſedition and matters of State between the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent;</hi> (men whoſe wit, learning, honeſty, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, carry an even and equall proportion) while all of them running themſelves out of breath, and finding how one error hath begotten an other, they will at length return home and ſeek ſhelter under the Apron of their Mother Church; and by Gods aſſiſtance I will doe my beſt endeavour to haſten their return.</p>
            <p>I cannot ferve God in any other kind, for my ſtrength will not ſerve me to Preach; and though no man doth honour Preaching more then my ſelf; yet I doe not think it alwayes a like neceſſary; where Religion is once Planted, and that men <note place="margin">Preaching when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> are ſufficiently ſatisfied in the truth of Religion, that there they ſhould be ſtill learning, and that the <hi>practice of Religion</hi> ſhould onely conſiſt in the <hi>precept;</hi> this I doe not commend; <hi>multiloquium parit contemptum;</hi> there may be <hi>Satietas in ſacris;</hi> it is not frequent and long Preaching, but painfull and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Preaching which works upon the minds and affections of men. It cannot be denied but many <hi>Sects and Sectaries</hi> have riſen from raſh and unadviſed Preaching; men muſt fill up the houre ſomtimes with impertinencies, ſomtimes with ſeditious diſcourſes; but alwayes with needleſs repetitions as the <hi>Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> commends extemporary Prayer: ſo following that example, <note place="margin">The abuſe of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> (for the reaſon is alike in both;) ſome men will Preach <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and while they ſweat in the Pulpit, and fill up the houre with weak ſtuff, the judicious hearer preſently concludes,
<pb facs="tcp:172639:6"/>
that this man breaks the fourth Commandement, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour and take pains, and the ſeventh day thou ſhalt reſt:</hi> but here he hath bin idle, and not followed his Studies the whole week, and now he labours and ſweats on the Sabbath, and truely to little purpoſe; for as it is in Husbandry, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pains of the Husbandman, together with Gods mercy, the Earth brings forth her increaſe: ſo according to the pains of the Preacher, he muſt <hi>expect</hi> that the People ſhall edifie: for if he be careleſs and negligent, and regard not his own Preaching, he cannot in juſtice <hi>expect</hi> that others ſhould greatly regard it. Thur far the judicious hearer, but the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſiſting of weak ſtuff, the weak hearer, ſuppoſe Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Artificers, if they have but a volubility of ſpeech, they will adventure to make ſuch a Sermon. Thus you have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all Trades and Profeſſions: thus ſome Miniſters deſiring to be reputed zealous and painfull in their Calling, with their tedious and frequent Preaching, they have proſtituted the very honour of Preaching, and made it contemptible.</p>
            <p>Some Preachers there are whom of all others I doe moſt commend: I confeſs I received more benefit from them, then from others; and theſe are Silenced, Sequeſtred, Plundered, and utterly ſuppreſt; for it is an Errour to think that all Preaching ſhould come from the Pulpit. Men Preach in their lives, in their actions, in their examples; <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God; and the Firmament ſheweth his handy work: one Day telleth another, and one Night certifieth another:</hi> here is excellent Preaching indeed, not an impertinent word: Thus the Church in all her Orders and Ceremonies did Preach; the building of great Cathedralls, ſet forth the Majeſty and Magnificency of God, and that he was to be ſerved like a God. Thus we conſider <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, where the very ſnuffers were of beaten Go'd; they did likewiſe aſſure us, that God had his dwelling and habitation amongſt men, which was an argument that God was once Incarnate, and viſibly converſant with men: And whereás the <hi>Jews</hi> expect a Temporall Meſſias, I doe acknowledge that in all the Old Teſtament there is not
<pb facs="tcp:172639:6"/>
one word to the contrary; and therefore I beleeve, that Chriſt <note place="margin">Chriſt was a temporal Meſſias.</note> was not onely a Spirituall, but likewiſe a Temporall Meſſias; for what Emperour or King of the World ever had or poſſibly could have ſo many Temples, ſo many Religious Houſes, ſo many Servants, Archbiſhops, and Prelats to be ſerved in ſuch rich Veſtments and Copes, ſuch continuall ſinging Prayſes and Hymnes, ſuch excellent Muſick, while all the Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Kings did bow and obey him, offering up their Crownes, and ſubmitting themſelves to his Laws, to teſtifie that the whole World was onely created for his Service, that as he was the beginning of all, ſo he might be the end of all. God cannot bereave or diveſt himſelf of that Honour, but all muſt tend and end in his Glory.</p>
            <p>Such as have pulled down theſe Temples, and committed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, <note place="margin">The natura and firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Sacriledge.</note> they doe but ſecond the Devill in his courſes; for the Devill intended to poſſeſs himſelf of Gods Throne in Heaven, and fayling in that attempt, being juſtly caſt down; yet ſtill he continues in his malice and obſtinacy towards God, and hath ſo far prevailed with his imps, the wicked of this world, that as he could not poſſeſs Gods Throne in Heaven, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould God have any Throne upon Earth; they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile God from the Earth, as the Devill was caſt down from Heaven, to be revenged of God, while God for a time permits it. Truely Sacriledge is the renouncing of God, and of his Service, and the greateſt of all ſins; and while they deſtroy Temples, they make it known whoſe ſons they are, and againſt whom they fight; while they take Gods Inheritance here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own poſſeſſion, they renounce their Inheritance in Heaven; while they adhere to the world, ceaſing upon Church means, ſpending them in all luxury and riot, they doe thereby ſhorten their own lives, and haſten to their own homes.</p>
            <p>But of all Preachers I doe moſt commend the Orders and <note place="margin">The Church did preach in her Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> Ceremonies of the Church, for they were all ſignificant, and had ſome ſpeciall uſe: As to inſtance in the obſervation of times; The Eccleſiaſticall year begins with Advent, wherein we are firſt awakened with the fears and terrors of Gods laſt
<pb facs="tcp:172639:7"/>
generall judgement; <hi>per ſetam introducimus linum,</hi> the needle firſt enters and brings the ſilk after: Then we conſider the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſity of a Saviour; and here the Propheſie of <hi>Eſay</hi> is read, which of all other Propheſies doth moſt punctually ſet forth the comming of Chriſt: Here we expreſs our hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the <hi>Antiphonies</hi> of the Church, <hi>Rorate Coeli deſuper &amp; nubes pluant juſtum, aperiatur Terra &amp; germinet Salvato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, attollite portas Principes veſtras, &amp; introibit Rex Gloriae, &amp;c.</hi> Then we conſider the Types and Figures of Chriſt in the Law: So we end our Advent with <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> the immediate fore-runner of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Then we come to the <hi>Nativitie of Chriſt,</hi> where we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the Miracles and Wonders which then paſſed the Song of the Angels, the Stars appearing to <hi>conduct</hi> the Gentiles to the place of his Birth: Here we expreſs out exceſſive joy for his comming, with all kind of mirth, with Hoſpitality to entertain the members of Chriſt: this time laſts to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, which is the time of the lying in of our Lady; and according to our own cuſtome and faſhion, while Wives are in Child bearing, there are Banquets and Feaſtings for <note place="margin">What we learn by the obſervation of time,</note> joy that a Child is born, and that the Mother is ſafely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: How much more ſhould our joy be, that God is born in our fleſh, to the ſalvation of Mankind? After the Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, we conſider the Infancy of Chriſt, and what then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; his flight into <hi>Egypt;</hi> the murther of Innocents; his return from <hi>Egypt;</hi> his manner of going to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the great Feaſts of the year; how he Diſputed with the <hi>Doctors</hi> at twelve years of age, when he was loſt in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> then we come to his Baptiſme; and his firſt Miracle of turning Water into Wine.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing our ſins are the great hinderance to Gods mercy, in <hi>Septuageſima</hi> we conſider our ſins, and how they have drawn Gods puniſhments upon us: Here <hi>Geneſis</hi> is read, <note place="margin">Septuage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima.</note> where it appears, <hi>That man was Created in happineſs, but fell for his ſin; and the puniſhment of his ſin, was no leſſe then Death;</hi> as an earneſt thereof, we ſee the murther of <hi>Abel,
<pb facs="tcp:172639:7"/>
that God would not ſpare the moſt righteous;</hi> ſo that <hi>if the Sonne of God took up mans nature,</hi> he cannot be diſpenced withall, but he muſt dye; <hi>Statutum eſt,</hi> there is a Statute paſt, and none can be exempted: This generally appears in the Deluge, where in effect all mankind periſhed, and that there are other puniſhments after Death, it is inmated unto us <note place="margin">The Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of God for ſin.</note> in the burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with fire and brimſtone. Then to ſhew the generall <hi>afflictions</hi> which befall man; it is manifeſt how <hi>Eſan</hi> did perſecute <hi>Jacob;</hi> how the Famine drove the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they lived in bondage: all this appears in that one Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For preventing Gods further anger, and appeaſing Gods wrath for ſin; there muſt be a time for repentance, with all <note place="margin">A time of repentance.</note> humility and mortification, to teſtifie our inward ſorrow; Thus we begin Lent with Aſhwedneſday, and perform that Ceremony, <hi>Pulvis es, &amp; in pulverem reverteris:</hi> Then we keep our forty dayes Faſt, according to the Imitation of Chriſt; this continues, and ends with the Death and Paſſion of Chriſt, whereby we expreſs our grief, that we ſhould be ſo wicked, <hi>that needs the Sonne of God muſt dye for our ſins.</hi> Thus, with repentance, we prepare our ſelves to celebrate the Reſurrection of Chriſt, that we might riſe together with him, and in aſſurance thereof be regenerated in him: Here we ſing our Hallelujah, with the greateſt expreſſion of joy <note place="margin">Our ioy with Halleluiah.</note> and comfort; for at this time Chriſt is ſuppoſed to be on the Earth as a Conquerour, having finiſhed his labours and paſſion. Thus we continue to the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, before which we have a Rogation-week, that ſo our prayers, and we our ſelves in heart and affection, may together aſcend with Chriſt: and though we are left here behind, yet ſtill we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelves, that, according to his promiſe, we doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly expect the comming down of his Spirit, which we Celebrate at <hi>Pentacoſt.</hi> Now in regard the three Perſons have thus revealed themſelves, we therefore keep the next Lords day, in memory of that high Myſtery, <hi>the Trinitie in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie,
<pb facs="tcp:172639:8"/>
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie in Trinitie;</hi> and from hence all the reſt of the Sundayes have their denomination; <hi>according to their diſtance.</hi> And becauſe theſe Myſteries are all implied in the bleſſed and holy Euchariſt, therefore we keep <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, for the Honour of the Inſtitution of that great Sacrament; and for the reſt of the dayes, they have proper Collects, Epiſtles, and Goſpels, fitted for the times. <hi>(E. G.)</hi> we have twice that <note place="margin">The Collects and Goſpels fitted for the time.</note> Goſpel of feeding ſo many thouſands with ſo few loaves. Firſt in Lent, to comfort us in our faſting, that God is able to ſeed us with a little, as well as with much: Then is it uſed in Harveſt, to put us in mind that we ſhould not aſcribe all to naturall Cauſes, but ſtill acknowledge that the ſame om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God who hath now multiplyed the Seed, and ſent a <note place="margin">All Saints and all Soule<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> plentifull Harveſt, he is able, and did likewiſe multiply the Loaves, to the feeding of many thouſands without the labour of the Husbandman, or the help and uſe of the Sun in the Firmament. Thus every Moneth hath Holy-dayes, to put us in mind of the Communion of Saints, and that following their example, we ſhall have our part and portion with them: And therefore in the laſt place, we keep all Saints Day, in memory of that Holy Communion with them: And becauſe all dyed not Saints, therefore we keep the next Day in memory of all Soules, to put us in mind that we muſt follow them, and that God will accompliſh the number of his Elect, and that we ſhall be all gathered together, and all to appear at his laſt and generall judgement.</p>
            <p>Thus the whole Year runs in a circle of Devotion, though <note place="margin">The Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</note> we cannot with the Angels be alwayes prayſing God; yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our weakneſs, we doe by degrees and acceſſion our beſt endeavour to follow the example of theit Holineſs. From the year, we come to the quarters, and moneths, Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath ſo diſpoſed it, that the comming of his own Son ſhould be at the return of the Corporeall Sun in the Heavens; <note place="margin">The reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> when the dayes begin to lengthen, then Chriſt came into the World, <hi>as a day-ſtar to enlighten our darkneſs.</hi> So the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb facs="tcp:172639:8"/>
of Chriſt by a ſpeciall providence of God, falls out in the Spring time, which is in <hi>effect,</hi> the Reſurrection of the Naturall Year; for then every Plant begins to riſe out of the Earth with a new Body; And ſo in every Quarter, we have our <hi>Ember Weeks</hi> for our Mortification and Devotion, as in every <hi>Moneth</hi> we have Holy-dayes for our Imitation.</p>
            <p>From the quarters, and the moneths, we come to the dayes of the Week, and in them with our Hymnes and Prayers we commemorate the work of every dayes Creation, and how wonderfully Gods mercy and goodneſs appears in the variety of his Creatures, together with that excellent order obſerved in the Creation, how fitting and agreeable to the nature of every thing in particular.</p>
            <p>From the Week, we come to the Houres of the Day; at <note place="margin">The Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call houres.</note> mid-night we celebrate the Birth of Chriſt, his deſcent into Hell, together with his laſt and unexpected comming in Judgement; At three of the clock we commemorate the ſong of the Angels in the Birth of Chriſt; as on the contrary, at the ſame time, we remember the apprehending of Chriſt in the Garden by the <hi>Jews:</hi> At ſix we celebrate the comming of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and they received by Chriſt; then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the carrying of <hi>Chriſt</hi> before <hi>Pilate,</hi> there to be condemned: At nine we celebrate the comming down of <note place="margin">The memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Chriſt for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</note> the Holy Ghoſt and then we remember the crying out of the <hi>Jews, Crucifie, Crucifie:</hi> At twelve we remember the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtles into all Nations to Preach <hi>Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> which was then done at the very ſame houre of the Day: At three we remember <hi>Chriſt</hi> giving up the ghoſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, and at the ſame inſtant we conſider the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of the Day, and our own haſtning to Death to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Chriſt:</hi> At ſix <hi>Chriſt</hi> was taken down from the Croſs by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> men ſcarce men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture before, who durſt not openly profeſs <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to give us an aſſurance that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for ſinners, and is able in an inſtant to convert them: At nine we
<pb facs="tcp:172639:9"/>
commemorate the Buriall of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and then the nine a Clock Bell Rings, to put us in mind of all thoſe who have departed in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Certainly no Man can diſlike this courſe of Devotion, if he hath any ſpark of Religion in him.</p>
