         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MOST Men that have ſpent
their Time in Collecting Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,
and retrieving the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of Things tranſacted long ago,
have made it their chief Buſineſs to
tranſmit to future Ages the Fame of
their own Learning, to diſtinguiſh them
in the Crowd of Authors. For which
Reaſon they have not been ſo ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
about the Truth of the Things
delivered, as that they might be handed
down to us with all the Advantages of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94482:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Eloquence and Language; perſwading
themſelves, that altho in reporting Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of great Antiquity, ſome Part of
their Story ſhould be Fabulous, yet the
Reader would be charm'd with their
Eloquence, nor would the Truth of
what they related be call'd in Queſtion.
Others again, out of a private Pique
and Hatred to Tyrants, or in flattering
Princes, Private Perſons, or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
have ſtamp'd too great a Character
upon mean and little Actions.</p>
               <p>But as for my Part, I report Things
not taken upon Truſt from others, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
few Witneſſes, and little Authority
to ſupport them, but ſuch as are freſh in
the Memories of all Men, which I have
collected with great Care and Fidelity
in the enſuing <hi>Memoirs,</hi> hoping that the
Knowledge of thoſe great and many
Occurrences which have hapned within
the Compaſs of a few Years, will not be
unwelcom to Poſterity. For if we look
back as far as the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
from whence we date the <hi>Roman</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and from thence down to the Times
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94482:3"/>
of <hi>Marcus,</hi> which is about Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years, we ſhall not find ſo many
Changes in the Succeſſion to the Empire,
ſuch various Events of Foreign and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars, ſuch Commotions of Nations,
Reductions of Towns, both <hi>Roman</hi> and
Barbarous, ſuch Earthquakes, Plagues,
Lives of Princes ſo monſtrouſly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant,
that former Ages are ſcarce able
to furniſh a Parallel. Some of theſe
enjoy'd the Empire a long Time, but
the Power of others was but ſhort-liv'd:
Nay, there are Inſtances of thoſe that
were only juſt declar'd Emperors, and
loſt the Power the ſame Day: For in
Sixty Years there having been more Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
of <hi>Rome</hi> than can be allow'd in
common Computation for ſo ſhort a
Period of Time, many Things hapned
which may deſerve our Admiration.
The more aged Emperors, being Men
of Experience in Affairs, govern'd both
themſelves and their Subjects with great
Caution and Diligence; but others
coming young to the Crown, abandon'd
themſelves to Eaſe and Pleaſure; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94482:4"/>
in theſe a Spirit of Innovation was very
prevalent; and from this Diſparity in
their Age and Meaſures of Government,
aroſe great Variety in their Actions and
Manners. Theſe Things I ſhall relate
in Order, having regard to the Time
and Reign wherein they were done.</p>

EPITOME
OF THE
Firſt Book.</head>
               <p>THE Emperor <hi>Marcus</hi> being taken
with a Fit of Sickneſs, and fearing
leſt his Son <hi>Commodus</hi> ſhould degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the Vertue of his Anceſtors,
as Princes uſually do, he commits him to
the Care and Guardianſhip of his Friends
and Relations, and dies. <hi>Commodus</hi>
ſucceeds him, and in the Beginning of his
Reign all things are duly and regularly
adminiſtred; but afterwards being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by Flatterers, he leaves the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonian</hi>
War unfiniſh'd, and reſolves for
<hi>Rome,</hi> notwithſtanding the Diſſwaſions
of <hi>Pompeianus.</hi> At <hi>Rome</hi> he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
with Publick Rejoycings, and having
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94482:5"/>
viſited the Temples, and return'd Thanks
to the Senate, he goes back to his Palace.
Then he appoints <hi>Perennius,</hi> a Man ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
Covetous, to the Management of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs, and abandons himſelf wholly
to his Pleaſures. His Perſon was come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
his Diverſions various, as Hunting,
Fencing, Chariot driving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But at laſt
he arriv'd at that Pitch of Madneſs, that
he commanded the People to call him <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>
the Son of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> And having
call'd the Months after his own Name, he
order'd his Statues to be erected in all the
Parts of the City. Then he chang'd his
Name a ſecond time, and took up the
Name and Family of a certain Gladiator
deceas'd. The Calamities of thoſe Times
were look'd upon as Judgments from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
puniſhing the Wickedneſs of the
Prince in the Miſeries of the People:
Such as was a great Plague, in which he
himſelf retir'd to <hi>Laurentum;</hi> and a
Famine, occaſion'd by <hi>Cleander</hi>'s buying
up the Corn. His Siſter <hi>Lucilla</hi> firſt
form'd a Deſign againſt his Life, after

Advice he was firſt poyſon'd, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

               <p>THE Emperor <hi>Marcus</hi> had a great
many Daughters, but only two
Sons; the one, call'd <hi>Veriſſimus,</hi> died
very young; he that ſurviv'd was named
<hi>Commodus:</hi> Him his Father educated
with all the Care imaginable, drawing
together from the moſt remote Parts,
by the Offers of conſiderable Penſions,
Men famous for their Learning, that
being always with his Son, they might
inſtruct him in whatever was proper for
him to know. His Daughters, after
they were of convenient Age, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the moſt Conſiderable Men in
the Senate, not ſo much regarding in the
Choice of a Son-in-Law, Ancientneſs of
Family, or Largeneſs of Fortune, as
Probity of Manners, and Innocency of

Life; looking upon the Endowments of
the Mind as the only true and laſting
Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>He liv'd in the conſtant Practice of
all Sorts of Vertues; he was a great
Lover and ſucceſsful Studier of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
inſomuch that he ſurpaſs'd moſt
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> of his Time;
the Truth whereof is atteſted by thoſe
Learned Remains which he left behind
him, which are yet in being amongſt
us. As to his Behaviour, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
civil and courteous to all Men;
he ſhook Hands familiarly with all that
came to him, and commanded his
Guards not to deny any Man Acceſs to
him that deſir'd it. He is the only Prince
that was a Philoſopher, not in Notion
and Speculation, but in his Converſation

the Praiſe of Courage or Conduct, and
how he behav'd himſelf againſt the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
and Eaſtern Nations, is abundantly
recorded in the learned Labours of others:
But as for all thoſe Things which ſince the
Death of <hi>Marcus,</hi> in the whole Courſe of
my Life I have heard or ſeen, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I have had more particular Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

at the Time, Theſe I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to deliver down to Poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus</hi> being now weakned with
Age, and ſpent with the Cares and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
of Government, whilſt he was in
<hi>Pannonia</hi> was ſeiz'd with a violent Fit of
Sickneſs, and perceiving himſelf to be
paſt Hopes of Recovery, was very ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
upon the Account of his Son,
who was now entring upon the State of
Manhood, fearing leſt in the Heat and
Fervour of Youth, being freed from the
Influence a Father's Authority might
have over him, and ſet at large from
every Thing that might reſtrain him, he
ſhould diſdain all honeſt and ſober Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94482:7"/>
and Riot: For the Minds of
Youths are apt to fall from Sobriety
and Vertue into the contrary Extremes.</p>
               <p>Beſides, being a Man of great Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Experience, he was the more
apprehenſive, in regard of the many
Miſcarriages of Princes that came young
to the Crown; ſuch as was <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> a
Man ſo wholly devoted to ſenſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
that he encourag'd with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Invention of all Things that
tended to the Improvement thereof.
Such were the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
whoſe Abuſe of their Power, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of their Subjects, reflected a
laſting Infamy upon his Empire; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> was ſo ſcandalouſly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
that contrary to the known Laws
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Inceſt with his Siſter: And <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi>
that he might repreſent <hi>Bacchus</hi>
in all his Extravagances, debas'd his
Scepter into a <hi>Thyrſe,</hi> and his <hi>Macedonian</hi>
Diadem into a Chaplet of Ivy.</p>
               <p>His Fears were alſo encreas'd by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of a later Date; as by that of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94482:7"/>
                  <hi>Nero,</hi> who with unheard-of Impiety
murther'd his Mother, expos'd himſelf
publickly, and turn'd Buffoon to make
Sport for the People: As likewiſe by
<hi>Domitian</hi>'s, who equall'd the greateſt
Tyrants in Inhumanity and Cruelty.
Having theſe Images of Tyranny in his
Mind, he was diſtracted between Hope
and Fear: But the <hi>Germans,</hi> a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nation, which he had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
conquer'd, encreas'd not a little
his Anxiety. Some of theſe had been
perſwaded to enter into a League with
him; others he had ſubdu'd by force
of Arms: But ſome there were whom
the Terror of his Arms had diſpers'd
only for the preſent; theſe he thought,
taking advantage of the Minority of the
Prince, might renew the War: For 'tis
the Cuſtom of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to take up
Arms upon every little Opportunity or
advantageous Conjuncture. Lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Diſtraction, he order'd ſuch of
his Friends and Relations as were near
his Perſon to be ſent for, and after they
were come together in his Preſence, he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94482:8"/>
plac'd his Son before them, and raiſing
himſelf from his Bed, ſpoke to this
effect.</p>
               <p>I don't wonder, Gentlemen, that you ſeem
concern'd to ſee me in this Condition; for
Humane Nature is apt to be touch'd with
other Mens Calamities, thoſe ſtill affecting us
the moſt ſenſibly to which we are Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
But beſides common Humanity, there
are other Reaſons for your Compaſſion at
this Time; that Love and Affection for
you which I feel ſo plainly within my ſelf,
makes me hope, nay challenge a Return of
Kindneſs from you. And now, Gentlemen,
is the Time for me to ſee whether or no I
have beſtow'd that Time in vain which I
have ſpent in honouring and ſerving you,
and for you to make your Acknowledgments,
and ſhew that you are not unmindful of the
good Offices I have done you. You ſee my
Son, whom your ſelves have educated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
upon the Eſtate of Manhood, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in need of a Pilot to direct him (if I
may ſo call it) in the Ocean of Life, leſt
through Unexperience of Affairs, he be betray'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94482:8"/>
into ſinful and diſhoneſt Courſes. I entreat
you therefore, inſtead of one, be to him many
Fathers, in inſtructing and adviſing whatever
is requiſite for him to know or to do: For it
is not in the Power of Riches to ſatisfie the
boundleſs Appetites of Tyrants; nor can
Troops of Guards, how numerous ſoever,
ſtave off Dangers from a Prince, that has
not gain'd the Love and Affections of his
People. Thoſe only enjoy long and happy
Reigns, that are rather belov'd for their
Gentleneſs, than fear'd for their Cruelty:
And thoſe Mens Services only that obey out
of Choice, not Neceſſity, are free from the
Suſpicion of Artifice and Deſign. Theſe
Men are Loyal at the bottom, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from their Duty unleſs they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
to it by ſome violent and contumelious
Uſage. But 'tis hard for Men to ſet Bounds
to their Paſſions, where there are none to their
Power. Sound therefore in his Ears the
Precepts of Vertue and Goodneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
him often of the Things he has heard
this Day, and hereby you will make your
ſelves happy in a Prince, and at the ſame
Time will do the greateſt Honour to my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94482:9"/>
Memory, which by this Means you will make
Immortal.</p>
               <p>After he had ſpoke theſe Words, his
Strength fail'd him, and being unable
to ſupport himſelf in that Poſture, he
ſunk gently into Bed. This affected the
Company ſo extremely, that ſome of
them broke out into undecent Out-cries.
He liv'd afterwards a Day and a Night,
and then died, to the unſpeakable Grief
and Affliction of all Men, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him the Memory of his Vertues,
which all Ages will have in veneration.
After he was dead, and the Report
thereof was ſpread abroad, the whole
Soldiery and Commons were ſeiz'd with
a general Sorrow, and a certain Air of
Melancholy appear'd in all the Parts of
the Empire, none receiving the fatal
News without Tears. All Men bewail'd
the Publick Calamity, and, as they were
variouſly influenc'd, lamented the Loſs
of their Prince, under the different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of a Kind Father, a Valiant
General, a Gentle and Prudent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94482:9"/>
and ſo many were the excellent
Qualities of this Emperor, that they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
all theſe Complaints.</p>
               <p>After the Ceremonies of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Interment were over, the young
Prince's Friends thought fit to bring him
into the Camp, that he might Harangue
the Soldiers, and, as it is uſual for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
upon their Acceſſion to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
engage their Hearts to him by the
Magnificence of a Donative. So pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Notice was given that they ſhould
aſſemble in the uſual Place, at which
Time <hi>Commodus</hi> came, and having ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd
to the Gods, aſcended a Bench of
State, erected for that purpoſe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Camp; and, his Father's Friends
ſtanding around him, many of which
were Perſons of great Learning, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
himſelf to the following Effect.</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText xml:lang="unk">

                              <hi>I</hi> Am perſwaded, Gentlemen, you are as
much affected as I can be with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Accident. My Father lov'd us all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94482:10"/>
equally, and while he was alive we all ſtood
upon a Level; and I remember he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
more pleas'd with calling me Fellow-Soldier
than Son, becauſe this denoted only a
Natural Relation, but that a Communication
of Vertue: And carrying me in his Arms
when I was a Child, would often put me into
your Hands, and commit me as it were to
your Faith and Protection. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
I aſſure my ſelf of your Good-will and
Affections, ſeeing by the Elder ſort of you I
have been educated, and to the Younger I have
been all along a Fellow-Scholar in Feats of
Arms. For my Father having an equal
Kindneſs for us all, took the ſame Care of
our Inſtitution in every Thing that was honeſt
or praiſe worthy. Upon his Deceaſe Chance
has caſt the Sovereignty upon me, being no
Stranger to the Imperial Line, nor Lording it
in a new-gotten Throne, as thoſe have done
that went before me. I am your only Prince
that have been born and bred up in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Court, untainted, as I may ſay, with
Private Education: The Royal Purple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me at my coming into the World, and I
commenc'd at the ſame time Man and Prince.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94482:10"/>
Reflect upon theſe Things, and love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
your Emperor, who is not the Creature
of a Faction, but claims the Empire of the
World by Blood and Birth-right. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is taken up into Heaven, and has taken
his Place among the Gods. The Care and
Adminiſtration of Humane Affairs is left in
my Hands, and the ſucceſsful Diſcharge of
ſo important a Truſt will depend entirely upon
you. Now if we proſecute with vigour the
Remainder of the War, and enlarge the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire by our Conqueſts, till it ſtretch
it ſelf to the Ocean, not only each Man will
have the Glory of his reſpective Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but we ſhall all in ſome meaſure ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Memory of our Common Father,
who hears and ſees in his exalted State all
we ſay or do here below; and happy we, that
have ſuch a Witneſs to our Actions! And
know, Gentlemen, you have ſtronger Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be valiant now than ever; for in my
Father's Life time the Glory of all Great
Actions was attributed to his Wiſdom and
Counſels: But under me, a young unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
Prince, your Courage and Bravery
will be the moſt conſpicuous, there being no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94482:11"/>
Abatement to be made upon the ſcore of a
General. Beſides, your Valour at this time
will have another good Effect, 'twill gain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

to the Barbarians, who, if vigorouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd
in the Beginning of my Reign, will
not only be quieted for the preſent, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
alſo from the like Attempts for the

               <p>Having thus ſpoke, he gave great
Sums of Money to endear the Soldiery
to him, and return'd to his Palace.</p>
               <p>'Twas but a ſhort time that the late
Emperor's Friends had the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of Publick Affairs; during which
Time, they were always with the young
Prince, giving him good Advices and
Inſtructions, and allowing him no more
Time for Recreations than was thought
requiſite for his Health: But after a
while, ſome of the Courtiers inſinuating
themſelves into his Acquaintance, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to debauch him. Theſe were
your Table-Flatterers, that make Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94482:11"/>
They would often take occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to him the Way of Living in
<hi>Rome,</hi> telling him of the Plays, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick-meetings,
and other Diverſions of
the Town, and generally of the Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all Things conducing to the
Pleaſure or Convenience of Life. On
the other Hand, they cry'd down at the
greateſt Rate imaginable the Country
about the <hi>Iſter,</hi> as well for the Barenneſs
of the Soil, as the perpetual Rigour
and Cloudineſs of the Weather: and
would often be ſaying to him, How

frozen muddy Water, whilſt others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the warm Baths and cool Streams,
with the Air, and refreſhing Breezes ſo
peculiar to <hi>Italy?</hi> With theſe and the
like Suggeſtions they rais'd unruly Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
in the Youth: So he call'd his
Friends together, and gave them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
he had a great Inclination to
viſit his Native Country; but was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd
to diſcover the Reaſons indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

Apprehenſions of Danger from ſome of

the Nobility, that might ſeize the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial

Body of Men, might as it were from a

adding withall, That there might be a
ſufficient Force rais'd out of the People
for the effecting ſuch an Enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>All Men were in perfect Amazement
to hear him talk in this manner, but
durſt not ſpeak their Thoughts to him
upon ſo tender a Point; till <hi>Pompeianus,</hi>

tho' indeed every Place is <hi>Rome</hi>

leave the War unproſecuted, will not only be a
Diſhonour to our Empire, but may be alſo
of dangerous Conſequence: For it will ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the Barbarians to new Attempts; who
will think us rather influenc'd by our Fears,

This Speech of <hi>Pompeianus</hi> diverted
the young Prince, and ſhook his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
for the preſent. The Words
of the Old Man weighed much with
him, and at this Time he had nothing
to alledge to juſtifie his Intention.
Therefore he diſmiſs'd his Friends, and
told them he would conſider of it: But
at laſt being overcome by the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of his Courtiers, he would no
longer conſult his Friends, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſent Letters to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſignifie his
Reſolution to return; and having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
ſuch Perſons as he thought fit,
to guard the Banks of the <hi>Iſter,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
the Incurſions of the Barbarians,
gave Publick Orders to prepare for a
March.</p>
               <p>After his Departure, the Perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with the Affairs upon the <hi>Iſter</hi>
were very vigilant in their reſpective
Poſts, and in a ſhort Time conquer'd
vaſt Numbers of the Barbarians by
Force of Arms; others by Offers of
Money were eaſily brib'd into an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94482:13"/>
of Peace; for the Barbarians
naturally love Money, and deſpiſe Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and live by Inroads and Ravages
upon the neighbouring Territory, or
traffick Peace for Money. Which <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi>
knowing, and being both able and
willing to purchaſe Security and Repoſe
to himſelf at any Rate, comply'd with
them in all their Demands.</p>
               <p>After the Proclamation was made,
that they ſhould march homewards, a
ſort of a confus'd Joy ran through the
whole Camp; every one being willing to
change the Toils and Fatigues of War in
an Enemy's Country, for the Pleaſures
and Gaieties of Peace at <hi>Rome.</hi> But
after it was publickly known that the
young Prince was returning, the <hi>Romans</hi>
were viſibly tranſported with Joy, all
Men expecting great Things from the
Preſence of a Prince, who they thought
would emulate his Father's Vertues. His
Journey he perform'd with great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
being entertain'd with great
Splendor and Magnificence in the Towns
he paſs'd through; and generally his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94482:14"/>
Preſence gave great Content and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to all Men.</p>
               <p>But when he came near <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole
Senate and <hi>Roman</hi> People went out in
full Body to meet him: They march'd
with great Formality, carrying Branches
of Laurel, and all ſorts of Flowers that
were proper for the Seaſon. Every Man
ſtrove to be foremoſt in this Ceremony,
both to expreſs his Affection, and ſatisfie
his Curioſity, in beholding the Greateſt
of Princes in the moſt flouriſhing Scene
of his Age. And the Truth is, the
<hi>Romans</hi> had a real Affection for him, in
regard he was not only a Native of their
Country, but had his whole Education
amongſt them, and was of Noble and
Imperial Blood for Three Deſcents; for
by his Father's Side he was deſcended
from Perſons of the moſt Eminent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the Senate: His Mother <hi>Fauſtina,</hi>
the Empreſs, ſprung out of the Loins
of Emperors, being Daughter to <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi>
Surnamed <hi>Pius,</hi> and Grand-daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Hadrian</hi> by the Mothers Side, and
Great Grand-daughter to <hi>Trajan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94482:14"/>
This is the Account of <hi>Commodus</hi>'s
Parentage. But beſide the Advantages
of Youth, his Perſon was very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
he had a Manly Beauty in his
Face, with a fine Shape and Figure of
Body: His Eyes were languiſhing, and
yet had a peculiar ſort of Luſtre: His
Hair was curl'd, and yellow, reſembling
Flame, when he walk'd in the Sun;
which made ſome Men fanſie he was
powder'd with Duſt of Gold. Others
thought it a Teſtimony of his Divinity,
looking upon theſe as the Glories that
adorn'd him at his Nativity. He had no
Beard, but only Down upon his Cheeks.
This was the Figure the Prince made
when the People receiv'd him with
<hi>Huzza's</hi> and Shouts of Joy, ſcattering
Flowers and Garlands all the Way as he
paſs'd.</p>
               <p>After he had enter'd <hi>Rome,</hi> and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Temples, he render'd Thanks to
the Senate in full Aſſembly, and to the
Soldiers that were left in <hi>Rome,</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
ſteadfaſt in their Duty and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
during his Abſence, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94482:15"/>
to his Palace. Thus for a few
Years he paid all the Deference imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to his Father's Friends, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
nothing without their Counſel and
Direction.</p>
               <p>But after a while he took the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon himſelf, and conſtituted <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennius</hi>
an <hi>Italian,</hi> a Man of great Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Skill, Captain of the <hi>Praetorian</hi>
Eſtabliſhment. This <hi>Perennius</hi> let the
Prince live at large, allow'd, nay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
him in the greateſt Riots and
Exceſſes. By this Means he drew all
the Affairs of the Empire that require
Diligence and Application to himſelf,
till at laſt he got the whole. Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into his Hands. He was a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiably
covetous, his Deſires could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
terminate in what he poſſeſs'd, but
ſtill graſp'd at ſomething he had not.
He conſtantly endeavour'd by Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Miſrepreſentations to create a
Jealouſie in the Prince of his Father's
Friends, eſpecially the moſt Rich and
Noble amongſt them, that the Prince
might be mov'd to cut them off, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94482:15"/>
he might enrich himſelf by their Fall.</p>
               <p>But however the Prince was reſtrain'd
for a Time by the Memory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Regard he had to his
Friends; but an unlucky Accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which deſtroy'd all the Remains
of Vertue and Moderation which he
yet retain'd, and utterly perverted the
Biaſs of his Mind. The Accident was
this. <hi>Lucilla, Commodus</hi> his eldeſt Siſter,
was formerly married to <hi>L. Verus</hi> the
Emperor, whom <hi>Marcus</hi> had made his
Collegue with him in the Empire, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Alliance would be the ſtrongeſt
Bond of a laſting Amity between them.
But it fell out, that <hi>Verus</hi> dy'd, and her
Father married her to <hi>Pompeianus,</hi> and
yet ſhe retain'd the Port and Grandeur
of an Empreſs. So it was, after <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi>
came to the Crown, he ſuffer'd
her to take the ſame State upon her, and
ſhe was in all Reſpects honour'd as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.
But now <hi>Commodus</hi> took a Wife
nam'd <hi>Criſpina,</hi> and <hi>Lucilla</hi> was oblig'd
to give Place to her, which gave her
great Regrets: For ſhe look'd upon all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94482:16"/>
Honours done to the Empreſs, as indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Affronts to her ſelf. This put her
upon Deſigns againſt the Government;
but ſhe knew her Husband's Love of
<hi>Commodus</hi> too well to communicate any
thing of that Nature to him: So ſhe
apply'd her ſelf to <hi>Quadratus,</hi> a young
rich Noble-man of <hi>Rome,</hi> (that lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Suſpicion of intriguing with this
Lady) and after ſhe had ſounded how
he ſtood affected, made her Complaint
to him, repreſenting how ſhe had been
injur'd and diſgrac'd; till at laſt ſhe
perſwaded him to enter into Counſels
fatal both to themſelves and the whole
Senate. For among other Senators that
he drew into this Combination, there
was one <hi>Quintian,</hi> a Man of a dauntleſs
Spirit, and one that would undertake
any Thing; him he perſwaded to take
a Ponyard under his Clothes, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Time and Place proper for the
Execution of his Deſign, to aſſaſſinate the
Emperor; adding, That if that was once
done, what remain'd would eaſily be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
by diſtributing Money among the
People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94482:16"/>
In order to the doing this, <hi>Quintian</hi>
poſted himſelf in the Entrance of the
Amphitheatre; the Darkneſs of the
Place he thought would help to conceal
him, and favour the Deſign. So when
the Emperor came by, he boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
him with his drawn Sword, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aloud, <hi>The Senate has ſent you this.</hi>
As he was repeating theſe Words, the
Emperor's Guards laid hold of him, and
made him pay dear for his Madneſs,
after he had rather diſcover'd, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd
his Deſign. This was the
firſt Cauſe of the Emperor's Hatred of
the Senate. That Saying made deep
Impreſſion in him, and from that Time
he look'd upon all the Senators as diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
ſtill keeping in Mind the Words
of this bold Aſſaſſine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perennius</hi> made good uſe of this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to inflame the Emperor againſt
them. He had always advis'd him to
cut off the Leading Men among them;
and whoever was cruſh'd by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
he ſtill grew fat upon his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
and by this Means eaſily became
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94482:17"/>
the richeſt Man of thoſe Times. And
now he made Inquiry into this Plot with
great Rigour and Severity; and <hi>Lucilla,</hi>
with the reſt of the Conſpirators, and
all ſuch as were ſuſpected to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
(how ſlight ſoever the Ground
of the Suſpicion was) were put to
Death without Mercy.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Perennius</hi> having taken out
of the way all thoſe that lov'd or were
reverenc'd by the Emperor, undertook
himſelf the Care of his Perſon; and
having got an unlimited Authority into
his Hands, began to aſpire to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
And in order to the compaſſing
his ambitious Ends, by his Intereſt with
the Emperor, he advanc'd his Sons to
the Command of the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Army;
and in his Miniſtry at home, amaſs'd
a Treaſure ſufficient at any time to ſhake
the Loyalty of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers,
and bring them over to his Party. His
Sons in the mean time made ſecret Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,
that as ſoon as <hi>Perennius</hi> had aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
the Emperor, they might follow
their Father's Blow, and ſeize the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:94482:17"/>
This Plot took Air very ſtrangely:
It was the Time when the Sacred Games
inſtituted to the Honour of <hi>Jupiter Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinus</hi>
were to be celebrated. This drew
together vaſt Multitudes of People, as
is uſual in <hi>Rome</hi> at the like Solemnities.
The Emperor preſides at theſe Games,
with the Prieſts in their Turns. <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
had ſeated himſelf in the Emperor's
Box, to hear the moſt celebrated Actors
of that Age: But when the Theatre
was full, and every Man had taken his
Place according to his Rank, before the
Action began, there ſtept out a Man in
a Philoſophers Habit, half naked, with
a Staff in his Hand, and a Satchel hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his Shoulder, into the middle
of the Stage, and commanding Silence,
addreſs'd himſelf to the Emperor, and
told him, <hi>That this was not a Time to
quit the Cares of Empire, for the Diverſions
of Games and Publick Feſtivities; That</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennius
<hi>his Sword was drawn againſt him,
and if he did not ward off the Blow which
would ſuddenly be made at him, it would
certainly be fatal, and he would feel it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94482:18"/>
he was aware; That</hi> Perennius <hi>was
raiſing Forces and Money to be employ'd
againſt him, and that his Sons by ſecret Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
had ſollicited the</hi> Illyrian <hi>Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in concluſion, if he did not take
care in time to break their Meaſures, he was
irrecoverably ruin'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the Man was urg'd by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Impulſe to utter theſe Words, or
was mov'd meerly by the Proſpect of
Glory or Reward, I can't determine;
but the Adventure ſo ſhock'd the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
that he was not able to ſpeak for
the preſent. As for other Men, tho'
they believ'd the Man might have
Ground for what he ſaid, yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to give no Credit to him; and
<hi>Perennius</hi> in great Rage commanded
him immediately to be apprehended
and burnt for a Mad-man, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter
of Vain Stories. So the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
ſuffer'd for his unſeaſonable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>However, thoſe that pretended to be
zealous for <hi>Commodus</hi>'s Intereſt, made
uſe of this Occaſion to let themſelves
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94482:18"/>
into Invectives againſt <hi>Perennius,</hi> whom
they hated before for his intolerable
Pride and Inſolence of Behaviour. And
it pleas'd the Gods that <hi>Commodus</hi> ſhould
eſcape, and that the Blow levell'd againſt
him ſhould return upon the Heads of
<hi>Perennius</hi> and his Sons: For a ſhort time
after ſome Soldiers came privately from
the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Camp to <hi>Rome,</hi> bringing
along with them Pieces of Money
ſtamp'd with the Image of <hi>Perennius;</hi>
and having without his Knowledge ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
Acceſs to the Emperor,, (tho' he
was then Captain of his Life-guard)
they ſhew'd the Pieces to him, and made
a large Diſcovery of the whole Plot, with
all the Circumſtances of it, and were
well rewarded for ſo ſignal a Piece of
Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perennius</hi> was ignorant of the whole
Courſe of this Buſineſs, and an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
was ſent by Night to take off his
Head, when he expected nothing leſs;
which was done: And a Courier is
diſpatch'd into <hi>Illyria,</hi> and order'd to
make all poſſible haſte, that he might
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94482:19"/>
prevent the Fame of what had hapned
at <hi>Rome.</hi> By him the Emperor ſent
Letters to <hi>Perennius</hi>'s Son, wherein he
made great Expreſſions of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and Satisfaction in his Conduct,
and told him, he would reward his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
abroad with better Preferment at
home. The Young Man could not
look thorough the Diſguiſe, but thought
the Emperor's Invitation to return was
ſincere: For he heard nothing of the
Diſaſter of his Family in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor of
any Thing that had hapned there; and
he was confirm'd in his Belief when the
Courier told him, that it was alſo his
Father's Pleaſure that he ſhould return,
and that he would have writ to him
upon that Subject, had he not known
his entire Reſignation to the Emperor's
Will. He was extremely regretted to
leave his Deſigns unaccompliſh'd, after
he had made ſo great Progreſs in them;
nevertheleſs, in confidence of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Intereſt at Court, which he thought
continu'd ſtill, he ſet out for <hi>Rome.</hi> But
when he came into <hi>Italy,</hi> he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94482:19"/>
by the Emperor's Order. This
was the End of theſe Great Men.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Commodus</hi> conſtituted two
Captains of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Band. To
intruſt ſo great Power with a ſingle
Man, he thought was dangerous; and
the dividing of it he knew would wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it, and make it leſs fit to encourage
Attempts againſt the Government, than
when it was united. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Caution, another Conſpiracy
was ſet on foot in a ſhort time: The
Account that is given of it, is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maternus,</hi> a Soldier that had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
divers Outrages, about this time
thought fit to leave the Camp, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
ſome other Soldiers to deſert
with him: Out of theſe, and others that
came in to him, he ſoon form'd a Party
of Men of the like deſperate Fortunes
and Tempers with himſelf. With theſe
he firſt plunder'd Villages, and ravag'd
the Country around: But after he had
furniſh'd himſelf with Money for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Enterpriſes, and had drawn together
a formidable Body of Men, by Promiſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94482:20"/>
of Reward and a Share of the Booty,
they grew from a contemptible Band of
Robbers, into a Juſt and Regular Army.
And now they attack'd and ſtorm'd the
greateſt Towns, broke open the Priſons,
and ſet at large all the Priſoners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinction; moſt of which, out of
hope of Impunity or Reward, joyn'd
themſelves to them. And now with
their whole Force they made an Inroad
into <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> over-ran the whole
Country, took the moſt conſiderable
Towns, burnt and pillag'd them, and
march'd off with the Booty.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Commodus</hi> heard of the ſwift
Advances of theſe Rebels, he wrote to
the Prefects of his Provinces in Terms
of Anger and Indignation, accuſing
their Conduct for not oppoſing the
Growth of this Rebellion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them inſtantly to levy a Force
to ſuppreſs it. The Rebels had Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of this, and that an Army was
raiſing againſt them, and therefore judg'd
it moſt adviſable to leave the Country
where they had committed their Rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94482:20"/>
and paſs over into <hi>Italy;</hi> which they
did by ſhort By-Roads, and in ſmall
Parties.</p>
               <p>And here <hi>Maternus</hi>'s Ambition began
to fly high, and to have the Empire in
view. For he had found that all his Deſigns
had hitherto ſucceeded beyond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and he knew that in this Juncture
he had a deſperate Game to play; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he reſolv'd to riſque at all, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeize the Empire, or die with Glory
in the Attempt.</p>
               <p>But he knew the Emperor's Strength,
and his own Weakneſs, too well to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
with him upon equal Terms: For
the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers, and generally the
whole <hi>Roman</hi> Commons, were thought
well-affected to <hi>Commodus;</hi> which oblig'd
him to have recourſe to Policy and
Cunning: ſo he form'd this Stratagem.
In the beginning of Spring, upon a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Day, the <hi>Romans</hi> make a pompous
Proceſſion in honour of <hi>Cybele,</hi> at which
time the richeſt Furniture either Prince
or Subject is Maſter of, is carry'd before
the Goddeſs with great Solemnity. This
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94482:21"/>
is a licentious Time for all ſorts of Frol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
and Gambols, which at this Time
have the Publick Countenance; all Men
are permitted to uſe what Diſguiſe they
pleaſe, nor is any Magiſtrate's Habit ſo
ſacred, but every Perſon that has a
mind may take it upon him; ſo that
during the Feſtival 'tis hard to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
a true Magiſtrate from a Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rader.
This <hi>Maternus</hi> thought the fitteſt
Occaſion for executing his treaſonable
Purpoſes; for he fanſied if he could
put himſelf and his Men in the Habit
and Equipage of the Emperor's Guards,
he might eaſily in that Huddle of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
crowd in amongſt them, and
ſeeming Part of the Emperor's Retinue,
might without Danger of Diſcovery aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
him, and ſo accompliſh his Deſign.
But before the Day came for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of this Stratagem, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
by ſome of his Accomplices, that
could not brook his Advancement from a
Fellow-Robber, to be their Lord and
Sovereign. Whereupon <hi>Maternus,</hi> and
all thoſe that were engag'd in the ſame
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94482:21"/>
traiterous Deſigns, were forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and put to Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commodus,</hi> after publick Thankſgiving
and Sacrifice to the Gods, was preſent
at the Celebration of the Feſtival, which
was perform'd by the People with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Demonſtrations of Joy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Account of the Emperor's Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
The Reaſon why the <hi>Romans</hi>
had this Goddeſs in ſuch veneration,
it won't, I think, be impertinent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
out of their own Hiſtories, ſeeing it
is ſo little known amongſt the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay her Image fell originally
from Heaven; but out of what, or by
whom it was made, remains uncertain;
tho' the Opinion has generally prevail'd,
that it could not be made by Men. The
Tradition runs, That it fell, and was
firſt found in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> in a Place call'd
from thence <hi>Peſſinuns;</hi> but I find this
Matter differently related from other
Hands. According to theſe, there was
heretofore an Engagement here between
<hi>Ilus</hi> the <hi>Phrygian</hi> and <hi>Tantalus</hi> the <hi>Lydian.</hi>
The Occaſion is reported variouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94482:22"/>
Some ſay, it was for taking away <hi>Gany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>
by Force: Others, that it was only
upon a Diſpute about a Way. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was the Occaſion, both Sides main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the Fight with great Obſtinacy,
without any apparent Advantage to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Slaughter was great on both
Sides, and from hence, ſay they, the
Place took its Name. And here it was
that <hi>Ganymede</hi> was torn in Pieces by his
Brother, in that fatal Endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue
him from his Lover, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
diſappear'd; which gave Occaſion
to the Report of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s carrying him
into Heaven, and of his Conſecration
conſequent thereupon. Here alſo the
<hi>Phrygians</hi> celebrated their <hi>Orgia</hi> upon the
Banks of the River <hi>Gallus;</hi> from whence
the gelt Prieſts of this Goddeſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
their Name. But when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Power advanc'd towards its Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
and they had receiv'd Information
from the Oracle, that the Poſſeſſion of
the <hi>Peſſinuntian</hi> Goddeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would conduce
to the effectual Eſtabliſhment and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
thereof, they were reſolv'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94482:22"/>
her Image of the <hi>Phrygians,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
diſpatch'd Ambaſſadors with
Inſtructions to that purpoſe, enforcing
their Demand by Pretenſions of Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and a Deſcent from a Common
Anceſtor, <hi>viz. Aeneas</hi> of <hi>Phrygia.</hi> In
ſhort, the <hi>Romans</hi> eaſily obtain'd what
they came for, and the Goddeſs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
for <hi>Rome:</hi> But when ſhe arriv'd
at the Mouth of the <hi>Tyber,</hi> which ſerv'd
the <hi>Romans</hi> then in ſtead of a Harbour,
the Veſſel by Divine Appointment
ſtood ſtill, and the whole united
Force of the <hi>Romans</hi> could not haul it from
the Place, till a Veſtal Prieſteſs perform'd
what the reſt had attempted in vain.
She had vow'd perpetual Chaſtity, and
now was charg'd with a Violation of
that Vow; and fearing the Execution
of the Law upon her, ſhe offer'd to
ſtand to the Award of the Goddeſs,
whether or no ſhe was guilty of the
Fact whereof ſhe ſtood accus'd; which
being accepted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhe took
off her Girdle, and pray'd the Goddeſs,
if ſhe knew her to be a ſpotleſs Virgin,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94482:23"/>
and that the Calumny ſhe lay under
was undeſerv'd, ſhe would command
the Veſſel to move; and immediately
faſtning her Girdle to it, ſhe drew it
after her with great eaſe, to the wonder
and amazement of the Spectators, who
look'd upon it as an unqueſtionable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of the Divinity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs,
and the Innocence of the Maid.
Thus much I thought fit to inſert about
the <hi>Peſſinuntian</hi> Goddeſs, with more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs
and Accuracy perhaps than the
Thing deſerv'd: However I hope the
Relation will not be unpleaſant to thoſe
that are unacquainted with the <hi>Roman</hi>
Story.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Commodus:</hi> After he
had eſcap'd theſe traiterous Deſigns of
<hi>Maternus,</hi> he augmented his Guards,
grew ſhie, and ſeldom appear'd in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
liv'd for the moſt part in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Houſes
which were moſt remote
from the City, gave over the Exerciſe
of all Imperial Juriſdiction, and laid
down in a Manner the very Figure and
Character of an Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:94482:23"/>
At this Time all <hi>Italy</hi> was viſited
with a great Plague; but it raged the
moſt in <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard it was a Town
very populous of it ſelf, and of a vaſt
reſort of Strangers from all Quarters;
whereupon enſu'd a great Mortality of
Men and Beaſts. The Emperor by the
Advice of his Phyſicians retir'd to <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum,</hi>
where the Air was more cool
and temperate, and the Groves of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
too frequent in thoſe Parts, as is
imported by the Name of the Place,
which it took from thence, preſerve the
Country from Infection by the Fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of their Smell, and the Delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Shade. And upon the ſame
Reaſon the People in the City, by the
Preſcription of their Doctors, fill'd their
Noſes and Ears with ſweet Ointments,
and always carried Perfumes about them;
for they fanſied theſe would cloſe up
the Pores by which the Infection was to
enter, ſo that either it ſhould not enter
at all, or, if it did, it might be expell'd
or vanquiſh'd by a contrary Force.
But notwithſtanding this, the Plague
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94482:24"/>
grew more outrageous, and Men and
Beaſts dy'd in great Numbers.</p>
               <p>At the ſame Time the <hi>Romans</hi> were
afflicted by an Evil of a different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> a Famine and Dearth of all
Things. The Occaſion was this. There
was a certain Man call'd <hi>Cleander,</hi> a <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian,</hi>
and one that had been publickly
ſold by the Common Cryer. His firſt
Advance was to be the Emperor's Slave;
afterwards he became his Favourite; till
at laſt he arriv'd to ſo great a Sway and
Intereſt at Court, that he got to himſelf
at once the honourable Charges of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of the Emperor's Bed-chamber,
Captain of his Life-Guard, and General
of his Armies. And now his Wealth
and Affluence of all Things put him
upon projecting how he might gain the
Empire. Hereupon he ingroſſed prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Quantities of Corn, and lock'd
them up in his Granary, that when the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army and People ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to Extremity for want of Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
ſo ſeaſonable and ſurprizing a
Relief might win and endear them to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94482:24"/>
him for ever. He built alſo a famous
Place of Exerciſe, and maintain'd a
Publick Bath at his own Charge, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by theſe Popular Arts to pleaſe and
cajole the Multitude.</p>
               <p>But they hated him upon an old
Score, for his inſatiable Covetouſneſs;
and now they look'd upon him as the
Author of their late Calamities, which
inflam'd them to that degree, that they
openly in the Theatre vented their Spleen
againſt him in Satyrical Touches and
Reflections upon his Behaviour, till at
laſt the whole Mobb went to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Palace with full Cry againſt him;
nor could any thing appeaſe their Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
beſides the delivering up this
Miniſter to them.</p>
               <p>While the People were in this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Court was fill'd with
Noiſe and Tumult, the Emperor lay
in the inmoſt Rooms, diſſolv'd in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and, as Matters were manag'd by
<hi>Cleander,</hi> utterly ignorant of the preſent
Poſture of Things: When upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
when no Man expected it, the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94482:25"/>
Horſe-Guards iſſued out upon them by
<hi>Cleander</hi>'s Order, and bore down and
trampled under Foot the defenceleſs Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
for being without Horſes and
unarm'd, they were unable to ſuſtain
the Impreſſion, but betook themſelves
immediately to their Heels, and fled
back to the City. Great Numbers were
ſlain upon the Spot; not only ſuch as
fell by the Hands of the Soldiers, or were
trod to death by the Horſes, but a great
many that were preſs'd to Death by the
Crowd in the Hurry of the Action.
They purſu'd them to the Gates of the
City without Reſiſtance, and made a
very great Slaughter.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that were left in the City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advertiz'd of the Misfortune of their
Friends, planted themſelves upon the
Tops of their Houſes, and threw down
Stones and Tiles upon the Horſe-men,
and in a Moment the Scales were turn'd;
for here was no engaging near at Hand,
but the whole Multitude ſecurely and
advantageouſly poſted, made a Battery
upon them from above, till at laſt being
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94482:25"/>
cruelly gall'd and wounded, they were
forc'd to quit their Ground, and retire
with Precipitation. A great many were
ſtruck down dead with Stones, that were
plaid upon them continually with great
Vigour, which afterwards rolling down
into the Streets, extremely annoy'd the
Horſes, and frequently occaſion'd the
Overthrowing both of Horſe and Man.
There were alſo ſome Foot-Soldiers
quarter'd in the Town, that out of a
private Pique to the Horſe-men, fell in
with and reinforc'd the Mobb.</p>
               <p>While all things were thus embroil'd
by Civil Fury, <hi>Commodus</hi> was kept in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of all that hapned; nor durſt
any Man acquaint him, for fear of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi>
till <hi>Fadilla,</hi> his eldeſt Siſter, who
had free Acceſs to him upon all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ran to him in great haſte, with her
Hair diſhervell'd, flung her ſelf upon
the Ground, and making indeed a very
deplorable Figure, ſpoke to him in theſe
Words, deliver'd with all the Concern
and Paſſion imaginable.</p>

               <p>After ſhe had ſpoke, ſhe rent her
Clothes; and this Boldneſs of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
inſpir'd others with Courage to
come in and confirm what ſhe had ſaid:
Which gave the Emperor ſuch terrible
Apprehenſions, that he thought the
Storm did not menace him from afar,
but was that Moment breaking over
his Head. So immediately he ſummons
<hi>Cleander</hi> to appear before him, who knew
nothing certainly of this Diſcovery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Conjecture and Suſpicion; and
after he was come, commanded him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
to be ſeiz'd; and his Head ſtruck
off, was afterwards fix'd on a Spear,
and expos'd to publick View, to the
unſpeakable Satisfaction of the People.</p>
               <p>Thus this Storm was blown over, the
Civil Fury was aſſwag'd, and all Sides
laid down their Arms. The Soldiers
ſaw their Leader ſlain, and began to
apprehend the Emperor's Diſpleaſure;
for they perceiv'd now that he had been
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94482:27"/>
abus'd in the whole Courſe of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
and that <hi>Cleander</hi> had acted without
his Authority or Commiſſion. The
Clamors of the People were appeas'd,
they ſat down contentedly under their
Miſeries, after they had been reveng'd
upon the Author of them. But <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s
Calamity involv'd all his Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
and his two Sons; they were
all butcher'd without Mercy, and their
dead Bodies dragg'd about the City,
after which Indignities they were thrown
into the Common Sewers. This was
the Period of <hi>Cleander</hi>'s Greatneſs, and of
all thoſe that were ſupported by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt:
And I am apt to believe, Nature
deſign'd him for a remarkable Inſtance
of the Mutability of our Condition,
and has ſhew'd in him how Men may
be lift up from the moſt abject State, to
the very utmoſt Pitches of Humane
Greatneſs, and how eaſily they may be
tumbled down again from this Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by a ſingle Turn or Double of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious
and inconſtant Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:94482:27"/>
And now <hi>Commodus,</hi> tho' he was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
afrai of an Inſurrection of the
People, yet he was prevail'd upon by
his Friends to return to the City, where
he was receiv'd by a great Appearance
of People, and loud Acclamations of
Joy, and then lodg'd himſelf in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Palace. But this Series of Dangers
he had encounter'd, had this bad Effect,
that it created in him a Jealouſie and
Diſtruſt of all Men, which betray'd him
to a mercileſs Diſpoſition of Mind, and
made him inclinable to hearken to all
manner of Calumnies and Accuſations,
tho never ſo falſe: He would not let
any Man have the leaſt Share in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that had the Reputation of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Vertue. As for himſelf, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from every Thing that was Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and Good, ſuffer'd his Animal
Nature to get the Aſcendent over his
Reaſon, which was ſenſibly impair'd by
his immoderate indulging Senſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
In concluſion, he baniſh'd all Men
his Court, that had the Fame of being
moderately Learned or Vertuous, under
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94482:28"/>
the notion of being Plotters and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators;
ſuffer'd himſelf to be led and
manag'd by a Set of Raſcals and Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons;
gave himſelf over to Chariot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driving,
and Combating with Wild
Beaſts, which he purſu'd with greater
Application than was ſuitable to his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Character; and from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
of this Kind it was, that his
Flatterers aſcrib'd to him the Reputation
of Valour.</p>
               <p>At this Time there were Prodigies
diſcover'd in the Heavens, Stars appear'd
in the Day-time, ſome of which of an
oblong Figure, ſeem'd to hang in the
Air. There were alſo a great many
extravagant Births of various Sorts of
Animals, contrary to the ordinary Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Nature. In ſome of theſe, the
whole Frame and Structure of the Body
was monſtrous; in others, the Parts
were ſtrangely diſproportionate. But
what gave the greateſt Wound for the
preſent, and fill'd Men with the moſt
dreadful Apprehenſions for the future,
was the Burning down of the Temple
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94482:28"/>
of Peace, being the moſt beautiful and
ſtately Fabrick that was in the City.
Before this diſmal Accident, there had
been no Rain and few Clouds, only the
Earth was juſt perceiv'd to tremble; and
whether it hapned by Lightning in the
Night, or by Fire which might burſt
out in that extraordinary Movement of
the Earth, is uncertain: But however it
was, the richeſt Temple in the City was
burnt to the Ground, with all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of Gold and Silver with which
it was beautified, far beyond any of
the reſt; for it was look'd upon as a
very ſecure Place, and was at that time
the univerſal Repoſitory for Things of
Value; ſo that by this Nights Calamity
ſeveral rich Men were reduc'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Poverty, and all Men lamented
the Publick Loſs, and each Man his own
Particular.</p>
               <p>Beſides this Temple, a great many
other graceful and magnificent Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
periſh'd in the Conflagration: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
theſe was the Temple of <hi>Veſta,</hi>
inſomuch that the Image of <hi>Pallas</hi> was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94482:29"/>
laid open to publick View. To this
the <hi>Romans</hi> pay a ſingular Veneration,
and ſecret it from the Eyes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The Tradition is, That it came
originally from <hi>Troy,</hi> and this was the
firſt Time it was ſeen in publick ſince
it was brought into <hi>Italy;</hi> for no ſooner
was it arriv'd, but the Veſtal Virgins
convey'd it privately along the Sacred
Way, and lodg'd it in the Imperial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
A great many other beautiful
and well-built Parts of the Town were
laid in Aſhes: Nor could the Fury of
the mercileſs Element be check'd, till it
was done by a Shower from Heaven.
And now the whole Buſineſs was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a Superintending Providence, and
the People were generally perſwaded
that the Fire began and ended by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Appointment; and it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Remark, That this Burning the
Temple of Peace portended Wars to
enſue. Nor was the Obſervation vain,
as appear'd by what hapned afterwards,
as ſhall be related in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:94482:29"/>
This Series of Diſaſters and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
coming one upon the Neck of
another, extremely abated the Affection
of the People to <hi>Commodus,</hi> to whoſe
Cruelty and enormous Way of Living
they imputed all the Miſeries they had
labour'd under; for they knew of all
his Irregularities, nor did he endeavour
to conceal them; but what he was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
for acting in Private, he boldly
own'd and avow'd in Publick; and at
laſt arriv'd to that Degree of Madneſs
and Folly, that he grew aſham'd of his
own Name, and in ſtead of <hi>Commodus</hi>
the Son of <hi>Marcus,</hi> commanded the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to call him <hi>Hercules</hi> the Son of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
He laid aſide too the Garb and
Enſigns of <hi>Roman</hi> Majeſty, wrapt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a Lions Skin, carry'd a Club in
his Hand, and, what was moſt ridiculous,
put on withall Purple Robes flowr'd
with Gold, inſomuch that he became
the Subject of the Publick Scorn and
Deriſion, having attempted to join in
the ſame Habit the Softneſs of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and the Manly Roughneſs of a
<hi>Heroe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94482:30"/>
In this Equipage he appear'd every
Day; and now with a peculiar Strain
of Vanity he chang'd the Names of the
Months, calling them after his own
Sur-names, moſt of which referr'd to
<hi>Hercules,</hi> as being a <hi>Heroe</hi> of the moſt
celebrated Valour. He likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Statues to be erected in all
the Parts of the City; particularly, one
was ſet up over againſt the Senate; the
Poſture was drawing a Bow; for he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
that even the Air of his Statues
ſhould carry ſomething of Terror and
Menace in it. This Statue was taken
down after his Death, by Order of the
Senate, and the Vacancy ſupply'd by
another of <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now <hi>Commodus</hi> could not maſter
his Vanity any longer; ſo he caus'd
Proclamation to be made, that he would
entertain the People with a Publick
Shew, wherein he would encounter the
Wild Beaſts in Perſon, and kill them
with his own Hands; adding Defiances
and Challenges to the <hi>Roman</hi> Youth,
and declaring that he would fight with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94482:30"/>
any that durſt appear in Single Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p>The Fame of this Entertainment
drew a vaſt Reſort of People out of
<hi>Italy</hi> and the adjacent Countries, all Men
being eager to ſee what they had not ſo
much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as heard of before: For 'twas
reported that <hi>Commodus</hi> levell'd a Dart
with that Dexterity and Addreſs, that he
ſeldom fail'd of hitting his Mark. He
had <hi>Parthians</hi> with him on purpoſe to
inſtruct him in the Myſtery of Arching,
and <hi>Numidians</hi> to teach him how to throw
the Javelin; and he had made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Improvement, that he ſurpaſs'd
them both in their reſpective Arts.</p>
               <p>And now the Day was come for the
Grand Entertainment, the Theater was
extremely crowded, and a Terraſs was
built for <hi>Commodus</hi> round the Place where
the Beaſts were to be ſhewn, from
whence, without any Hazard to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
he might dart upon them, to the
infinitely greater Proof of his Skill than
his Courage. As for Bucks and Does,
and other Horned Beaſts, except Bulls,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94482:31"/>
he gave them Chace himſelf, and with
the fatal Shaft o'ertook and ſlew them
in their Flight; but Lions and Panthers,
with the more generous ſort of Salvages,
he ſhot from the Terraſs; and ſo great
a Maſter was he of this Diverſion, that
every Dart gave Wounds, and every
Wound was mortal; for as ſoon as the
Beaſt was rous'd, and had put himſelf
in poſture to inſult him, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtruck him in the Heart or Head,
which were the only Parts he aim'd at,
ſo that the Beaſt infallibly dy'd. And
now we had an Opportunity of ſeeing
what before we had only admir'd in
Picture; for whatever Beaſt of porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Size or Form, the South or the
North, <hi>India</hi> or <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> could furniſh,
was ſhewn and ſlain in Publick by the
Emperor upon this Occaſion; all the
Spectators being in perfect Amazement
and Admiration of his matchleſs Skill.
Sometimes he would take a Dart the
Point whereof was faſhion'd in the
Shape of a Half-Moon; with this he
would ſtrike a <hi>Moreſco</hi> Eſtridge, a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94482:31"/>
that by its Swiftneſs of Foot, and
Wings that ſerve it in ſtead of Sails,
runs at a moſt prodigious rate, and
would take off its Head with that force,
that the Bird would continue its Career
a conſiderable time after. And when a
Panther with incredible Swiftneſs had
ſeiz'd a Man within the Liſts, and was
about to tear him in pieces, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
came in ſeaſonably to his Reſcue
with an Arrow, that ſtruck the Beaſt
dead, and fav'd the Man from the Jaws
of Death. He alſo kill'd a hundred
Lions with the like Number of Arrows,
their Dead Bodies fell in ſuch regular
Order, that any Perſon might number
them with eaſe; nor was any ſingle Shaft
found that had not done its deſign'd
Execution.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things, tho' they were unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Majeſty of an Emperor, yet
becauſe they had in them ſome Shadow
and Reſemblance of Skill and Bravery,
were not unpleaſing to the Populace:
But when he came naked into the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater,
and took upon him the Figure of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94482:32"/>
a Common Gladiator, this was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Spectacle: For how muſt it
wound the Eyes of every true <hi>Roman,</hi>
to ſee ſo Illuſtrious and High-born a
Prince, and Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> after ſo
many Triumphs of his Father and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
not making War upon the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations, nor doing any thing
worthy of that Empire of which he was
the Head, but debaſing his Imperial
Dignity, by taking upon him a Habit
ſo notoriouſly ſcandalous and infamous?
Notwithſtanding this, <hi>Commodus</hi> went on
with his Fencing, and eaſily baffl'd all
thoſe that enter'd the Liſts with him:
But he did not proceed beyond Wounds,
all the Combatants ſubmitting to him,
and confeſſing the Power of a Weapon
in the Hand of a Prince, how mean ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Skill was in uſing it. And now
he was ſo entirely given over to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Humour, or rather Madneſs,
that he deſign'd to abandon his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Palace, and to take his Apartment
in the Fencing-School. He thought fit
likewiſe to lay down his Name of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:94482:32"/>
and to take up that of a certain
Gladiator of famous Memory. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
took away the Head of the <hi>Coloſſus,</hi>
or the Statue of the <hi>Sun,</hi> for which the
<hi>Romans</hi> have a peculiar Veneration, and
ſet up his own in the Room; and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
the ordinary Style of <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
inſcrib'd upon the Baſis, <hi>The
Vanquiſher of a thouſand Gladiators;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
this vain Character to all the
Titles deriv'd to him from his Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>But now it was time a Stop ſhould
be put to the Follies and Madneſs of
the Emperor, and that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be
freed from his Tyranny. It was the
New Year, the Firſt Day of the Year,
at which Time the <hi>Romans</hi> celebrate a
Feſtival to <hi>Janus,</hi> the ancienteſt of the
<hi>Italian</hi> Gods. This <hi>Janus</hi> is reported
to have entertain'd <hi>Saturn</hi> when he was
forc'd out of his Kingdom, and liv'd
here <hi>incognito,</hi> for fear of the prevailing
Power of his Son <hi>Jupiter:</hi> And from
hence the Country was call'd <hi>Latium,</hi>
from a Word of <hi>Greek</hi> extraction, ſince
become <hi>Latin;</hi> and for this Reaſon the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94482:33"/>
                  <hi>Romans</hi> to this Day celebrate the <hi>Saturnalia</hi>
to the <hi>Abſconding God,</hi> immediately after
the Feaſt of the New Year, according
to the ancient Uſage of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Image
of this <hi>Janus</hi> has two Faces, becauſe in
him the Old Year ends, and the New
one begins. During this Feſtival, Friends
viſit and entertain one another in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
manner; Preſents are ſent,
and Invitations paſs amongſt Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
and, in ſhort, an Humour of
Generoſity, Hoſpitality, and Freedom
reigns all over the City: And at this
Time it is the Principal Magiſtrates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the firſt time in their Formalities.
In the height of this Solemnity <hi>Commodus</hi>
deſign'd to begin his Proceſſion, not
from the Imperial Palace, (as the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
was) but from the Fencing-School;
not in the Imperial Robes, but in the
Habit and Equipage of a Fencing-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
with a Train of Gladiators at his
Heels; and thus attended, he deſign'd
to make his Appearance in Publick.</p>
               <p>This Reſolution he communicated
to <hi>Marcia,</hi> one of his Concubines of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94482:33"/>
firſt Rate; for he lov'd her far above
all the reſt, and paid her all the Regard
and Deference that is due to a Wife, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
her all the Honours of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
except that of having Fire carry'd
before her in State. She preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
how ridiculous and extravagant
his Intention was in all the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it, and eſſay'd all the Ways ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to divert him from it, flung
her ſelf at his Feet, and beſought him
with Tears, that he would not entruſt
his Perſon with ſuch a Set of deſperate
Bravo's, nor do a Thing ſo highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with the Dignity of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire. But when ſhe found he
was inflexible, and all her Pray'rs ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
nothing, ſhe departed with Tears in
her Eyes.</p>
               <p>After that he call'd to him <hi>Laetus</hi> the
Captain of his Life Guard, and <hi>Electus</hi>
the Gentleman of his Bed-Chamber, and
commanded them to furniſh up an
Apartment for him in the Fencing-School,
imparting to them his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Marching from thence the next
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94482:34"/>
Morning, to perform the Sacrifices cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary
upon this Occaſion, and of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
before the People in Armour; at
which they were infinitely ſurpriz'd, and
beſought, and us'd their utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to diſſuade him from doing a
Thing ſo unworthy of his high Station
and Character.</p>
               <p>But this only ſerv'd to incenſe him:
Whereupon in great Rage he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to withdraw, and retir'd into
his Bed-Chamber, as if he had deſign'd
to repoſe himſelf, (as his Cuſtom was
about Noon) and there took his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-book,
and wrote down the Names
of thoſe he had doom'd and mark'd
out that Night for Deſtruction: The
firſt of which was <hi>Marcia,</hi> and after her
<hi>Laetus</hi> and <hi>Electus,</hi> with a great many
other eminent Perſonages of the Senate:
For he deſign'd to remove all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Friends, and eſpecially thoſe that
were venerable for their Age and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
leſt their Preſence might give him
ſome Check in thoſe infamous Liberties
which he reſolv'd to abandon himſelf
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94482:34"/>
to. Their Riches and Effects he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to diſtribute amongſt the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Gladiators, that the firſt might
protect, whilſt the latter did divert him.
This Table-book, after he had wrote
what he intended, he laid down upon
his Pallet, not imagining that any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
would enter his Chamber. Now
there was about the Court one of that
ſort of Boys that go naked, and are
trick'd up with Gold and Jewels, being
kept by Perſons of Quality in <hi>Rome</hi> for
their Diverſion. This Boy was a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of the Emperor's, who doted
upon him to that degree, that he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
took him to Bed with him, and
call'd him <hi>Philo-Commodus,</hi> the very Name
expreſſing his peculiar Fondneſs of him.
This Boy, when <hi>Commodus</hi> was Bathing,
or engag'd at his Revels, being at Play,
ran into the Emperor's Chamber, as he
us'd to do, and taking up the Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book,
began to play with that, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
out of the Chamber again with
the Book in his Hand, accidentally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd
<hi>Marcia,</hi> who had alſo a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94482:35"/>
for the Lad; and now ſhe took
him in her Arms, and kiſs'd and careſs'd
him, but took the Book away from
him, for fear he ſhould loſe or deface
ſomething that contain'd Matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
She knew the Hand very well,
and her Curioſity tempted her to look
what was wrote in it: But when ſhe
found how fatal it was to her ſelf, that
ſhe was to be the firſt Victime, and that
<hi>Laetus</hi> and <hi>Electus</hi> were to follow, and
that there was a great Maſſacre to be of
other Men, ſhe broke out into this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation:
<hi>Ah</hi> Commodus! <hi>are theſe
then the Returns you make me for my Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Paſſion! Have I deſerv'd this at
your Hands! Have I for this born your
drunken Frollicks, and all the Affronts and
Indignities you have been pleas'd to put upon
me for theſe many Years? And muſt all this be
tamely ſuffer'd? No, his Deſigns ſhall turn
upon himſelf, and he ſhall find how unequal
a Match a drunken. Sot is for a ſober de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
Woman.</hi> After this Menace, ſhe
ſent for <hi>Electus,</hi> with whom ſhe had the
Opportunity of frequent Converſations,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94482:35"/>
as being Gentleman of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and was indeed ſuſpected of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities
with him which were not very
Honourable. When he was come, ſhe
gave him the Book, and bid him look
after what manner they were like to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
this Feſtival. <hi>Electus,</hi> after he
had read it, was perfectly aſtoniſh'd:
(He was by Nation an <hi>AEgyptian,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
bold, and of a fiery Diſpoſition.)
He ſent the Book ſeal'd up immediately
to <hi>Laetus,</hi> by the Hands of a Servant in
whom he could repoſe a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Confidence. The Adventure
gave the ſame Diſturbance to <hi>Laetus,</hi> it
had done to the reſt; whereupon he
came over to <hi>Marcia,</hi> under pretence of
adjuſting by her Advice the Furniture of
the Emperor's Apartment in the Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
School. Under this Colour they
held their Conſult, wherein it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
That this was no Time for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays;
that they muſt inſtantly attempt
ſomething, or periſh in the Storm that
threatned them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:94482:36"/>
After Debate about the Ways and
Means, they reſolv'd to poiſon <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi>
This <hi>Marcia</hi> undertook to do with
a great deal of Eaſe, becauſe all his
Liquors were mix'd and given to him
by her Hand; for he drank any Thing
with a peculiar Relliſh that was prepar'd
by that dear Creature. Purſuant to the
Reſolutions taken, when he return'd
from the Bath, <hi>Marcia</hi> offer'd him Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
mix'd with Wine of a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Flavour, which he drank without
ſuſpecting any thing; for he had made
himſelf extreme thirſty by the Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Bathing and Hunting. After
the fatal Draught, he was ſeiz'd with a
ſudden Drowſineſs, which threw him
into a Slumber, and from thence into a
Sleep. This People attributed only to
the Fatigue of the Day. Hereupon
<hi>Marcia</hi> and <hi>Electus</hi> commanded all the
Company to repair to their reſpective
Lodgings, for fear of diſturbing him.
And leſs notice was taken of this Buſineſs,
becauſe he us'd to have theſe Sleeping
Fits, which at other Times were the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94482:36"/>
of ſome inordinate Debauch; for
he divided his Time ſo between Bathing
and Banquetting, that he had ſet none
apart for his Reſt, but was ſtill run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
on in a Circle of Pleaſures, to
which he was become ſo abſolute a
Slave, that he often purſu'd them
even againſt his Inclination. But after
a ſhort Repoſe, when the Poiſon began
to work upon his Stomach, he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſeiz'd with a Dizzineſs, and after
that, vomited moſt exceſſively. What
the Reaſon was, is uncertain; whether
he had gorg'd himſelf with Meat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
or the Wine; which he had
drunk plentifully, combated with, and
expell'd the Malignity of the Poiſon; or
whether he had taken ſomething, as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
uſually do, by way of Antidote
againſt it.</p>
               <p>However it was, when they ſaw him
diſgorge at this rate, fearing leſt he
ſhould caſt up all the Poiſon, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and conſequently put them all to
Death, they perſwaded <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> a young
<hi>Deſperado,</hi> to ſtrangle him in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94482:37"/>
which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Condition, languiſhing under the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
which his late Debauch, and the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he had taken, had caſt him into.
Thus dy'd <hi>Commodus,</hi> after he had reign'd
Three Years from his Father's Death.
He was the Nobleſt Prince, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
Perſon of his Age; and if we may
admit Valour to conſiſt in Skill in Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Levelling at a Mark, no Man
was more eminently poſſeſs'd of that
Vertue; but the whole Tenor of his
Life was made up of baſe Actions, and
diſhonourable Practices, as is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>

                  <hi>COmmodus</hi> being ſlain, it is given
out that he died of an Apoplexy, and
<hi>Pertinax</hi> is elected Emperor, as being the
moſt worthy of that Honour. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
it, but is prevail'd upon at laſt by
the Inſtances of the People, and accepts it.
The Soldiery, Senate, and People of
<hi>Rome</hi> proclaim him Emperor. He makes
a Speech, ſacrifices, and then goes to his
Palace. In his Government he has a
ſtrict Regard to Equity and Juſtice for
which Reaſon he is extremely belov'd by the
People, both in <hi>Rome</hi> and the Provinces,
and no leſs formidable to his Enemies:
But to the Soldiers he is inſupportable,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94482:38"/>
becauſe they are reſtrain'd from Rapine
and Injury. So they form a Conſpiracy
againſt him, and kill him, and then ſhut
themſelves up in the Camp, and make
Proclamation that the Empire is to be
ſold by <hi>Auction. Julian</hi> was the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer,
and adminiſter'd it as ſhamefully
as he got it. Whereupon <hi>Niger,</hi> Prefect
of <hi>Syria,</hi> is choſen, and holds his Court
in <hi>Antioch:</hi> But being not ſo active
as his Affairs requir'd, <hi>Severus</hi> ſeizes
the Empire, under colour of Revenging
<hi>Pertinax</hi>'s Death, and is proclaim'd Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> from whence he
marches directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, upon
his Arrival, the Senate confirm his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and order <hi>Julian</hi> to be put to
Death, who is executed accordingly by a
Tribune appointed for that purpoſe. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>COmmodus</hi> being ſlain, as we have
related in the former Book, the
Conſpirators had a mind to keep this
Matter from taking Air; and for a
Blind to the Guards that were then upon
Duty about the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they wrapp'd
up his Body in a courſe Blanket, and
gave it to two Servants of known Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to carry it out of the Palace, as if
it had been ſome unneceſſary Furniture,
that only cumber'd the Chamber. They
did ſo, and paſs'd the Guards without
Difficulty, ſome of which were drunk,
others ſo ſleepy they were ſcarce able to
hold their Halberts, and the reſt were
not at all inquiſitive about a Matter
which they thought did not concern
them. So the Emperor's Body was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
away privately, and carry'd that
Night by Coach to <hi>Ariſteum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now <hi>Laetus, Electus,</hi> and <hi>Marcia</hi>
were in deep Conſult about what was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94482:39"/>
to be done in this critical Conjuncture.
At laſt they fell upon this Reſolution,
That it ſhould be given out, that he
dy'd ſuddenly of an <hi>Apoplexy;</hi> for they
thought this Report would eaſily gain
Credit, becauſe of the Notoriety of his
luxurious and irregular Way of Living.
The next Point that came under Debate,
was about a Succeſſor; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to chuſe ſome grave old Man,
that had a competent Degree of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Experience to recommend
him, under whoſe Government not only
they might live ſecurely, but all Men
might enjoy Repoſe and Quiet, which
they had been ſo long depriv'd of by a
Tyrannical Adminiſtration; and after
long Deliberation about a Perſon, none
was found ſo fit a Man, or ſo worthy
of the Empire, as <hi>Pertinax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Pertinax</hi> was by Nation an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
much renown'd for his ſucceſsful
Atchievements in Time of War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his
prudent Miniſtry in Time of Peace.
He had ſignaliz'd himſelf in his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
againſt the <hi>Germans;</hi> and the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94482:39"/>
Nations, over whom he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
great Victories; and he was the
only Perſon ſurviving of thoſe grave
and wiſe Men whom <hi>Marcus</hi> honour'd
with his Friendſhip and Confidence.
The Reaſon why he was ſpar'd, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain:
Whether <hi>Commodus</hi> rever'd him
for the Dignity and Gravity of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
or he had no Regards of
Intereſt to move him to cut him off:
For this alſo is part of his Panegyrick,
that though he had run through the
greateſt Charges and Employments of
any, yet he had made the ſmalleſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of his own Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To him</hi> Laetus <hi>and</hi> Electus, <hi>with ſome
others of the Conſpirators, came at
Midnight, when all Men were aſleep;
and finding his Gates lock'd, awaken'd
the Porter, who, as ſoon as he deſcry'd
the Soldiers, and</hi> Laetus, <hi>Captain of the
Guard, among them, in great conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
he runs back to acquaint his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
Pertinax <hi>commanded him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them to him, without any greater
Emotion than the ſaying,</hi> That now what
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94482:40"/>
he had ſo long expected, was come to paſs.
<hi>And he maintain'd all the Time ſuch a
Sedateneſs and Conſtancy of Mind,
that he did not ſo much as move him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the Bed, or alter the Air of
his Face. And when</hi> Laetus <hi>and</hi> Electus
<hi>made their Approach, tho' he concluded
they came to kill him, yet he never
chang'd Colour, but ſpoke to them
with a becoming Boldneſs and Gravity
of Countenance.</hi> I've expected, <hi>ſays he,</hi>
a long time that this Period ſhould be put to
my Days, being the only Perſon remaining
of the Friends of the deceas'd Emperor;
and I muſt confeſs, I have wonder'd why
<hi>Commodus</hi> has ſuſpended the Blow ſo long.
And as for you, Gentlemen, what do you
ſtay of? Why don't you execute your War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and diſpatch me out of this wretched
State of Anxiety and Miſery? Laetus <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,</hi>
Pray, Sir, forbear ſpeaking Things
ſo unworthy your Character, and the former
Courſe of your Life. We come not hither
to be your Executioners, but to compleat
the Preſervation and Deliverance of us, your
ſelf, and the <hi>Roman</hi> People, from Tyranny
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94482:40"/>
and Slavery. The Tyrant is ſlain, and has
receiv'd the Chaſtiſement due to his Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
and Folly. We have prevented him,
and he has ſuffer'd that from our Hands,
which he deſign'd we ſhould undergo by his.
And now we come to offer the Empire to you,
the Leading Man in the Senate, as well in
regard of your Authority and Age, as of the
conſtant Moderation and Sobriety of your
Manners. We know alſo, that none main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
ſo great a Share as you in the Vogue and
Affections of the People, and for that Reaſon
aſſure our ſelves, that by this Action of
ours we ſhall not only provide for our own
Safety, but merit Eſteem and Applauſe from
every true <hi>Roman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pertinax <hi>anſwer'd,</hi> Pray, Gentlemen, don't
banter an old Man at this rate: I am not
ſunk into ſuch Meanneſs and Abjectneſs of
Spirit, as that you ſhould thus abuſe me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you kill me. Nay then, <hi>ſaid</hi> Electus,
if you won't take our Word, pray read this
Book, (you know and have been accuſtom'd
to the Emperor's Hand) and you'll perceive
how great a Danger we have eſcap'd, and
that what we ſay now, is not to enſnare, but
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94482:41"/>
to inform you of the true State of Things.
<hi>And now</hi> Pertinax <hi>began to overcome
his Incredulity, and to believe what
they ſaid; and underſtanding the whole
Matter, told them,</hi> he was intirely at
their Diſpoſal, and would purſue ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
as they ſhould direct. <hi>And they
thought it the moſt adviſable in the firſt
place to go to the Army, and ſound the
Inclinations of the Soldiers; tho'</hi> Laetus
<hi>aſſur'd them, he could influence them to
do what he pleas'd, in regard he was their
Commander, and upon that Score might
pretend to a more than ordinary Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them. So they all went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to the Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the Night was far ſpent,
and the Day for the Celebration of the
Feſtival approach'd: But all Things
were adjuſted before Morning, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Men were order'd to ſpread abroad
the Report, that <hi>Commodus</hi> was dead, and
that <hi>Pertinax</hi> was to ſucceed him, and
was gone to the Army, in order to his
Election.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:94482:41"/>
After this News was publickly known,
the People were viſibly tranſported into
ſtrange Emotions and Ecſtaſies. A great
many ran about the Streets, and handed
to their Friends the welcome Tydings,
eſpecially to thoſe of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Fortune or Quality; for they had
the greateſt Reaſon to rejoyce upon this
Occaſion, as being deliver'd from the
moſt imminent Danger. Then they
ran to the Temples and Altars, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Thanks to the Immortal Gods for
this ſignal Deliverance; ſome crying
aloud, <hi>The Gladiator,</hi> others, <hi>The Tyrant
is dead.</hi> And ſome there were that broke
out into far more bitter Reproaches; all
which, during the late Tyranny, were
ſtifled, none daring even to whiſper
thoſe Things, which now they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
with great freedom and liberty.
After this, great Numbers of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
went in a tumultuary manner to the
Army, for fear the Soldiers ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Promotion of <hi>Pertinax;</hi> for he
was a Man famous for Temper and
Moderation, and therefore they fanſied
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94482:42"/>
might not be very agreeable to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who had miniſter'd to the Luſts
of Tyrants, and under their Shelter and
Countenance had committed the greateſt
Violences and Rapines. The purpoſe
therefore of their coming, was to force
them to a Compliance, in caſe they
ſhould endeavour any Oppoſition. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were aſſembled in the Camp,
<hi>Laetus</hi> and <hi>Electus</hi> introduc'd <hi>Pertinax,</hi>
and preſented him to them; and having
call'd the Soldiers together, <hi>Laetus</hi> made
this Harangue.</p>

<hi>Commodus</hi> your Emperor is dead of
an Apoplexy, occaſion'd by his own Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
for he deſpis'd the wholeſom and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Advices which we gave him, and living
on at the Rate which you very well know,
was at laſt perfectly choak'd up with exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Eating. This is, Gentlemen, the Account
of his Death. Indeed every Man has not
the ſame Fate; the Cauſes of Death are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94482:42"/>
various almoſt as the Caſualties of Life; and
tho' we muſt all die, yet we tread different
Paths to that Common End. In his Room,
we and the <hi>Roman</hi> People propoſe to you a
Man that has the Recommendations of Age,
Sobriety, great Military Experience. As to
the laſt of theſe, I dare appeal to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of all thoſe that have been any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Time in the Army, and aſſure my
ſelf, they can't but ſpeak honourably of his
Conduct in all his Expeditions. Nor have
the reſt of you leſs admir'd his Prudence and
Moderation in the whole Courſe of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry

the City, in the Capacity of <hi>Praefect,</hi> divers
Years; and now, by the Bounty of Heaven,
he's offer'd not to be only a Prince, but a

upon thoſe many great and glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
of his to which themſelves have been

Witneſſes. We ſhall need no longer diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
to purchaſe a precarious Peace with
the Barbarous Nations; the Memory of his

impatient of Delay, whilſt the Soldiers
were debating and demurring upon the
Propoſal, without waiting the Reſult,
proclaim'd him Emperor, and Father of
his Country, with loud Acclamations of
Joy. The Soldiers did the ſame, but not
with the ſame Chearfulneſs and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but rather as if they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to it by an over-powering Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
(ſurrounding them on every Side)
and had comply'd with a Thing which
was impoſſible to oppoſe; for, in regard
it was a Feſtival, they were without their
Arms. However, they took the Oaths
of Allegiance to him, and ſacrific'd to
the Gods; after which, the whole Army
and People, carrying Branches of Laurel,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94482:43"/>
accompanied him to the Imperial Palace
with great Solemnity.</p>
               <p>And here his Cares and Fears gave
him great Uneaſineſs; for tho' he had
always diſcover'd great Conſtancy and
Preſence of Mind in all Emergencies,
yet now he was extremely ſhock'd upon
duely weighing the preſent Condition of
Affairs: Not on the Account of any
Perſonal Dangers which he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
to himſelf; for he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
far greater at other times, than
he had now any Reaſon to fear. But
he conſider'd the ſudden Change of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Government; that his Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might occaſion great Reſentments in
ſome of the Nobility, who would not
brook, that a Man ſo meanly born,
ſhould ſucceed a Prince ſo nobly deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

celebrated for his Moderation and Civil
Prudence, and had gain'd alſo great
Renown by his Military Atchievements,
yet a great many excell'd him in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their Lineage. Therefore in
the Morning he went to the Senate, but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94482:44"/>
would not ſuffer Fire, nor any Enſign of
Imperial Dignity to be carried before
him, till the Senate had declar'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Point of his Election.</p>
               <p>After he had enter'd the Senate, by the
unanimous Suffrage of the Houſe he was
declar'd Emperor; but he declin'd the
Honour, ſaying, it would draw too
great a Weight of Envy upon him;
and earneſtly entreated to be excus'd,
alledging his Inability for ſo great a
Charge, upon the Account of his Age;
and that there were a great many of the
Senators far more worthy of ſo great
and honourable a Truſt; and taking out
<hi>Glabrio,</hi> would have plac'd him on the
Imperial Throne. He was the moſt
nobly deſcended of all the Senators, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
his Pedigree from <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Son
of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> and had been twice
Conſul. But he excus'd himſelf very
handſomly, and told him, Since he was
pleas'd to ſingle him out as the moſt
worthy of the Empire, he did freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
all his Title and Intereſt to him, and
with the concurring Voices of the whole
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94482:44"/>
Senate, declar'd him Emperor. After
which <hi>Pertinax,</hi> being unable to reſiſt
the violent and preſſing Inſtances of all
Men, with a kind of Reluctancy aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Imperial Throne, and deliver'd
himſelf in the following Words.</p>

                           <p>GEntlemen, this ſignal Honour which
you do me, and that extraordinary
Zeal and Affection which you diſcover on
this Occaſion, by preferring me to ſo many
Noble Peers, does not only exclude all Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of Flattery, but is a ſtrong Argument
of your Good-will and ſincere Intentions.
Such Aſſurances of your Favour would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
another Man chearfully to accept ſo
great and gracious an Offer, and make him
conceive Hopes of an eaſie and a happy Reign,
where he ſhould meet with ſuch good Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
in the Subject. But theſe Things have
a contrary Effect upon me, and rather admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
Matter of Wonder and Amazement,
and fill me with a Fear and Diffidence, when
I conſider the Difficulty of making a Return
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94482:45"/>
ſuitable to ſo great a Merit. For in the
Intercourſe of Good Offices, if the Requital
be greater than the Benefit, it is not ſo much
valu'd for that, as for the Intention with
which it is made. But in the Caſe of a
prior Obligation, if the Return be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to the Benefit receiv'd, we preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall under the Cenſure and Imputation of
Ingratitude, and ſhall be rather thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
of the Kindneſs, than unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
it. And now I ſee what almoſt inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
Difficulties I am to encounter, to make
my future Behaviour worthy of the preſent
Honour you have done me: For it is not
Dignity of Place, but of Manners, that gives
a true Preheminence; and the more Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
the Vices of the paſt Age, the more they
wiſh for a Reformation of this. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
make a laſting Impreſſion; but the very
Ideas of Benefits receiv'd, are ſoon loſt and
defac'd. Nor are Men ſo ſenſible of the
Enjoyment of Liberty, as of the Want of it:
For where's the Obligation, ſay they, if we
have the free Uſe of what is our own? 'Tis only
our Right. And few will be found that will
make any Acknowledgments upon that Score:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94482:45"/>
But if their Properties come to be invaded,
and their Goods are taken away by Force, this
they can never forget. Another Thing is,
few Private Perſons have a due Regard for
the Publick Good, or think their own Intereſt
involv'd in that of the Community: But if
they be aggriev'd in their own Particular,
they preſently exclaim againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and think they're hardly dealt with. On
the other hand, thoſe that have been ſupported
by the profuſe Largeſſes of Tyrants, if you
conſider the general want of Money, and
thereupon retrench the Publick Expences,
won't commend your Prudence or Frugality
in this Regulation; but will preſently accuſe
you of a ſordid Meanneſs and Narrowneſs of
Spirit; never conſidering, that thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Donatives can't be furniſh'd without

Whereas he that proportions his Rewards to

               <p>This Declaration of <hi>Pertinax</hi> highly
ſatisfied the Senate, after which he was
receiv'd with loud Acclamations of Joy,
and the greateſt Marks of Honour and
Reſpect; and having viſited the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the other Gods, and
ſacrific'd according to the Cuſtom, he
retir'd to the Imperial Palace. After this
Speech was made Publick, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had read a Declaration of his that
was directed to them, they diſcover'd
great Signs of a general Contentment
and Satisfaction; for all Men were of
Opinion that he would make a Prudent
and a Gentle Prince, and a Father ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than an Emperor: For he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
commanded the Soldiers, under
ſevere Penalties, not to offer any Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the People, nor to affront any
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94482:46"/>
Perſon that paſs'd by; and deſign'd to
reform the whole Diſcipline, and reſtore
all Things to their ancient Courſe and
Order.</p>
               <p>Whenever he appear'd abroad, or ſat
in the Courts of Judicature, he ſtill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
a Spirit of Mildneſs, Humanity,
and Good-nature. And now the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
began to be influenc'd by the
ſame gentle Principles that were obſerv'd
by <hi>Marcus,</hi> whoſe Princely Vertues he
emulated in all Things; which gave him
the general Eſteem and Approbation of
all the old Men that remembred <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:</hi>
Nor was he leſs dear to the reſt,
whom he eaſily won to him by that
happy Change which he had introduc'd
in the Government, wherein every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
might enjoy Security and Repoſe,
in ſtead of the Fears and Moleſtations
they were liable to under the late Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
The Fame of theſe Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carried to diſtant Nations, excited
the People as well as the Soldiery, and
not only our own, but thoſe of our
Allies, to decree him Divine Honours.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94482:47"/>
And the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> ſome of which were
actually revolted, and others upon the
point of running into the ſame Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
were reduc'd to Terms of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Submiſſion, partly by the Fear
of his Bravery, whereof they had had
Experience in the late Wars, and partly
by the Fame of his Clemency, Honour,
and Juſtice, from which he was never
known to have departed.</p>
               <p>Ambaſſadors were alſo diſpatch'd
from all Parts to congratulate the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of the <hi>Romans</hi> in ſo incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an Emperor. But this gentle and
well-order'd Government, which gave
ſuch general Satisfaction to the People,
as they expreſs'd both in Publick and
Private, bred a great deal of ill Blood
among the Soldiers that quarter'd in
<hi>Rome,</hi> and guarded the Emperor's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
For being reſtrain'd from Rapine
and Injury, and bound to their Good
Behaviour, and the Rules of ſtrict Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
they thought theſe Meaſures of
gentle and regular Government reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a kind of Reproach and Diſgrace
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94482:47"/>
upon them, and were a manifeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment
upon their Privileges; and
at laſt reſolv'd, they were inſupportable,
and not to be ſuffer'd. So at firſt they
grew by degrees inſolent and mutinous,
and would not render that Obedience
to the Commands of their Superiors
which was expected from them; and
before Two Months of his Reign were
compleated, after the Dawn of a Prudent
Government had diſplay'd it ſelf in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
diſcreet and wiſe Regulations which
he made, and after the Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of all Men were rais'd to the
utmoſt height, by one Stroke of a cruel
invidious Fortune, all was daſh'd and
overthrown; and all thoſe admirable
Deſigns which he had form'd, which
would have been of ſo univerſal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the Publick, were defeated before
they were ripe for Execution.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, he took care that
all the Deſarts and Waſte Grounds in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and the Provinces, ſhould be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
and improv'd: In order to this,
he gave all theſe Lands (without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94482:48"/>
even of ſuch as belong'd to the
Crown) to the Occupiers, to every one
ſo much as he ſhould manure and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate,
veſting the Property of the Soil
in him that was at the Charge of the
Improvement. And by way of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
he granted them an Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
from all Taxes for Ten Years, and
freed them as long as they remain'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
from all Moleſtations and Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
whatſoever. Thoſe Grounds
that were Crown-Lands, he would not
ſuffer to be call'd ſo, in regard they were
not (as he ſaid) the Private Poſſeſſions
of the Crown, but belong'd to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
Body of the <hi>Roman</hi> People. He
remitted all Tolls and Impoſts laid upon
Banks of Rivers, Harbours, and Publick
Ways, to raiſe Funds to ſupport the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances
of Tyrants, and reſtor'd
them to their ancient Freedom; and
had he liv'd longer, would have done a
great many other Things of the ſame
Nature and Quality.</p>
               <p>He baniſh'd all Common Informers
from <hi>Rome,</hi> commanding them to depart
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94482:48"/>
the City under ſevere Penalties, that no
Man might be in danger of falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.
And now the Senators, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all Orders and Degrees of Men,
propos'd to themſelves Great Happineſs
and Satisfaction under the Government
of a Prince that did not ſet himſelf
proudly above his Subjects, and yet was
ſo ſollicitous for their Welfare; for ſo
exemplary was the Humility and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> even in his higheſt
Exaltation, that he would never ſuffer
his Son to approach the Imperial Palace,
but order'd him to remain at his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Houſe, from whence he repair'd,
as he us'd to do, to the Schools and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Exerciſe, in the Quality of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſon, conforming in all Points to
the ordinary Rules and Diſcipline, and
was in all Reſpects and Circumſtances
as the Children of Private Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt Appearance of the State
and Grandeur of a Prince.</p>
               <p>Whilſt all Men admir'd the wiſe and
ſober Conduct of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> the <hi>Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Soldiers were ſo much diſſatisfied
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94482:49"/>
with the preſent Poſture of Affairs, that
they began to wiſh for a Revolution,
and that the ſame Tyranny might take
place, under which they had committed
what Spoil and Violence they pleas'd,
without Controul: And in the height of
a Debauch they concerted to take <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi>
out of the Way, as being a great
Check and Curb to them, and to ſet
up one in his ſtead, that would reſtore
them to, and maintain them in thoſe
ſcandalous Privileges and Liberties which
they uſurp'd during the late Reign:
And accordingly, when all Things were
in a profound Calm, they came down
ſuddenly to the Palace-Gates at High-Noon,
breathing Fury and Revenge, in
a very tumultuous Manner, with their
Spears mounted, and their Swords
drawn, as if they would have inſulted
the Imperial Palace. This ſudden Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar
put thoſe that were of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Houſhold in great Conſternation;
but being few, and without Arms, they
durſt not make Head againſt ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and well-appointed Troops, but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94482:49"/>
deſerted every Man his Poſt, and made
the beſt of their Way out of the Palace,
ſome one Way, and ſome another. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
thoſe that had a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Affection for the Emperor, gave
him notice of this Outrage of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and advis'd him withal to conſult
his own Safety, by forſaking the Palace,
and demanding the Aſſiſtance of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He thought theſe Advices pertinent
enough in the preſent Exigent; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he look'd upon it as diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and unworthy his former Life, and
the Majeſty of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, to fly
or ſtep behind the Screen at the aproach
of Danger, and immediately reſolv'd
to oppoſe himſelf to their Fury, hoping
that if he went out and ſpoke to them,
he might allay their preſent Heats, and
prevent any further Conſequence of ſo
unnatural a Rage. Whereupon he left
the Palace, and boldly walk'd out, and
demanded of them the Reaſon of this
Concourſe, endeavouring to reclaim
them to their Duty and Allegiance. And
this he did with all the Unconcern ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94482:50"/>
compoſing his Countenance to a
grave and Majeſtick Air, without utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Thing that was mean, or in the
Strain of a timerous obnoxious Perſon,
he ſpoke to them as follows.</p>

                           <p>GEntlemen, tho' you take away my Life,
yet neither will you be any great
Gainers, nor ſhall I be any conſiderable Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
having liv'd to this Age, and arriv'd to
theſe Honours: For there is a neceſſary
Term and Period of Humane Life. But for
you, who are appointed to guard and protect
your Prince againſt the Attacks of others, to
fall upon him your ſelves, to murther your
own Charge, and ſtain your Hands not only
with the Blood of a Fellow-Citizen, but your
Leige-Lord, will not only be a Crime of a
very heinous Nature for the preſent, but
may alſo prove very fatal to you in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.
And as for my part, I am not
conſcious that I have done you any Injury.
If you lay to Heart <hi>Commodus</hi>'s Death,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94482:50"/>
it is no ſtrange Thing that a Man ſhould
die; and if you ſuſpect any Thing of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in his Death, I can plead Not Guilty
to any Arraignment for that Fact; and you
your ſelves know, I was not ſo much as
ſuſpected to have had any Hand in it, being
as utterly ignorant of what was done then, as
you were. If you therefore think that there
was Treaſon in that Affair, you muſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Charge upon ſome other Perſon. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Gentlemen, tho' <hi>Commodus</hi> is dead,
you may ſatisfie your ſelves, that you ſhall
want nothing that is reaſonable or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,

               <p>This gentle Rebuke, together with
his Auguſt Preſence and Age, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
a kind of Reverence from his
Hearers, had its deſir'd Effect upon ſome
who began to relent, and draw off in
great Numbers, whilſt others more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſeleſs
aſſaulted him in the middle of
his Harangue, and kill'd him. After
the commiſſion of this horrid Treaſon,
fearing the Reſentments of the People,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94482:51"/>
which they knew would be very high
upon this Occaſion, they reſolv'd to
withdraw themſelves from their Fury,
and retir'd in great haſte to the Camp,
and kept themſelves within the Walls,
diſpoſing Soldiers upon the Ramparts,
to repulſe the Mobb, if they ſhould
make any Attack upon the Wall. Thus
dy'd <hi>Pertinax,</hi> after he had liv'd in great
Reputation for his Integrity and Vertue,
as is before related.</p>
               <p>After it was nois'd abroad that the
Emperor was aſſaſſinated, all Places were
full of Sorrow and Confuſion; the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in a ſtrange Ferment ran about the
Streets, as if they had been ſeiz'd by
ſome ſudden epidemical Madneſs, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Authors of this deteſtable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy,
but in vain; for they could not
find them; and if they had, they were
out of their Power. But the Senators
were the moſt ſenſibly affected; they
ſaw how deep a Wound it had given to
the Publick, and what a Loſs they had
ſuſtain'd, not only of a gentle Prince,
but of an indulgent Father; and now
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94482:51"/>
they look'd for a Re-eſtabliſhment of
Tyranny and Arbitrary Power, which
they knew would be grateful to the
Soldiers.</p>
               <p>But after two or three Days, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
took Counſel of their Fears, and
were diſpos'd to be quiet. Thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them that were of eminent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
left the City, and retreated to their
Country-houſes which were at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diſtance from it, to avoid all Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
which their Preſence might
expoſe them to in the next Reign. The
Soldiers, after they found the Popular
Rage abated, and perceiv'd that no Man
would be ſo hardy as to revenge the
Emperor's Death, kept themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Trenches, and appointed ſuch
as had the beſt Lungs to make Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
upon the Walls, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was to be ſold by <hi>Auction,</hi> that he
that offer'd the moſt ſhould be the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer,
adding, that they would inveſt
him with the Imperial Dignity by Force
of Arms, and conduct him in Safety to
the Palace. This Proclamation did not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94482:52"/>
move any of the Senators that were Men
of Reputation and Authority, nor any
of thoſe few rich Men that had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
the Tyranny of <hi>Commodus:</hi> none
of theſe approach'd the Wall, but
ſcorn'd even the Empire of the World,
where the Means to attain it were ſo
diſhonourable.</p>
               <p>The News of this Proclamation was
brought to <hi>Julian,</hi> a Man of Conſular
Dignity, and one that had the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of great Poſſeſſions, when he was
at Supper, carowſing and regaling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
for he was cenſur'd for being very
often guilty of theſe Exceſſes: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his Wife and Daughter, falling in
with a multitude of Paraſites that were
there, advis'd him with all ſpeed to riſe
from the Table, and inform himſelf of
this Matter, perſwading him all along
as he went, not to ſuffer the-Empire to
lie expos'd for want of a Purchaſer, and
telling him, that he was able to give as
good a Price as the beſt of them, if any
Perſon ſhould diſpute that Point with
him. As ſoon as he came near the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94482:52"/>
Wall, he cry'd aloud, that he would give
whatſoever they demanded, and withal
gave in a Particular of his Eſtate, and
of the vaſt Treaſures which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd.
Hither alſo repair'd <hi>Sulpicianus,</hi>
with the ſame Intention. He was too a
Conſular Man, and had been Praefect
of the City, and was Father-in-Law to
<hi>Pertinax;</hi> but they would not hearken to
any Propoſals of his, becauſe of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
to <hi>Pertinax,</hi> which gave them a
Jealouſie that there was ſome Fraud or
Colluſion at the Bottom, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<hi>Pertinax</hi>'s Death.</p>
               <p>Hereupon they put down a Ladder,
and took <hi>Julian</hi> up to the Top of the
Wall, but would not open the Gates
till the Bargain was ſtruck up, and the
Sum aſcertain'd: After which having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the Camp, he engag'd his Faith
and Honour to them for the Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Memory, Honours, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of <hi>Commodus,</hi> which were taken
down by Order of the Senate; as alſo
for the Reſtoring all thoſe Privileges
which they had enjoy'd during his Reign.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94482:53"/>
He gave to every Soldier more than he
did expect, or could have demanded;
which he promis'd to pay down in ready
Caſh, giving out that he had the Money
in Bank. Theſe Things highly ſatisfied
the Soldiers, and buoy'd them up into
mighty Expectances; inſomuch that
they immediately proclaim'd him Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and honour'd him with the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of <hi>Commodus;</hi> then flouriſhing
their Enſigns, and reſtoring the Images
of <hi>Commodus,</hi> they prepar'd to conduct
him to the Palace: Whereupon he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd
according to the Cuſtom, and
march'd out of the Camp with a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Guard than ordinary; for having by
Force, contrary to the Inclinations of
the People, by baſe Means, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Condeſcentions, obtain'd the Empire,
he had too juſt Reaſon to fear the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
of the <hi>Mobile.</hi> Therefore the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
put on their whole Armour, and
form'd themſelves into a Regular Body,
that if Occaſion ſhould require, they
might be in condition to engage any
that ſhould oppoſe them. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94482:53"/>
the Emperor into the Middle,
and bearing their Spears and Targets
over their Heads, to ſhelter them from
the Stones which might be thrown upon
them from the Houſes, in this manner
they guarded him to the Palace, none
appearing to make any Reſiſtance. But
the People did not receive him with thoſe
Acclamations of Joy which are uſual
upon the like Occaſions; but ſtanding
at a diſtance, beſtow'd a great many
Curſes and Execrations upon him, for
ſhamefully trucking the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
for Gold with thoſe baſe Mercenaries.
And from hence it is that we muſt date
the total Corruption of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
their ſordid and inſatiable Deſires
of Money, with their Contempt of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Power; for no Body appearing
to execute Vengeance upon them for
this barbarous Aſſaſſination of their
Prince, or to oppoſe this ignominious
<hi>Auction</hi> of the Empire, from this Time
they grew proud and arrogant: Their
Avarice with their Contempt of Princes,
encreas'd, even to the offering Violence to
their Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:94482:54"/>
                  <hi>Julian</hi> after he had obtain'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
fell into an eager Purſuit of ſenſual
unmanly Pleaſures, became regardleſs
of Publick Concerns, and abandon'd
himſelf to Luxury and Diſſoluteneſs of
Manners: He alſo diſappointed the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
being unable to perform his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;
for he had not thoſe vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
which he boaſted himſelf to be
Maſter of, and the Exchequer was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
by the late Profuſions of <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi>
The Soldiers were in great Wrath
to be thus bubbl'd; and the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
how they were affected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
alſo to ſlight and deſpiſe him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they would revile him as he
paſs'd along, and upbraid him with his
Debaucheries, and in the Publick Cirque,
where there is the greateſt Concourſe of
People, reproach'd him openly, and
call'd upon <hi>Niger</hi> to deliver the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire from ſo infamous a Governor,
and to undertake the Adminiſtration of
it himſelf.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Niger</hi> had been Conſul hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and was at this time Governor of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94482:54"/>
                  <hi>Syria,</hi> which is a Place of the greateſt
Truſt and Honour in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
for the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and all the
Country as far as <hi>Euphrates,</hi> is under his
Government. He was paſt the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
of his Age, and by his Conduct in
ſeveral Actions and Expeditions had
gain'd the Reputation of Gentleneſs, and
Dexterity in Affairs. He was a great
Imitator of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> whoſe Life he
made the Standard of his own: This
made him a powerful Intereſt amongſt
the People, inſomuch that in all their
Aſſemblies they repeated their Clamours
and Demands of him to be their Prince,
loading <hi>Julian</hi> with Reproaches to his
Face, and at the ſame time extolling
<hi>Niger,</hi> tho' he was abſent, with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Demonſtrations of Good-will and
Affection.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Niger</hi> was advertis'd how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
the People were for him, which
they had declar'd by their conſtant Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Proceedings in their Aſſemblies,
he began to flatter himſelf that he had
a very fair Proſpect, and that it was in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94482:55"/>
his own Power to make the Iſſue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to it; eſpecially when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
how <hi>Julian</hi> was ſlighted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded
by the Soldiers, whoſe Creature
he was, becauſe he had not kept Touch
in the Payment of the Money accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Contract; as alſo how much
he was deſpis'd by the People, who
eſteem'd him unworthy of the Empire,
which he had ſo diſhonourably pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd.
Upon theſe Encouragements
he began to entertain Hopes of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
himſelf to the Empire. And, in
the firſt place, he ſent for certain Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,
with other principal Officers and
Commanders of Note, with whom he
diſcours'd this Matter, giving them to
underſtand in what Poſture Affairs were
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards ſent them home
one after another, with Deſign that
theſe Rumours ſhould by this Means
be diſpers'd far and near over all the
Eaſtern Countries; for he thought more
Men would favour and adhere to him
in this Enterprize, if they were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that he was not prompted by his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94482:55"/>
Ambition to invade the Empire, but
was call'd by the <hi>Romans</hi> to their Aid
and Aſſiſtance. Upon theſe Rumours
the People came in to him in great
Numbers, importuning him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Sollicitations to take the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Authority upon him: For the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
are a capricious People, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
prone to Innovation and Change;
and <hi>Niger</hi> was a Man that was very Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular,
in regard of that uniform Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs
and Equity with which he had
govern'd them. He us'd alſo very often
to exhibit Publick Shows for their Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
the <hi>Syrians</hi> being naturally very
much delighted with theſe kinds of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments;
and in <hi>Antioch,</hi> a great and
flouriſhing City, there are Games and
Feſtivals celebrated almoſt every Day in
the Year, either in the City or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs.
By this exhibiting Publick Shows,
by ruling them with a gentle Hand, and
allowing them Leiſure and Liberty to
purſue their Recreations, he engag'd the
People entirely in his Intereſts, and was
generally belov'd and reſpected by all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94482:56"/>
Men. This <hi>Niger</hi> knew very well;
and now he iſſu'd out his Orders to the
Soldiers to appear at a Day appointed,
at which Time vaſt Numbers of other
People were aſſembled, to whom he
ſpoke as follows, from a <hi>Roſtrum</hi> erected
there for that purpoſe.</p>

                              <hi>I</hi> Suppoſe, Gentlemen, I need not inform
you of the Gentleneſs of my Nature,
and of the Conduct and Caution which I have
always us'd in undertaking Matters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
I ſhould not have detain'd you
with this Harangue, had I been led by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Inclination, Ambition, or any vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Proſpect: But now I am call'd by the
unanimous and inceſſant Clamours of the
<hi>Roman</hi> People, to aſſert the Publick Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and not to ſuffer the Empire, which
has been ſo glorious from all Antiquity, to
lie under ſuch Infamy and Diſgrace. Now,
Gentlemen, as it would be the higheſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
and Raſhneſs to attempt a Thing of
this Nature without an Occaſion offer'd; ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94482:56"/>
in my Caſe, to neglect the Cries and Petitions
of the People, would caſt upon me the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Cowardice and Treachery? And the
true Motive of this Addreſs is to know your
Sentiments, and concert with you what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be done in this Conjuncture; for 'tis
your Counſels muſt be the Meaſure of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in this Affair. The Iſſue, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
will have a good Influence upon our
Common Intereſt, and will redound to your
Benefit, as well as mine. They are not ſlight
Grounds we go upon; we are invited by the
<hi>Roman</hi> People, whom the Gods have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
to diſpoſe and adminiſter all Things
below. The Succeſſion remains unſettled, and
no Man is yet eſtabliſh'd in the Empire.
There is no Hazard in this Enterprize, as
well by reaſon of the Zeal and Affection of
our own Party, as that there are none to
oppoſe us: For all our Advices from <hi>Rome</hi>
agree, that even thoſe Soldiers that advanc'd
<hi>Julian</hi> to the Empire, are not firm to his
Intereſts, in regard he has not perform'd the
Conditions of his Advancement. I deſire you

No ſooner had he ſpoke theſe Words,
but the whole Army and People that
were there aſſembled, in the height of
their Zeal proclaim'd him Emperor, and
immediately put Purple Robes upon
him, with the other Ornaments of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
after which they conducted him
to the Temples of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and from
thence to his Houſe, carrying Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him all the way with great forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
His Houſe they did not look upon
any longer as Private, but adorn'd it on
the Out-ſide with all the Marks and
Characters of Imperial Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Niger</hi> was much delighted with the
Zeal and Affection which the People
both at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> teſtified for
him, and began to think himſelf ſecure
of the Empire. After the Report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was ſpread abroad, all the Nations
bordering upon <hi>Europe</hi> came in, to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him their Homage and Service; and
Embaſſies were ſent from all Sides to
<hi>Antioch,</hi> as to a Juſt and Lawful Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
The Nations alſo that inhabit
beyond <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> diſpatch'd
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94482:57"/>
their Envoys to him to make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations
uſual upon the Occaſion,
and to promiſe him their Succour and
Aſſiſtance in caſe his Affairs ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it. He rewarded them all very
ſplendidly, and thank'd them for the
Zeal and Affection which they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
for him, affirming, That as his
Affairs then ſtood, he had no need of
their Succour, foraſmuch as the Empire
was aſſur'd to him; and added withall,
That he would take eſpecial care that
his Reign ſhould not be defil'd with
Blood.</p>
               <p>This Security made him grow remiſs
and negligent, inſomuch that he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the People of <hi>Antioch</hi> with Shows
and Publick Games, and reſign'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
wholly to Eaſe and Pleaſure, not
marching directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> as it would
have behov'd him in the firſt place to
have done, nor certifying the <hi>Illyrian</hi>
Army of what had been tranſacted here;
whereas it ought to have been his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Effort to gain ſo conſiderable a
Party over to his Intereſt: But he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94482:58"/>
that they would not diſſent to
what the <hi>Roman</hi> People and the Eaſtern
Army had ſo unanimouſly approv'd.
Whilſt he was lift up in this manner by
groundleſs Hopes, and falſe Eſtimates of
Things, the Fame of what had hapned
reach'd <hi>Pannonia</hi> and <hi>Illyria,</hi> and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
that lay encamp'd upon the <hi>Iſter</hi>
and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to reſtrain the Inroads of
the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and to cover the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> was at this time General of
the <hi>Pannonian</hi> Forces; for they were all
under one Commander. He was by
Nation an <hi>African,</hi> a hot and violent
Spirit, that had been inur'd to Toils
and Hardſhips, and was indefatigable in
Labour, quick too at inventing, and
ready in executing what he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd.
Upon Intelligence that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
lay expos'd to any Perſon that had
Courage to ſeize upon it, he contemn'd
the Pretenders <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Niger,</hi> the one
becauſe he had neither Power nor
Strength to effect any thing; the other,
becauſe he did not make uſe of what he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94482:58"/>
had His Confidence was alſo heighten'd
by Dreams, Oracles, and Predictions,
which are then the moſt believ'd when
they are made good by the Event.
Moſt of theſe he has recorded in the
Hiſtory of his Life, and preſerv'd in
Statuary Repreſentations. The laſt,
being that which made the ſtrongeſt
Impreſſions upon him, and gave him
the greateſt Aſſurances, ought not to
be paſs'd over in ſilence.</p>
               <p>When the News came to <hi>Severus</hi> that
<hi>Pertinax</hi> was elected Emperor, after he
had ſacrific'd, and taken the Oaths of
Allegiance to him, he return'd home,
and fell aſleep, and was preſented with
this Viſionary Scene; He ſaw a ſtately
Horſe adorn'd with Imperial Accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
bearing <hi>Pertinax</hi> on his Back
through the City, along the Sacred Way
but when he came to the Entrance of
the <hi>Forum,</hi> where the Aſſemblies of the
People were held whilſt the Government
continued under the form of a Popular
State, he began to flounce and caper
till he had thrown him to the Ground,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94482:59"/>
and immediately making his Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Severus,</hi> receiv'd him upon his
Back, and carried him very quietly into
the middle of the <hi>Forum,</hi> where he ſtood
aloft, and commanded the Eyes and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of the Multitude. This Viſion
is yet to be ſeen in the very ſame place,
repreſented in a large Statue of Braſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> having his Hopes rais'd to
this Pitch, and flattering himſelf into
an Opinion that the Gods had made
choice of him to govern the Empire,
reſolv'd to try the Inclinations of the
Soldiers; and to this end call'd to him
certain Tribunes, and other Officers of
principal Note, with theſe he enter'd
into Diſcourſes concerning the preſent
State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to them how the Sovereign Power
was proſtituted to all Perſons that durſt
uſurp it, and that none appeared worthy
or able to execute ſo high and important
a Truſt: He would alſo take occaſion
to inveigh againſt the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers,
for the having violated their Military
Oath, by ſpilling the Blood of their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94482:59"/>
Emperour; adding, That ſo heinous a
Crime ſhou'd be aton'd for, and that
<hi>Pertinax</hi>'s Death ought to be reveng'd:
He knew very well they honour'd his
Memory, in regard of the many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
they had obtain'd under his
Command againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> in the
Reign of <hi>Marcus;</hi> and when he was
Governour of <hi>Illyria,</hi> he had given many
eminent Proofs of his Bravery and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
in ſeveral Engagements, and had
practis'd an uniform Gentleneſs, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
and Juſtice towards his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the whole Tenor of his Publick
Actions in that Station; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
they had a peculiar Veneration for
his Memory, and reſented very highly
that inhuman Butchery committed upon
his Perſon. In ſhort, he made ſo good
uſe of this Occaſion, that he eaſily led
and manag'd them as he pleas'd, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
ſtill to move on a far different
Spring from what he did; that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was what he neither thought of,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or affected, and that the utmoſt of
his Ambition was to revenge the Death
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94482:60"/>
of ſo great a Prince. Theſe artificial
Colours eaſily impos'd on the People,
for the Natives of this Country as they
are Tall of Stature, of a ſtrong Make
of Body, and fit for Service and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo they are generally very Stupid,
and ſlow of Apprehenſion, which is the
reaſon that they very rarely ſuſpect any
thing of Colluſion or Intrigue in any thing
you either ſay or do. So when <hi>Severus</hi>
declar'd that his Intention was only to do
Juſtice on the Murtherers of <hi>Pertinax,</hi>
they all ſo unanimouſly eſpous'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
that they inſtantly proclaim'd
him Emperor, and put the Sovereign
Power into his Hands.</p>
               <p>Having thus diſcover'd the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Pannonian</hi> Soldiers, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
made his Court to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations, and to the Praefects
of the Northern Provinces, whom he
eaſily allur'd by fair Promiſes; for no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Man in the World made profeſſions of
Kindneſs and Friendſhip with more Art
and Addreſs than <hi>Severus:</hi> He was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Man of nice Conſcience, but wou'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94482:60"/>
lye and falſifie without ſcruple to ſerve
a Turn, and wou'd even ſtretch an Oath
if his Affairs requir'd it: His Words being
always different, and often oppoſite to his
Intention. And now having ſecur'd to
himſelf all <hi>Illyria,</hi> and the Praefects of the
neighbouring Provinces, he rais'd vaſt
numbers of Soldiers from all Parts, and
took upon himſelf the Name of <hi>Pertinax,</hi>
which he thought would be acceptable
both to the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> after
which, having order'd them to rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
in a certain place, he ſpoke to them
as follows, from a Throne there erected.</p>

Piety to the Gods, by whom you

Heads, by the Abhorrence you've expreſt of this
barbarous and unnatural Treaſon committed by
the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers, a Band of Wretches
corrupted by Peace, and unſerviceable in
War, and much fitter to adorn a Triumph
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94482:61"/>
than to obtain a Victory; and ſo juſt are
your Reſentments on this Occaſion, that I
cannot but comply with what you deſire; nor
do I doubt of Succeſs in an Enterprize
which you all fall into with ſo much Zeal
and Chearfulneſs, tho' before this time I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
durſt conceive a Hope of atchieving ſo
great a Work, There is none I believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you, but will render a Teſtimony to
the Loyalty of my Principles; but at this
time the Honour of the Empire is concern'd,
which ought to be aſſerted from the Scandal
and Infamy it now lies under. Our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
had always eſpecial Care of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,
that it might be free from all
Abuſes and Corruptions tending to its Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and then we commanded Reſpect and
Reverence from all the Nations around us,
even in the Reign of <hi>Commodus,</hi> tho'
the Publick might ſuffer through the Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertencies
of his Youth, yet the Memory of
his Father, and his own high Birth, gave a
Coak and Varniſh to thoſe Errors, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Review of his Actions, we ſhall find that
they ought rather to move our Compaſſion
than our Hatred; for he is not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94482:61"/>
the Author of what was done then,
but his Flatterers and Counſellors that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
and aſſiſted him in all his unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Proceedings. And when <hi>Pertinax,</hi>
whoſe Worth and Virtue you all remember,
was elected Emperor, they were ſtill unquiet,
grew inſolent and factious, nor would any
thing ſatisfie them till they had remov'd that
excellent Prince by an inhumane Violence
acted upon his Perſon. And now <hi>Julian,</hi>
that has purchas'd the Empire by an infamous
Bargain and Sale, is hated (as you hear)
by the People, and not ſupported by the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
with whom he has violated his Faith
and Honour; and tho' they ſhould adhere
to him, yet neither are they equal to us in
Number, nor in the perſonal Bravery of
their Men. You are Veterane Soldiers, train'd
up in a Courſe of Military Actions; you
have repreſs'd the Inſults of Barbarous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
are inur'd to the Hardſhips of War, have
born the Extremities of Heat and Cold, have
march'd over frozen Rivers, drunk Puddle-Water,
chas'd wild Beaſts; and I muſt ſay
this in your Commendation, I don't believe
that there are this Day in the World Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94482:62"/>
that are able to ſtand againſt you: For 'tis
Labour is the Teſt of a good Soldier, and not
Pleaſure, with which they are ſo ſoften'd and
emaſculated, that even your Warlike Shouts
will ſhock their Courages, and ſcare them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Submiſſion. And as for the <hi>Syrian</hi>
Faction, if any among you apprehend any thing
from that ſide, tis evident in how weak a
Condition they are, and to what a low Ebb
their Hopes are ſunk, becauſe they keep
themſelves within their own Country, and
dare not ſo much as enter into Debate
whether or no they ſhall march to <hi>Rome,</hi>
but content themſelves to live at large
during the Confuſion and Licence of an
unſettled Government; and its well known,
that tis the Talent of the <hi>Syrians</hi> to rally
with a <hi>bon grace,</hi> and that they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
better Drolls than Soldiers. Thoſe that
live in <hi>Antioch</hi> are they which appear the
moſt Zealous for <hi>Niger.</hi> The other Cities
and Provinces do declare for him at preſent,
becauſe no other Pretender appears that is
worthy of the Empire, or is able to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
it with Prudence and Reſolution: But if
they be advertis'd that the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Army

have ſet up a Competitor, and ſhall hear my
Name, which is very well known amongſt
them ſince I govern'd in thoſe Parts, believe
me, Gentlemen, they are too well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with my Courage and Conduct to deſpiſe
either: Nor will they be willing to ſuſtain
the force of your Arms, or the vigour of
your Attacks, being ſo much inferiour to you
in Stature of Body, and military Diſcipline.
In fine, my Advice is to march directly to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and poſſeſs our ſelves of the City

and Divine Prediction to ſupport us in this

               <p>The Soldiers ſignify'd their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of this Speech, in loud Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of Joy, calling <hi>Severus Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi>
and <hi>Pertinax,</hi> with all the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of an extraordinary Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Zeal for him. <hi>Severus</hi> gave
them not time for their Affections to
cool, but inſtantly commanded them to
put themſelves in readineſs, and to
march directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> diſtributing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94482:63"/>
Victuals to them, with all other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Neceſſaries for a March. This
Expedition he perform'd with incredible
Swiftneſs, not ſo much as halting at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Place, unleſs it was to let the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
take breath, that were fatigu'd with
conſtant marching. He himſelf ſhar'd
the Toil of the Journey, lying always
in an ordinary Tent, and living upon
the ſame courſe Fare that ſerv'd the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Soldiers, without any thing of the
Luxury of Courts, or the Delicacy of
Kings. This confirm'd to him the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
of the Soldiers; for when
they ſaw him undergo the ſame Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
or rather greater than they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent,
they could not but reverence
him, and were upon the vie amongſt
themſelves who ſhould appear the moſt
ready to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>After he had march'd through <hi>Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and was come to the Mountains
of <hi>Italy,</hi> preventing all Intelligence of
his Approach by the ſwiftneſs of his
March, he appear'd in <hi>Italy</hi> before it
was known that he was upon his Way.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94482:63"/>
This ſudden deſcent of ſo puiſſant an
Army, put the Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> into a
terrible Conſternation; for the People
of this Country having been long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd
to the Tumults and Alarms of
War, had apply'd themſelves to the
Tillage of the Ground, and other Arts
of Peace. Indeed while the <hi>Roman</hi>
Government remained under the Form
of a Democracy, and the Senate grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Commiſſions to their Generals, the
<hi>Italians</hi> were always in Arms, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conquer'd the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
gain'd an entire Sovereignty of
Land and Sea. Nor was there any
Country or Climate in Earth or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
whither the <hi>Romans</hi> had not exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their Conqueſts. But when <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
became Emperor, he diſarm'd them, and
put an End to their Toils, and committed
the Guard and Defence of the Empire to
Mercenary Forces, which he maintain'd
in the nature of a Standing Army, to
be a Wall and Barrier to his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which were alſo naturally fortify'd
by great Rivers, deep Ditches, crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94482:64"/>
Mountains, vaſt and unpaſſable
Deſarts.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons the Approach of
<hi>Severus</hi> with ſo formidable an Army,
being a thing ſo unuſual, put the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into a terrible Confuſion, for they
were unable to oppoſe or give him any
Diverſion, and therefore they went out
to meet him with Branches of Laurel,
and receiv'd him with open Gates; he
ſtay'd no longer with them than till he
had ſacrific'd, and harangu'd the People,
and then proceeded on his March to
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julian</hi> was in great Conſternation
upon the Intelligence which he receiv'd
of the Progreſs of <hi>Severus,</hi> and of the
Strength and Number of the <hi>Illyrian</hi>
Army; he knew that he was univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hated by the People, and could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
no great Confidence in the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
with whom he had apparently
broken his Promiſe: however he amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
what Money he could, part whereof
was his own, part he borrow'd of his
Friends, beſides what he had got by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94482:64"/>
pillaging Temples, and other Publick
Places; and diſtributed it among the
Soldiers to retrieve his Credit and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
with them; but they, though they
receiv'd very conſiderable Summs,
thought themſelves under no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

as free Gifts, but as payments of juſt
Debts.</p>

having added to thoſe other Bounties

to betake themſelves to their Arms

for State and Parade, he endeavoured
to manage, and make fit for Service,
ſuppoſing that the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Men and
Horſes wou'd be terrify'd by the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
Size, and uncouth Shape of theſe
Beaſts, the like to which they had
never ſeen; and all the City was buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in making Arms and Engines of
War.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Julian</hi>'s Soldiers were thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in making themſelves ready for
the Battle, the News came that <hi>Severus</hi>
was upon them; for he had detach'd
a great part of his Army, with orders
to convey themſelves into the City ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
in ſmall unobſerv'd Parties, which
they did at Night, entring by different
Ways, and concealing their Arms under
the Habit of Country Peaſants; and
now the Enemy was in the Heart of
the City before <hi>Julian</hi> was aware, or
knew any thing of the Matter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the People, fearing the Power of
<hi>Severus,</hi> immediately fell in with that
Faction, and declar'd for him, vilifying
and reproaching <hi>Niger</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94482:66"/>
firſt for his Lazyneſs, and the latter for
his Cowardice, and extolling in the
mean time <hi>Severus</hi> to the Skies, who
was then advancing towards the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julian</hi> at this time being irreſolute,
and uncertain what Counſels to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
call'd a Senate, and ſent Letters to
<hi>Severus,</hi> wherein he made Overtures of
a Treaty to him, and offered him a
Partnerſhip of the Empire. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
readily concurred with him in this
Propoſal; but when they ſaw him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to this height of Deſpair, made
a general Defection to <hi>Severus;</hi> and
within two or three Days after, when
the Report of his Arrival was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
diſowned his Authority, and
were conven'd by Order of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,
to whom the Adminiſtration of
Affairs is committed while the Supreme
Power is under Conteſt. Being thus
aſſembled, they enter'd into Debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Meaſures to be taken in this
Conjuncture. <hi>Julian</hi> ſtill remaining in
the Imperial Palace, bewailing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Cataſtrophe of his Fortune, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94482:67"/>
requeſting that he might renounce his
Claim to the Empire, and render up
his Power and Authority to <hi>Severus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the Senate underſtood that
he was in this Conſternation, and that
his Guards had all deſerted him for fear
of <hi>Severus,</hi> they determin'd to put him
to Death, and to declare <hi>Severus</hi> ſole
Emperor, and inſtantly order'd an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy
to <hi>Severus,</hi> compos'd of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Magiſtrates, and ſuch as were of
the greateſt Conſideration in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
to make a Tender of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Honours to him, and at the ſame
time commiſſion'd a certain Tribune
to diſpatch <hi>Julian,</hi> (that miſerable
Wretch that by his Money had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
his Ruin.) He found him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
and abandon'd by all Men, and
executed his Warrant upon him; his
Deportment in this laſt Scene arguing
the ſame Meanneſs of Spirit which he
had diſcovered in the whole Courſe of his
former Life. After <hi>Severus</hi> was inform'd
of the Proceedings of the Senate, and of
the Death of <hi>Julian,</hi> he began to have
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94482:67"/>
greater Matters in view, and made uſe
of this Stratagem to get all thoſe into
his Power that were concern'd in the
Murder of <hi>Pertinax.</hi> He ſent Letters
to the Tribunes, and other Principal
Officers, importing, that they ſhould
perſwade the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to all his Commands; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
them great Rewards, provided
they ſhould effect what he had given
them in Charge. Afterwards he put
out an Edict, commanding the Soldiers
to leave their Arms in the Camp, and
to march out attir'd (as they were
wont to be when they attended the
Emperor at a Sacrifice or Feſtival)
and to take the Oaths of Fidelity to
him, as if they were to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
in the Poſt they were then in.
They eaſily believ'd all this, and were
prevail'd upon by their Officers to
leave their Arms according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Edict, and march'd out with
Branches of Laurel, in the Habits
which they appear in only at Publick
Solemnities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:94482:68"/>
After they were arriv'd at <hi>Severus</hi>'s
Camp, he commanded them to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Field, as if he had deſign'd
only ſome Civilities to them upon the
Interview: They obey'd; and as ſoon
as they ſaw him aſcend the Bench of
State, they all broke out into Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Joy; and that very Moment
the Signal being given, were all made
Priſoners. For <hi>Severus</hi> had order'd his
Soldiers, as ſoon as their Eyes were fix'd
upon him, and their Minds were in
ſuſpence and amuzement, to ſurround
them in Martial manner, but not to
wound or ſtrike any of them, but only
to keep them hemm'd in, and mount
their Spears and preſent their Javelins to
them, that being few, and without Arms,
they might not attempt any Oppoſition,
for fear of being wounded. When they
were thus encompaſs'd, in a loud Voice,
and full of Wrath and Anger, he ſpoke
to them as follows.</p>

                           <p>GEntlemen, I ſuppoſe you find by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that we are ſuperior to you
as well in Conduct, as in the Strength and
Number of our Forces. You are all reduc'd
here, and made our Priſoners, without ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Blow. 'Tis in my Power to do with
you what I think fit, and, if I pleaſe, to
ſacrifice you to my preſent Reſentment. If
I ſhould endeavour to proportion a Reward
to the Greatneſs of your Villainy, 'twould
be in vain; for your Crime exceeds all
Meaſures and Degrees of Puniſhment.
You have baſely murther'd a good and
gracious Prince, whom you ought to have
guarded and defended. And whereas our
Anceſtors in the Choice of Emperors were
chiefly moved by Highneſs of Birth, and the
excellent Qualities of the Pretenders, you have
baſely and infamouſly barter'd the Empire
for Gold, as if it had been your own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty:
And moreover, when you had ſet up
an Emperor, you durſt not protect him, but
by a ſingular Inſtance of perfidious Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94482:69"/>
betray'd and abandon'd him. For theſe
Crimes you are worthy of a thouſand Deaths,
would I inflict a Puniſhment equal to the
Heinouſneſs of your Guilt: This is what in
Juſtice you ought to ſuffer. I will pardon
you ſo far, as not to imitate your own
Cruelty; but it is neither juſt nor fit that
after you have thus manifeſtly broken your
Oath, and defil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of your Emperor and Fellow-Citizen; after
you have violated your Faith, and betray'd
this your Truſt, that you ſhould yet guard
the Body of your Prince. Your Lives and
Liberties you ſhall owe to my Clemency;
but I ſhall command theſe my Soldiers to
ſtrip you of all your Military Equipage,
and to ſend you away naked. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I command you all to depart this City,
and from henceforward do make it Capital
for any of you to appear within a hundred
Miles of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>As ſoon as theſe Orders were given,
the <hi>Illyrians</hi> immediately flew upon them,
and plunder'd them of their Bagonets,
which were curiouſly adorn'd with Gold
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94482:69"/>
and Silver, and made only to be worn in
Solemn Pomps and Proceſſions; tore off
their Belts, Coats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all their other
Military Equipage, and ſent them away
naked. They were forc'd to ſubmit,
being caught and over-reach'd by this
Politick Fetch of <hi>Severus:</hi> For what
could a few naked Men do againſt a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and well appointed Army? They
march'd off bewailing their hard Fortune,
but were pleas'd however that they had
eſcap'd with their Lives, nothing regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them ſo much as that they ſhould
be thus ſhamefully decoy'd and caught
by parting ſo eaſily with their Arms.
<hi>Severus</hi> made uſe of another Stratagem;
for he was afraid that being thus ſtripp'd,
they might grow deſperate, and return
to their Camp, and ſo rally again.
Therefore he detach'd ſome of the beſt
of his Troops, commanding them to
march by ſecret Ways, and poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of their Camp, while it lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and unguarded, and ſecure their
Arms, that in caſe they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to re-enter, they might be able
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94482:70"/>
to repulſe them. This was the End of
the Murderers of <hi>Pertinax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus,</hi> with the Remainder of his
Army rang'd in Order of Battel, march'd
directly to <hi>Rome.</hi> This ſtruck Terror
into the <hi>Roman</hi> People, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
his bold and fortunate Exploits.
The People and Senate went out to
meet him, with Branches of Laurel,
being the firſt of Emperors or Men that
had accompliſh'd ſo great a Work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhedding a Drop of Blood, or ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſo much as a Stroke. He had
many excellent Qualities, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Veneration and Reſpect: Of
this Number were his Sagacity, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
Induſtry, his Aſſurance and
Courage in embarking in great Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
After the People had receiv'd
him with Acclamations of Joy, and the
Senate had complemented him at the
Gates of the City, he repair'd to the
Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> where he ſacrific'd,
as he did alſo at the other Temples, in
conformity to the Cuſtom; and from
thence he retir'd to the Imperial Palace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:94482:70"/>
The next Day he appear'd in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
where he ſpoke to them with a
great deal of Mildneſs and Temper,
giving them great Aſſurances of future
Bleſſings. He treated all Men in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and Private with an obliging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
declaring, that the Intent of his
Coming was to revenge the Death of
<hi>Pertinax,</hi> and eſtabliſh an <hi>Ariſtocracy;</hi>
that no Man's Life ſhould be taken
away, nor any Man's Goods confiſcated,
without Legal Trial; that he would
not give Ear to Informers; that he would
make it his principal Study and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that his Subjects might be Happy
under his Government; that he would
govern by the ſame Meaſures that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
had rul'd by before him; that he
would not only aſſume the Name of
<hi>Pertinax,</hi> but that he would alſo imitate
his excellent Qualities. Theſe and the
like Profeſſions, won to him the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Confidence of the People: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſome of the Old Men that were
acquainted with his Temper, inform'd
them ſecretly, that he was an old pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94482:71"/>
Hypocrite, that he manag'd all
Things by Art and Intrigue, that he
would lie, falſifie, diſſemble, do any
thing in the World to ſerve an Intereſt;
all which they found to be true after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by Experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> made only a ſhort Stay in
<hi>Rome,</hi> during which he gave a large
Dole to the People, and Donatives to
the Soldiers: Out of theſe he choſe ſuch
as had ſignaliz'd their Bravery above the
reſt, to guard the Empire, in the Room
of thoſe that had been caſhier'd; and
then prepar'd for his Expedition into
the Eaſt; for <hi>Niger,</hi> thoughtleſs and
undeſigning, lay ſtill in <hi>Antioch,</hi> diſſolv'd
in Luxury and Pleaſure; and <hi>Severus</hi>
intended to ſurpriſe him, before he had
Intelligence of his Coming, or could
put himſelf in Condition to oppoſe
him. So he iſſu'd out Orders to the
Soldiers to be in a readineſs to march
upon the ſhorteſt warning; he drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
his Army from all Parts, made
new Levies in <hi>Italy,</hi> and commanded
that Part of the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Army which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94482:71"/>
was left, to joyn him in <hi>Thrace;</hi> he
alſo equipp'd a Navy, and mann'd
out all the <hi>Italian</hi> Ships that were fit for
Service; and theſe mighty Levies, as
well for Sea as Land, were compleated
in a ſhort time: For he knew he ſhould
have Occaſion for a very formidable
Force, to reduce all that Continent which
lies oppoſite to <hi>Europe,</hi> which univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adher'd to <hi>Niger.</hi> Theſe were the
Preparations he made for the War.</p>
               <p>But being a Man of great Wiſdom
and Foreſight, he was jealous of the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Forces, which were very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and conſiſted of gallant Men:
They were under the Command of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,</hi>
a Man nobly deſcended, and one
that had liv'd from his Youth in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and Plenty. <hi>Severus</hi> therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
by a Strain of Court-Skill to gain
this Man over to him; for he fear'd leſt
having ſo many Incentives to Ambition
and Deſire of Rule, (as his Wealth, his
Birth, the Strength of his Army, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with the <hi>Romans</hi>) he might be
induc'd to ſeize upon the Empire, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94482:72"/>
ſurprize <hi>Rome,</hi> which is not far from
<hi>Britain,</hi> while he was engag'd in a War
in the Eaſt. He thought the beſt Way to
allure him, was by a ſhew of Honour and
Deference; for he was at all times very
weak and and open to the Practices of
deſigning Men, and now readily believ'd
<hi>Severus</hi>'s Promiſes, which he enforc'd
with Oaths, and all the Solemnity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
He therefore declar'd him his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue,
anticipating his Ambition, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
him a Share in the Empire, and ſent
him Letters full of Profeſſions of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Amity, and entreated him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himſelf to the Adminiſtration of the
Empire; adding, that the Publick Affairs
requir'd a Man that was nobly deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and in the Flower of his Age; that
he was very old, and afflicted with the
Gout; that his Children were young,
and unfit for Buſineſs, <hi>&amp;c. Albinus</hi> was
eaſie of belief, and readily catch'd at
the Propoſal, being highly ſatisfied to
have attain'd the Ends of his Ambition
without any Hazard or Trouble in the
attaining.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:94482:72"/>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> acquainted the Senate with
his Intention; and that he might ſatisfie
them and the World of his Sincerity, he
commanded Moneys to be ſtamp'd with
<hi>Albinus</hi>'s Image, and order'd his Statues
to be erected, and all other Imperial Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to be paid to him: And after he
had made all Things ſecure on that Side,
by his politick Management of <hi>Albinus,</hi>
and had freed himſelf from the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of a Diverſion from <hi>Britain,</hi>
and the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Armies were united, and
he had order'd all Things at home as he
thought moſt convenient in the preſent
Conjuncture, he advanc'd with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
againſt <hi>Niger.</hi> Now, as for the
Halts he made in his March, his Speeches
in the Towns which he paſs'd through,
the Signs which appear'd from Heaven,
the Countries through which he march'd,
his Engagements, the Number of the
Slain on both Sides, theſe you will find
related with more accuracy by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians

the ſingle Life of <hi>Severus.</hi> But I have

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94482:73"/>
all the remarkable Occurrences
which have hapned within my Memory
and Obſervation, under divers Reigns, in
the whole Courſe of 70 Years. The
principal therefore, and moſt memorable
of <hi>Severus</hi>'s Atchievements, we ſhall relate
in the Proſecution of this Hiſtory, not
extolling any thing out of favour or
devotion to a Party, as the Writers of
that Age have done; nor omitting any
thing that is worthy to be recorded.</p>

Preparations he can to oppoſe him. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>

againſt <hi>Niger,</hi> is finiſh'd in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

unexpected News, that <hi>Severus</hi> had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
<hi>Rome,</hi> and was declar'd Emperor
by the Senate, and that he was advancing
againſt him with the whole <hi>Illyrian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and with other mighty Forces, both
by Sea and Land, he was in a terrible
Conſternation, and immediately iſſu'd
out Orders to the <hi>Praefects</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
to take all poſſible Precautions
for the blocking up all the Ports and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and ſent to the Kings of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi>
and <hi>Armenia,</hi> and to the King of the
<hi>Atrenians,</hi> to demand Succours. The
<hi>Armenians</hi> return'd Anſwer, that they
would not eſpouſe any Party, but would
content themſelves to defend their own
Territories. The <hi>Parthian</hi> promis'd to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94482:75"/>
give out Commiſſions to his Peers to
levy Forces, which is their Method,
when the Neceſſity of their Affairs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to raiſe an Army; for they
don't maintain any Standing Force in
conſtant Pay. The <hi>Atrenians</hi> ſent ſome
Companies of Archers to their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
by order of their King <hi>Barſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius.</hi>
The reſt of his Army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of the Soldiers that were under
his Command, and of the Citizens of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> great Numbers of which being
puſh'd on by their natural Levity, and
Zeal for <hi>Niger,</hi> liſted themſelves in his
Service, rather raſhly, than upon due
Conſideration of the preſent Juncture of
Affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Niger</hi> alſo commanded the Streights
of the <hi>Taurus</hi> to be block'd up with a
ſtrong Wall and Fortification, ſuppoſing
that the impaſſable Craggineſs of this
Mountain would be an impregnable
Screen and Bulwark to the Eaſtern
Countries. This <hi>Taurus</hi> lies between
<hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and divides the
Northern from the Eaſtern Nations.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94482:75"/>
He detach'd alſo part of his Army to
take in <hi>Byzantium,</hi> the greateſt and moſt
flouriſhing City of <hi>Thrace,</hi> by reaſon of
the Wealth as well as Number of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants:
It is ſituated upon the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Fret of the <hi>Propontis,</hi> and has conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Revenues from the Sea, ariſing out
of Impoſts, and the Fiſhing Trade:
Her Poſſeſſions alſo at Land are of large
extent, and fertile Soil; ſo, in ſhort,
both Elements pay her Tribute, and
conſpire to make her rich. This City
<hi>Niger</hi> had a great mind to be Maſter
of, in regard it was the ſtrongeſt Town
in thoſe Parts, and he ſuppos'd would
give him an abſolute Command of
the Narrow Sea through which all
Ships paſs out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Aſia.</hi> This
City is encompaſs'd with a ſtrong Wall,

which <hi>Niger</hi> took, very wiſely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently,
as he thought.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Severus</hi> with haſty
Marches advanc'd with his Army, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
halting or reſting; and hearing that
the Enemies had poſſeſs'd themſelves of
<hi>Byzantium,</hi> and knowing that that City
was ſtrongly fortified, he march'd to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zicum;</hi>
of which <hi>Aemilian</hi> being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd,
whom <hi>Niger</hi> had intruſted with
the higheſt Command, and in truth with
the whole Conduct of the War, he
march'd alſo to <hi>Cyzicum</hi> with his whole
Army, compos'd of his own Levies,
and the Soldiers which <hi>Niger</hi> had ſent
him. When they were come together,
after divers ſharp Engagements, <hi>Severus</hi>
obtain'd an intire Victory, <hi>Niger</hi>'s Army
being routed and put to Flight. By this
Succeſs the <hi>Illyrians</hi> were fluſh'd and took
Courage; but the Hopes of <hi>Niger</hi>'s
Army began ſenſibly to ſink and abate.</p>
               <p>But ſome ſay <hi>Niger</hi> was betray'd by
<hi>Aemilian</hi> from the beginning, and aſſign
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94482:76"/>
two Reaſons for this his Treachery:
The firſt, That <hi>Niger</hi> was malign'd by
<hi>Aemilian</hi> upon his Promotion to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
in regard he had been his Succeſſor
in the Government of <hi>Syria,</hi> who was
now to be his Lord and Sovereign.
Others ſay, he was mov'd to it by the
Prayers of his Children, beſeeching him
by Letters to have regard to their Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Theſe Children were arreſted in
<hi>Rome,</hi> and then held in Cuſtody by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi>
which was a very uſeful Project,
and a piece of Policy that had been
practis'd by <hi>Commodus,</hi> who us'd always
to retain the Children of ſuch Men as
were ſent to govern in diſtant Provinces,
as Hoſtages for their Father's Loyalty.
<hi>Severus</hi> knew this very well, and as ſoon
as he was proclaim'd Emperor, while
<hi>Julian</hi> was yet alive, he ſent certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to ſteal his Children out of <hi>Rome,</hi>
to prevent their falling into other Hands;
and as ſoon as he enter'd <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeiz'd
upon all the Children of ſuch Men as
had Commands or were in Authority
in the Eaſt, or in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and at that time
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94482:77"/>
detain'd them in Cuſtody, hoping that
the Ties of Nature would cancel thoſe
of Loyalty, and that their Tenderneſs
to their Iſſue would make them Traitors
to their Prince; or, in caſe they ſhould
perſiſt in the Intereſts they had eſpous'd,
he might have it in his Power to puniſh
the Obſtinacy of the Fathers, by his
Cruelty to their Children.</p>
               <p>After the Defeat at <hi>Cyzicum, Niger</hi>'s
Soldiers fled in great haſte, ſome to the
Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> others through
<hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> to the Mountain <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
to get within the Fortifications. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>'s
Army march'd through the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> into <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and the
adjacent Countries.</p>
               <p>After the Report of <hi>Severus</hi>'s Victory
was ſpread abroad, preſently in theſe
Parts Feuds and inteſtine Diviſions broke
out in divers Cities; not ſo much out of
Hatred or Affection to either of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
engag'd in the War, as out of a
Spirit of Envy, Animoſity, and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then very powerful amongſt them.
This was the old Diſtemper of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94482:77"/>
                  <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were always torn into jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Factions, and ſtill levelling at that
Head, that had arriv'd to any uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Eminency amongſt them; and by
this Means they utterly unhing'd and
deſtroy'd the <hi>Graecian</hi> Government. And
being thus inveterate and imbitter'd one
againſt the other, they firſt loſt their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and afterwards
became Vaſſals to the <hi>Romans.</hi> This
Diſeaſe of Strife and Envy hath already
ſeiz'd ſome of our moſt flouriſhing Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
After the Battel of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> the
<hi>Nicomedians</hi> revolted to <hi>Severus,</hi> and ſent
an Embaſſie to him, to let him know,
that they were ready to receive his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and afford him what Aſſiſtance
they could. The <hi>Niceans,</hi> out of an
implacable. Enmity to the <hi>Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
adher'd ſtiffly to the contrary
Side, and receiv'd <hi>Niger</hi>'s Soldiers, as
well ſuch as fled thither, as thoſe that
were ſent for the Defence of <hi>Bithynia:</hi>
And ſoon after theſe Soldiers, ſallying
out of both theſe Cities, as if they had
iſſu'd out of Regular Camps, began a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94482:78"/>
fierce Engagement, which was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
on both Sides with great Vigour
and Obſtinacy; but at laſt <hi>Severus</hi> had
manifeſtly the better, and ſuch Soldiers
of <hi>Niger</hi> as ſurviv'd the Battel, fled with
great precipitation to the Streights of
the <hi>Taurus,</hi> contenting themſelves to be
upon the Defenſive, and to guard the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.
And <hi>Niger</hi> leaving ſuch a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as he thought ſufficient for the defence
of the Place, went to <hi>Antioch,</hi> to raiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits
of Men and Supplies of Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi>'s army marching through
<hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> came into <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
and ſitting down before the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
began to aſſail it. Here he
ſtruggl'd with great Difficulties, the Way
being narrow and rugged; and beſides,
he was incommoded in his Aſcent by
Stones which were thrown down upon
him, and by the gallant Reſiſtance
which the Defendents made from the
Ramparts; for upon that Advantage of
Ground, a few Men might eaſily repulſe
the Attacks of whole Battalions, the Way
being narrow, and the one Side defended
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94482:78"/>
by a high Mountain, and the other full
of Water continually rolling from a vaſt
Precipice. Beſides, <hi>Niger</hi> had block'd
up all the Avenues, and obſtructed the
Approaches of his Army on all Sides.</p>
               <p>This was the Poſture of Affairs in
<hi>Cappadocia,</hi> when the Cities of <hi>Tyre</hi> and
<hi>Laodicea,</hi> (the firſt in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> the latter
in <hi>Syria</hi>) fell deſperately at variance
with the People of <hi>Antioch</hi> and the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rythians,</hi>
being urg'd forward by an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Rancour and Envy; inſomuch
that the two former, upon a ſettled
Averſion to the latter, underſtanding
that <hi>Niger</hi> was fled, defac'd all the
Marks of Publick Honour that had been
done him, and declar'd for <hi>Severus.
Niger</hi> who was then in <hi>Antioch,</hi> being
advertis'd of this Procedure, tho' at
other Times a Man of incomparable
Temper and Mildneſs, was highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated,
and ſent immediately his
<hi>Mooriſh</hi> Darters, with a Band of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to the two Cities before-mention'd,
with peremptory Orders to put all to the
Sword, and to ſack and burn the Towns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:94482:79"/>
Theſe <hi>Moors</hi> are naturally cruel, and
inur'd by frequent Uſe to deſpiſe the
Encounters of Death and Danger; and
now falling upon the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> before
they apprehended any ſuch Matter,
made an entire Deſtruction of the City
and People; and marching from thence
to <hi>Tyre,</hi> burnt and plunder'd the Town,
and made a great Slaughter of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
               <p>While theſe Things were doing in
<hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Niger</hi> was raiſing an Army,
<hi>Severus</hi> had inveſted and was making
his Attacks upon the Fortification, his
Soldiers being very much diſheartned,
and deſpairing of Succeſs, in regard the
Fortification was not only very Strong,
and almoſt impregnable of it ſelf, but
was alſo defended by a high Precipice.
The Beſieged, in the mean time, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves ſecure and out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
When ſuddenly in the Night there
fell a prodigious Quantity of Rain and
Snow, (for the Winters in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> are
very ſevere, eſpecially upon the <hi>Taurus</hi>)
the Conſequence whereof was a ſudden
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94482:79"/>
Torrent of Water, which broke out
with great Rage and Fury, which was
encreas'd by the Fortifications, that
check'd its Courſe, and made it ſtill
more violent and outragious; till at
laſt Nature grew too powerful for Art,
and the Cement being diſſolv'd, the
Walls were unable any longer to reſiſt
the Shocks of the raging Element, which
eaſily forc'd it ſelf a Paſſage, making a
wide Breach for the Enemy to enter at;
which was the more eaſily done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Fortification was Irregular, and
thrown together without Care or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance.
As ſoon as the Beſieg'd ſaw
this, fearing leſt they ſhould be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,
and ſo made Priſoners by the
Enemy, as ſoon as the Waters were
fordable, they all abandon'd the Place,
and ſhifted for themſelves. This extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Piece of Fortune put new Life
into <hi>Severus</hi>'s Soldiers, and buoy'd them
up into a Confidence, that all they acted
was under the immediate Direction and
Conduct of Heaven; and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Enemy had forſaken the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94482:80"/>
Place and were fled, they eaſily paſs'd
the <hi>Taurus,</hi> there being none to oppoſe
them, and made an Impreſſion into <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Niger,</hi> upon Advice of what had
hapned, levy'd a mighty Army, but
without Experience, and undiſciplin'd,
and with haſty Marches advanc'd at the
Head of this Multitude, which was very
numerous, by reaſon the Youth of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
had almoſt univerſally liſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in his Service, and were ready to
hazard all Things for him, and even
equall'd the <hi>Illyrians</hi> in Forwardneſs and
Diſpoſition of Mind, but were by no
Means comparable to them in Perſonal
Bravery and Military Skill. Both the
Armies met in a Place call'd <hi>The Bay of
Iſſicum,</hi> which is a ſpacious Plain, bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on all Sides with a Chain of Hills,
in the Form of a Theater. The Shore
along the Sea is ſtretch'd a great way
up into the Continent, as if Nature
in the firſt Contrivance had deſign'd it
for a Scene of Action. Here, they ſay,
the great deciſive Battel was fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94482:80"/>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> wherein
the latter was defeated and made Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and the Men of the Eaſt routed by
thoſe of the North. Here remains yet
the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſituate upon the
Eminence, and <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Statue of
Braſs, as Monuments of this memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Victory. And as the Place of the
Battel was the ſame, ſo was the Event
alſo. In the Evening the Armies were
embattell'd one againſt the other, and
ſpent that whole Night amidſt the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Diſquiets of a ſollicitous
Fear. In the Morning, as ſoon as the
Sun roſe, each General exhorted and
animated his Soldiers, repreſenting to
them, That this was to be the deciſive
Battel, that upon the Iſſue hereof all their
Hopes depended, that the Fortune of
this Day would determine the Fate of the
Empire. But in ſhort, after they had
fought a long time with great Courage
and Reſolution on both Sides, and great
Numbers were ſlain, inſomuch that the
Rivers were not ſlightly tinctur'd, but
ſeem'd to carry a greater quantity of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94482:81"/>
Blood than Water, <hi>Niger</hi>'s Soldiers turn'd
their Backs, and fled in diſorder. The <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrians</hi>
purſuing, drove ſome of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, others they chas'd to the Tops
of the Hills, where they kill'd them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with great Numbers of Peaſants
that were drawn together out of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Cities and Villages, and had poſted
themſelves there, as in a ſecure Place, from
whence they might ſurvey the Armies,
and be Spectators of the Engagement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Niger</hi> being mounted upon a ſwift
Horſe, fled with a ſmall Party to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
where he found a very melancholy
Face of Affairs: That Remnant of the
People which was left, were about to
abandon the Place; nothing was to be
heard but an univerſal Grief, Parents
lamenting their Children, and Siſters
their Brothers. Beſides, <hi>Niger</hi> himſelf
was in the utmoſt Deſpair and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
in which Condition he fled from
<hi>Antioch,</hi> and conceal'd himſelf in a
Country-houſe not far from the City,
where he was found by certain Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that purſu'd him, and beheaded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:94482:81"/>
This was the Fate of <hi>Niger,</hi> which he
drew upon himſelf by his Slowneſs and
Inactivity, tho' otherwiſe his Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both in his Publick and Private
Capacities, was always ſpoken of with
Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> having thus diſpatch'd <hi>Niger,</hi>
cut off all his Friends and Adherents
without Mercy or Diſtinction, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
whether they were ſuch by
Choice or Neceſſity. But thoſe Soldiers
that (he heard) had paſs'd the <hi>Tygris,</hi>
and were going over to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
he endeavour'd to bring back by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of Pardon and Indemnity. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
great Numbers went over to them,
which was the true Reaſon why they
became more able from henceforward
to combate with the <hi>Romans</hi> in a Set
Battel; for formerly they never wore
compleat Armor, ſeldom us'd Sword
or Spear in the Fight, were lightly and
looſly habited, and fought with Bows
and Arrows on Horſeback, and moſt
commonly in their Flight, ſhooting back
upon the Enemy that purſu'd them:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94482:82"/>
But now they were inſtructed by theſe
<hi>Roman</hi> Refugees, amongſt which were
a great many Artizans, who choſe to
ſpend the Remainder of their Days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, not only to uſe Arms,
but alſo to make them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> having ſettled his Affairs in
the Eaſt as he thought moſt adviſable
in the preſent Conjuncture, intended to
have made a Deſcent upon <hi>Parthia,</hi> and
the Territories of the <hi>Atrenians,</hi> both
which he charg'd with the Supporting
<hi>Niger</hi> againſt him: However he relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd
this Deſign for the preſent, and
began in the firſt place to conſider of
Ways and Means to ſettle and entail
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire upon himſelf and his
Family. <hi>Niger</hi> being remov'd, he thought
<hi>Albinus</hi> was uſeleſs to him, and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd
him in the Proſecution of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;
and he had heard that the Name
of <hi>Caeſar</hi> had inſpir'd him with proud
and haughty Images, and that a great
many of the moſt eminent Men in the
Senate had ſecretly by Letter ſollicited
him to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Severus</hi> was
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94482:82"/>
abſent and employ'd abroad. And, in
truth, the whole Nobility favour'd him
more than they did <hi>Severus,</hi> becauſe he
was ſprung from Illuſtrious Anceſtors, and
had gain'd the Reputation of Gentleneſs
and Temper. <hi>Severus</hi> had Intelligence of
theſe things, but would not fall openly at
variance with him, nor proclaim a War
againſt him, being deſtitute of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
to juſtifie ſuch a Proceeding; but
reſolv'd to attempt his Life by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Ways of Fraud and Stratagem;
and ſent immediately certain Imperial
Couriers, in whom he could repoſe the
laſt Confidence, with ſecret Orders as
ſoon as they ſhould be brought into his
Preſence, to deliver the Letters to him in
Publick, and withal to entreat him to
withdraw with them, for that they had
ſomething to impart to him in private;
and as ſoon as they had drawn him from
his Guards, they ſhould fall upon him
ſuddenly, and diſpatch him. He gave
them alſo certain poyſonous Drugs, and
commanded them to try if his Cooks
or Butlers could be engag'd in an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94482:83"/>
to poiſon him. <hi>Albinus</hi> his Friends
had already entertain'd a Jealouſie of
<hi>Severus,</hi> and advis'd him to beware of
his Frauds and Stratagems. His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable
Deportment towards <hi>Niger</hi>'s
Captains, had caſt a Blemiſh upon
his Reputation; for having perſwaded
them, by means of their Children, as
is before related, to betray their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
Counſels, after he had abus'd
their Service, and compaſs'd his Ends,
he put them all to Death, both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Children; the various Folds
and Windings of his Temper diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves ſtill in his Actions.</p>
               <p>Theſe Advices made <hi>Albinus</hi> encreaſe
the Number of his Guards; and from
this Time he would not ſuffer any
Man that was ſent to him from <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
to approach his Perſon, unleſs he
firſt put off his Sword, and was ſearch'd,
for fear he ſhould conceal ſome ſecret
Weapon under his Clothes.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Couriers arriv'd at
<hi>Albinus</hi>'s Court, they deliver'd their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to him in Publick, and, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

of their Orders, deſir'd him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from the Company, becauſe they
had ſomething to communicate to him
in private. He preſently ſuſpected their
Intention, and commanded them all to
be apprehended, and upon Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Matter, diſcover'd the whole
Scheme and Courſe of the Deſign. The
Couriers receiv'd condign Puniſhment.
And now he prepar'd againſt <hi>Severus,</hi>
as againſt a declar'd Enemy. <hi>Severus</hi>
upon Advice of this Diſcovery, being
naturally hot and violent, and apt to be
tranſported with Anger, could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
his Thirſt of Revenge; but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Army together, ſpoke to them
to this purpoſe.</p>

                           <p>LET no Man, when he reflects upon
my former Actions, accuſe me of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
or of Ingratitude and Treachery, to
one whom I have treated as a Friend. I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94482:84"/>
have punctually diſcharg'd all the Duties of
Friendſhip on my part, even to the inviting
him to a Partnerſhip of my Empire, after I
had eſtabliſh'd it; which few Men are
willing to ſhare even with their own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
That Power which you lodg'd ſolely
in me, I was content to hold in common with
him. And after all theſe ſignal Obligations
laid upon him, conſider, Gentlemen, what
ungrateful Returns he makes. He levies an
Armed Force againſt us, contemns the Fame
of your Bravery, neglects the Ties of Faith
and Juſtice with reſpect to me, and being
puſh'd forward by wild Ambition, chooſes
rather to engroſs the whole Power with Toil
and Hazard, than to enjoy his Share in Safety
and Quiet; neither reverencing the Gods, by
whom he has ſo oft and ſolemnly ſworn;
nor ſparing you, after you have fought and
fatigu'd your ſelves with ſo much Courage
and Reputation for our joint Intereſt: For
he, as well as I, has a Share in the Honour
and Benefit accruing from your Victories,
which had been greater, had he not thus
openly departed from the Principles of Faith
and Honour. Now, Gentlemen, as it is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94482:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unjuſt to offer the firſt Injury, ſo it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
a Man of Honour to ſit tamely under
an Injury receiv'd, without requiring Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
The Reaſons of our War upon
<hi>Niger,</hi> were not ſo ſpecious as they were
neceſſary in that critical Juncture: He did
not invade a Power whereof we were actually
poſſeſs'd; but the Empire lying between us,
and our Pretenſions to it being the ſame, we
both ſtrove to gain it to our ſelves with an
equally warrantable Ambition. But <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
has broke through Oaths and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>liances;
and tho' he has obtain'd by my free Gift,
what other Perſons only beſtow on the Iſſue of
their own Bodies, yet, after all, he chooſes
Hoſtility before Friendſhip, and the Name
of an Enemy before that of an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
How ought I then to reſent this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour?
As I have heretofore ſtudied to
ſerve and honour him, ſo now Ill chaſtiſe
his Perfidy and Cowardice with the Sword.
His few undiſciplin'd Men will not pretend
to oppoſe the Force of your Arms: For, can
any Man imagine that an Army that has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
all the Kingdoms of the Eaſt, fluſh'd
by a Courſe of ſo many Victories, and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94482:85"/>
by almoſt the whole Power of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, will not eaſily vanquiſh a
Band of Men commanded by a diſſolute and
a cowardly General? For who is a Stranger
to the Fame of <hi>Albinus</hi>'s Luxury, and his
Way of Living, more reſembling the Brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Hog, than the Life of a Soldier?
In concluſion, let us advance againſt him with
our wonted Alacrity and Courage, relying
upon the Gods, whom he has offended by his
Perjuries, and remembring the Trophies which
we have ſo often rais'd, and he thinks fit to
deſpiſe.</p>

               <p>After he had ſpoke, his Soldiers una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
declar'd <hi>Albinus</hi> an Enemy;
and applauding <hi>Severus,</hi> expreſs'd the
Zeal of their Minds in the Alacrity of
their Acclamations. This infus'd new
Courage into <hi>Severus,</hi> and afforded him
good Ground of Confidence. He dealt
a magnificent Donative amongſt his
Soldiers, and then took his March a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Albinus,</hi> having before detach'd a
Party to reduce <hi>Byzantium.</hi> This Place
was held by <hi>Niger</hi>'s Soldiers that fled
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94482:85"/>
thither, and was afterwards taken by
Famine, and totally demoliſh'd, with
all its Theaters, Baths, and all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Ornaments of the City. It was
reduc'd into the Form of a Village, and
given to the <hi>Perinthians,</hi> as <hi>Antioch</hi> was
to the <hi>Laodiceans.</hi> He alſo ſent Money
to rebuild the Cities which <hi>Niger</hi>'s Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
had deſtroy'd, while he march'd
on with his Army without Intermiſſion,
equally regardleſs of the Celebration of
Feſtivals, and the Toils of the March;
of the moſt parching Heats, and the
moſt rigorous Cold. He would often
march bare over the higheſt Mountains,
in the midſt of Snow, in the coldeſt
Seaſon of the Year, to excite his Soldiers
to Alacrity and Patience by his own
Perſonal Deportment, that they might
be mov'd to ſurmount all Difficulties,
not ſo much by fear of Authority, as by
an Ambition to imitate the Behaviour
of their General. He ſent out alſo a
ſtrong Body to poſſeſs the Streights of
the <hi>Alps,</hi> and ſecure that important In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
into <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <hi>Albinus,</hi> who had reſign'd himſelf over
to Pleaſure and Repoſe, was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alarm'd when he heard that <hi>Severus</hi>
was ready to invade him; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
leaving <hi>Britain,</hi> embarqu'd his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for <hi>Gaul,</hi> where he encamp'd, and
iſſu'd out Orders to the <hi>Praefects</hi> of the
neighbouring Provinces to ſend in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
of Money, and other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
for his Army. Some obey'd the
Orders, and their Compliance prov'd
fatal to them afterwards. Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd,
rather by good Fortune, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Politick Reaſons, and hereby
eſcap'd the Storm that enſu'd; the Iſſue
of the War diſcovering whoſe Conduct
was the more adviſable in this Affair.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Severus</hi> had enter'd <hi>Gaul</hi> with
his Army, ſeveral ſlight Skirmiſhes paſs'd
between them; but the deciſive Action
was near <hi>Lions,</hi> a great and flouriſhing
City, where <hi>Albinus</hi> had ſhut up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſent out his Army to give <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>
Battel. The Engagement laſted
a long time, both Armies diſputing the
Point with great Obſtinacy, without any
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94482:86"/>
apparent Advantage to either. The
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Soldiers were no way inferior to
the <hi>Illyrians</hi> in Force or Courage, or
Thirſt of Blood; ſo both being gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Armies, it was no eaſie Matter to
put either of them to the Rout. Tho'
the Hiſtorians of that Age, that made
a true Report of the Matter of Fact,
without Favour or Partiality, do affirm,
that <hi>Albinus</hi> had much the better of that
Part of <hi>Severus</hi>'s Army where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in Perſon; inſomuch that he
fairly fled, and falling from his Horſe,
was forc'd to throw off his Imperial
Cloke, and owe his Safety to a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe.</p>
               <p>While the <hi>Britains</hi> were purſuing and
triumphing over their Enemies, as if
they had gain'd a compleat Victory,
<hi>Laetus, Severus</hi>'s General, appear'd with
a freſh Army; for 'twas thought that
he affected the Empire, and for that
Reaſon commanded his Soldiers to
march ſlowly, that he might preſerve
them in their full Strength and Vigour,
till he ſaw what would be the Iſſue of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94482:87"/>
the Battel, not ſo much as offering to
come up till he heard that <hi>Severus</hi> was
ſlain: And it appear'd afterwards, that
this was no ill-founded Suſpicion, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as <hi>Severus,</hi> after he had put all
Things in good Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eſtabliſh'd
the Peace and Quiet of his Empire, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nobly rewarded all his other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
but put <hi>Laetus</hi> to death; having
reſpect, as was thought, to the Treaſon
intended this Day.</p>
               <p>But theſe Things hapned long after.
<hi>Laetus</hi> at this time appearing with ſo
conſiderable a Reinforcement, retriev'd
the declining Vigour of <hi>Severus</hi>'s Men.
<hi>Severus</hi> re-mounted, and put on again
his Imperial Cloke. <hi>Albinus</hi>'s Soldiers
ſuppos'd they had intirely defeated the
Enemy, and being in great diſorder,
were unable to ſuſtain the Attacks of
theſe freſh Forces, which fell upon them
with incredible Fury, and after a ſhort
Reſiſtance put them to a precipitate
Flight. <hi>Severus</hi>'s Army purſu'd them,
making a great Slaughter of them, even
to the Gates of the City. The Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94482:87"/>
of thoſe that were kill'd and taken
on both Sides in this Engagement, is
variouſly related by the Hiſtorians of
thoſe Times.</p>
               <p>After the Victory, <hi>Severus</hi>'s Soldiers
burnt and plunder'd <hi>Lions,</hi> and having
taken <hi>Albinus,</hi> cut off his Head, and
preſented it to <hi>Severus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>thus he erected two mighty Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,
the one in the Eaſt, the other
in the North; and I doubt whether
any Thing we meet with in Story will
bear a Compariſon with his Victories
and Battels, whether you conſider the
Puiſſance of his Armies, the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Nations, the Number of his
Engagements, or the Length and Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Marches. The Battels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> between <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>
and <hi>Antony,</hi> or <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sons, were
great and memorable Actions; as alſo
were the Atchievements of <hi>Sylla</hi> and
<hi>Marius</hi> in Civil and Foreign Wars: But
for one Man to cut a Paſſage to the
Empire through three Emperors actually
inveſted in the Sovereign Dignity, to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94482:88"/>
overcome the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers by reach
of Policy, to murther an Emperor in
his own Palace, to vanquiſh another in
the Eaſt, where he had ſat at the Helm
divers Years after he was proclaim'd
in <hi>Rome;</hi> to make a third his Priſoner,
that was in actual Poſſeſſion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
is ſtill more wonderful and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary;
and you'll ſcarce find any
Thing upon Record that is able to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
the Greatneſs of the Adventure,
or the Courſe of proſperous Fortunes by
which it was atchiev'd.</p>
               <p>Thus fell <hi>Albinus,</hi> after he had enjoy'd
his fatal Dignity for a ſhort time; and
<hi>Severus</hi> ſoon pour'd out the Fury of his
Revenge upon his Adherents in <hi>Rome,</hi>
and ſent the Head of <hi>Albinus</hi> to be nail'd
publickly upon a Gibbet. He ſent alſo
Letters giving an Account of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and adding by way of Poſtſcript,
<hi>That he ſent that Head to be fix'd upon a
Gibbet, and expos'd to publick View, that
it might be a Token of his diſpleaſure, and
ſignifie how highly he was enrag'd againſt
them.</hi> And having put all Things in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94482:88"/>
order in <hi>Britain,</hi> he conſtituted two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
to take care of that Iſland, and
leaving the Affairs of <hi>Gaul</hi> in ſuch a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
as he thought moſt convenient, he
put to death all thoſe that had eſpous'd
<hi>Albinus</hi>'s Intereſt, not regarding whether
they had done it by Choice, or were
determin'd to it by Neceſſity; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcating
their Eſtates, he took his March
for <hi>Rome,</hi> drawing with him his whole
Army, that his Appearance might be
the more terrible.</p>
               <p>He perform'd his March with his
uſual Speed, and made his Entry into
<hi>Rome,</hi> his Breaſt ſtill glowing with a
malignant Heat againſt the Remainder
of <hi>Albinus</hi>'s Faction. The People bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Branches of Laurel, receiv'd him
with Acclamations of Joy, and all the
Marks of Honour and Reſpect. The
Senate too complemented him on this
Occaſion, tho' moſt of her Members
expected nothing at his Hands but
Death and Deſtruction. They knew
the implacable Cruelty of his Nature,
and upon what ſlight Occaſions he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94482:89"/>
would proceed to the moſt injurious
Rigours, tho' now he had plauſible
Reaſons to juſtifie his Indignation. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>
after he had paid a Viſit to <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Temples, and perform'd the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
cuſtomary on the Occaſion, retir'd
to his Palace, threw a Largeſs amongſt
his Soldiers, and gave a Dole to the
People on the Account of his Victory.
To the firſt of theſe he granted divers
Privileges, out of his meer Grace and
Bounty, being ſuch as they had never
before enjoy'd; he encreas'd their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances
of Corn, authoriz'd them to
wear Rings of Gold, and permitted
Women to live with them. Theſe
Things were heretofore judg'd inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the Rules of Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and that unincumber'd Freedom
and Readineſs for Action which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
in a Soldier. He was the firſt
that alter'd their courſe and wholeſom
Diet, the Conſequence whereof was a
ſenſible Decay of Force and Vigour,
and utterly deſtroying the ancient Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Authority of Generals. He
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94482:89"/>
engag'd them in diſſolute Courſes, and
taught them to love Money.</p>
               <p>After he had made theſe Alterations,
he came into the Senate, and aſcending
the Imperial Throne, broke out into a
vehement Impeachment of <hi>Albinus</hi>'s
Friends, ſome of whoſe ſecret Letters
he produc'd and laid before them, which
were thoſe he found in <hi>Albinus</hi>'s Cabinet;
others he upbraided with the curious
Preſents which they had made him;
others again he tax'd with the having
favour'd the Eaſtern Faction: So that
upon the whole Matter, he put to death
all the moſt eminent Men in the Senate,
with all ſuch as were moſt conſiderable
for Wealth or Family in the Provinces.
He pretended to act in this Affair by
the Dictates of Revenge, tho the truth
is, he was urg'd on by a more prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Paſſion, which he had for Money,
to which none of the Emperors was
ever ſo totally enſlav'd: For as in
Strength of Body, Vigour of Mind,
and Conduct of Military Affairs, he
equall'd the moſt renowned Generals;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94482:90"/>
ſo he was exceſſively covetous, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he ſought Money by all,
even the moſt unwarrantable Means,
as by Injury, Oppreſſion, Murther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
He was rather fear'd than belov'd by
his Subjects, tho' it was the principal
Study and Endeavour of his Life to be
Popular: To this end he frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
Publick Shows, which were
both various and magnificent: In theſe
a hundred Wild Beaſts were often ſlain
at a time, which he procur'd from all
Parts of the World. He made frequent
and noble Largeſſes to the People, and
entertain'd them with Publick Games,
wherein Wreſtlers, Stage-players, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
were drawn from all Parts to contend
for the Prize: And I have ſeen in his
Time Shews of all ſorts repreſented in
all the Theaters in <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſacred
Rites and Ceremonies ſolemniz'd after
the manner of the Myſteries of <hi>Ceres.</hi>
Theſe were the <hi>Ludi Seculares,</hi> which are
never renew'd till three Ages be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
from the laſt Celebration; at
which time Cryers go through <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:94482:90"/>
and <hi>Italy,</hi> to make Proclamation, that
the People may come and behold what
they had never ſeen before, nor could
ever ſee again: Which is a plain Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that the Diſtance of Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the former and the enſuing Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration,
exceeds the utmoſt Limits of
humane Age.</p>
               <p>Having ſtaid ſome time at <hi>Rome,</hi> he
aſſum'd his Sons into a Partnerſhip of
the Empire; and being willing that
ſome Foreign Atchievements ſhould
contribute to the Glory of his Arms,
which had hitherto been employ'd in a
Civil War, from whence he declin'd an
Occaſion of Triumph, he led his Army
into the Eaſt, giving out, that the Cauſe
of this Invaſion was to puniſh <hi>Barſemius</hi>
the King of the <hi>Atrenians,</hi> for ſending Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
to <hi>Niger,</hi> to be made uſe of againſt
him: And being on the Frontiers of
<hi>Armenia,</hi> he was about to ravage that
Country; but was prevented by the
King of the Place, who voluntarily ſent
Hoſtages, with Money, and other rich
Preſents to him, and entreated him to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94482:91"/>
eſtabliſh a Friendſhip and good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
between them. <hi>Severus</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Things ſucceed according to his
Wiſhes in <hi>Armenia,</hi> bent his Courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Country of the <hi>Atrenians;</hi> and
here his Strength was encreas'd by the
Repair of <hi>Augarus</hi> King of the <hi>Oſrhoeni,</hi>
who deliver'd up his Children by way
of Hoſtage for their Father's Fidelity,
and joyn'd him with a conſiderable
Force of Archers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> croſſing <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and the
Country of the <hi>Adiabeni,</hi> over-ran <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi>
call'd <hi>the Happy,</hi> by reaſon of the
Fertility of the Soil, which produces in
great Abundance thoſe ſweet Herbs
which we uſe in our Perfumes. He
pillag'd a great many Cities and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and waſting all the Country,
march'd forward into the Territories of
the <hi>Atrenians,</hi> and ſat down before <hi>Atrae.</hi>
This City is founded upon the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of a Rock, and fortifi'd with a
high and regular Wall. The Garriſon
was numerous and brave, and conſiſted
for the moſt part of Archers. This City
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94482:91"/>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> inveſted with his whole Army,
and aſſail'd it with his utmoſt Fury:
Engines of War of all ſorts were drawn
to the Wall, and nothing omitted that
is of importance in the Storming of
Towns. The <hi>Atrenians</hi> made a brave De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and throwing Stones and ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arrows at the Aſſailants, extremely
incommoded <hi>Severus</hi> his Army. They
fill'd alſo Earthen Veſſels with ſmall
winged Inſects and other venemous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and threw them upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
theſe faſtning upon their Eyes,
or any other Part that was naked, and
ſecretly crawling up and down, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
gall'd and wounded them.
They could not bear the Heat of the
Climate, the Air was too ſoultry, and
the Sun burnt them exceſſively, and
threw them into divers and deſperate
Maladies, inſomuch that <hi>Severus</hi> loſt
more Men by theſe Caſualties, than by
the Sword of his Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> ſeeing his Soldiers diſheartned
and tir'd with the Siege, which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with more Loſs than Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94482:92"/>
to the Beſiegers, took care to draw
off his Army before it was totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,
without effecting what he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
The Iſſue of this Attempt
coming ſo far ſhort of his Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
gave him great Regrets. Not to
vanquiſh, was in effect to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd,
to him who had always been
accuſtom'd to Victory. But a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Gale of Fortune, which ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hapned, eaſily blew this Damp
off his Spirits, and made this Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo far from being fruitleſs, that it
crown'd it with greater Succeſſes than
he at firſt expected; for putting to Sea
with his whole Army, compoſing a
ſtrong Naval Force, he was driven from
the <hi>Roman,</hi> and forc'd in a rough Sea
upon the Coaſt of <hi>Parthia,</hi> but a few
Days Journey from <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> where the
King keeps his Court: At this time
he liv'd in perfect Tranquillity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturb'd
by War, or the fears of it, not
imagining that <hi>Severus</hi>'s Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Atreni</hi> did any ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
him, nor apprehending any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94482:92"/>
to be made upon him in this
Juncture. But <hi>Severus</hi> being thus dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by Streſs of Weather upon his
Coaſts, landed his Men, and ravag'd
the Country, carrying off all the Cattel
he met with, that he might be ſecure of
Proviſions; and burning the Villages
that fell in his way, he advanc'd into
the Country, till he reach'd the City
<hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> where the great <hi>Artabanus</hi> held
his Reſidence, and falling by ſurprize
upon the Barbarous People, who were
unprepar'd, kill'd all the Men they
found, and made the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
Priſoners, the King only eſcaping,
with a few Horſemen. But the <hi>Romans</hi>
poſſeſs'd themſelves of his Treaſure,
and Royal Furniture and Ornaments,
and return'd with them to their Ships.
Thus <hi>Severus</hi> atchiev'd his <hi>Parthian</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
rather by good Fortune than
Conduct.</p>
               <p>This Enterprize being thus fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accompliſh'd, he immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
an Expreſs to <hi>Rome,</hi> giving an
Account of his Succeſs, and magnifying
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94482:93"/>
the Exploit. He ſet up alſo publick
Pageants, wherein his Engagements and
Victories were repreſented. The Senate
upon this Occaſion decreed him all the
Honours imaginable, and gave him
Surnames from the Nations which he
had conquer'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus,</hi> after he had ſettled his Affairs
in the Eaſt, haſtned to <hi>Rome,</hi> bringing
along with him his Sons, who were now
good big Youths; and having put the
Affairs of the Provinces in a right
Courſe, and review'd the <hi>Myſian</hi> and
<hi>Pannonian</hi> Forces, he enter'd <hi>Rome</hi> in
Triumph, being receiv'd by the People
with loud Acclamations, and the higheſt
Teſtimonies of Honour and Reſpect.
After his Entrance, and ſome Time
ſpent in ſacrificing and celebrating Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals,
and exhibiting publick Shews and
Games, he diſtributed a magnificent
Donative among the People, and made
certain Publick Entertainments on the
particular Account of his Victories.
After this he ſtaid a great many Years
at <hi>Rome,</hi> adminiſtring Juſtice, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94482:93"/>
himſelf wholly to the Care of
the Civil Government, and the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Children in Vertue and
Good Manners: But they were vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and young, and falling in with the
Humour of the Town in their delicate
and refin'd Way of Living, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with too great eagerneſs the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
of Balls, Plays, Chariot-dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> were early debauch'd. The
Brothers began to jar and interfere,
firſt out of a Childiſh Humour or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
at Quail-fights, Cock-fights, or
the Wreſtlings of Boys, where they
would frequently wrangle and fall out.
If any thing was ſpoke or repreſented
upon the Stage, they always varied in
Opinion, and never favour'd the ſame
Actor; but whatever pleas'd one, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
diſtaſted the other. Their Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
and Miniſters made it their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to cheriſh and foment theſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
ſaying any thing that would pleaſe
the young Princes at that Age, and give
them Credit and Intereſt with them.
<hi>Severus</hi> being inform'd of theſe Things,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94482:94"/>
employ'd his utmoſt Endeavours to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
all Differences between
them, and to make them Friends. His
eldeſt Son (whoſe Name was <hi>Baſſian,</hi>
afterwards chang'd into <hi>Antonine, Marcus</hi>'s
Surname, upon his Alliance to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Line) he marry'd, upon a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that it would tame him, to a
Daughter of <hi>Plautian</hi>'s, who was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Band. This <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
they ſay, was originally of a mean
Fortune, and had in his Youth been
convicted of Seditious Practices, and
divers other Miſdemeanours, for which
he was baniſh'd; nevertheleſs, being by
Nation an <hi>African,</hi> and Fellow-Citizen,
and, as ſome ſay, a Relation to <hi>Severus,</hi>
(tho' others tax him with the having
proſtituted his Body to him in the
Flow'r of his Age) <hi>Severus</hi> from a low
and mean Condition, promoted him to
great Wealth and Honour, conferring
upon him the Eſtates of ſuch Perſons
as were put to Death, ſharing every
thing with him except his Empire: But
he abus'd this Power and Dignity, not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94482:94"/>
abſtaining from the higheſt Acts of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
and Violence, in the advancing
his own Intereſts or Deſigns, out-doing
all the Princes that went before him in
Barbarity and Cruelty. With his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Severus</hi> match'd his Son, by this
Alliance uniting the two Families.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antoninus</hi> was very much diſſatisfied
with the Match, which was made up
rather by Concert amongſt Friends, than
by Conſent of Parties, and conceiv'd a
mortal Averſion both to the Lady and
her Father; inſomuch that he would
neither lie in the ſame Bed, nor live in
the ſame Houſe with her; but thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
out repeated Menaces againſt them
both, which he threatned to execute as
ſoon as he ſhould get the Sovereign Power
into his Hands. The Lady told all
theſe Things to her Father, remonſtrating
to him how implacable his Hatred was
againſt her, which put the old Man into
a mighty Rage; how ſeeing that <hi>Severus</hi>
was old, and weakned by a long Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and knowing the natural
Fierceneſs and Impetuoſity of <hi>Antoninus,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:94482:95"/>
began to fear leſt he ſhould ſome Day
fulfil his Threats: Whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to be beforehand with him,
eſteeming it better to be upon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive,
than tamely to expect the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of theſe Menaces. He
had a great many Motives to ſpur on
his Ambition to an Affectation of the
Empire: His Eſtate was greater than
ever any Private Man poſſeſs'd, the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery
was entirely at his Beck, the whole
<hi>Roman</hi> People paid a ſingular Honour
and Deference to him; he always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in the Senatorian Robes, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
with large Studs of Gold, and
was always rank'd with Men of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Note, and ſuch as had been twice
Conſuls: When he came abroad, he
was attended with all the Circumſtances
that might encreaſe the Terror or
Grandeur of his Appearance; he had a
Sword by his Side, with all the Enſigns
of Sovereign Dignity: No Man was
ſuffer'd to approach his Perſon; and if
any encounter'd him by accident, he was
oblig'd to retire. Certain Gentlemen
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94482:95"/>
of his Retinue always march'd before
him to make Proclamation, that no
Man ſhould preſume to draw near or
look upon him, but that they ſhould all
turn out of the Way, and fix their Eyes
on the Ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plautian</hi> by this Deportment incurr'd
the high Diſpleaſure of <hi>Severus,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
odious and inſupportable to him;
inſomuch that he retrench'd his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and exhorted him to abate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his Pride and Arrogance:
Which incens'd him to that Degree,
that he reſolv'd to attempt the Empire
by Policy and Intrigue; and in order to it,
form'd this Deſign: There was a certain
Tribune of <hi>Plautian</hi>'s, by Name <hi>Saturninus,</hi>
who had abandon'd himſelf to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Obedience to the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his General, which in truth all
the reſt had done as well as he; yet he
by a ſhew of an extraordinary Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for him above the reſt, had inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
himſelf the moſt intimately into
his Affections. This Man he thought
the moſt fit to be truſted with, and the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94482:96"/>
moſt proper to execute his ſecret Orders,
and commanded him to attend him in
the Evening, after all other Perſons were
withdrawn; and when he was come,
told him, <hi>That this was the Time for him
to give the laſt Proof of his Zeal and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to his Intereſt, and for him to make
a Requital proportionable to ſo great a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
That it was in his Choice whether he
would ſucceed him in the Poſt he was now
in, and be ſuch a Man as he ſaw he was at
that time, or die inſtantly, and receive the
Rewards of his Contumacy and Diſobedience;
That he ought not to be ſtagger'd with the
Greatneſs of the Enterprize, or ſtartle at
the Name of</hi> Emperor, <hi>in regard of the
free Entrance which he ſhould have alone
into the Imperial Bed-chamber, when his Turn
ſhould come to be upon the Night-Guard, at
which time he might eaſily effect what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to him, without Oppoſition or Diſcovery;
That he ſhould not expect any further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from him, but ſhould go immediately
to the Imperial Palace, as if he brought Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of Importance and Secreſie from Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
and ſo ſhould fall upon the Old Man
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94482:96"/>
and his Son, and kill them; adding, That
the Matter was very feaſible to a Man that
would acquit himſelf with Bravery; and
aſſuring him, That as he had a Share in
the Hazard, ſo he ſhould alſo have in the
Honour and Dignity to which this Enterprize
would make way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tribune was infinitely ſurpriz'd
with the Propoſal, but not ſo much as
to loſe his Underſtanding in that Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
but, like a Man that had his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
about him, (for he was a <hi>Syrian,</hi> and
'tis obſerv'd that the Eaſtern Countries
produce generally very clear Heads)
conſidering the Violence of his Rage,
together with the Extent of his Power,
thought not fit to oppoſe him in any
Circumſtance of what he open'd to
him, for fear of being ſacrific'd inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Diſpleaſure; but hearing the
whole Propoſal with ſeeming Joy and
Rapture, as if he was ambitious to
be an Inſtrument in the Execution, and
adoring him as if he had been already
Emperor, deſir'd of him a Copy of his
Commiſſion; for 'tis the Cuſtom of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94482:97"/>
Tyrants, when they command any Man
to be cut off without Legal Proceſs, to
give their Orders in Writing, that ſome
Footſteps might remain of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by which the Party was put to
Death. <hi>Plautian,</hi> blinded with Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
gave him a Commiſſion under his
Hand, and diſpatch'd him away inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to execute it, ſtrictly charging him
to ſend for him as ſoon as the Buſineſs
was done, and before it was nois'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that he might appear in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
before it was known that he had
invaded the Empire. Matters being thus
concerted between them, the Tribune
left him, and walk'd through all the
Rooms of the Palace, as he us'd to do,
without Controul: But conſidering that
it was abſolutely impracticable for one
Man to aſſaſſinate two Emperors that
were lodg'd in different Apartments, he
went directly to <hi>Severus,</hi> and calling to
the Guards of the Imperial Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
deſir'd Admittance to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Preſence, in regard he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to impart to him that nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94482:97"/>
the Safety of his Perſon. They
immediately inform'd the Emperor
hereof, and by his Command the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune
was brought before him: After he
was introduc'd, addreſſing himſelf to
<hi>Severus,</hi> he accoſted him with this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
Relation. <hi>May it pleaſe your
Majeſty, I don't come here as a Traytor to
aſſaſſinate your Perſon, as he that ſent me
imagines; but according to my own Hopes
and Deſires, to be your Preſerver and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer.</hi>
Plautian <hi>ſeeking by Intrigue and
Policy to gain the Empire, has Commiſſion'd
me to murder you and your Son, and that
not only by Word of Mouth, but by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in Writing;</hi> [Then he laid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
before them,] <hi>which I readily
undertook, leſt if I ſhould decline it, he
might meet with ſome other Perſon forward
enough to engage in the Enterprize; and now
I am here ready to make Diſcovery of what
I know, and to bring to light his Secret
Deſigns.</hi> This he ſpoke with Tears in
his Eyes, and a mighty appearance of
Concern. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Severus</hi> gave
but ſlow Credit to him; he lov'd <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:94482:98"/>
moſt paſſionately, and ſuſpected
Forgery and Subornation in the whole
Buſineſs; he fanſied his Son, out of an
inveterate Malice to <hi>Plautian</hi> and his
Daughter, had invented this artful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
to take away his Life; and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him, charg'd him home with
it, reproving him moſt ſeverely for theſe
unwarrantable Practices againſt the Life
of his Friend and Domeſtick. <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
at firſt proteſted he was ignorant of
the whole Matter; but when the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune
preſs'd his Depoſitions, ſhewing
forth his Commiſſion, <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſpurr'd
him on, and animated him to impeach
him of the Fact, and be Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. And the Tribune ſeeing
into what imminent Danger he had
brought himſelf, and fearing the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening
Kindneſs of <hi>Severus</hi> to <hi>Plautian,</hi>
and being ſatisfied if the Plot was not
fairly diſcover'd, and the Criminal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,
that he ſhould undergo the moſt
exquiſite Torments, ſaid to them, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, my Lords, what clearer Proof
or ſtronger Evidence can you deſire? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94482:98"/>
me only to go out of the Palace, and
by ſome truſty Friend of mine let him
know that the Buſineſs he gave me in Charge
is accompliſh'd, and he will ſpeedily be here,
expecting to find the Palace abandon'd; and
then you your ſelves may judge of the
Truth of what I have depos'd. Only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Silence in the Palace, for fear he ſhould
have Intelligence of what has paſs'd, and ſo
defeat the Deſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this being agreed to, he ſent a
particular Friend of his to <hi>Plautian,</hi> to
tell him, <hi>That he ſhould make all the haſte
he could; that both the Emperors were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd;
that it would behove him to be in
the Palace before the Thing had taken Air;
that having made himſelf Maſter of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel,
and eſtabliſh'd his Empire, he might
conſtrain the People to render Obedience to
him, as to an actual Sovereign. Plautian</hi>
eaſily believ'd all this, and full of Hope,
in the Evening put on a Coat of Mail
for the Defence of his Body, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his other Robes over it, drove with
all ſpeed to the Palace, accompanied
only by a few Servants, who fanſied he
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94482:99"/>
went upon a Summons from Court,
about Affairs of Importance.</p>
               <p>He enter'd the Palace without any
Difficulty, the Guards knowing nothing
of what had hapned. Here the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune
met him, and deſigning to trepan
him, accoſted him by the Title of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror;</hi>
and taking him familiarly by the
Hand, told him he would conduct him
into the Chamber where the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Emperors were beſtow'd.
Here <hi>Severus</hi> had order'd certain of his
Guards to ſtand ready to lay Hands
upon him, as ſoon as he ſhould come
in. So <hi>Plautian,</hi> to his unexpreſſible
diſappointment, ſaw both the Emperors
ſtanding in the Room; and being
ſeiz'd upon by the Guards, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
aſtoniſh'd with the Encounter,
began to beg and entreat, and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
himſelf, proteſting, <hi>That it was all
a Lye, a meer Forgery and Contrivance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
againſt him. Severus</hi> upbraided him
with his good Offices, and the Honours he
had conferr'd upon him. <hi>Plautian,</hi> on the
other Hand, reminded him of his Faith,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94482:99"/>
Loyalty, and the good Services he had
render'd him; till at length <hi>Severus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to credit what he ſaid, until
an unlucky Rent in his Garment diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Coat of Mail that was under
it: Whereupon <hi>Antonine,</hi> a fiery auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Youth, and naturally very invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
againſt the Man, demanded of him
what Anſwer he would give to theſe two
Points, <hi>Why he came to Court at that Time
without Orders;</hi> and, <hi>What was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Coat of Mail. Is it uſual,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>for any Man to come armed to a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?</hi>
At which Words he commanded
the Tribune, and the other Soldiers that
were preſent, inſtantly to draw their
Swords, and cut him in Pieces for an
avow'd Enemy. They preſently obey'd
his Orders, and killing him, flung out
his dead Body into the publick Street,
there to lie open to the View of all Men,
and expos'd to the Indignities of thoſe
that hated him. Thus the ambitious
<hi>Plautian</hi> ran his Period, being betray'd by
him who made the greateſt Profeſſions
of Friendſhip and Devotion to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:94482:100"/>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> from henceforth created two
Captains of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Band, and
ſpent the Remainder of his Days for
the moſt part in his Country Houſes
that were near the City, or on the Sea-Coaſts
of <hi>Campania,</hi> diſtributing Juſtice,
and regulating the Affairs of State.
He was extremely deſirous that his
Children ſhould have the Benefit of a
vertuous Education. He ſaw they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd
the vain Amuſements of Shews and
Games, with greater Eagerneſs than was
ſuitable to their Character. He ſaw too,
that about theſe they conſtantly thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and oppos'd one another with great
Zeal and Warmth, which bred ill Blood
amongſt them, and afforded Incentives
to Fewds and Animoſities: Eſpecially
<hi>Antonine</hi> became inſupportable after
<hi>Plautian</hi> was remov'd, (tho' the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of his Father reſtrain'd him from
Actions that were of a very flagitious
Nature) he endeavour'd to kill his
Wife, and left nothing unattempted to
effect it: Whereupon <hi>Severus</hi> ſent her
away with her Brother into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94482:100"/>
allow'd them a large and honourable
Maintenance; imitating herein <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
who took the ſame Courſe with <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s
Sons after he was declar'd an
Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> endeavour'd as much as in
him lay to compoſe all theſe Quarrels,
and to create a Friendſhip and good
Underſtanding between them; and in
order to this, frequently put them in
mind of the old Tragedies and Fables,
wherein private Animoſities between
Brothers jointly inveſted in Supreme
Power, were generally the Source of
all their Miſeries; and repreſented to
them, that the Exchequer and Temples
were very full of Money; that no Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Potentate would have Force or
Treaſure enough to attack them from
without; that their Funds at home
would abundantly ſupply them with
Donatives to diſtribute amongſt the
Soldiers, as often and in what Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they pleas'd; that the <hi>Praetorian</hi>
Band was four times as ſtrong as it
was at his Acceſſion to the Empire;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94482:101"/>
that the Army that was poſted before the
City, was of that Strength, that no Foreign
Force was equal or comparable to it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you conſider the Plenty of Money, or
the Strength, Stature, or Number of Men;
remonſtrating to them upon the whole
Matter, that all this would ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as long as there were Civil Feuds
and Inteſtine Diviſions among them.
Theſe Admonitions he often repeated,
ſometimes mildly entreating, at other
times as ſharply rebuking them, leaving
no way uneſſay'd to allay theſe unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Heats, and make a firm and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Reconciliation between them. But
they, regardleſs of all his Counſels, liv'd
in open defiance of him and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
making ſtill more deſperate Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Sin and Vice; the Heat and Fire
of Youth, the Licentiouſneſs of Princes,
the faireſt Opportunities, and the moſt
powerful Incentives to Pleaſure, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
to puſh them forward to the
greateſt Extravagancies. Beſides theſe,
they were led by Buffoons and Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
who by inveagling Arts endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94482:101"/>
to allure and win them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
not ſtopping at a ſervile Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with their moſt diſhoneſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Appetites, but ſtill inventing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in favour of the Prince they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
which could not delight him
more than it regretted his Brother. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>
took ſome of theſe Men, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
them ſeverely for theſe ſervile
Compliances.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Severus</hi> was thus concern'd for
the lewd Courſes of his Sons, and that
indecent Application with which they
had follow'd Plays and Games, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Britain</hi> notified to him by
Letter, <hi>That the</hi> Britains <hi>were in open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
that they had ravag'd and laid waſte
the Country, that he muſt either ſend him a
ſtrong Reinforcement, or come in Perſon to
reduce the Place.</hi> Theſe Advices were
very agreeable to <hi>Severus,</hi> who was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
very deſirous of Glory, but had
a peculiar Ambition to crown his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
in the Eaſt and North, and his
Titles of Honour merited by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
in thoſe Parts, by erecting new
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94482:102"/>
Trophies in <hi>Britain.</hi> This Expedition
alſo offer'd him an Occaſion which he
extremely wiſh'd for, of drawing his
Sons from <hi>Rome,</hi> that being remov'd
from the Luxury and Gaieties of the
Town, and making a Campaign in
<hi>Britain,</hi> they might be accuſtom'd in
their Youth to a temperate Courſe of
Life, as that which is moſt proper for
a Soldier. Soon after he caus'd Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to be made of his deſign'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
into <hi>Britain.</hi> He was old, and
much afflicted with the Gout; but the
Faculties of his Mind were active and
vigorous, far excelling all the Young
Men. He travell'd for the moſt part
in a Calaſh, making no conſiderable
Halts in his March; and having reach'd
the End of his Journey by Land, he
croſs'd the Seas ſooner than he could
have expected, and landed his Men in
<hi>Britain,</hi> and appointing a general Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous
for his Forces, drew together a
formidable Army, and made all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Preparations for the War.</p>

The <hi>Britains</hi> were exceedingly alarm'd
at the ſudden Arrival of <hi>Severus;</hi> and
underſtanding what a mighty Power
was rais'd againſt them, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſent Ambaſſadors to make Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Peace, and to excuſe their late
Miſcarriages: But <hi>Severus</hi> was inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
he was ambitious of a Victory
over the <hi>Britains,</hi> and enflam'd with the
Surname of <hi>Britannicus,</hi> and was loth to
return to <hi>Rome</hi> without atchieving the
one, and deſerving the other: So he
contriv'd Delays and Difficulties, to gain
Time, and detain the Ambaſſadors in
ſuſpenſe; but diſmiſs'd them at length,
after a final Rejection of their Propoſals,
and put all things in poſture and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for a Battel. It was his principal
Care to build Bridges over the Moraſſes,
that his Men might run over them with
eaſe, and fight upon a ſolid Bottom.
Of theſe there are great Numbers in
this Iſland, covering vaſt Extents of Land,
occaſion'd by the frequent Inundations of
the Sea. The Natives often ſwim or
wade into them up to the Waſte, in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94482:103"/>
Water and Mud, which they don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
the greateſt part of their Bodies
being naked. They are not acquainted
with the Uſe of Clothes, but wear Iron
about their Necks and Waſtes, which
they eſteem an Ornament, and a Sign
of Riches, as the other Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do Gold. They paint their Bodies
with an agreeable Variety, drawing upon
them all Sorts of Creatures; which is
the Reaſon they wear no Clothes, their
Vanity not permitting them to draw a
Veil over ſo much Beauty. They are
a very warlike and a bloody People.
Their Arms are only a narrow Shield
and a Lance, with a Sword that hangs
at their naked Side. They know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Uſe of a Breaſt-plate or
Helmet, looking upon them as an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Luggage, which would only hinder
them in paſſing the Bogs, out of which
continually aſcend thick Vapors, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whereof the Face of the Heavens
ſeems always overcaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severus</hi> in this Interval made Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch Things as would the moſt
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94482:103"/>
annoy the Enemy, and be of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Uſe to his own Men. And now all
Things ſeeming in good State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for the War, he left <hi>Geta</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
Juſtice in that part of the Iſland
which was not revolted, and to make
ſuch Regulations as the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould require, appointing him a
Council compos'd of the moſt aged,
and the moſt experienc'd of his Friends:
And taking <hi>Antonine</hi> along with him,
he advanc'd againſt the Rebels; and
having paſs'd his Army over the Rivers
and Fortifications which divided the
<hi>Roman</hi> Frontier from that of the Enemy,
there hapned divers Rencounters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, wherein the <hi>Britains</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
had the worſe; but having the
advantage of being throughly acquainted
with the Country, they could retreat at
pleaſure out of Danger, into the Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of the Woods and Bogs; all
which being againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> retarded
the Proſecution of the War.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Severus</hi> being arriv'd
to a great Age, was ſeiz'd with a ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94482:104"/>
Illneſs, which conſtrain'd him to
ſtay at home; by which means the
Character of <hi>General</hi> devolv'd upon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine,</hi>
whom his Father ſent to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the War: But he being not very
ſollicitous how Matters were carry'd on
againſt the Rebels, us'd his utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to ingratiate with the Soldiery,
and to exclude all others from any
Share in their Affections and Eſteem,
affecting immoderately to be ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.
In order hereto, he loaded his
Brother with Calumnies and Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:
But the long Indiſpoſition of his
Father, and the ſlow Approaches of
Death, afflicted the Spirit of the Young
Man, inſomuch that at length he grew
impatient, and fell to Practices with his
Servants and Phyſicians to ſhorten his
Life; till at laſt <hi>Severus</hi> dy'd, rather
through Anguiſh of Mind, than Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Body, after he had run a
glorious Courſe, far tranſcending all his
Predeceſſors in the Glory of Military
Atchievements, none of which were
Victorious in ſo many and ſo great
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94482:104"/>
Engagements both in Civil and Foreign
Wars. He reigned Eighteen Years, and
was ſucceeded by his own Sons. He
left behind a greater Treaſure than ever
any Prince did before him, with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of that Puiſſance, that no Force was
able to encounter it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonine</hi> had no ſooner got the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power into his Hands, upon his
Father's Deceaſe, but he began a moſt
bloody Maſſacre, putting to Death all
the Phyſicians that refus'd to comply
with the Propoſal he made to them of
taking off his Father, as alſo all thoſe
Perſons that had the Conduct of his
own and his Brother's Education, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they earneſtly endeavour'd to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
a Reconciliation between them.
Nor did any of thoſe Miniſters weather
this Storm, whom his Father in his
Life-time had honour'd with his Eſteem
and Confidence. The Chief Officers
in the Army he endeavour'd to engage
in his Intereſts by great Gifts and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Promiſes, to the end they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
the Army to declare him ſole
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94482:105"/>
Emperor, ſetting a foot all manner of
Practices to deſtroy his Brother. But
he could not over-rule the Soldiers in
this Point; they remembred how equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Severus</hi> had deported himſelf towards
his Sons while he was alive, keeping
them both upon a Level in the whole
Courſe of their Education, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought themſelves oblig'd to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an equal Loyalty and Deference to
them both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonine</hi> finding that his Project did
not take in the Army, concluded a Peace,
and taking Hoſtages for the Obſervance
of it, left the Enemies Country, and
advanc'd with all ſpeed towards his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Brother. After they came to
an Interview, their Mother employ'd her
utmoſt Efforts to reconcile them; all
the Men of moſt eminent Dignity, and
ſuch as had been of his Father's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
joining with her in an Endeavour ſo
important to the Publick Quiet. So <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine</hi>
ſeeing all things conſpire to
thwart the Bent of his Humour, agreed
at laſt, rather by Neceſſity than Choice,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94482:105"/>
to the outward Forms of a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tho' there was little Sincerity at
the bottom. After this they admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd
the Government jointly; and
parting from <hi>Britain,</hi> ſet Sail for <hi>Rome,</hi>
and carry'd along with them their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Aſhes, which, mix'd with Perfumes,
they put into an Urn of Alabaſter, and
convey'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> that it might be
plac'd amongſt the Sacred Monuments
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors. And embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Army as Conquerors of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
croſs'd the Sea, and arriv'd in <hi>Gaul.</hi>
Thus we have given Account in this
Book, how <hi>Severus</hi> dy'd, and how his
Sons ſucceeded him in the Empire.</p>

                  <hi>SEverus</hi> his Aſhes are brought from
<hi>Britain</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and he is Deified. <hi>Antonine</hi> and
<hi>Geta</hi> undertake the Government, and fall
into ſuch Quarrels and Jealouſies, that
they were once about dividing the Empire,
and ſtating the Limits of their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
had not <hi>Julia</hi> diſſwaded them. But
after a while, their Animoſities flaming
more and more; <hi>Antonine</hi> kills <hi>Geta</hi>
upon the Breaſt of his Mother, and flies
to the Camp, where the Soldiers, corrupted
by a Largeſs, declare him ſole Emperor.
He exerciſes great Cruelties towards the
People and Senate: Afterwards he makes
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94482:106"/>
ſeveral Progreſſes, one to the Banks of
the <hi>Iſter,</hi> where he follows the Faſhions
of the <hi>Germans;</hi> a ſecond into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where he perſonates <hi>Alexander;</hi>
and a third into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where he imitates
<hi>Achilles.</hi> Then going to <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
by a ſingular Inſtance of Treachery and
Barbarity, he cuts to Pieces all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;
and afterwards entring <hi>Parthia,</hi>
under colour of a Marriage to be ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd
there, ſurprizes the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
and breaking the League, makes a great
Slaughter of them, the King eſcaping

which continues for three whole Days,

               <p>WHat <hi>Severus</hi> did in thoſe Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years in which he was
Emperor, is related in the foregoing
Book. His Sons, who were now young
Men, haſtned to <hi>Rome</hi> with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but there aroſe ſuch Bickerings
and Quarrels between them upon the
Road, that they would neither eat at the
ſame Table, nor lodge in the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment;
and ſo powerful was the
Spirit of Jealouſie, that they apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Poiſon in all their Meats and Drinks,
either from the Hands of one another,
or from Servants corrupted to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
For which Reaſon they made the
more haſte to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to live in greater Security, by reaſon
of the Largeneſs of the Palace, which
conſiſted of a vaſt Range of ſtately
Buildings, exceeding the reſt of the City
in its Extent. This being divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, they thought they might
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94482:107"/>
hold their Courts aſunder, and live at
Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>When they arriv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
receiv'd them with the Solemnity of
carrying Branches of Laurel, the Senate
complimented them in full Body, and
at the Head of this glorious Train they
march'd in their Robes of Purple: The
Conſuls follow'd, bearing the Urn
wherein the Aſhes of <hi>Severus</hi> were laid;
and complimenting the new Emperors,
paſs'd by them, and worſhipp'd the
Urn, which, attended with all the Pomp
and Ceremony imaginable, was by them
plac'd in the Temple, where the Sacred
Monuments of <hi>Marcus</hi> and his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
are to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After the young Emperors had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the Sacrifices cuſtomary upon
the Acceſſion of new Princes to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
they retir'd to the Palace,</hi> which
was divided into diſtinct Courts, and
with mighty Caution ſhut up all the
By-ways and Paſſages, ſuffering only the
great Court-gates to be made uſe of in
common. Each of them had his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94482:108"/>
Life guard, and rarely came
together, unleſs it was for a ſhort time,
when they appear'd in Publick. Their
firſt Care was to pay the Honours due
to their deceas'd Father; it being a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> to deifie thoſe
Emperors that die in the Life of their
Sons and Succeſſors. This Honour they
term an <hi>Apotheoſis.</hi> During the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
there is a various Face of Things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
from a Combination of Joy and
Sorrow in the City: For the dead Body
of the Emperor is interr'd with great
magnificence, according to the Funeral
Rites here on Earth. His Effigies,
wrought in Wax, as like the Original as
the moſt exquiſite Art can make it, is
laid upon a high and ſtately Couch of
Ivory, plac'd before the Entrance of the
Palace, and cover'd with Cloth of Gold.
The Effigies looks pale, and has the
ghaſtly Air of a ſick Perſon. On the
left Side ſtand all the Senators in Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
on the right, Matrons of the moſt
eminent Quality by Birth or Marriage,
diveſted of their Neck-laces, Jewels, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94482:108"/>
all the Gaieties of Dreſs, and attir'd
in narrow white <hi>Manteaus,</hi> appearing
like ſo many Mourners. This Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is repeated for ſeven Days ſucceſſively.
The Doctors come in every Day, and
approaching the Couch of State, view
the Patient, and make the Report ſtill
that the Malady encreaſes. When it is
given out that he is dead, certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Noblemen of <hi>Rome</hi> are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of the moſt Illuſtrious Families,
to ſupport the Couch; theſe carry it
along the Sacred Way with ſolemn Pace,
till they bring it into the Old <hi>Forum,</hi>
where the Magiſtrates of <hi>Rome</hi> take their
Oaths, upon quitting their Offices. Here
are Steps rais'd on both Sides in the
Form of Stairs; on the one Side ſtands
a <hi>Chorus</hi> of Noble Patrician Youths, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to theſe are Ladies of Condition,
both which ſing in honour of the Dead
Hymns and Songs ſet to doleful and
majeſtick Airs, which are favour'd by
the Cadence of the Verſe. After this,
they take up the Couch again, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it out of the City, into the middle of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94482:109"/>
the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> where there was a
Pile erected of Quadrangular Figure, all
the Sides being equal, and the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
only vaſt Pieces of Timber, faſtned
together into the Form of an Houſe.
The Inſide is fill'd with dry combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Matter; the Outſide is adorn'd with
Cloth of Gold, Statues of Ivory, and
curious Painting. Below this ſtood ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
exactly of the ſame Model, and
beautified as the former, with its Gates
open; and ſo a third, and a fourth;
every one being ſomewhat leſs than
that which is next above it; and ſo on
till you came to the laſt, which is the
loweſt of all. The Model of theſe
Piles was not unlike the Towers that
are built over Harbours, to direct Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
by Lights ſet out, where they may
put in and lie ſecurely. The Couch
was plac'd upon the ſecond Pile, after
which ſweet Gums and all ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
with Fruits and Flowers of the
moſt fragrant Scent, were heap'd upon
it in great abundance: For there is no
Nation, City, nor Private Perſon of any
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94482:109"/>
conſiderable Quality or Note, but is
very zealous upon this Occaſion to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
his Reſpect to his Prince by theſe
laſt Preſents. After the Place was fill'd
with theſe Spices and Gums pil'd up to
a vaſt Heighth, all the Gentlemen of
<hi>Rome,</hi> gallantly mounted, pranc'd and
curvetted about the Pile in a kind of
Figure and Order, according to the
Meaſures of the <hi>Pyrrhick</hi> Dance. The
Chariots alſo went the ſame Round, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the like Decorum and Order.
The Charioteers, clad in Purple Robes,
repreſented the Perſons of the greateſt
Generals and Emperors of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then
he that is to ſucceed in the Empire, takes
a Flambeau, and puts it to the Pile; after
which the Multitude ſet Fire to it on all
Sides, and in an inſtant the whole is in a
bright Flame, by reaſon of the infinite
Quantity of Spices, Gums, and other
combuſtible Matter: And immediately
after, from the loweſt and leaſt Pile, as
from a Turret, an Eagle is let go, and
towring with the Flame, takes his Flight
towards Heaven, carrying along with
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94482:110"/>
him, as the <hi>Romans</hi> perſwade themſelves,
the Soul of the Deified Emperor; and
from this time they pay Adoration to
him, as to one of their Gods.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> was finiſh'd,
the young Emperors return'd to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and from that time were perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
claſhing and jarring, and managing
Practices one againſt the other. Each
ſought by all Means to deſtroy his
Collegue, and lodge the Supreme Power
ſolely in himſelf: The People alſo that
bore any Dignity or Employment in the
City, were torn into different Factions;
both the Emperors by ſecret Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Promiſes ſeeking to draw them
to their ſeparate Intereſts. But <hi>Geta</hi>'s
Party was far the ſtronger; he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
at leaſt a Dawn and Semblance of
Honour and Vertue, was courteous and
affable to all that came to him; his
Studies were generous, he entertain'd
and encourag'd Learned Men, purſu'd
Wreſtling and other Gentleman-like Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions;
and his Converſation was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
extremely eaſie and agreeable:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94482:110"/>
By theſe Means he became Popular,
his Reputation and good Fame gaining
him the Love and Eſteem of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
On the other Hand, <hi>Antonine</hi> was
rough and violent in his whole Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
utterly averſe to all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Qualities, a pretended Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of a Military Life, and the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
of a Campagne. He did every
thing in Wrath, more by Menaces than
Perſwaſions, rather affrighting than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring
Men to his Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>The Mother had long endeavour'd to
reconcile her two Sons, that were thus
conſtantly interfering even about the
moſt trivial Matters: But all her Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
prov'd ineffectual. They had once
determin'd to make Partition of the
Empire, to the End they might be leſs
expos'd to the Attempts of one another,
than when both liv'd in <hi>Rome:</hi> And
aſſembling their Father's Friends, this
Point was debated in the Preſence of
their Mother; and they came at laſt to
this Reſolution, <hi>That</hi> Europe <hi>ſhould be
allotted to</hi> Antonine, <hi>and</hi> Aſia <hi>to</hi> Geta;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94482:111"/>
theſe Continents being as it were by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence diſterminated by the
<hi>Propontis.</hi> It was alſo agreed upon,
<hi>That</hi> Antonine<hi>'s Army ſhould lie encamped
at</hi> Byzantium, <hi>and</hi> Geta<hi>'s at</hi> Chalcedon
<hi>in</hi> Bithvnia; <hi>that lying oppoſite one to the
other, they might guard their ſeveral Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
and hinder any Deſcent which might be
made upon them.</hi> A third Article was,
<hi>That ſuch Senators as were</hi> Europeans
<hi>ſhould remain at</hi> Rome; <hi>that the reſt ſhould
repair to</hi> Geta<hi>'s Court, which he deſign'd to
keep in</hi> Antioch <hi>or</hi> Alexandria, <hi>looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe Cities as little inferior to</hi> Rome <hi>in
bigneſs. Of the</hi> African <hi>Provinces</hi> Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
<hi>was to have the</hi> Moors <hi>and</hi> Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>and the bordering Nations; and</hi> Geta
<hi>the reſt, as far as the Eaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While this Matter was in agitation,
the whole Aſſembly ſeem'd mightily
concern'd, and fix'd their Eyes upon
the Ground; but <hi>Julia</hi> broke out into
this tender Expoſtulation: <hi>O my Sons,</hi>
ſays ſhe, <hi>you have found out Means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Lands and Seas, and the</hi> Propon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
<hi>you ſay, will ſeparate your Territories;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94482:111"/>
but how will you divide your Mother? how
ſhall wretched I be apportion'd and carv'd
between you? Firſt kill me and cut me to
Pieces; then take each of you a Part, and
bury it with you; ſo I ſhall be ſhar'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you, as well as the Land and the Sea.</hi>
This ſhe ſpoke with all the Affection
and Concern imaginable, ſhedding Tears
all the Time; and as ſoon as ſhe had
done, flinging her Arms about them,
and embracing them with all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment
and Tenderneſs of a fond
Mother, eſſay'd all poſſible Ways to
make them Friends. This ſtirr'd up
Compaſſion in all that were preſent, and
immediately the Council was diſſolv'd,
and the Propoſal rejected, both the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
returning to their Palaces.</p>
               <p>But theſe Heats and Quarrels were
more and more inflam'd every Day:
Whether an Employment Civil or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
was to be elected into, each ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for the Promotion of his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
If they were upon the Bench do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juſtice, they always diſagreed in
Opinion, to the no ſmall prejudice of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94482:112"/>
the Parties in the Suit depending before
them; their Decrees being always more
influenc'd by their own Paſſions than by
any Regard to what was Equitable and
Juſt. At Publick Games they conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſpous'd different Sides, and ſet all
Engines at work againſt one anothers
Life, even to the corrupting their Cooks
and Butlers to poyſon their ſeveral Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters:
But when theſe Deſigns did not
ſucceed ſo fortunately as they could
have wiſh'd, in regard both the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rors
were extremely cautious what they
eat or drank, <hi>Antonine</hi> grew impatient,
and being driven forward by an irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Deſire of Ruling alone, fell into
bloody and dangerous Deſigns; and
finding that his ſecret Machinations fail'd
of bringing about his Ends, he judg'd it
neceſſary to betake himſelf to Counſels
that were more hazardous and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
by reaſon of his Mothers extreme
Fondneſs of <hi>Geta,</hi> and <hi>Geta</hi>'s Deſigns
upon him. This Reſolve being form'd,
he ruſh'd into <hi>Geta</hi>'s Chambers, and
gave him his mortal Wound upon the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94482:112"/>
Breaſt of his Mother, who was all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear'd
with his Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonine,</hi> after the Commiſſion of this
horrid Murther, ran through the Court,
crying aloud, <hi>That he had with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
eſcap'd an imminent danger;</hi> and
commanded the Soldiers that guarded
the Palace inſtantly to conduct him to
his Army, affirming, <hi>That he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
be kill'd if he ſtaid in the Palace.</hi>
The Guards believ'd him, not knowing
what had hapned, and ran along with
him; the People being infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to ſee the Emperor run through
the City in the Evening in that Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
As ſoon as he reach'd the Camp,
he went directly to the Place where the
Statues and Gods of the Army are kept,
and falling down before them, render'd
Thanks, and ſacrific'd to them, as for
ſome ſignal Deliverance.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Report of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
was ſpread about the Camp,
the Soldiers, ſome whereof were in the
Baths, others in their Beds, ran all to
the Place in great aſtoniſhment. Here
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94482:113"/>
the Emperor came out to them, but
did not preſently diſcover the Truth of
the Matter, but cry'd aloud, <hi>That he had
avoided a Danger; that he had eſcap'd the
Attempts of an Enemy,</hi> (meaning his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<hi>that after a long Diſpute, his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were vanquiſh'd; that both of them had
been in manifeſt Peril, but Fortune had at
laſt declar'd him ſole Emperor.</hi> Thus
giving indirect Hints of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and willing rather that they ſhould
ſuſpect what was done, than that he
ſhould inform them.</p>
               <p>And now for the Security of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and the Eſtabliſhment of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
he promis'd every Soldier 2500
<hi>Attick Drachma's</hi> by way of Donative,
and augmented their Allowance of
Corn by an Addition of half as much
as they uſually receiv'd; commanding
them to march to the Temples and
Exchequers, and be their own Payma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
thus ſquandring in one Day all
the Treaſure which <hi>Severus</hi> had amaſs'd
in Eighteen Years, by the Ruin and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of his Subjects. The Lure of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94482:113"/>
ſo conſiderable a Sum eaſily tempted
the Soldiers, who underſtanding the
Truth of the Matter from the Reports
of thoſe that fled out of the Palace, and
took care to publiſh an Account of the
Murder, proclaim'd him ſole Emperor,
declaring <hi>Geta</hi> a Traytor. <hi>Antonine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
that Night in the Temple of
the Army; but the next Day, truſting
to the Efficacy of his Largeſs upon the
Soldiers, he adventur'd to go to the
Senate, attended by his whole Army,
ſomewhat better appointed than is uſual
upon the like Occaſions. After he had
entred the Senate, and Sacrific'd, aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Imperial Throne, he ſpoke to
the following effect.</p>

                           <p>GEntlemen, I am not ignorant that at
firſt ſight Men look upon the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of a Domeſtick with Abhorrence and
Deteſtation: The very Name, upon the firſt
mention, is apt to draw the ſevereſt Cenſure
on thoſe that are guilty of the Crime. Envy
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94482:114"/>
does not oftner purſue the Victor, than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
attends the Vanquiſh'd: Theſe always
ſeem to be injur'd, and thoſe are ſtill the
Wrong-doers. But if a Man would impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
conſider, and without Prejudice in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of him that is dead, weigh the Matter
of Fact, with the Occaſion and Deſign of it,
he will find, that it is both rational and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to anticipate a Miſchief we have juſt
Reaſon to apprehend, by a timely Revenge,
rather than tamely to attend till it fall upon
us. In this Caſe, the Miſery of the Wretch
that ſuffers, is aggravated by the Reproach
of Cowardice: Whereas, on the other hand,
the Reputation of Valour which accrues to the
Conqueror, enhances the Benefit of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.
Now, Gentlemen, what Attempts
he has made againſt my Life by Poyſon, and
what other Plots he has form'd againſt me,
you may examine, by putting his Servants to
the Queſtion, whom for that Reaſon I have
commanded to give their Attendances in this
Place, that you might be throughly inform'd of
the Truth. Some of them have been tortur'd
already, whoſe Confeſſions you may order to
be read. But at laſt, in the Preſence of my
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94482:114"/>
Mother he ſet upon me, being ſeconded by
ſeveral Ruffians with drawn Swords, who
were prepar'd to commit this Villainy. I
had indeed, by my extraordinary Caution and
Sagacity, diſcover'd his Traiterous Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and treated him as a profeſs'd Enemy,
after he had renounc'd all that Affection and
Kindneſs that is due from a Brother, and
acted very unſuitably to that Relation. To
chaſtiſe an unlawful Aggreſſor, is not only
juſt, but what is approv'd by the general
Practice of Mankind. An Inſtance of this
we have in <hi>Romulus</hi> the Founder of this
City, who could not put up the Affront of
his Brother, that only reflected upon what he
had built. I paſs over <hi>Germanicus,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Nero;</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian.
Marcus</hi> himſelf, tho' a Man of
great Wiſdom and Temper, reſented the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
put upon him by <hi>Lucius</hi> his Son in-Law
ſo highly, that nothing leſs than his Ruine
could atone for it, which he afterwards
contriv'd. But I, juſtly alarm'd by the
manifeſt Danger I was in from the Poyſon
and Sword that threatned me, have executed
Vengeance upon an Enemy, his Behaviour
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94482:115"/>
having pronounc'd him ſuch. 'Tis your
Duty, on this Occaſion, to return Thanks to
the Immortal Gods, for the preſerving one of
your Emperors, to ſuppreſs the Spirit of
Faction and Diviſion reigning amongſt you;
and having only one Prince, unanimouſly to
ſupport his Intereſts, and enjoy the common
Benefit of Repoſe and Security. As <hi>Jove</hi>
alone hath all the Power above, ſo 'tis his
Pleaſure there ſhould be one only Potentate
on Earth.</p>

               <p>Having thus ſpoke in a loud Voice
and great Rage, frowning all the time
upon his Brother's Friends, he return'd
in haſte to his Palace, leaving moſt of
the Senators under great Terrors and
Apprehenſions, and inſtantly maſſacred
all his Brother's Adherents, Miniſters,
and Menial Servants, that were in or
about his Palace, without any reſpect to
Age, his Cruelty extending even to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.
Their dead Bodies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly
thrown into Carts, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out of the City, where they were
burnt in Heaps, without the Decency
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94482:115"/>
of common Ceremonies. No Man
eſcap'd that had the leaſt Acquaintance
with <hi>Geta.</hi> All Wreſtlers, Charioteers,
Players, Buffoons, Singers, Dancers, that
had any way contributed to his Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
were all ſacrific'd to his preſent
Fury. Men that were of the higheſt
Conſideration in the Senate for Quality
and Eſtate, he put to Death for ſlight
or no Reaſons, upon any trivial Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
exhibited againſt them, under
the Notion of <hi>Geta</hi>'s Adherents. He
alſo put to death <hi>Commodus</hi>'s Siſter, an
aged Lady, to whom the other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
had paid a ſingular Deference, in
regard of her near Alliance to <hi>Marcus,</hi>
whoſe Daughter ſhe was. Her Crime
was, the condoling with his Mother
upon the Murder of her Son <hi>Geta.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe, he caus'd to be murder'd
<hi>Plautian</hi>'s Daughter his late Wife, who
was at that time in <hi>Sicily,</hi> his own
Couſin-german <hi>Severus,</hi> together with
<hi>Pertinax</hi>'s Son, and the Son of <hi>Lucilla
Commodus</hi>'s Siſter; and, in ſhort, utterly
extirpated and extinguiſh'd the Imperial
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94482:116"/>
Line, with the whole Patrician Nobility.
From hence his Fury paſs'd over into
the Provinces, where, by his Orders, were
diſpatch'd all the Prefects and Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
whom he charg'd with the having
been in <hi>Geta</hi>'s Intereſts. Whole Nights
were ſpent in the executing his cruel
Decrees. He buried the Veſtal Virgins
alive for pretended Breaches of their
Vow of Chaſtity, which he arraign'd
them of. Laſtly, (which was a Cruelty
abſolutely without Precedent) at the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſian</hi>
Games, where he was preſent in
Perſon, when ſome of the Mob threw
out ſome Words to the diſadvantage of
a Charioteer that he favour'd, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this as a Contempt offer'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he pour'd his whole Army upon
them, with poſitive Order to cut in
pieces all thoſe that had preſum'd to ſay
any thing againſt his Charioteer. The
Soldiers having thus a Power put into their
Hands to ſlay and pillage the People
with Authority, and it being impoſſible
to diſtinguiſh the Innocent from the
Guilty, in ſo great a Multitude, where
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94482:116"/>
none would confeſs the Fact, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
all without Mercy or Diſtinction,
or took what they had from them by
way of Ranſom, and then ſuffer'd them
to eſcape, tho' with great Difficulty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonine,</hi> upon review of theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
felt great Remorſes of Conſcience,
and his Stay in the City became irkſom
and uneaſie to him; inſomuch that he
determin'd to leave it for ſome time,
which he did under pretence of regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Affairs relating to the Army, and
of viſiting the Provinces. So he parted
from <hi>Italy,</hi> and came to the Banks of
the <hi>Iſter,</hi> and the Northern Parts of the
Empire, where he exercis'd himſelf in
Chariot-driving, and Combating with
all ſorts of Wild Beaſts. He ſeldom
ſat in the Courts of Juſtice; and when
he did, his Judgments were haſty, often
paſſing Sentence before he had heard
the Merits of the Cauſe. He won the
Hearts of all the <hi>Germans,</hi> and made a
ſtrict League and Friendſhip with them;
he made them alſo his Confederates in
his Wars, and choſe the goodlieſt and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94482:117"/>
ſtrongeſt amongſt them to be of his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard.
He often put off his <hi>Roman</hi>
Habit, and dreſs'd himſelf after the
Faſhion of the <hi>Germans,</hi> frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in a <hi>German</hi> Cloak, curiouſly
flower'd with Silver, according to the
Mode of that Country: He likewiſe
wore Yellow Hair, which had alſo the
<hi>German</hi> Cut. Theſe Condeſcenſions
gain'd wonderfully upon the <hi>Germans,</hi>
and made the Emperor the Darling of
that Barbarous People. Nor was he
leſs dear to his own Soldiers, whoſe
Affections he gain'd chiefly by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
Largeſſes which he dealt amongſt
them, and by his reducing himſelf to a
Level with the reſt of his Soldiers: For
if a Trench was to be made, or Bridge
to be built, or Rampart to be caſt up,
or any thing to be done that requir'd
Bodily Labour, he was ſtill the firſt
Man that ſet the reſt an Example. He
eat at a very mean Table; the Cups
and Diſhes he was ſerv'd in were made
of Wood; his Bread was courſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Cakes; his Cuſtom was to grind
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94482:117"/>
as much Corn with his own Hand as
was ſufficient for one Man, and to knead
it into a Cake, and bake it upon the
Coals. He abſtain'd from all ſorts of
Delicacies, and confin'd himſelf to as
courſe a Fare as ſerves the pooreſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Soldier. He always appear'd more
pleas'd when they call'd him Fellow Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
than when he was accoſted by the
Title of Emperor. For the moſt part
he travell'd on Foot, very rarely rid on
Horſeback or in his Coach, carry'd his
own Arms, and ſometimes the Standard,
which was adorn'd with Boſſes of Gold,
and was ſo heavy, that 'twas a Load
for the ſtrongeſt Soldier in the Army.
For theſe and the like Reaſons he was
extremely belov'd and admir'd by his
Army, as a brave Man, and a good
Soldier; and 'twas almoſt a Miracle
that ſo ſmall a Body as his was ſhould
endure ſuch mighty Hardſhips.</p>
               <p>After he had review'd his Army on
the <hi>Iſter,</hi> he paſs'd over into <hi>Thrace</hi> that
borders upon <hi>Macedon.</hi> Here he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd
an <hi>Alexander Redivivus,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94482:118"/>
by all Means to renew the
Memory of that Prince. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Images and Statues to be
erected in all the Cities; <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf,
the Capitol, and all the Temples were
fill'd with them. Theſe Honours were
paid him in conſideration of an Alliance
to him which the Emperor pretended to.
I have ſeen very ridiculous Pictures,
with one entire Body and Head, and
two Half-Faces, the one repreſenting
<hi>Alexander,</hi> the other <hi>Antonine.</hi> He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
abroad in a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Habit,
with a Turban on his Head, and Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
faſtned to his Feet. He had a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
compos'd of the Flower of his
Army, which he call'd the <hi>Macedonian
Phalanx,</hi> and commanded the Officers
to take upon them the Names of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's
Captains.</hi> He alſo ſent for Young
Men to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and call'd them the
<hi>Laconick</hi> and <hi>Pitanite Bands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had done this, and put all
Things in the Cities in as good a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
as they were capable of, he took
his way for <hi>Pergamus,</hi> a City of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:94482:118"/>
in order to have the Benefit of <hi>Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>'s
healing Influence. After he was
arriv'd here, and had follow'd his own
Caprichio's as long as he thought fit,
he ſet out towards <hi>Ilium:</hi> Here he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
the Ruines of that Place, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitted
<hi>Achilles</hi>'s Tomb, which he adorn'd
moſt curiouſly with Chaplets and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of all ſorts. Here he ſet up for a
ſecond <hi>Achilles,</hi> and being at a loſs for a
<hi>Patroclus,</hi> ſupply'd the Want by this
Shift. <hi>Feſtus,</hi> his Favourite Freed-man,
and Remembrancer-general, dy'd while
he was at <hi>Ilium;</hi> ſome ſay indeed he
was poyſon'd, to the end he might be
interr'd in the ſame manner that <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus</hi>
had been; yet others ſay he dy'd
naturally. His dead Body was order'd
to be brought out, and a Funeral Pile
to be rais'd of Wood; the Corps was
laid upon the middle of the Pile, and
Beaſts of all Kinds were ſlain; after
which the Emperor ſet Fire to the Pile,
and holding a Vial in his Hand, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd
Wine, and pray'd to the Winds.
His Hair was extremely thin, and it was
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94482:119"/>
very ridiculous to ſee the Emperor cut it
off and caſt it into the Fire, and very
much diverted thoſe that look'd on.
He extoll'd the <hi>Roman Sylla,</hi> and <hi>African
Hannibal,</hi> above all the Generals of all
Ages; and to demonſtrate his high Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of them, commanded their Statues
to be erected.</p>
               <p>Departing from <hi>Ilium,</hi> he paſs'd
through <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and the other
Provinces; and taking ſuch Meaſures
as were neceſſary for the Settlement of
Affairs in thoſe Parts, he arriv'd at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi>
Here he was receiv'd very ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly;
and having ſtaid ſome time,
took his Journey for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a mighty Deſire of viſiting that
City, of which <hi>Alexander</hi> was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and of conſulting a Deity, to which
the Inhabitants pay ſo ſingular a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Theſe were the Colours he
gave to this Expedition. And to the
end it might give no Jealouſie to the
People, he order'd Proviſion to be made
of Hecatombs and all manner of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
The <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> upon notice of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94482:119"/>
the Viſit which the Emperor deſign'd
them, being naturally light, and apt to
be mov'd by every Breath of Air, were
perfectly ecſtaſy'd, eſpecially when they
underſtood what Zeal and Affection the
Emperor had teſtified for them. And
now Preparations were making for his
Reception, which they had reſolv'd
ſhould be more magnificent than ever
had been made for any Prince. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this, Maſters of Muſick were
diſpos'd in all Parts of the City, with
Inſtruments of differing Kinds; and
from this Variety of Sounds reſulted a
moſt delightful Harmony. The Air
was ſweetned with Perfumes and ſweet
Gums in all the Entrances into the
Town. Flowers were ſtrew'd, and
Flambeau's were carried before him.
He made his Entry with his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and went in the firſt place to the
Temple, where he ſacrific'd great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Victims, and heap'd Incenſe
upon the Altars. From hence he went
to the Tomb of <hi>Alexander,</hi> where he
offer'd up his Purple Robes, and Belt,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94482:120"/>
and Rings ſet with Stones of great
Price, and whatever elſe he had about
him that was of extraordinary Value,
and laid them upon the Tomb. The
People ſeeing this, were overjoy'd, and
dedicated their whole Time to Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Jollity, little ſuſpecting the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Intentions of the Emperor.</p>
               <p>But all this was only a Varniſh to
diſguiſe his hidden Purpoſes, which were
utterly to deſtroy all the Inhabitants.
The Cauſe of his ſecret Hatred to them
was this. He had been inform'd while
he was in <hi>Rome,</hi> that both before and
after his Brothers Death, they had often
jeſted very irreverently upon him. They
are a People naturally addicted to drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and making Satyrical Touches on
Things and Men, not ſparing even the
moſt eminent. They look upon it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as pleaſant Raillery; but it galls
thoſe to the quick who are made the
Subjects of it, eſpecially if it have
ſome Ground of Truth; for thoſe Jeſts
ſtill make the deepeſt Wounds, that
touch upon a real Guilt. They had
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:94482:120"/>
frequently made very ſcurrilous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon him, not waving even
the Subject of his Brother's Murder.
His Mother they call'd in contempt <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſta,</hi>
and ridicul'd him for pretending
to perſonate <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> the
mightieſt and moſt valorous <hi>Hero's</hi> of
Antiquity, himſelf coming ſo far ſhort
of the ordinary Proportion of Men.
Theſe things were highly diſobliging to
him, and incens'd him to that degree,
being naturally cholerick and ſanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that he reſolv'd to contrive their
Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>After the Feſtival Jollity was over, the
Town being very full of People which
reſorted thither from all Quarters, he put
out an Edict, commanding all the Young
Men in the City to rendezvous on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Plain, ſetting forth his Intention of
conſtituting a <hi>Phalanx</hi> in Honour of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
that as he had a <hi>Spartan</hi> and a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian
Phalanx,</hi> ſo he would have another
which ſhould bear the Name of that
<hi>Heroe.</hi> He order'd them alſo to marſhal
themſelves into Ranks, and to ſtand at
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94482:121"/>
a convenient Diſtance one from another,
that he might the better take a View of
them, and upon conſideration of their
Age, Stature, and Make of Body, judge
which would be the fitteſt for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
The <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Youth eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
him, and conceiv'd mighty Hopes,
as they might do upon very good
Grounds, by reaſon of that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Reſpect which he had ſhewn the
City; and aſſembled in great Numbers
at the Place appointed, together with
their Fathers and Brothers, very much
rejoicing at their fair Proſpects. When
they were rang'd, the Emperor walk'd
in amongſt them, laying his Hand upon
them as he paſs'd by, and commending
one thing in one Man, and another
thing in another, till they were all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
by his Army before they were
aware of any ſuch Deſign. As ſoon
as the Emperor perceiv'd that his Army
had encompaſs'd them, and that they
were all enclos'd as it were in a Net,
he withdrew from amongſt them with
the Guard that attended him, and giving
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94482:121"/>
the Signal to his Soldiers, they inſtantly
fell upon them, being without Arms,
and ſurrounded and cut them all
to pieces, with all the other Multitude
that were there aſſembled. Some of
the Soldiers carried on the Tragedy of
the Day, others dragg'd the dead Bodies
into the Pits that they had dug for that
purpoſe; after which they rais'd over
them a great <hi>Tumulus</hi> of Earth. Some
that were hurried into theſe Pits, were
but half dead; others were not ſo much
as wounded. Great Numbers of the
Soldiers alſo periſh'd; for thoſe that had
any Remains of Life and Force, faſtned
upon thoſe that puſh'd them into the
Pits, and pull'd them down along with
them. The Slaughter was ſo great, that
all the Plain was floated with Blood,
which diſcharging it ſelf into the Sea
and the <hi>Nile,</hi> diſcolour'd the Mouth of
that mighty River, and all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

               <p>
                  <hi>After the Emperor had thus executed
his Revenge on the</hi> Alexandrians, <hi>he left
that City, and return'd to</hi> Antioch; <hi>and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94482:122"/>
ſoon after extremely affecting the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of</hi> Parthicus, <hi>and the Glory of
Conquering the Eaſtern Barbarians, in
the profoundeſt Tranquillity he fram'd
this Project. He ſent Ambaſſadors with
Letters and rich Preſents to</hi> Artabanus
<hi>King of</hi> Parthia; <hi>in his Letters he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Daughter in Marriage, and
ſet forth at large,</hi> That he was an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and the Son of an Emperor; that he
could not marry the Daughter of a Private
Perſon; that his Station in the World oblig'd
him to match with ſome Queen or Princeſs
of high Birth; that the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
Empires were the greateſt in the
World; that if the two Crowns were united
and cemented by this Alliance into one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
without any Rivers or Boundaries to
divide them, as heretofore, the whole World
beſide would not be able to balance their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in Conjunction; that the Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are ſubject to both Empires would
be eaſily kept within the Bounds of their
Duty, provided they were ſuffer'd to enjoy
their own Governors and Conſtitutions; that
the <hi>Roman</hi> Infantry and Pike-men were
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94482:122"/>
the beſt in the World for a cloſe Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
that the <hi>Parthians</hi> excell'd all other
Nations in the Force of their Cavalry, and
the Dexterity of their Archers; that theſe
Things concurring with a Proviſion of all
War-like Stores, would put them in a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of eſtabliſhing and maintaining with eaſe
an Univerſal Monarchy; that whereas here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
the <hi>Parthian</hi> Spices and Silks, and
the Metals and curious Manufactures of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> were only imported by Merchants,
and that very rarely, and by ſtealth, that
after this Union there ſhould be a free and
open Uſe and Intercourſe of all Things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
between the two Nations.</p>
               <p>Upon receipt of the Letters, the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
at firſt refus'd to accord him his
Demands, and remonſtrated to him the
Inconveniences of a Match between a
<hi>Roman</hi> and one that was Barbarous;
<hi>That it would be impoſſible for them to
agree, each being an utter Stranger to the
others Language, and their Diet and Habit
ſo vaſtly different; that he had Noble men in</hi>
Rome <hi>whoſe Daughters he might take to
Wife, as he had his</hi> Arſacidae; <hi>that it was
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94482:123"/>
not convenient their Blood ſhould be corrupted
by any Foreign Mixture.</hi> Theſe were the
Reaſons he alledg'd for the rejecting his
Propoſal. But <hi>Antonine</hi> making freſh
Inſtances to him, and enforcing them
with rich Preſents, and repeated Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations
of his great Kindneſs and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the Princeſs, the <hi>Parthian</hi> was at
laſt prevail'd upon, and promis'd to
give him his Daughter, and began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to call him his Son-in-Law. The
News whereof being carried up and
down, the Barbarous People were put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all Things in Poſture for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
with Joy the near Proſpect of an
everlaſting Peace. <hi>Antonine</hi> paſs'd the
Rivers without Impeachment, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the <hi>Parthian</hi> Territories, which he
look'd upon as his own; the People all
along ſacrificing, and offering Incenſe
upon crowned Altars, with which Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
he appear'd extremely ſatisfied, and
advanc'd up into the Country, till he
drew near to the <hi>Parthian</hi> Court; at
which time <hi>Artabanus</hi> march'd out into a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94482:123"/>
ſpacious Plain that lies before the City,
to receive his Son-in-Law. Here were
great Numbers of <hi>Parthians,</hi> adorn'd
with Chaplets of Flowers of their own
growth, and Gowns of Silk flower'd
with Silver, and curiouſly dy'd. They
were celebrating a Feſtival, and dancing
with artful Motion, and due Obſervance
of Time, to the Muſick of Flutes,
Pipes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is an Entertainment
they are extremely delighted with, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they are enflam'd with
Wine.</p>
               <p>The Multitude were no ſooner drawn
together upon the Plain, but they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
their Horſes, threw aſide their
Bows and Quivers, and abandon'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Revellings and Feſtival Gaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The Concourſe of People was
very great, and, as Luck would have
it, they ſtood very diſorderly, without
the leaſt Jealouſie or Apprehenſion,
every Man preſſing forward to get a
Sight of the new Bridegroom. The
Opportunity being thus favourable, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine</hi>
gave the Signal to his Men to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94482:124"/>
begin the Maſſacre, having before given
poſitive Orders to put all to the Sword.
The Barbarians amaz'd with the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Encounter, ſoon turn'd their
Backs, and the <hi>Romans</hi> gave them chaſe,
killing many, and wounding more.
<hi>Artabanus</hi> was born off by his Guards,
and being ſet upon a Horſe, made his
Eſcape, with a ſmall Party, and great
Difficulty; all the reſt were cut to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
They wanted their Horſes, which
are of the greateſt Service to them in a
Battel; for they were diſmounted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and had turn'd them to graze:
Nor could they betake themſelves to
their Heels, which were entangled in the
looſe Garments that came down to
their Feet. Bows and Arrows they had
none, nor was there any Occaſion for
them at the Celebration of a Marriage.
<hi>Antonine,</hi> after he had made a great
Slaughter, return'd with great Numbers
of Priſoners, and a vaſt Booty, without
any Oppoſition, burning the Cities and
Villages to the Ground, and giving all
up to the Plunder and Ravage of his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94482:124"/>
Soldiers. Such was the Calamity which
befel the <hi>Parthians,</hi> in an Hour when
they leaſt expected it. <hi>Antonine,</hi> after
he had ſpoil'd and harraſs'd all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and his Soldiers were tir'd with
ravaging and killing, return'd into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia,</hi>
from whence he ſent an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi>
with the News, that he had made an
entire Conqueſt of the Eaſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
all thoſe Kingdoms under his
Dominion. The Senate, tho' they had
had true Accounts of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of this Expedition, (for 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for the Actions of Princes to be
conceal'd) yet out of Fear or Flattery they
decreed him all the Honours of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Generals. After this, he ſtaid ſome
time in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> following the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
of Hunting and Chariot-dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonine</hi> had two Generals, <hi>Audentius</hi>
and <hi>Macrinus;</hi> the firſt was an old Man,
reputed an excellent Captain, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unacquainted with Civil Buſineſs;
the latter was a good Lawyer, and an
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94482:125"/>
able Pleader. The Emperor would
often upbraid him publickly with want
of Courage and Military Conduct, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſometimes to the bittereſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.
He had been inform'd, that
<hi>Macrinus</hi> kept a good Table, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd
himſelf above a courſe and
common Diet; which the Emperor, out
of a Martial Humour, was extremely
delighted with. He heard alſo, that he
wore a Cloak, and dreſs'd after the
City-faſhion, which gave occaſion to the
Imputations he threw upon him, of
Softneſs and Effeminacy, and to his
threatning to kill him. Which Things
touch'd <hi>Macrinus</hi> ſo ſenſibly, that he
was not able any longer to bear them.</p>
               <p>About this time it hapned, that <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,</hi>
being naturally very curious, and
conſidering that he muſt die ſooner or
later, was very deſirous to enlarge the
View of his Underſtanding beyond the
Bounds of Humane Knowledge, and
to dive into the Secrets of Gods and
Demons. He fanſied every Body had a
Deſign upon his Life, conſulted all the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94482:125"/>
Oracles, and ſummon'd all Pretenders
to the Myſtery of Aſtrology and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-telling,
to rendezvous at his Court;
and herein he was ſo diligent, that not
one of that Kind of Impoſtors eſcap'd
him. But ſuſpecting that they did not
tell him what was moſt probable, but
what they imagin'd would pleaſe him
moſt, he ſent to <hi>Maternian</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi>
where he ſat at the Helm of Publick
Affairs, being the Emperor's greateſt
Favourite, and the only Man whom he
us'd with an univerſal Confidence. Him
he order'd to call a Council of the moſt
eminent of the <hi>Magi,</hi> and by Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
Art to enquire about the End
of his Life, and whether any Deſigns
were a-foot againſt the Government.
<hi>Maternian</hi> readily executed his Orders,
and whether the Spirits that were rais'd
made any ſuch Diſcovery to him, or he
did it out of a private Pique to <hi>Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
remains uncertain; but he gave the
Emperor to underſtand by Letter, that
<hi>Macrinus</hi> was in an Intrigue to gain the
Crown, and that it would behove him
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94482:126"/>
ſpeedily to cut him off. The Letter he
ſeal'd, and gave it amongſt other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as he us'd to do, to the Poſt, who
knew nothing of the Contents, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
his Journey with his uſual Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and came to the Emperor when
he was in his driving Equipage, and juſt
ready to mount his Chariot; he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the whole Packet to him, and
amongſt the reſt was the Letter which
concern'd <hi>Macrinus.</hi> The Emperor was
ſo ſet upon his Sport, that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Macrinus</hi> to take the Letters, and to
withdraw from the Company, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
them, and if there was any thing of
moment, to acquaint him with it; if
not, to do the Duties of his Office as
Captain of his Life-guard; which was
an Admonition he frequently repeated.
After he had given theſe Orders, he fell
to his Sports.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macrinus</hi> withdrew and loos'd the
Letters, and lighting upon that which was
of fatal importance to himſelf, ſaw how
imminent the Danger was, and knowing
the Emperor's Violence and Cruelty on
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94482:126"/>
theſe Occaſions, eſpecially when he had
any Pretence for it, wiſely ſuppreſs'd
the Letter, and gave him an Account,
as he us'd to do, of what was material
in the reſt: But apprehending a ſecond
Letter from <hi>Maternian</hi> upon the ſame
Subject, he thought it better to be active
than paſſive in a Caſe of this Nature,
and laid this Plot. There was one
<hi>Martial,</hi> a Centurion of the Emperor's
Life-guard, that always attended him,
his Brother had been put to death by
the Emperor, upon an Information
againſt him, without any Conviction.
The Emperor had alſo revil'd <hi>Martial</hi>
himſelf, calling him <hi>Cowardly Raſcal,</hi> and
<hi>Macrinus his Tool.</hi> So <hi>Macrinus</hi> ſent for
him, being in great Affliction, as well
for his Brother's Death, as his own ill
Treatment, not doubting but he would
be fit for his Purpoſe, becauſe he was
under great Obligations to him, and
had always been very ready to ſerve him.
He imparted to him his Deſign of taking
off <hi>Antonine,</hi> and deſir'd him to give the
Blow as ſoon as a favourable Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94482:127"/>
ſhould offer it ſelf: Which was no
ſooner propos'd than undertaken by
<hi>Martial, Macrinus</hi>'s Promiſes, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Murder, and his own Reſentments,
all conſpiring to puſh him forward to
the Attempt.</p>
               <p>It fell out, that ſoon after this Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was projected, the Emperor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then at <hi>Carrae</hi> a City of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi>
reſolv'd to viſit the Temple of the <hi>Moon,</hi>
which is held in extraordinary eſteem by
the Natives. This Temple ſtands at
a great diſtance from the City, ſo the
Emperor only took a few Horſemen
with him, that he might not harraſs his
whole Army, deſigning to return as ſoon
as he had ſacrific'd to the Deity of the
Place. In the middle of the Journey
he had a Motion to Stool, and order'd
all his Retinue to withdraw, and went
aſide to eaſe Nature, attended only by
one Servant, all the reſt retiring, and
ſtanding at a great diſtance, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
<hi>Martial,</hi> that warily obſerv'd all
his Motions, ſeeing him alone, ran to
him in great haſte, as if he had beckon'd
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:94482:127"/>
to him to hear or ſee ſomwhat, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Opportunity, when he ſtood
with his Back to him, and was buſied
in pulling down his Breeches, ſtabb'd
him with a Ponyard which he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
about him, of which he inſtantly
died. Thus <hi>Antonine</hi> receiv'd the fatal
Stroke, when he was the leaſt aware of it,
none of his Guards being near enough
to defend him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martial,</hi> as ſoon as the Buſineſs was
done, leap'd upon his Horſe, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to make his Eſcape; but the
<hi>German</hi> Horſemen, whom the Emperor
held in great Eſteem, and had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be of his Guard, being the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
his Perſon, and the firſt that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
what was done, inſtantly purſu'd
him, and levelling at him with their
Javelins, ſtruck him dead. The reſt of
the Soldiers, as ſoon as they heard of it,
ran together in great Diſorder; nor
was any Man's Sorrow more remarkable
upon this Occaſion than <hi>Macrinus</hi>'s; no
Man ſeem'd more affected, or ſhed
more Tears over the dead Body. The
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94482:128"/>
Diſaſter extremely afflicted the whole
Army; they conſider'd in him the Loſs
of a Companion and Fellow-Soldier,
more than that of a Prince. But no
Suſpicion was entertain'd of <hi>Macrinus,</hi> no
Man doubting but <hi>Martial</hi> was led by a
private Reſentment to the Commiſſion
of this Murder, and ſo every Man return'd
to his own Tent. <hi>Macrinus</hi> burnt the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and depoſiting the Aſhes in an Urn,
ſent them to his Mother in <hi>Antioch</hi> to be
buried. Theſe Misfortunes of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were laid ſo to Heart by the Mother,
that ſhe offer'd Violence to her ſelf;
but whether voluntarily, or by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
remains uncertain. Thus fell <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine</hi>
and his Mother <hi>Julia,</hi> after they
had liv'd as is before related. He reign'd
Six Years after the Death of his Father
and Brother.</p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Antonine,</hi> the Army
was in great irreſolution and uncertainty
what to do: So there was an <hi>Inter-reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
for two Days, which were ſpent in
Debates and Deliberations about a
Succeſſor. They had receiv'd Advice,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94482:128"/>
that <hi>Artabanus</hi> was advancing againſt
them with a mighty Force, being reſolv'd
to purſue his Revenge, and to ſacrifice
them to the Ghoſts of his Subjects,
whom they had treacherouſly murder'd
in a Time of Peace and Feſtival So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.
The Choice fell upon <hi>Auden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
who was reckon'd upon as a Man
of great Courage, and Experience in
the Art of War; but he excus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
alledging his Incapacity for ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
a Charge, by reaſon of his great
Age. Then they choſe <hi>Macrinus.</hi> This
Election was very much influenc'd by
the Tribunes, in favour of <hi>Macrinus,</hi>
who were after his Death look'd upon
as his Complices, and privy to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
againſt <hi>Antonine,</hi> as will appear in
the Sequel of this Hiſtory. So <hi>Macrinus</hi>
ſucceeded; the Army in this Election
being determin'd rather by the Neceſſity
of the Conjuncture, than by any Eſteem
or Confidence they had in the Perſon
elected.</p>
               <p>While theſe Things were in agitation,
<hi>Artabanus</hi> approach'd with a great Army,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94482:129"/>
compos'd of a great Force of Cavalry
and Archers, and Cuiraſſiers that rode
upon Camels, and fought with long
Spears. Whereupon <hi>Macrinus</hi> call'd his
Soldiers together, and harangu'd them
to the following Effect.</p>

                              <hi>I</hi> Don't wonder, Gentlemen, that you are
all ſo deeply afflicted with the Loſs of
ſuch a Prince, or rather of a Fellow-Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier:
But it is the Part of a Wiſe Man to
bear all the Traverſes of Fortune with Stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
and Moderation. His Memory ſhall
for ever be preſerv'd in our Breaſts, and
handed down to Poſterity, with the Immortal
Glory of his Great and Noble Atchievements;
nor ſhall we ever forget his ſingular Love
of you, which he teſtified in ſo unuſual a
Condeſcenſion, even by ſtooping to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Duties of the meaneſt Soldier. But
now that we have paid the Honours due to
his Memory, and diſcharg'd all Debts of that
Nature, it concerns us to conſult our own
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94482:129"/>
Welfare and Security. <hi>Artabanus</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
againſt us with the whole Power of
the Eaſt, and ſeems to have juſt Grounds
of Quarrel againſt us. We were the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors;
we infring'd the Treaty, and
made War upon him in the profoundeſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.
And now, Gentlemen, the whole
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire relies upon your Courage
and Fidelity. The Point in diſpute is not
about Rivers or Boundaries. Our whole
Fortunes lie at Stake. A mighty Potentate
comes againſt us, to execute Revenge for
the Murther of his Children and Relations,
who, he ſays, were unjuſtly maſſacred, and
in manifeſt violation of the moſt ſolemn
Leagues. My Advice is, that you ſtand to
your Arms, and be careful to keep your
Ranks according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline.
The Barbarians are an unform'd, irregular
Multitude; their very Numbers will be an
hindrance to them; whilſt your Order and
Military Skill will not only preſerve you
from Danger, but give you great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
over the Enemy. Take Heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and behave your ſelves as <hi>Romans</hi>
ought to do, and you have done hitherto. If
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94482:130"/>
you vanquiſh, you will not only reap the
Glory which this Action deſerves, but this
will be the moſt effectual Method of convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the World, that your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Victory over them was not gain'd by
Treachery and Surprize, but by true Valour
and Force of Arms.</p>

               <p>After he had ſpoke, the Soldiers ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Neceſſity of the preſent Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Affairs, rang'd themſelves in
Battel-array, and ſtood to their Arms.
As ſoon as the Sun roſe, <hi>Artabanus</hi> came
in ſight with a vaſt Army; and the
Barbarians, after they had worſhipp'd
the Sun with the uſual Ceremonies of
thoſe Countries, made the Onſet with
terrible Shouts. The Cavalry begun
the Charge with a Volley of Arrows.
The <hi>Romans</hi> were marſhall'd with great
Caution, and ſtood in very good Order.
The <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Cavalry was plac'd in both
the Wings; in the Lanes between the
Ranks were poſted Light-Horſemen,
that were ready to ſally out upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
Thus imbattell'd, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94482:130"/>
with great firmneſs the Charge
of the Barbarians, who gall'd them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
with the Multitude of their
Arrows, and the long Spears which the
Cuiraſſiers fought with from their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Camels. On the other Hand,
whenever they came to cloſe Combate,
the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſtill the better: But
when they found themſelves preſs'd by
the Enemies Horſe and Camels, which
were very numerous, they feign'd a
Flight, and ſo decoy'd the Barbarians
amongſt ſharp Iron Stakes, and other
Engines that were prepared beforehand.
Theſe Stakes were cover'd with Sand,
ſo well, that they were not diſcover'd;
which made this Stratagem prove very
fatal to the Enemies Horſe: For as ſoon
as they rode amongſt them, their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but eſpecially their Camels, that
have very tender Hoofs, began to halt,
and throw their Riders to the Ground.
Now the <hi>Parthians</hi> as long as they are
on Horſeback behave themſelves very
manfully; but whenever they come to
diſmount or fall from their Horſes, they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94482:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are eaſily taken, and are not able to
bear the Shock of a cloſe Engagement.
Beſide, they are ſo encumber'd by a
looſe Garment about their Legs, that
they can neither fly nor purſue. The
Engagement laſted two whole Days,
from Sun riſe to Sun-ſet, till the Night
coming on put an end to it; at which
time they return'd to their reſpective
Camps, each eſteeming the Advantage
to be on his own Side. The third Day
both Sides drew their Armies out into
the Field, and the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who were
far the moſt numerous, endeavour'd to
ſurround the <hi>Romans;</hi> but they diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them, by enlarging the Front
of their Army to a great breadth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any conſiderable depth. The Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Men and Beaſts that were
ſlain was ſo great, that they fill'd the
Field. The dead Bodies were pil'd up
to a vaſt height, eſpecially the Camels,
that fell one upon another in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which cut off all poſſibility of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging;
for the Armies could neither
ſee nor come at one another, by reaſon

<hi>remain'd ſtill in</hi> Antioch, <hi>from
whence he ſent Letters, directed to the
Senate and People of</hi> Rome, <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
whereof was,</hi> That he thought it
needleſs to uſe many Words to them, who
were ſo well acquainted with the Principles
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94482:133"/>
on which he had all along acted, with his
natural Diſpoſition to Gentleneſs, and with
his conſtant Moderation in the whole Courſe
of his late Miniſtry, wherein his Authority
was little inferior to that of the Emperor,
whoſe Perſon was committed to his Faith
and Protection, as Captain of the Life-guard.
They knew very well his Diſlike of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
Proceedings, and that he had often
interpos'd on their behalf, with no ſmall
Hazard to himſelf, when the Emperor by
falſe Suggeſtions, which he very much heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to, was urg'd on to violent Counſels:
That he had often caſt Aſperſions upon him,
and had publickly reproach'd him on the
ſcore of his Mildneſs and Love of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and had therefore accus'd him of Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Diſſoluteneſs of Manners: That
he always entertain'd Flatterers, and ſuch as
inflam'd him by their Calumnies, and ſpurr'd
him on to Cruelty, looking upon them as his
trueſt Friends, and the warmeſt Zealots for
his Intereſts: That for his own part, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
approv'd gentle Methods; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had put an end to the War with the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> which had made the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94482:134"/>
tremble: That in the Action of the War
they came no way ſhort of the Enemy in
Proweſs and Gallantry: That by the Peace
which he had concluded, a formidable Enemy,
that was advanc'd againſt them with a puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Force, was become their Friend and
Allie: That as long as he ſhould be their
Prince, a ſtop ſhould be put to Effuſions of
Blood, and Alarms of War; the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſhould be lower'd, and the Privileges of
the Subject advanc'd, and Arbitrary Power
ſhould ſink into an <hi>Ariſtocracy:</hi> That there
was no Reaſon why they ſhould eſteem him
unworthy of the Empire, or judge it the
Error of a blind Chance, by which he was
exalted from a Private Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi>
to this high Station: That there was no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in high Birth, unleſs it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with Moderation and Clemency: That
the Gifts of Fortune were often caſt on
thoſe that did not deſerve them; but the
Vertues of the Mind ſtamp'd a real Value and
Dignity on all that poſſeſs'd them: That
Eſtate, Luſter of Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might make
a Man happy, but were not good Topicks
of Commendation, becauſe they are deriv'd
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94482:134"/>
from others; but Gentleneſs and Humanity
are not only admir'd by all Men, but redound
to the real Praiſe of thoſe whom they adorn:
That the Publick had receiv'd no Benefit
from the Noble Parentage of <hi>Commodus,</hi>
nor from <hi>Antonine</hi>'s ſucceeding his Father:
That theſe Princes take the Empire as it were
by Right of Inheritance, and abuſe it as their
own Patrimony; but thoſe that receiv'd it
from the free Gift of the People, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
remain ſenſible of the infinite Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and will ſtill be meditating Returns pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to ſo great a Merit. Beſides,
this Nobility diſpos'd them to Arrogance, and
a Contempt of their Subjects, as their Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors;
whereas thoſe that advanc'd through
inferior Employments to this high Dignity,
would endeavour to defend it as the Reward
of their Induſtry, and will pay the ſame
Reſpect and Deference which they us'd to do
to thoſe who were their Superiors before this
Elevation. As for his part, he would do
nothing without their Approbation; they
ſhould be his Counſellors, and have a Share
in the Conduct of all Publick Affairs, and
ſhould enjoy their ancient Liberty and Repoſe,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94482:135"/>
which their High-born Princes had depriv'd
them of, and which <hi>Marcus,</hi> and after him
<hi>Pertinax,</hi> both Men of mean Extraction,
had endeavour'd to reſtore: <hi>Concluding,</hi>
That it was better to be the firſt of a
Noble Family, than to debaſe that Nobility
which was tranſmitted from Glorious Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
by declining from the generous Paths
in which they trod.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Letter was read, all
the Senators broke out into Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Joy, and unanimouſly decreed
him Imperial Honours: But they were
more overjoy'd that <hi>Antonine</hi> was dead,
than that <hi>Macrinus</hi> ſucceeded him; which
was expreſs'd by Publick Rejoycings
made on that Occaſion. All common
Informers, and Servants that had accus'd
their Maſters, were publickly Gibbeted;
and what by Proſcriptions, what by
Capital Puniſhments inflicted on profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
Villains, the City, and indeed the
whole Empire was pretty well purg'd.
Thoſe that lay conceal'd, were quiet,
for fear of the Juſtice of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So the People liv'd in Security,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94482:135"/>
and enjoy'd at leaſt an Appearance, and
as it were a firſt Dawn of Liberty, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that one Year in which <hi>Macrinus</hi>
reign'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macrinus</hi> commitred a great <hi>Soloeciſm</hi>
in not disbanding and diſperſing the
Soldiers, and in that he did not haſten
to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Preſence was greatly
deſired, and whither he was invited by
the daily repeated Clamours of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
But he ſtaid in <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he
began to affect a long Beard and ſlow
Gate. He would ſcarce vouchſafe to
ſpeak to thoſe that came to him; and
when he did, he often ſpoke ſo low,
it was a hard matter to tell what he ſaid.
In theſe Particulars he copied after <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
and they were the only Actions of
that Prince which he imitated; for he
abandon'd himſelf to diſſolute Courſes,
became a great frequenter of Plays and
Muſick-meetings, neglected Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and appear'd always in Publick
with Buttons, and a Belt curiouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd
with Gold and Precious Stones.
This Luxury was by no means pleaſing
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94482:136"/>
to the Army, that look'd upon it as an
unmanly Softneſs, better becoming a
Woman, or the Barbarous Nations,
than the Emperor of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe
things, I ſay, gave great diſguſts to the
Soldiers; they diſlik'd his Courſe of
Life, as too effeminate; and calling to
mind <hi>Antonine</hi>'s Way of Living, which
was ſuch as became a Soldier and a Man
of Buſineſs, they condemn'd <hi>Macrinus</hi>'s
Luxury. Beſides, they murmur'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
that they were not permitted to
return home, but were conſtrain'd to
live in a Camp in a Foreign Country,
where ſometimes they wanted neceſſary
Proviſions, and that too after a Peace
was concluded. They obſerv'd too at
the ſame time, how ſoftly and delicately
the Emperor liv'd. So, in ſhort, things
tended to a Rebellion. They began to
ſpeak diſreſpectfully of him, and only
ſought for ſome ſort of Pretence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this Author of their Grievances.
Thus it pleas'd the Fates that <hi>Macrinus</hi>
having revell'd it in Imperial Dignity
for the ſpace of one Year, ſhould loſe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94482:136"/>
his Life and Empire together; Fortune
ſoon affording a ſlight Occaſion to the
Soldiers for the effecting what they
deſir'd.</p>
               <p>There was a certain Lady call'd <hi>Maeſa,</hi>
born in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> in the City <hi>Emeſa.</hi>
She was Siſter to <hi>Julia, Severus</hi>'s Wife,
and Mother to <hi>Antonine,</hi> and had liv'd
many Years in the Emperor's Court in
her Siſters Time, both in the Reign of
<hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Antonine;</hi> but after her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Death, and the Murder of <hi>Antonine,</hi>
was commanded by <hi>Macrinus</hi> to depart
into her own Country with her Effects,
which were very conſiderable, by reaſon
of her living at Court ſo many Years.
<hi>Maeſa</hi> obey'd the Orders, and return'd
into <hi>Phoenicia.</hi> This old Lady had two
Daughters, the elder <hi>Soaemis,</hi> and <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maea</hi>
the younger: Each of theſe had a
Son; <hi>Soaemis</hi> call'd hers <hi>Baſſian, Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maea</hi>'s
was nam'd <hi>Alexian:</hi> Both the
Youths were bred up under the Care of
their Mother and Grandmother. <hi>Baſſian</hi>
was about Fourteen Years old, <hi>Alexian</hi>
had juſt enter'd his Tenth Year. They
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94482:137"/>
were both Prieſts of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is
the God of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and in their
Language is call'd <hi>Heliogabulus.</hi> They
have a magnificent Temple built for
him, adorn'd with Gold and Silver and
Precious Stones. Nor do the Natives
only worſhip this God, but all the
neighbouring Princes and Potentates ſend
rich Preſents to him every Year. They
have no Statue made with Hands in the
likeneſs of the God, as is uſual amongſt
the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> but only a huge
Stone, that is round at the bottom, and
grows ſharper by degrees towards the
top. The Colour of it is Black, and
the Figure Conical. The Tradition is,
that it fell from Heaven. It hath ſome
little Rudeneſſes and Marks upon it.
They ſay 'tis the Image of the <hi>Sun,</hi> not
made by any mortal Artificer, and eſteem
it as ſuch. <hi>Baſſian</hi> was ordain'd his
Prieſt, and performed the Functions of
the Prieſts Office, as being the Elder,
appearing publickly in his barbarous
Formalities, which were a Gown of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Silk flower'd with Gold, that came
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:94482:137"/>
down to his Feet and Hands, all his
Legs being cover'd with Under-Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the ſame Silk. Upon his
Head he wore a Crown, richly adorn'd
with Precious Stones of ſeveral Colours.
Beſides, he was then in the flower of his
Age, and the goodlieſt Youth of his
Time. So Youth and Native Beauty
being ſet off with all the Advantages of
a ſoft and charming Dreſs, might well
give occaſion to his Admirers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
him with the beautiful Images of
<hi>Bacchus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While he was ſacrificing and dancing
about the Altars, according to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Rites of the Country, with
Flutes, Pipes, and all ſorts of Muſical
Inſtruments, all the People, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Soldiers, took a ſtricter View of
him than ordinary, either becauſe they
knew he was of the Imperial Line, or
the Charms of his Beauty drew the Eyes
of all Men upon him. There was at
that time a great Army near the Town,
that lay there to cover <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> but was
afterwards commanded away, as ſhall
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94482:138"/>
be related in due time. The Soldiers
came every day to Town, and to the
Temple for the ſake of Divine Worſhip,
and were wonderfully pleas'd with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lad. Some of theſe were <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>'s
Acquaintance, that were fled from
<hi>Rome,</hi> amongſt whom ſhe whiſper'd,
when ſhe perceiv'd how much they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
the Youth, <hi>That he was</hi> Antonine'<hi>s
Natural Son, tho' he was reputed another
Man's: That when ſhe liv'd at Court in her
Siſters Time, the ſaid Emperor had Intrigues
with her Daughters, that were then young
and handſom.</hi> Whether this was true, or
only an Artifice, remains uncertain; but
however it was, as ſoon as they got hold
of this Report, they handed it from
one Soldier to another, till it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
through the whole Army. It
was alſo given out, <hi>That</hi> Maeſa <hi>had a
prodigious Fond of Money, and that ſhe would
freely diſtribute it amongſt them, provided
they would re-eſtabliſh her Family in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
Hereupon it was concerted, <hi>That
if ſhe would come privately by Night to the
Camp with her Family, they would receive
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94482:138"/>
her, and proclaim the Son of</hi> Antonine
<hi>Emperor.</hi> Which was no ſooner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the old Lady, but ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
inſtantly to put her ſelf into their
Hands, being reſolv'd to run any
Riſque, rather than live privately, and
be thus neglected. Purſuant to theſe
Counſels, ſhe got out of the City pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
with her Daughters and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children,
and was conducted by the ſaid
Soldiers of her Acquaintance that were
fled from <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Fortifications of
the Camp, where ſhe eaſily gain'd Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance;
and the Queſtion being put,
the Soldiers were all unanimous, that
their young Emperor ſhould be called
<hi>Antonine:</hi> After which, they put upon
him Purple Robes. Then they laid
in Proviſions, and took in their Wives
and Children, and all their Effects that
were in the adjacent Country or Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and ſhutting up their Gates, began
to put themſelves into a Poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ſo as to endure a formal Siege, if
Occaſion ſhould require.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:94482:139"/>
                  <hi>Macrinus</hi> receiv'd Advertiſement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
when he was in <hi>Antioch;</hi> and the
News was carried to all the other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that a Son was found to <hi>Antonine,</hi>
and that <hi>Julia</hi>'s Siſter diſtributed Money
to the Soldiers. They took Things
upon truſt, and thought every Thing
true that was related to them for ſuch,
and were in great uncertainty of Mind.
Their Diſaffection to <hi>Macrinus,</hi> and a
kind of Compaſſion which they had for
the Memory of <hi>Antonine,</hi> were of ſome
force to make them deſire a Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but the Hopes of Gain had the
greateſt weight, and influenc'd great
Numbers to fly over to the new <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macrinus</hi> look'd upon all this as a
Childiſh Enterprize, and retaining his
uſual gaiety of Temper, ſtaid at home,
and ſent <hi>Julian,</hi> one of his Generals,
with a ſufficient Force, as he thought, to
reduce the Rebels; who no ſooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
their Walls, but they ſhew'd
their young Emperor upon the Turrets
and Ramparts, and ſhouted aloud, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94482:139"/>
the Son of</hi> Antonine! They alſo
held up Bags full of Money, well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
that nothing was a more
effectual Bait to tempt Traytors. And
ſo it hapned; for <hi>Julian</hi>'s Soldiers eaſily
believ'd he was <hi>Antonine</hi>'s Son, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
themſelves that he extremely
reſembled him, cut off <hi>Julian</hi>'s Head,
and ſent it to <hi>Macrinus,</hi> and were receiv'd
with open Gates into the Camp. After
this Reinforcement, the Rebels were in
Condition not only to hold out a Siege,
but to engage in a pitch'd Battel: Their
Numbers alſo encreas'd every Day, by
Deſerters that came over to them.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Macrinus</hi> receiv'd Advice
of this Diſaſter, he appointed a general
Muſter of his Forces, and advanc'd with
his whole Army againſt the Rebels, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to force their Trenches. <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi>
found that his Soldiers would not
ſtay to be attack'd in their Camp, but
were ready to march out againſt <hi>Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and give him Battel: So he drew
his whole Force out into the Field. The
Engagement was in the Confines of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94482:140"/>
                  <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia. Antonine</hi>'s Soldiers
were alarm'd by the Fears of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their traiterous Practices, in
caſe they ſhould be vanquiſh'd, and
therefore they exerted their utmoſt
Vigour; but <hi>Macrinus</hi>'s Men fought
more lazily, great Numbers deſerting,
and going over to the Rebels; inſomuch
that <hi>Macrinus</hi> fearing leſt they ſhould all
abandon him, and he ſhould be made
Priſoner by the Rebels, and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his Uſage would not be the beſt
if he ſhould fall into their Hands, when
it was almoſt Night, and his Soldiers
yet maintain'd the Fight, he threw off
his Imperial Cloak, and all the other
Badges of Majeſty, and fled, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
only by a few Captains,
whom he eſteem'd the moſt faithful to
his Intereſts. He ſhav'd his Beard, that
he might not be diſcover'd, and putting
himſelf in travelling Equipage, he poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both Night and Day with his Head
cover'd, preventing even the Fame of
his bad Fortune. The Captains were
very diligent in preſſing the Coaches, as
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:94482:140"/>
if <hi>Macrinus</hi> had ſtill been Emperor, and
they had been ſent on ſome important
Diſpatches.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Macrinus</hi> eſcap'd: The Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
continu'd; the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Band,
which is a ſelect Number of the talleſt
Men, choſen out of the whole Army to
guard the Emperor's Perſon, maintain'd
their Ground, and ſuſtain'd the Fury of
all the Enemies Forces; the reſt were all
for <hi>Antonine.</hi> But when <hi>Macrinus</hi> had
not been ſeen of a long time, nor any
Enſigns of Imperial Majeſty could be
deſcry'd, and his Men knew not what
was become of him, whether he was
ſlain or fled, they were in great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
what Meaſures to take, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
at laſt to hazard themſelves no
longer for a Man that was no where to
be found; and yet they were afraid to
render themſelves, and be caſt on the
Faith of the Enemy. As ſoon as <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi>
underſtood by Deferters that <hi>Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
was fled, he ſent Heralds to ſignifie
to his Men, <hi>That it was in vain to fight
for a Coward and a Fugitive;</hi> and offer'd
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94482:141"/>
them a Pardon and Oblivion of what
was paſt, and ſwore he would obſerve
it, and conſtituted them his Life-guard.
They accepted the Terms, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
Whereupon <hi>Antonine</hi> ſent out a
Detachment to purſue <hi>Macrinus,</hi> who
was got a conſiderable way before them.
They found him at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> a City of
<hi>Bithynia,</hi> extremely indiſpos'd by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
of ſo long a Journey, and took
him in his Concealment in a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe-near
the City, and beheaded him.
'Twas ſaid, he was making what haſte
he could to <hi>Rome,</hi> in confidence of the
Zeal and Affections of the Populace;
but as he was paſſing over the <hi>Propontis</hi>
into <hi>Europe,</hi> he was forc'd back by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Guſts when he was near <hi>Byzanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
even the Winds conſpiring to draw
him back to his Deſtruction. So near
he was eſcaping his Purſuers. He died
moſt infamouſly. He would have gone
to <hi>Rome</hi> now, when it was too late;
whereas he ought to have done it as ſoon
as he was declar'd Emperor. Thus fell
<hi>Macrinus,</hi> both his Fortunes and his
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94482:141"/>
Counſels failing him, together with his
Son <hi>Diadumenianus,</hi> whom he had made
<hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the whole Army came
over to <hi>Antonine,</hi> and own'd him Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:
So he took upon him the Supreme
Authority, and his Grandmother, with
the Aſſiſtance of her Friends, made ſuch
Regulations in the Eaſt as the State of
Affairs did moſt require, (for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was very young, and unskilful in
Buſineſs and Letters) after which the
Army was preſently commanded to
march, <hi>Maeſa</hi> being impatient to viſit
the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, where ſhe had liv'd
ſo long.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as theſe Things were noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the <hi>Roman</hi> People and Senate,
they were by no means ſatisfied; but
the Neceſſity of Affairs determin'd them
to a Submiſſion to what the Army had
been pleas'd to ordain. Nevertheleſs,
all Men condemn'd <hi>Macrinus</hi>'s Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and his looſe and diſſolute Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and look'd upon him as the ſole
Author of his own Miſeries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:94482:142"/>
                  <hi>Antonine</hi> march'd out of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the
Seaſon of the Year oblig'd him to Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> Here he ran into the
moſt prodigious Riots and Exceſſes,
turn'd the Worſhip of his God into a
Scene of Buffoonry, was beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
luxurious in his Clothes, wore Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Silks flower'd with Gold, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
nicely deck'd with Jewels, Bracelets,
and Coronets made in the Faſhion of a
Turban, and embeliſh'd with Gold and
great Variety of Precious Stones. His
Habit was between the Sacred Robe of
the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and the ſoft Apparel of
the <hi>Medes.</hi> He ſcorn'd the Attire of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> becauſe it was made
of Cloth, which he us'd to term a vile
Manufacture. Nothing would pleaſe
him but <hi>Syrian</hi> Silks, in which he often
appear'd abroad with a Conſort of
Flutes and Pipes, to celebrate the <hi>Orgies</hi>
of his God.</p>
               <p>This Conduct of his did not pleaſe
<hi>Maeſa</hi> by any Means; ſhe laid out her
utmoſt Efforts to reconcile him to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Habit, and remonſtrated to him,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94482:142"/>
                  <hi>if he ſhould enter the City and Senate in
that Garb, how offenſive it would be to the</hi>
Romans, <hi>who are not accuſtom'd to theſe
Fopperies, eſteeming them unworthy of a
Man, and tolerable only in the weaker Sex.</hi>
But he took little notice of what ſhe
ſaid, nor would hearken to any Lectures
that were read to him upon that Subject
by any body elſe: For he admitted
none into any degree of Intimacy but
Flatterers, and Men of his own Morals,
that would make no ſcruple to extol
even the worſt of his Vices. Moreover
he reſolv'd to uſe the Senate and People
of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Sight of his Garb, and
try how they would bear it, before he
came amongſt them; and to this end
caus'd his Picture to be taken at length
in all his Formalities, in which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in Publick, or when he ſacrific'd.
His God was repreſented in the ſame
Piece, and he was drawn ſacrificing to
him. This Draught he ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and order'd it to be plac'd in the middle
of the Senate, above the Image of
Victory, in the higheſt part of the Houſe,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94482:143"/>
that when the Senators were aſſembled,
they might offer Incenſe and ſacrifice
Wine to it. He alſo gave out Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that all the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrates, and
ſuch as perform'd Publick Sacrifices,
ſhould invoke their new God <hi>Heliogabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
before any other God ordinarily
mention'd at thoſe Solemnities.</p>
               <p>When he arriv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> the People
were not much ſtartled at the Original,
having been ſo well us'd to the Copy.
Here he threw a Largeſs amongſt the
People, as is ordinary for Emperors
upon their Acceſſion to the Crown, and
exhibited Shews of all ſorts with great
Magnificence. Then he built a large
and beautiful Temple for his God, and
commanded a great many Altars to be
rais'd about it, on which he ſacrific'd
every Day Hecatombs of Bulls, and
great Numbers of Sheep. He heap'd
Spices upon them, and pour'd out many
Casks of the oldeſt and beſt Wine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that Streams of Wine mix'd
with Blood ran all over the Temple.
After this he fell to dancing about the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94482:143"/>
Altars, to a Conſort of all ſort of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Inſtruments, and the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
fell in with him, and tript it about
with Cymbals and Timbrels in their
Hands. During this Solemnity, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
and Gentry of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtood about
him in the form of a Theater. The
Intrails of the Victims, and the Spices,
were carried in Veſſels of Gold, upon
the Heads, not of Servants, or Men of
mean Condition, but of his Generals,
and of Perſons in the moſt honourable
Employments, that were habited after
the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Faſhion, in Robes that
came down to their Hands and Feet,
and wore Linen Shooes, in imitation of
the Prophets of thoſe Countries. He
thought he conferr'd a ſignal Honour
on thoſe whom he permitted to aſſiſt at
thoſe Solemnities.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Emperor ſeem'd thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
devoted to a Humour of Dancing
and Sacrificing, yet he put to death ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
rich and eminent Men, who, as he
was inform'd, diſlik'd his Courſe of
Life, and had preſum'd to make him
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94482:144"/>
the Subject of their Raillery. He took
to Wife a Lady of the moſt Illuſtrious
Quality amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd
her ſoon after, diveſted her of
all Imperial Honours, and confin'd her
to a private Sphere. Afterwards, that
his Actions might have ſomething of the
Man in them, pretending to be mightily
in love with a Veſtal Prieſteſs, that by
the Sacred Conſtitutions of the <hi>Romans</hi>
is oblig'd to perpetual Chaſtity, he
took her by force out of the Temple,
and married her: But that it might be
done with as good a Grace as the Thing
would bear, he wrote to the Senate, to
extenuate the Guilt of an Action which
was in it ſelf ſo Criminal: The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Apology was, <hi>That Humane
Frailty had betray'd him into the Sin; that
his Paſſion for the Maid was extreme; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
no Match could be more congruous or
ſacred, than that of a Prieſt with a Prieſteſs.</hi>
Not long after he divorc'd this Wife
alſo, and married for his third a Lady
of <hi>Commodus</hi>'s Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:94482:144"/>
Nor did he only play at Faſt and
Looſe with Humane Matrimonies, but
was now ſeeking out for a Wife to his
God. So he remov'd the Image of
<hi>Pallas,</hi> (which the <hi>Romans</hi> worſhip, but
are not allow'd to ſee) into his Bed-chamber.
It had never been mov'd
ſince it was brought from <hi>Troy,</hi> but once
when the Temple was in a Flame, till
now it was fetch'd into the Imperial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
in order to be married. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
the Emperor reported, <hi>That his
God had no great Affection for ſuch an
arm'd Virago;</hi> and therefore he ſent for
the Image of <hi>Urania,</hi> which is held in
great Veneration by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
and all the Nations of <hi>Africk.</hi> It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be erected by the <hi>Phoenician
Dido,</hi> when ſhe founded <hi>Carthage</hi> on the
Ground which ſhe encompaſs'd with the
Bulls Hide. The <hi>Africans</hi> call it <hi>Urania,</hi>
and the <hi>Phoenicians, Aſtroarch,</hi> or <hi>the
Moon:</hi> Whereupon the Emperor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd,
<hi>That the Match would be very
ſuitable between the</hi> Sun <hi>and</hi> Moon; and
commanded the Image to be brought
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94482:145"/>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> with all the rich Ornaments of
the Temple, and a very conſiderable
Treaſure, which he order'd to be given
with the Goddeſs as her Portion. Upon
her arrival ſhe was plac'd at a ſmall
Diſtance from the God, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
iſſu'd out Orders to the People in
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> to celebrate a Feſtival,
with all the Demonſtrations of Joy,
publick and private, for the Marriage
of the Gods. He built alſo a large and
magnificent Temple near the City, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he made an Anniverſary Proceſſion
with his God about Midſummer. He
exhibited all ſorts of Publick Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as Stage-plays, Chariot-races,
Banquets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he thought were
of a popular Nature, and ſerv'd to
amuſe the Multitude. The Proceſſion
was in this manner. The God was
ſeated in a Chariot richly adorn'd with
Gold and Precious Stones; in this he
was carried out of the City, with great
Solemnity, to the Temple. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
was drawn by Six white Horſes, that
were above the ordinary Proportion,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94482:145"/>
and richly accouter'd: The God held
the Reins. No Mortal ever ſat in the
Chariot, but all ſtood around and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Divine Charioteer. The Emperor
held the Bridle, and ran all the way
backward, keeping his Eyes fix'd upon
the Image. The Way was ſtrow'd with
Filings of Gold, and he was ſupported
by Soldiers on both Sides, to prevent
his falling or ſtumbling, his Eyes being
ſo engag'd, that he could not ſee his
Way. The People ran on each Side
with Torches, Flowers, and Garlands.
Then came the Images of all the Gods,
with all the Enſigns of Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and the richeſt Furniture of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and the moſt magnificent Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Temple. All the Gentry
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the whole Army, march'd
before the God with ſolemn Pace, and
conducted him to the Temple, where
when he was plac'd, and the Sacrifices
and Solemnities whereof we have before
made mention were perform'd, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
from vaſtly high Turrets, erected
there by his Direction, ſcatter'd, by way
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94482:146"/>
of Largeſs amongſt the Multitude,
Tickets for Goblets of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
for Clothes and Linen of all ſorts,
for all Kinds of Beaſts, wild and tame,
except Hogs, from which he abſtain'd
in conformity to the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Cuſtoms.
Great Numbers periſh'd in the ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
for theſe Tickets, being trod to
death in the Crowd, or puſh'd upon the
Spears of the Soldiers; ſo that it prov'd
a fatal Feſtival to many. He often
danc'd and drove in Publick, diſdain'd
to cloak his Follies, and appear'd abroad
with his Eyes and Cheeks painted, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring
that Beauty which Nature had
beſtow'd upon him, by an uncomely
Varniſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maeſa</hi> in this <hi>interim</hi> obſerv'd how
much the Soldiers were diſguſted with
the Extravagances of their Prince; and
fearing, if any thing ſhould befall him,
that ſhe ſhould be forc'd to relapſe into
her private Condition, ſhe perſwaded the
light headed Youth to adopt <hi>Mammaea's</hi>
Son, that was his Couſin-german, and
her Grandſon, and declare him <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:94482:146"/>
To compaſs which, ſhe accoſted him
with a cajolling Harangue, wherein ſhe
repreſented to him, <hi>how ſuitable it would
be to his Character to attend Religious Rites
and Ceremonies, to perform the Functions of
his Office, and aſſiſt at the Worſhip and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his God; that in the mean time
ſome Perſon ſhould be impower'd to take
care of the Civil Government, to take from
him the Burden of a Crown, and free him
from the Avocations which the Affairs of the
Empire might otherwiſe give him; and that
this Truſt ought rather to be committed to
an Ally and a Relation, than to a Stranger.</hi>
Hereupon <hi>Alexian</hi> was alter'd into <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
the Name of that renown'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi>
who was ſo highly eſteem'd and
honour'd by <hi>Antonine,</hi> the ſuppos'd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of both theſe Princes: For both
<hi>Maeſa</hi> and her Daughters, with a ſort of
Pride and Vanity, publiſh'd their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Amours with him, to inflame the
Affections of the Soldiers to their Sons.
So <hi>Alexander</hi> was declar'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and
join'd with <hi>Antonine</hi> in the <hi>Conſulate,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he enter'd into the Senate, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94482:147"/>
this Matter was ratified by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that Aſſembly. The Point was
carried without any Oppoſition, all Men
concurring in the Decree, tho' nothing
could be more ridiculous and abſurd,
<hi>Antonine,</hi> who was only Sixteen Years
old, being made Father to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
who was then in his Twelfth Year, by
vertue thereof.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was he declar'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but
<hi>Antonine</hi> had a mind to train him up in
his own Method: He would have him
dance, and bear a Share in the Prieſt's
Office, wear the ſame Habit, and do the
ſame Thing that he did: But his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had an Eye upon him, and reſtrain'd
him from all Indecencies that might ill
beſeem a Man in his Station, ſent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
for Maſters in all Sorts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
infus'd into him honeſt and ſober
Notions and Principles, accuſtom'd him
to Wreſtling, and other manly Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
and inſtructed him in the <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latin</hi> Learning.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things highly offended <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,</hi>
inſomuch that he repented that he
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:94482:147"/>
had adopted him, and made him his
Collegue. He commanded all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
inſtantly to depart the Court, ſome
of the moſt eminent he put to death,
others he baniſh'd, ridiculouſly alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Reaſons to juſtifie theſe Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>That they corrupted his Son, that they
would not ſuffer him to dance and revel, that
they ty'd him up to Modeſty of Behaviour,
and inſtructed him in Manly Duties.</hi> Yea,
his Infatuation ran ſo high, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
Stage-players and common Actors
to the higheſt Dignities in the Empire.
He gave the Command of the <hi>Praetorian</hi>
Band to one that had danc'd publickly
on the Theater; he took another from
the Stage to ſuperintend the Education
of Youth, and to approve and admit
ſuch as were elected into the Order of
Gentlemen or Senators. He commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Chariot-drivers, Comedians, and
Buffoons, the Execution of the moſt
important Truſts in the Government,
and gave the Lieutenancy of Provinces
to ſuch of his Slaves and Freed-men as
had the greateſt Vices to recommend
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:94482:148"/>
them. Theſe Things bred Diſcontents
and ill Humours in the People, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Soldiers; they deſpis'd him
for his Niceneſs in adjuſting the Air of
his Face, which was ſuch as a Woman
could not be guilty of, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
her Claim to Modeſty. He wore
Necklaces of Gold; his Clothes and
Garniture were wonderfully effeminate;
and thus attir'd, he danc'd frequently in
Publick. So the Army and People were
alienated from him, and biaſs'd ſtrongly
in favour of <hi>Alexander.</hi> They conceiv'd
greater Hopes in a Youth that was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
and vertuouſly educated, and
guarded him with great diligence, to
defeat the Practices ſet afoot by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt his Life. His Mother <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maea</hi>
would not ſuffer him to eat or drink
any thing that was ſent to him from that
Hand. He did not make uſe of the
Cooks and Butlers that ordinarily ſerv'd
the Court, but of ſuch as his Mother
made choice of, after manifold Proofs
of their Fidelity. She alſo ſent Money
to be diſtributed privately amongſt the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94482:148"/>
Soldiers, to miniſter Fuel to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Zeal for <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to link them
to his Intereſts by Money, the Spring
which gives Life to their moſt vigorous
Motions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonine</hi> had Intimations of all theſe
Things, and left no Stone unturn'd to
accompliſh the Ruine of <hi>Alexander</hi>
and his Mother; but <hi>Maeſa</hi> manag'd
Matters with that Dexterity, that he
miſcarried in all his Deſigns againſt them.
She was a Woman of a ſubtil Brain,
and had liv'd many Years at Court
with her Siſter <hi>Julia,</hi> Wife to <hi>Severus,</hi>
and was now let into all <hi>Antonine</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
who was naturally ſhallow, and
ſtill diſcovering himſelf, and betraying
his own Counſels.</p>
               <p>When he found that all his Projects
to ruine his Brother fell to the Ground
without effect, he reſolv'd to take from
him the Title and Dignity of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and
would not ſuffer him to be compliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor permit any Reſpect to be paid
him in Publick. The Soldiers enquir'd
diligently after him, and murmur'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94482:149"/>
at his Diſgrace. So <hi>Antonine</hi>
ſpread a Report that he lay at the point
of Death, to try how the Army would
take it; which gave a deep Wound to
them, eſpecially when he was no where
to be found, and put them in ſo violent
a Rage, that they refus'd to ſend the
ordinary Guards to the Emperor, but
ſhut themſelves up in the Camp, and
ſent their Demands to Court, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a View of <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Temple.
This infinitely alarm'd <hi>Antonine,</hi> ſo that
without delay he took his Brother with
him in his Imperial Chariot, that was
richly adorn'd with Gold and Precious
Stones, and drove with great haſte to
the Camp. The Soldiers receiv'd them
both with open Gates, and conducted
them to the Temple in the Camp;
and <hi>Alexander</hi> was extravagantly careſs'd
by the whole Army, and receiv'd with
Shouts of Joy; but <hi>Antonine</hi> was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Coldneſs and Neglect. This
ſtruck him to the Heart; ſo lodging
that Night in the Temple of the Camp,
and being not able to brook the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94482:149"/>
he commanded the Men who had
been the moſt forward in beſtowing their
Applauſes upon <hi>Alexander</hi> to be ſeiz'd
upon, as the Authors of a Sedition and
a Riot, in order to be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign
Puniſhment. This begot a general
Reſentment in the Army; they hated
<hi>Antonine</hi> on a Foreign Score, and had
long wiſh'd that an end could be put to
his infamous Deportment; they alſo
thought themſelves bound in Honour to
reſcue their Companions that were under
Arreſt; and at this time they ſeem'd to
have juſt Grounds, and a favourable
Opportunity to effect what they deſir'd.
So they kill'd <hi>Antonine</hi> and his Mother,
who was there preſent, by reaſon of her
Character and Alliance to the Emperor,
and maſſacred all the Tools and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Villainies, that were then
aſſembled in the Camp. The dead
Bodies of <hi>Antonine</hi> and his Mother were
deliver'd over to the Scorn and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Mob, who after they had
mangled and dragg'd them contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
about the City, threw them into
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:94482:150"/>
the Common Sewers that diſcharge
themſelves into the <hi>Tyber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus fell <hi>Antonine,</hi> after he had reign'd
Six Years, and liv'd as we have related.
Then the Army proceeded to proclaim
<hi>Alexander</hi> Emperor, and conducted him
to the Imperial Palace, being very
young, and remaining as yet under the
Care and Tuition of his Mother and
Grandmother.</p>

                  <hi>SEverus Alexander</hi> remains under the

Moderation. He has a Council appointed
of grave Men, choſen out of the Senate,
by whoſe Advice and Aſſiſtance all Things
as well Sacred as Profane, are reſtor'd
to their former State and Condition.
Then he marries a Lady of Noble Birth,

<hi>Artabanus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſtirs

               <p>THe Account of <hi>Antonine</hi>'s Death
is deliver'd in the former Book:
After which <hi>Alexander</hi> aſſum'd the Title
of Emperor, and appear'd in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Robes; but the Regency and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Publick Affairs was in the Hands
of the Women. They endeavour'd a
Reformation of all Abuſes, and to put
all Things in a more prudent and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:94482:151"/>
Courſe than they had been in the
late Reign. And to this end, in the firſt
place, they made choice of Sixteen of
the moſt aged Men in the Senate, and ſuch
as were in the greateſt Reputation for
Integrity and Probity of Manners, who
were to compoſe the young Emperor's
Privy-Council, and nothing was ſaid or
done without their Concurrence and
Approbation. This Change in the
Form of Government gave general Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to the Army, Populace, and
Senate, a ſort of <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
in the room of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power.</hi> Then they reſtor'd the
Images of the Gods, that had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
by <hi>Antonine,</hi> to their reſpective
Temples and Fanes: And all thoſe that
had in the late Reign been advanc'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly,
or upon the bare Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
of their Vices, to Honours
and Dignities, were turn'd out, and
order'd to betake themſelves to their
former Myſteries and Vocations. All
Civil Offices, and Employments apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the Law, were fill'd with
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94482:152"/>
Men famous for their Learning and
Eminency in that Knowledge; and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
Military were beſtow'd on Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the greateſt Experience in the
Art of War.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Empire adminiſtred
for a long time, when <hi>Maeſa</hi> having ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to a great Age departed this Life.
Her Funeral was ſolemniz'd with Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Ceremonies, and ſhe was Deified
according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mammaea</hi> ſeeing the ſole Guardianſhip
of her Son devolv'd upon her ſelf, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to bear the ſame Sway, and
govern him ſtill by the ſame Meaſures:
But now he had the Authority of the
Government in his Hand, ſhe was afraid
leſt being then in the Heat of Youth,
and conſcious of his own unlimited
Power, he might be puſh'd on to ſome
Vices and Irregularities incident to his
Blood and Family, and therefore ſet a
ſtrong Guard about the Court, and
would not permit any Perſon to come
near him that was cenſur'd for any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality
in his Converſation, for fear
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:94482:152"/>
they ſhould debauch his native Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and ſpur on Nature, now he was
vegete and young, to diſhoneſt Paſſions
and Appetites. She advis'd him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
principally the Adminiſtration of
Juſtice, and to ſet apart the beſt Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Time for the Diſcharge of
that Truſt, that being employ'd about
greater Affairs, and more important to
the Publick Welfare, he might not have
leiſure to purſue vain and ſinful Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> had a mild and benign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
diſpoſing him always to Humanity
and Compaſſion, which was manifeſted
in the enſuing Courſe of his Life. His
Government was ſo gentle, that in Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years not one Man was put to
death, tho' many were convicted of
Crimes of the higheſt Nature. He would
never proceed to Capital Puniſhments;
a Clemency ſo exemplary, that never
any Prince ſince <hi>Marcus</hi> came up to it;
and I'm confident no Man can affirm,
that in the whole Courſe of his Reign
(tho' it continu'd many Years) any Man
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94482:153"/>
ſuffer'd Death without a fair and legal
Trial.</p>
               <p>He cenſur'd his Mother extremely,
and was highly offended at her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable
Covetouſneſs, and indecent
Zeal in heaping up Money; for ſhe
pretended to act in this Matter with a
different View from what ſhe did, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
that the Emperor might never find his
Exchequer unfurniſh'd, whenever he had
an Occaſion to diſtribute Munificences
amongſt the Soldiers; whereas ſhe was
laying in a private Fund for her ſelf at
home. This caſt a great Blemiſh upon
his Government, that a Woman ſhould
preſume to pillage the Subject, and make
Invaſions on their Property, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Emperor diſapprov'd, and
in his own Judgment oppos'd it.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Mammaea</hi> marry'd her
Son to a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady of high Birth,
whom ſhe afterwards by inſupportable
Uſage conſtrain'd to leave the Court, tho'
ſhe was paſſionately belov'd by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.
She affected the Title of Sole
Empreſs, and envy'd her a Share in that
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94482:153"/>
Honour, and proceeded at length to
thoſe Outrages, that the Father of the
young Empreſs, who was then in great
Eſteem and Credit with the Emperor,
impatient of the Injuries with which
ſhe loaded both himſelf and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
retir'd from the Court to the Camp,
where he made publick Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the great Reſpect which had
been always paid him by the Emperor,
but complain'd of the inſolent Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Mammaea;</hi> which exaſperated
her to that degree, that ſhe inſtantly
gave out Orders to put him to death,
commanded his Daughter to depart the
Court, and baniſh'd her into <hi>Africk.
Alexander</hi> acted in this Affair by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,
contrary to his own Judgment
and Inclination; for ſo arbitrary was
<hi>Mammaea,</hi> and ſo abſolute and Aſcendant
had ſhe over him, that he render'd an
univerſal Obedience to all her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>This Eaſineſs and Obſequiouſneſs to
his Mother, even to a Crime, in Things
which he manifeſtly diſlik'd, was the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94482:154"/>
only Thing for which this Prince could
juſtly be blamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having thus for Thirteen Years (as
to what reſpected himſelf) adminiſter'd
the Empire ſo as not to afford Subject
of Complaint, in the Fourteenth Year
of his Reign there came Letters from
the Praefects of</hi> Syria <hi>and</hi> Meſopotamia,
<hi>with the following Advices,</hi> viz. That
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<hi>Parthia,</hi> and ſubdu'd the Kingdoms
of the Eaſt, and kill'd the Great King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanus,</hi>
(who was the firſt that had bore
that Title, and wore a double Diadem) had
reduc'd under his Dominion all the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations on that Side, and made them
Tributary; and not being content with his
Acquiſitions on the other Side the <hi>Tigris,</hi>
had paſs'd the River, made an Impreſſion
upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Frontiers, over-run <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia,</hi>
threatned <hi>Syria,</hi> and all the
Continent that lies oppoſite to <hi>Europe,</hi> which
is call'd <hi>Aſia,</hi> and is bounded by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis</hi>
and the <hi>Aegean;</hi> pretending, that
theſe vaſt Tracts were the Poſſeſſions of his
Anceſtors, and as ſuch he would re-unite
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:94482:154"/>
them to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire: And farther
ſetting forth, That from the Reign of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
who firſt tranſlated the Empire from
the <hi>Medes</hi> to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to the Times of
<hi>Darius,</hi> who was vanquiſh'd and depos'd by
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Arms, all thoſe Countries
as far as <hi>Ionia</hi> and <hi>Caria</hi> were govern'd
by <hi>Perſian</hi> Vice-Roys; and that he eſteem'd
himſelf in Honour bound to cauſe Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be made of all the ancient Dependences
of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>This unexpected News extremely
alarm'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had been bred
up in the Softneſs and Luxury of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and had enjoy'd hitherto an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Calm: However, his Council
was conven'd, and he communicated
to them his Intelligence; whereupon it
was reſolv'd, that Ambaſſadors ſhould
be diſpatch'd with Letters, which 'twas
believ'd would check the Hopes and
Attempts of theſe Barbarous Invaders.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of theſe Reſolutions,
Letters were ſent, purporting, <hi>That they
ought to content themſelves with their own
Territories, and not endeavour to enlarge
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:94482:155"/>
them by new Conqueſts; that they ſhould not
ſuffer themſelves to be lift up by vain Hopes,
to engage in a War with a powerful Enemy;
that they could not expect the like fortunate
Iſſue of their Combates with the</hi> Romans,
<hi>which they had found againſt their Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Neighbours;</hi> and reminded them
withal of the Victories heretofore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
over them by <hi>Auguſtus, Trajan,
Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Severus.</hi> Theſe Letters the
Emperor thought would either perſwade
or terrifie the Barbarian into a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to be quiet; but they made
no Impreſſion upon him. <hi>Axtaxerxes</hi>
thought it was not Words but the Sword
muſt do his Buſineſs, and therefore he
puſh'd on the War with greater vigour,
ſpoiling and waſting all the <hi>Roman</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory.
<hi>Meſopotamia</hi> he ravag'd both with
his Foot and Cavalry, and began to carry
off the Plunder, attack'd the <hi>Roman</hi>
Camps which were pitch'd on the Banks
of the Rivers, to cover the Frontiers of
the Empire; and being naturally arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
and at this time elevated by his
late unexpected Succeſſes, he thought
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:94482:155"/>
eaſily to ſurmount all Oppoſition. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and weighty Motives conſpir'd to
make him deſire an Elargement of his
Empire: He was the firſt that had dar'd
to make a War on the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and
had after a long Interval retriev'd the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy: For after the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of <hi>Darius</hi> by the Arms of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and thoſe that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Alexander</hi> for a long Series of
Time, ſhar'd <hi>Aſia</hi> and the Kingdoms
of the Eaſt among themſelves, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Regal Authority in their reſpective
Territories, until <hi>Arſaces</hi> the <hi>Parthian,</hi>
taking advantage of their Animoſities
and frequent Wars, by which the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi>
Force was conſiderably weakned,
perſwaded the Barbarians on that Side
to a general Revolt, and was elected
their Ruler by the unanimous Conſent
of <hi>Parthia</hi> and the adjoining Countries;
and accordingly he reign'd over them,
and his Empire continu'd in his Family
for ſeveral Ages, deſcending in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
Courſe of Succeſſion, till it
devolv'd on <hi>Artabanus,</hi> who lived in our
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:94482:156"/>
Times: So <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> having ſlain this
<hi>Artabanus,</hi> and re-eſtabliſhed the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Monarchy, and ſubdu'd all his Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Neighbours, had opened an eaſie
Paſſage for his Forces to aſſail the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> being in <hi>Rome,</hi> was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
of the Hoſtilities committed by the
Barbarians, and their Inſolence, which
was now inſupportable even in his own
Judgment; and being preſs'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of his Generals in thoſe Parts,
began to put all Things in readineſs
for an Expedition againſt them, tho'
with ſome Reluctancy, and after much
ſtruggling with his natural Averſions to
a War. Accordingly he proceeded to
make his Levies in <hi>Italy,</hi> and all the
Provinces of the Empire, requiring all
Men whom Age or Habit of Body had
not rendred uncapable, to enter into
his Service. So Muſters were made with
great Vigour and Application through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Empire, to raiſe an Army
ſufficient to cope with the Barbarian
Force; and <hi>Alexander</hi> having given out
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:94482:156"/>
Orders for the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
in the Field, delivered himſelf
to them in the following Speech, from a

going to ſay to you might produce the
ſame happy Effects which my Speeches have
hitherto done, that it might redound to the
Reputation of the Speaker, and give uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Satisfaction to thoſe that hear me.
'Tis poſſible that after ſo long a Peace, you
may be ſtartled at the News of an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
War: But 'tis the Part of Wiſe and
Valiant Men to wiſh for the beſt, but to bear
what happens, and acquieſce under all the
Diſpenſations of Heaven. Pleaſure is ſweet
in the Enjoyment, but Glory's the Reward of
Vertue. As he that offers an Injury, muſt
needs be ſenſible of it, and feel Remorſes
within himſelf; ſo he that repels an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Aggreſſor, is animated by his Conſcience,
and the Goodneſs of his Cauſe gives him
the ſtrongeſt Aſſurance of Succeſs. <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi>
                              <pb n="308" facs="tcp:94482:157"/>
having murder'd <hi>Artabanus,</hi> his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Lord and Maſter, contemns the Terror of
our Arms, and the Glory of our Empire, and
openly ſpoils and ravages our Provinces. I
firſt eſſay'd by Reaſoning and Debate to
divert him from this inſatiate Madneſs, and
exhorted him to be content with his own Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
for which end I ſent Letters to him;
but he, out of the abundance of his barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Arrogance, diſdains to ſtay within his
own Territories, but defies us, and provokes
us to a Battel. 'Tis my Opinion clearly, that
we advance againſt them with all poſſible
ſpeed. To the Veterans among you my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is, That you reflect upon the Conqueſts
you have gain'd over them under the Conduct
of <hi>Severus</hi> and my Father <hi>Antonine:</hi> And
you that are in the Flower of your Youth,
cheriſh, I exhort you, the generous Thirſt
of Fame and Glory, and make it apparent to
the World, that you can be as brave Soldiers
in the Action of War, as you have been
good Subjects in the Leiſures of Peace. The
Courage of the Barbarians encreaſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
in proportion to the Cowardice and
Bravery of their Enemies. If theſe fly,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:94482:157"/>
they purſue; but never ſupport the Shocks
of a gallant Army, that attacks them with
vigour; for they dare not hope for Succeſs
in a Pitch'd Battel, but make ſudden Inroads
and Ravages, and content themſelves to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
off the Plunder of the Countries they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade:
And we have the Advantage of them,
not only in Order and Diſcipline of our
Armies, but in that we have been train'd
up in a conſtant Courſe of Victories over
them.</p>

               <p>When he had concluded his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,
all the Soldiers expreſs'd their
forward Diſpoſitions to the War, by
their Acclamations, which were very
unanimous on this Occaſion. Then he
diſtributed a magnificent Donative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, and commanded all
Things to be put in poſture for a
March. After that, he went into the
Senate, and made a Speech, much the
ſame in Subſtance with what he had
ſpoke before, and ſignified his Pleaſure
as to the Day when he would begin his
March. When the Day was come, he
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:94482:158"/>
perform'd the Sacrifices cuſtomary upon
the undertaking any Expedition, and
parted from <hi>Rome,</hi> being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi>
in full Body. He often look'd back
upon the City with Tears in his Eyes;
nor was there any of his Subjects but
was in grief upon his Departure: For
he was univerſally belov'd by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace,
in regard he had been educated
among them, and had govern'd ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years with ſo much Gentleneſs.</p>
               <p>Having perform'd his March, which
he did with incredible Diligence, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view'd
the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Army and Country;
after which he rais'd a conſiderable
Force in thoſe Parts, and retir'd to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
where he made Proviſion of all
Things neceſſary for a War, exerciſing
his Soldiers, and diſcharging all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a General. However, he thought
it adviſable to ſend a ſecond Embaſſie
to the <hi>Perſian,</hi> to make Overtures of an
Accommodation. He imagin'd the
Terror of his Preſence would influence
him to cloſe with his Offers. But <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:94482:158"/>
would hearken to no Propoſals
that were made: So the <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
return'd to their Camp; and
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> made choice of Four hundred
of the talleſt Men in his Army, whom
he diſpatch'd to <hi>Alexander</hi> with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of his Envoys. They were richly
and ſplendidly attir'd, well mounted,
and armed with Bows and Arrows, to
the end the <hi>Romans</hi> might be terrified by
the Garb and Auguſt Preſence of the
<hi>Perſians.</hi> Their Inſtructions were, <hi>to
require the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperor and People, in
the Name of the Great</hi> Artaxerxes, <hi>from
thenceforth to renounce all Claim and Title
to</hi> Syria, <hi>and that Part of</hi> Aſia <hi>which lies
oppoſite to</hi> Europe, <hi>and to ſuffer the</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
<hi>quietly and peaceably to exerciſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
as far as</hi> Ionia <hi>and</hi> Caria, <hi>and over
all the Countries that are divided by the</hi>
Aegean <hi>and</hi> Pontick <hi>Seas, being the ancient
Poſſeſſions of the Crown of</hi> Perſia.</p>
               <p>After the Ambaſſadors had made their
Demands, <hi>Alexander</hi> commanded them
all to be arreſted, and diveſting them of
their Splendor, ſent them away into
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:94482:159"/>
                  <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where he aſſign'd them Houſes
to inhabit, and Lands to manure; for
he would not inflict any farther Penalty
than the prohibiting them to return
home, looking upon it as a manifeſt
Breach of the Laws of Honour and
Natural Juſtice, to put them to death,
being no Priſoners of War, and having
done nothing but in Execution of their
Royal Maſter's Injunctions.</p>
               <p>Theſe Meaſures being taken, <hi>Alexander</hi>
prepar'd to paſs the River, and carry
the War into the Enemies Country; at
which time ſome <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Soldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted,
and a Plot was ſet on foot in
<hi>Syria,</hi> that threatned a Revolution in
the Empire; but was happily defeated,
and the Conſpirators puniſh'd: After
which he detach'd ſeveral ſtrong Parties
into other Countries, to reſtrain the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
of the Barbarians in thoſe
Parts.</p>
               <p>Things being in this Poſture, and the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army very numerous, and not
inferior to the Enemies, the Emperor
call'd a Council of War, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94482:159"/>
was, That the Army ſhould be
divided into Three Parties: The Firſt
was commanded to march to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
through <hi>Armenia,</hi> which Country
was in League with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to
make a Deſcent upon <hi>Media</hi> on that
Side. The Second was alſo command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Northward; but they were order'd
to direct their March through the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Country where <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
meet, and are ſwallow'd up in vaſt
Pools and Lakes, which gives occaſion
to an Opinion obtaining in the World,
That 'tis unknown where thoſe Rivers
diſcharge themſelves. The Third, and
ſtrongeſt of the Three, he undertook
to lead in Perſon againſt the Enemy,
and took the middle Road.</p>
               <p>By this means he thought to amuſe
the Enemy, and ſurprize them before
they were aware of, or had provided
againſt any ſuch Attempt. He thought
too, the <hi>Perſians</hi> receiving ſo many pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Diverſions from different Quarters,
would be weaker and more irregular
than if they advanc'd in an entire Body:
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:94482:160"/>
For the Barbarians have no Stipendiary
Force, or Standing Army, that is kept
in conſtant Pay, and practis'd in the
Art of War; but all their Men, and, if
the Occaſion's more extraordinary, the
Women too, upon the King's ſignifying
his Pleaſure to them, repair to a general
Rendezvous. After the War they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home, receive no Pay, but content
themſelves with a Share in the Spoil of
the Countries they invade. They uſe
Bows and Horſes, not only in Time of
War, as the <hi>Romans</hi> do, but are bred up
to it from their Childhood, and live by
Hunting, and very ſeldom ungird their
Quivers, or alight from their Horſes, but
make conſtant uſe of them either againſt
their Enemies, or the Wild Beaſts of the
Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Meaſures ſeeming now ſo
wiſely laid, as to promiſe almoſt certain
Succeſs, Fortune interpos'd to baffle Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Policies. The Army that was
order'd to march through <hi>Armenia</hi> paſs'd
with great difficulty the ſteep and rocky
Mountains of the Country, (tho' they
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94482:160"/>
were favour'd by the Seaſon of the
Year) and made an Inroad into <hi>Media,</hi>
where they burnt divers Villages, and
laid waſte the Country; whereof <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
being advertis'd, advanc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them with all his Strength, but
could not drive them out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which being rough and mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
afforded firm Footing and eaſie
Paſſage to the Infantry, but gave great
Inconveniences to the Barbarians Horſe.</p>
               <p>About this time an Expreſs arriv'd at
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Camp, with Advice that
another <hi>Roman</hi> Army had invaded <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi>
towards the Eaſt. This gave him
great Jealouſie, that as ſoon as they had
ravag'd <hi>Parthia,</hi> which they might eaſily
do, they would make an Impreſſion
into <hi>Perſia.</hi> Therefore leaving a Force
ſufficient, as he thought, to cover <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
he haſtned with the groſs of his
Army to the Eaſtward.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> finding no Oppoſition,
and no Enemy appearing, were not ſo
careful in their March as they might
have been; they ſuppos'd that <hi>Alexander</hi>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:94482:161"/>
had fallen upon the Barbarians with
his Army, which was the ſtrongeſt and
moſt numerous of the Three, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought there was no Occaſion for
haſty Marches, and look'd upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as out of danger, not doubting
but all the Armies were advancing to
the general Rendezvous, where by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert
they were to re unite, and bring all
the Booty and Priſoners they had taken
in this Expedition. But <hi>Alexander</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
them, and neither came in
Perſon, as 'twas concerted, nor ſent the
Army. 'Tis uncertain whether his own
natural Cowardice made him ſo unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to venture his Life in Defence of the
Empire, or he was over-rul'd in this
Affair by <hi>Mammaea.</hi> The Timorouſneſs
of a Woman, and the Fondneſs of a
Mother, might influence her to do it;
and 'tis well known ſhe always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to repreſs all generous Impulſes
in her Son, and ſtill perſwaded him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to let others hazard themſelves for
him, than to expoſe his Sacred Perſon
to the Chance of War. However it
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:94482:161"/>
was, it occaſion'd the total Overthrow
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army that had enter'd the
Enemies Country: For <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> with
the whole Power of his Kingdom, fell
upon them by Surprize, and ſurrounded
them, and galling them with Arrows
from all Quarters, obtain'd an entire
Victory: For he over-power'd them
with his Numbers; it was all they could
do to cover the naked Parts of their
Bodies againſt the Enemies Arrows. So
they contented themſelves to be upon
the defenſive, and rather to preſerve
themſelves than annoy the Enemy: But
after they had defended themſelves for
a ſhort ſpace, by joining their Targets
together, being attack'd on all Sides,
like a beleaguer'd Town, at laſt, after a
gallant Reſiſtance, they were all cut to
Pieces.</p>
               <p>This was a fatal Stroke to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
perhaps ſcarce parallell'd in Story;
a gallant Army, not inferior to any of
the moſt celebrated in former Ages, for
Fidelity and Courage, cut off entirely,
and as it were at one Blow. But the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:94482:162"/>
fortunate Event of ſo conſiderable an
Enterprize, animated the Barbarians to
undertake greater.</p>
               <p>The News of this Overthrow was
brought to the Emperor when he was
very ill, either through ſome Diſeaſe of
Mind, or Indiſpoſition of Body, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
by the Climate, to which he was
not accuſtom'd. It gave him great
Mortification, and exaſperated the whole
Army againſt him, inſomuch that they
declar'd openly, that his Perſonal Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
in not coming up with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
purſuant to the Determination of
the Council, had drawn this Calamity
upon them. But <hi>Alexander,</hi> finding he
could not any longer ſtruggle with his
Malady, which encreas'd upon him in
that ſultry Climate, and the greateſt part
of his Army being ſick, eſpecially the
<hi>Illyrians,</hi> who dropp'd away in great
Numbers, in regard they feed plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and are us'd to a colder foggy Air,
reſolv'd to march back to <hi>Antioch;</hi> and
Orders were ſent to the Army in <hi>Media</hi>
to return: But the greateſt part periſh'd
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94482:162"/>
in re-paſſing the Mountains, or were
frozen to death by the Rigour of the
Climate. <hi>Alexander</hi> led back the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of his Army to <hi>Antioch;</hi> for he
alſo had loſt great Numbers of his
Men. The Succeſs of this Expedition
bred great Diſcontents among the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and ſunk the Emperor's Reputation
extremely in the Opinion of the World:
He was baffled in all his Deſigns, and
return'd home ingloriouſly, after he had
loſt the beſt part of three Armies by
Cold, Sickneſs, or the Sword.</p>
               <p>After he arriv'd at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the change
of Air ſoon reſtor'd his Health, and the
cool Springs frequent in this City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd
him after the parching Heats of
<hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> Here he gave a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Largeſs to the Soldiers, to buoy up
their Spirits under their preſent Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For this he eſteem'd the only Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
to re-inflame their dying Zeal and
Affection for his Intereſts. After this,
he apply'd himſelf to the making new
Levies, as if he intended a ſecond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> in caſe they
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94482:163"/>
ſhould give him any Diſturbance: But
News came that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
his Army, and commanded the
Soldiers to repair to their reſpective
Homes. And tho' in the Iſſue of the
War the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſeem'd to have the
Advantage, yet their Forces were very
much diminiſh'd by ſeveral Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in <hi>Parthia;</hi> and of thoſe Soldiers
that ſurviv'd, many were wounded, and
others extremely harraſs'd and broken:
For the <hi>Romans</hi> behav'd themſelves very
bravely, and made often great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Enemy, and had vanquiſh'd
them, had they not been over-power'd
by their Numbers. Neither can the
<hi>Perſians</hi> pretend to have excell'd them
in Perſonal Valour, the Number of the
Slain on both Sides being very near
equal: And their being ſo quiet for
three or four Years after this Victory,
amounts to a Demonſtration, that their
Loſſes were very conſiderable.</p>
               <p>This News deliver'd the Emperor
from his Fears, and he began to diſplay
a new Gaiety of Temper, threw aſide
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:94482:163"/>
the Cares of War, and abandon'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Pleaſures and Luxury of the
Town. He thought the <hi>Perſians</hi> would
not again diſturb his Repoſe, or at leaſt
it would be a long time before their
disbanded Forces could re aſſemble into
an Army, in regard they don't conſiſt
of regular diſciplin'd Troops, nor can
they properly be term'd an Army, but
are rather a diſorderly Multitude; they
have no Proviſions, but what every Man
carries from home, for his own Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and beſides, they are very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to leave their Wives, Children, and
Native Country. But while he was
thinking of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> there ſuddenly
arriv'd a Courier from the Prefects of
<hi>Illyria,</hi> with Letters for him, which put
him into a greater Conſternation. Theſe
brought advice, <hi>That the</hi> Germans <hi>had
paſs'd the</hi> Rhine <hi>and</hi> Danube, <hi>and enter'd
the</hi> Roman <hi>Territories in Hoſtile manner,
had aſſail'd the</hi> Roman <hi>Camp upon the</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,
<hi>ſack'd and plunder'd all the Cities and
Villages in thoſe Parts, whereby</hi> Illyria
(<hi>that borders upon</hi> Italy) <hi>was in imminent
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:94482:164"/>
Danger;</hi> concluding, <hi>That in this Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of Affairs it would be requiſite that he
came in Perſon, with the whole Power of his
Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Advices exceedingly alarm'd
the Emperor, and afforded Matter of
great Regret and Grief to the <hi>Illyrian</hi>
Soldiers. This was a ſecond Calamity
coming upon the Neck of a former.
They had loſt great Numbers of Men
in the Expedition againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
and now the <hi>Germans</hi> over ran their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country. Theſe Things put them
into a violent Rage againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
for they charg'd the bad Succeſs
of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Expedition wholly upon
his ill Conduct, or his Fear; and now
they accus'd his Slackneſs in ſuccouring
the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> as proceeding from the
ſame baſe Paſſion. The Emperor and
his Council began to apprehend that
<hi>Italy</hi> was in danger. The <hi>German</hi> Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſeem'd to be of far more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Conſequence to the Empire, than
the <hi>Perſian;</hi> for in diſtant Regions of
the Eaſt, which are disjoin'd by a vaſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:94482:164"/>
Tract of Land and Sea, the Name of
<hi>Italy</hi> is ſeldom heard; but <hi>Germany</hi> is
only parted from <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Illyria,</hi> which
contains but a ſmall Spot of Ground,
ſubject to the <hi>Illyrians.</hi> Therefore with
great reluctancy the Emperor proclaim'd
his March, being driven to it by the
Extremity of his Affairs; and leaving
a Force ſufficient for the Defence of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Frontiers on that Side, he view'd
the Camp and fortified Towns, repair'd
their Fortifications, and put ſtrong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
into them out of his Army, and
then advanc'd with the Remainder of
his Forces againſt the <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He perform'd his March with great
Expedition, and encamp'd on the Banks
of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where he made Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the War. He built a Bridge
of Boats over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> for the more
eaſie paſſing his Army over that River.
This River and the <hi>Danube</hi> are the
greateſt Rivers in the North. The <hi>Rhine</hi>
runs through <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Danube</hi>
through <hi>Hungary.</hi> They are very deep
and broad, and in the Summer navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:94482:165"/>
in the Winter, by reaſon of the
extremity of the Cold, they are frozen
ſo hard, that the People ride over them,
as if they were part of the <hi>Terra firma.</hi>
The Ice is ſo firm, that it not only
bears Men and Horſes, but thoſe that
come for Water don't bring Pails, or
other Veſſels, but Spades and Axes, with
which they hew out the Water, and
carry it away like a piece of a ſolid
Rock. This is the Nature of thoſe
Rivers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> had great Numbers of <hi>Moors</hi>
and Archers in his Service, which he
brought with him out of the Eaſt;
they conſiſted moſtly of the <hi>Oſrhoeni,</hi>
and <hi>Parthian</hi> Deſerters, and ſuch as were
tempted to come over to them by hopes
of Gain. Theſe Men annoy'd the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
the moſt of any. The <hi>Moors</hi> throw
their Darts a prodigious way, and charge
and retire with wonderful agility. The
Archers would level at the naked Heads
and Bodies of the over grown <hi>Germans,</hi>
and ſeldom fail'd of hitting their Mark.
Sometimes they came to a Pitch'd Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:94482:165"/>
wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> could ſeldom
get any Advantage. Things being in
this Poſture, <hi>Alexander</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors
to the Enemy to treat of a Peace, and
to let them know, that the Emperor
was willing to furniſh them with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they wanted, and to ſupply them
with Money, than which nothing has a
more powerful Influence over the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
provided they would lay down
their Arms, which they are always ready
to do upon the Terms now propounded
to them. So <hi>Alexander</hi> enter'd into a
Negotiation with them, thinking it more
prudential to purchaſe Peace with his
Money, than expoſe his Perſon to the
Hazards of War.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers were much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
that they ſpent ſo much Time
to ſo little purpoſe, without having any
Opportunity of ſignalizing themſelves
by ſome brave Action. While the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
gave himſelf up to his Pleaſures,
and to the driving of Chariots; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he ought to have purſu'd his Revenge,
and chaſtiz'd the late Inſolence of the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:94482:166"/>
                  <hi>Germans.</hi> There was at this time in
the Army one <hi>Maximine,</hi> a Man half-barbarous,
born in the Heart of <hi>Thrace,</hi>
and in his Youth he was a Shepherd;
but when he came to Mans Eſtate, for
his Strength and extraordinary Stature
he was made a Trooper, and from
thence was led by the Hand of Fortune
through all the inferior Poſts and Offices,
to the Government of Provinces, and
the Command of Armies. To him,
being a Man well practis'd in the Art
of War, <hi>Alexander</hi> gave the Command
of his New Levies, to train and fit them
for his Service. He was very induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the Diſcharge of this Truſt,
which won him the general Love of all
the Soldiers. He not only directed them
what to do, but obſerv'd himſelf thoſe
Directions in his own Perſonal Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the end they might learn their
Duty, not only by obeying his Orders,
but by following his Example: And
that he might join them more firmly to
his Intereſts, he omitted no Opportunity
of honouring and rewarding them; and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:94482:166"/>
he gain'd his Point: For all the young
Soldiers (being for the moſt part <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonians</hi>)
became great Admirers of his
Bravery, and took all Occaſions of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
<hi>Alexander,</hi> often ſaying of him in
contempt, <hi>That he was led by the Noſe by
his Mother, and ſubmitted the Conduct of
Publick Affairs to the Direction of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
They reflected upon his Sloath
and Cowardice in Military Matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to talk again very hotly of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Overthrow in the Eaſt, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it to be chiefly occaſion'd by his
Lazineſs, which was alſo the Reaſon
that as yet nothing had been done in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
againſt the <hi>Germans.</hi> Beſides, they
are naturally deſirous of Revolutions
and Changes: This was a long Reign,
and they grew weary of it; they could
not expect to get any thing under the
preſent Government, in regard the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
was not ſo ſollicitous to procure
their Favour, as he was in the firſt Years
of his Reign; and they might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
hope for greater Honours and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
under a Prince that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94482:167"/>
to the Throne ſolely by their
Intereſt, having no Grounds himſelf to
expect ſuch Promotion.</p>
               <p>Theſe Motives put together, made
them reſolve the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
and the Advancement of <hi>Maximine,</hi> who
was their Fellow-Soldier and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and was the fitteſt Man that could
be pitch'd upon to proſecute the War
againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> by reaſon of his
Perſonal Valour and Military Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of theſe Reſolutions,
they aſſembled in the Field arm'd, and
<hi>Maximine</hi> at the Head of them, making
as if he would only direct them in their
ordinary Exerciſes. Some ſay he was
privy to their Deſigns, and others affirm
the contrary: However that was, they
proclaim'd him Emperor, and inveſted
him with the Imperial Robes. He at
firſt declin'd and rejected the Purple;
but when the Soldiers drew their Swords,
and threatned to kill him if he did not
comply, he choſe rather to run a future
Hazard, than expoſe himſelf to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94482:167"/>
Danger, and ſo accepted the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and declar'd that he had had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Intimations by Dreams and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<hi>That he ſhould one Day ſit at the
Helm of the Empire.</hi> He proteſted alſo
to them, <hi>That his Compliance in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
was much againſt his Will; but he
could not reſiſt their Importunity:</hi> And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
them, <hi>ſeeing they would needs have
it ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtantly to ſtand to their Arms, and
eſtabliſh what they had done, by ſurprizing</hi>
Alexander <hi>before the News of what had
hapned had reach'd his Ears, and putting
his Guards and Soldiers in Conſternation, by
which Means they might either be perſwaded
to join with them in puſhing on the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or they might eaſily be forc'd to a
Submiſſion, being unprovided of all Things
for making a Reſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximine</hi> was very careful to cheriſh
that Affection which they had expreſs'd
for him, by doubling their Allowance
of Corn, by promiſing large Donatives,
and granting a general Pardon of all
Crimes of what Nature ſoever: After
which he led on his Men to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94482:168"/>
Pavilion, which was not far
off.</p>
               <p>This ſudden and ſurprizing Turn of
Affairs extremely alarm'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he abandon'd his Tent, and
flew out like a Mad-man, crying and
trembling, and upbraiding <hi>Maximine</hi>
with Perfidiouſneſs and Ingratitude. He
ran out into a long Enumeration of the
Favours he had conferr'd upon him,
and reprov'd his Adherents for raſhly
engaging in traiterous Deſigns, contrary
to the Duty of their Allegiance. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
he promis'd to grant all their
Demands, and redreſs all their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
provided they would lay down
their Arms. The Soldiers that were
about him encourag'd him in this Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
by their chearful Acclamations,
and promis'd to ſtand by him with their
Lives and Fortunes. But as ſoon as
that Night was over, and the News
came in the Morning, that <hi>Maximine</hi>
was advancing againſt them, and a
Cloud of Duſt was deſcry'd afar off,
and a Noiſe as it were of a great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:94482:168"/>
was heard, <hi>Alexander</hi> came out
again into the Field, and call'd his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
together, and exhorted them <hi>to be
firm to him, to protect their Prince who had
been brought up among them, and had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
for Fourteen Years with ſo much
Gentleneſs and Equity, that not one Subject
had ſo much as Cauſe of Complaint given
him.</hi> So all Men ſeeming mov'd with
Compaſſion, he bid them <hi>ſtand to their
Arms, and put themſelves in poſture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Enemy:</hi> Which they promis'd
to do, but fell away by degrees, and
deſerted him. Some there were that
imputed this Defection to the Practices
of the Captain of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Band,
and of ſome of the Emperor's Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
and would have impeach'd them
of that Fact: Others laid the Blame on
his Mother, whoſe covetous Temper
and extreme Parſimony in giving out
Munificences to the Soldiers, had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
her Son odious. They ſtaid for
ſome time, debating the Point to and
fro, till <hi>Maximine</hi> came in ſight, and
bid them <hi>abandon a wretched Woman, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:94482:169"/>
that eaſie diſ-ſpirited Boy, who could truckle
ſo tamely to a Mothers Tyranny, and join
themſelves to a Man of Courage and Conduct,
who had been their Companion in Arms, and
was an old and experienc'd Captain.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they all revolted from <hi>Alexander,</hi>
and unanimouſly proclaim'd <hi>Maximine</hi>
Emperor. <hi>Alexander</hi> in great Fear and
Diſtraction made a ſhift to return to
his Tent, tho' with great difficulty; and
embracing his Mother, he bewail'd his
Misfortune, and (as ſome ſay) accus'd
her as the procuring Cauſe of it, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Moment the Meſſenger of
Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximine,</hi> as ſoon as he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
Emperor by the Army, order'd
a Tribune and certain Centurions to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
<hi>Alexander</hi> and his Mother, and all
ſuch as pretended to make any Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They forthwith executed their
Warrant, ruſhing into the Emperor's
Tent, and killing him and his Mother,
and all thoſe that ſeem'd to be honour'd
and eſteem'd by him, except ſuch as
fled and abſconded for the preſent; all
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:94482:169"/>
which were afterwards apprehended by
<hi>Maximine,</hi> and put to death.</p>
               <p>This was the End of <hi>Alexander</hi> and
his Mother, after he had reign'd Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years without ſpilling any Blood,
or giving the Subject any juſt Ground
of Complaint. He abhorr'd all cruel
and tyrannical Methods, and never put
any Man to death without Legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
He was naturally inclin'd to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs
and Beneficence; and the whole
Tenor of his Government had been
without Reproach or Blemiſh, had not
the ſordid Avarice of his Mother
thrown ſome Scandal upon it.</p>

               <p>THe Account of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Life
and Death, after he had reign'd
Fourteen Years, is declar'd in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Book. <hi>Maximine</hi> ſucceeded him;
whereupon great Changes enſu'd. He
exercis'd great Severities towards his
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94482:171"/>
Subjects, endeavouring by this Means
to render himſelf Formidable. So the
Government began to be influenc'd by
new Principles, and from Mild and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
became Cruel and Tyrannical. He
knew he was generally diſtaſteful to the
People, in regard he was the firſt that
from the obſcureſt Condition had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
to the higheſt of Dignities. He
was Barbarous as well in Manners as
Extraction. His Nature was Cruel,
agreeing with the <hi>Thracian Genius.</hi> So
he purſu'd violent Meaſures, thinking
thereby moſt effectually to eſtabliſh his
Empire. He was afraid that the Senate
and People of <hi>Rome</hi> would deſpiſe him,
that they would look back upon the
Meanneſs of his Birth, and not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in his preſent Exaltation. It
was commonly known and talk'd of,
that he had been a Shepherd in <hi>Thrace,</hi>
and being a tall brawny Youth was
liſted a Soldier to ſerve among his
Country-men, and from thence was
conducted by the Hand of Fortune to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. He remov'd all
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:94482:171"/>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Miniſters and Counſellors
that were appointed by the Senate.
Some he ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> others he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd
for Malverſation in their Offices.
His Deſign herein was, that there might
be no Perſon in the Army of Nobler
Extraction than himſelf; that being as
it were a ſtrong Fortreſs, and having
none about him to whom he ow'd the
leaſt Deference, he might give himſelf
over to a Tyrannical Adminiſtration.
He turn'd out all the Servants that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the Court in the late Reign,
and put moſt of them to death, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Apprehenſions of a Conſpiracy
form'd againſt him by them; for which
he had little Ground, beſide their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for the Death of the late Emperor.
About this time an Accident hapned,
which ſerv'd to encreaſe his Rage, and
made him more forward to drive Things
to Extremities. A Diſcovery was made
of a Combination form'd againſt him
by the whole Senate, together with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Centurions. <hi>Magnus,</hi> a Nobleman
of <hi>Rome,</hi> of Conſular Dignity, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:94482:172"/>
for endeavouring to raiſe a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and practiſing with the Soldiers to
make him Emperor. The Plot was
laid thus. <hi>Maximine</hi> had built a Bridge,
over which he deſign'd to paſs his Army
againſt the <hi>Germans:</hi> For he had a mind
to ſignalize the Beginning of his Reign
by ſome memorable Action, well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
that his podigious Stature
and Strength of Body, together with
his Military Skill and Experience, had
chiefly recommended him to the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the late Election; and therefore
he was willing to eſtabliſh his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and confirm the Opinion the Army
had conceiv'd of him, by ſome Exploit
anſwerable to it; and by the ſame it
would be apparent to the World, that
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Fear, and Slackneſs in puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the War, was not blam'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
juſt Reaſon. He was very diligent
in exerciſing his Soldiers, appear'd often
in his Army, and exhorted his Men with
great vehemence to behave themſelves
valiantly. But when the Bridge was
finiſh'd, and he deſign'd to paſs over
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:94482:172"/>
his Army, and advance againſt the
<hi>Germans,</hi> Information was made, that
<hi>Magnus</hi> had corrupted ſome of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
not many in number, but choſen
Men, eſpecially thoſe who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to guard the Bridge, which he
had perſwaded them to break down as
ſoon as <hi>Maximine</hi> was got to the other
Side, and ſo he ſhould have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
into the Hands of his Enemies, all
poſſibility of re-paſſing being cut off,
by reaſon of the Depth and Broadneſs
of the River, there being no Tranſport
Veſſels on the other Side. This is the
Subſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of what was diſcover'd. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was true, or was only a Forgery
of <hi>Maximine</hi>'s, is uncertain: I can't ſay
any thing poſitively, becauſe it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
inquir'd into; for none of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
were brought to Trial, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to make their Defence; but all
that were ſuſpected were inſtantly
apprehended, and executed without
Mercy.</p>
               <p>Soon after the <hi>Oſrhoene</hi> Archers revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> touch'd
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:94482:173"/>
them ſenſibly; ſo meeting accidentally
with <hi>Quartinus,</hi> a Conſular Man, who
had been deeply in the late Emperor's
Intereſts, and was diſcarded by <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
they conſtrain'd him to Head them,
which he did with great reluctancy.
Then they carry'd Fire before him in
State, and put upon him the Imperial
Robes, (Ornaments which afterwards
prov'd fatal to him) and advanc'd him
to the Empire, which was an Honour
he was very far from aſpiring to: But
ſoon after he was aſſaſſinated in his
Tent, when he was aſleep, by an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Acquaintance, and one whom he
eſteem'd his Friend. His Name was
<hi>Macedon;</hi> he was Commander in Chief
of the <hi>Oſrhoeni,</hi> and 'twas by his Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that they revolted. There was no
Ground of Diſtaſte, nor ſo much as
a Miſunderſtanding between them, to
ſtir him up to the commiſſion of this
Barbarity on one whom he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to take upon him the Empire;
but he thought the Merit of this Action
would entitle him to a great Share of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:94482:173"/>
the Emperor's Favour: So he cut off
<hi>Quartinus</hi> his Head, and preſented it to
<hi>Maximine. Maximine</hi> approv'd the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
better than he lik'd the Traitor;
hereby he had one Enemy leſs than he
had before: But he order'd <hi>Macedon</hi> to
be put to death amidſt his high Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctances
for ſo ſignal a Piece of Service,
as an Arch-Rebel to his Prince, and a
Traitor to his Friend, whom by his
pernicious Counſel he had miſled.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things exaſperated <hi>Maximine,</hi>
and ſerv'd to encreaſe the ſtanding Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of his Nature. His Aſpect was
very terrible, and his Body ſo vaſtly
big, that none of the <hi>Greek</hi> or Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Champions were comparable to
him. His Affairs being thus order'd, he
boldly led all his Forces over the Bridge,
and carry'd the War into <hi>Germany.</hi> His
Army was very numerous; he had with
him almoſt the whole Power of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, together with great
Numbers of <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Darters, and <hi>Oſrhoene</hi>
and <hi>Armenian</hi> Archers, whereof the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
are ſubject to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the latter
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:94482:174"/>
are their Confederates. He had alſo a
great Force of <hi>Parthians,</hi> conſiſting of
Deſerters, and ſuch as fought meerly
for Pay, together with Priſoners of War,
that were then in the <hi>Roman</hi> Service.
This Army was rais'd by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and
was conſiderably reinforc'd, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
by <hi>Maximine.</hi> The Darters and
Archers are the moſt ſerviceable againſt
the <hi>Germans;</hi> they fall upon them by
ſurprize, and retreat again with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
expedition. <hi>Maximine</hi> met with
no Oppoſition for a long time. The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
were fled: So he ravag'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
without controul, tho' it was then
the middle of Harveſt. The Villages
he burnt, and gave them up to the
Plunder of his Army. All their Cities
and Buildings are ſoon conſum'd with
Fire; for they very rarely uſe Brick or
Stone, but their Houſes are a ſort of
Sheds made only of Boards fitted and
faſtned together.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Maximine</hi> for a long time ſpoil'd
and waſted the Country, giving all the
Cattel that was taken among his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:94482:174"/>
But ſtill no Enemy appear'd; for
the <hi>Germans</hi> had retir'd out of the plain
open Country, into the Faſtneſſes of the
Woods and Fens, to the end they might
decoy the <hi>Romans</hi> thither, where they
might fall upon them among thick
Woods, which would ſhelter them from
the Enemies Darts and Arrows, and
render them unſerviceable, and where
too the Deepneſs of the Bogs would be
dangerous to them, in regard they were
unacquainted with the Country; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they had the Advantage of knowing
which of them were paſſable, and which
not, and run into them every Day up
to the Knees. The <hi>Germans</hi> alſo are
excellent Swimmers, having no Baths
beſide the common Rivers.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe Diſadvantages,
the <hi>Romans</hi> gave them Battel. The
Emperor with extraordinary Gallantry
made the Onſet in Perſon; for the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had retreated into a deep Moraſs,
whither the <hi>Romans</hi> were afraid to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
them; ſo <hi>Maximine</hi> ſet Spurs to his
Horſe, and plung'd in up to the Belly,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:94482:175"/>
making havock of all that pretended to
oppoſe him. This Bravery of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
had its due influence on the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
they were aſham'd to betray their
Emperor, that hazarded himſelf ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
for them: So they all readily
follow'd him. The Number of the
Slain was very great on both Sides;
but the <hi>Romans</hi> had the better, the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Army being almoſt entirely cut off.
<hi>Maximine</hi> acquitted himſelf very vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly,
inſomuch that the whole Moraſs,
fill'd up with dead Bodies, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd
all with Blood, ſeem'd to afford
a juſt Repreſentation of an Engagement
at Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximine</hi> took care not only to ſend
Accounts of this Engagement, and his
own Behaviour in it, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and People, but caus'd it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
in a large Pageant, and hung
up before the Senate-houſe, to the end
the Peoples Eyes, as well as their Ears,
might be duly affected with the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Exploits. This Pageant was
afterwards taken down by an Order of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:94482:175"/>
the Senate, which aboliſh'd all his Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Honours. He had ſeveral other
Rencounters with the <hi>Germans,</hi> wherein
his Perſonal Deportment always deſerv'd
great Commendations; but the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
being far advanc'd, he return'd
into <hi>Pannonia</hi> with many Priſoners and
a rich Booty. He Winter'd in <hi>Sirmium,</hi>
which is the greateſt City in thoſe Parts,
and prepar'd there for a ſecond Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the Spring; and he was often
heard to threaten, (and he ſeem'd to be
in earneſt) that he would utterly deſtroy
and ſubdue all the Barbarous Nations
of <hi>Germany,</hi> as far as the Ocean.</p>
               <p>Thus much for his Military Vertues.
And he had certainly been a Glorious
Prince, had not his Cruelty at home
caſt a Blemiſh upon his Atchievements
abroad: For, what ſignified the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Enemies abroad, if greater was
made of the Subjects at home? What
did all the Booty and Priſoners of War
avail, if the Subject was deſpoil'd of
all he had by Injury and Oppreſſion?
Common Informers were not only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:94482:176"/>
but countenanc'd and encourag'd
by the Government, to circumvent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Men, and, if Occaſion requir'd, to
rake into ſecret Crimes, that had been
committed in former Reigns, and had
lain undiſcover'd till theſe Times. And
ſo partial were the Courts of Juſtice,
that if any Man was impeach'd by a
Court-Sycophant, he was certainly found
guilty, and his Eſtates declar'd forfeit;
by which Means it often hapned, that
he that reliev'd his Neighbour to day,
was conſtrain'd himſelf to ask Relief
the Day following. Thus were the
Subjects ſqueez'd under a griping Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that ſtill acted under a Pretext of
ſupplying himſelf with Money to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
among the Soldiers. His Ears were
open to all ſorts of Calumnies, againſt
whomſoever vented, without any reſpect
to Age or Quality. Several Men of
eminent Condition, that were intruſted
with the Government of Provinces, and
the Command of Armies, after Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Triumphal Honours, were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
arreſted upon ſlight Accuſations,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:94482:176"/>
and by Order of the Emperor thruſt
into a Coach, and conſtrain'd to travel
Night and Day, without any Attendants,
from the Eaſt or Weſt, or perhaps from
the South, into <hi>Pannonia,</hi> where the
Emperor at that time held his Reſidence.
Upon their arrival they were diſgrac'd
and degraded, and then either put to
death or baniſh'd.</p>
               <p>While theſe Storms fell only upon
ſingle Perſons, and bounded themſelves
within private Families, the Publick did
not ſeem much concern'd. The Fall
of Great Men is not only little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Multitude, but ſome Perſons
that envy the Happineſs of thoſe that
are above them, by a particular Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Nature, rejoice at their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</p>
               <p>Thus the Tyrant reduc'd ſeveral
Noble Families from great Wealth to
extreme Poverty. And yet all this was
too little for him, his Appetite was ſtill
craving; ſo he began his Rapines upon
the Publick, and ſeiz'd at once all the
Treaſure of the City, to whatſoever
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:94482:177"/>
Uſes deſign'd, whether it was to be
diſtributed among the People, or was
to furniſh the Publick Granaries, or was
to defray the Expence of Games and
Shews exhibited at the Cities Charge.
Then he commanded all the Ornaments
of Churches and the other Publick Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
all the Statues of Gods and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of <hi>Heroes,</hi> and, in ſhort, whatever
might be converted into Coin, to be
melted down. Theſe Things gave ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Diſcontent, and afforded Matter
of an univerſal Grief: The City, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any War or Foreign Hoſtility, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
like a Town beſieg'd; inſomuch
that there aroſe ſome generous Patriots,
who reſolv'd to ſtem theſe Oppreſſions,
and to guard the Temples, and rather
to be ſacrific'd upon the Altars, than
behold the Ruine and Deſolation of
their Country. The ill Humour of the
People both in the City and Provinces
began to appear more manifeſtly than
ever. The Soldiers themſelves could
not approve what he did, being often
reproach'd by their Friends as the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:94482:177"/>
of all his illegal Proceedings. So
he drew, as well he might, a popular
<hi>Odium</hi> upon himſelf: But no Man dar'd
as yet to do any thing; they only pray'd
to and invok'd the injur'd Gods, until
he had reign'd Three Years compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
at which time the <hi>Africans,</hi> upon a
ſlight Occaſion, (ſuch are the Slips of
Tyrants) took up Arms and rebell'd.
The Occaſion was this.</p>
               <p>The Procurator of <hi>Carthage</hi> was very
rigid and cruel in his Government:
Proſecutions were carry'd very violently
againſt the Subject, and he extorted
great Sums of Money from them; and
all this was done to the end he might
merit <hi>Maximine</hi>'s Approbation, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
made choice of ſuch Tools as he
knew were the fitteſt for his own Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.
The Officers of the Exchequer,
tho' they were really honeſt Men, (which
very rarely happens) conſidering the
inſatiate Avarice of the Emperor, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Example of the other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
tho' much againſt their will, well
knowing the great Hazard they were to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:94482:178"/>
run if they did not. This Procurator
among his other Oppreſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proceeded
with great violence againſt certain young
Men of rich and noble Families, and
obtain'd Judgment to be pronounc'd
againſt them, intending to ſqueeze great
Sums of Money from them, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of the Eſtates and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
of their Anceſtors. Theſe things
highly exaſperated the young Nobles;
however, they promis'd to pay the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
only they deſir'd him to reſpite
the Payment for Three Days: In which
time they form'd an Aſſociation, and
drew into it all thoſe who had been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
by the Government already, or
had reaſon to apprehend the like Uſage;
and prevail'd with the Boors and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
to come down in the Night with
Clubs and Axes, which they did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
entring the City before the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hiding their Arms under their
Clothes, which were ſuch as they could
be furniſh'd with upon ſo ſudden an
Inſurrection. Their Number was very
great; for <hi>Africk</hi> is very populous, and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:94482:178"/>
great Numbers of Peaſants are employ'd
in cultivating the Land. In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the young Nobles commanded theſe
Boors to follow them in a Body, as
part of the Mob; but charg'd them
ſtrictly not to diſcover their Arms, till
they were aſſaulted by the Soldiers or
People for what they were about to do.
Then they went to the Procurator, and
made as if they would have treated with
him about the Payment of the Money
afore-mention'd; but then they ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fell upon him, and kill'd him before
he was aware of any ſuch Deſign; at
which the Soldiers began to draw their
Swords, as if they would have reveng'd
his Death: But they were ſoon diſpers'd
by the Boors, that came on very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
with their Clubs and Axes. After
this Fact, ſo openly and ſo audaciouſly
committed, the Youths grew deſperate;
and having ſucceeded ſo well in their
firſt Enterprize, thought the only way
to be ſafe, was to attempt greater, and
therefore reſolv'd to make the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Province embarque in the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:94482:179"/>
Adventure, and then perſwaded the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to a general Revolt, which had been
long wiſh'd for by all Men, by reaſon
of the general Hatred of <hi>Maximine,</hi> tho'
their Fears had hinder'd the putting of
it in practice: So they led the Mob at
Noon-day to the Proconſul's Houſe;
his Name was <hi>Gordian,</hi> he was Eighty
Years of age when he was made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul,
and had run through great
Employments, and ſuperintended divers
Provinces; for which Reaſons they
thought he would not diſlike the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
they were about to make to him.
The Empire would come now very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
to crown his other Dignities.
They thought alſo the Senate and People
of <hi>Rome</hi> would be ſatisfied with their
Choice, in regard he was not only ſprung
from Illuſtious Anceſtors, but had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
as it were gradually through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Truſts and Honours, to this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Dignity.</p>
               <p>This Buſineſs hapned at a Time
when <hi>Gordian</hi> liv'd at his private Houſe,
in the enjoyment of a Retreat from the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:94482:179"/>
Fatigues and Ceremonies of his Publick
Character. The Youths who headed
the Mob, as ſoon as they came to the
Houſe ſeiz'd the Porters, and ruſh'd
violently into the Houſe with their
Swords drawn, where they found <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
repoſing himſelf upon a Couch,
and inſtantly put Robes of Purple upon
him, and declar'd him Emperor with
the uſual Solemnity. So ſurprizing an
Accident infinitely amaz'd him; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
thought 'twas ſome Deſign againſt
his Life: So he flung himſelf from his
Couch upon the Ground, and beſought
them to ſpare an old Man, who had
done them no Injury, and advis'd them
to be cautious how they violated their
Faith and Loyalty to their Prince. And
when they importun'd him, and held
up their naked Swords, ſo great was his
preſent Fright, and ſo utterly ignorant
was he of the whole Matter, that he
could not apprehend what they meant,
nor divine the Reaſons of the Tumult.
So one of the Youths, that was ſprung
from a nobler Stock than the reſt, and was
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:94482:180"/>
the moſt powerful Orator among them,
commanded Silence, and laying his Hand
upon his Sword, deliver'd himſelf to him
in the following Words.</p>
               <p>SIR, You muſt take your Choice of two
Dangers; the one preſent and certain,
the other future and contingent. We leave
it to your Diſcretion, whether you'll be
ſav'd with us, and lay hold on this favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Conjuncture, to which we have all truſted,
or be inſtantly murder'd by thoſe Hands
that make you this Tender of Safety. If
you chuſe the former, you have many and
rational Grounds of Incouragement. <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
is univerſally hated; and by taking
him off you'll reſcue us from the cruel Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of a Barbarous Tyrant, and will
encreaſe the Luſtre of your former Actions
by a conſiderable Acceſſion of Glory, the juſt
Reward of ſo generous an Undertaking.
You will receive alſo eminent Acknowledgments
for the ſame, and immortal Honours from
the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate and People. But if
you refuſe to concur with us, we will cut
you in Pieces this Day, and ſacrifice our
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:94482:180"/>
ſelves (if need be) in the Quarrel. We
have done that which we can't imagine will
ever be pardon'd: We have murder'd the
Procurator, that Tool of Villainy, and he
has receiv'd that Reward from our Hands
which his Cruelty has long cry'd aloud for.
In ſhort, Sir, if you'll engage in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
and run the Riſque that it may
expoſe us to, we will ſet you upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Throne; and ſo far ſhall this Action
of ours be from being condemn'd, that the
whole World ſhall applaud it.</p>
               <p>In the middle of this Harangue the
Mob grew impatient, and with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the Citizens, who were all
drawn hither by the News of this Days
Action, proclaim'd <hi>Gordian</hi> Emperor.
He excus'd himſelf at firſt, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his great Age had render'd him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to execute ſo important a Truſt;
yet he accepted it with all his Heart;
for he was naturally very deſirous of
Glory, and of the two Dangers was
willing to chuſe that which only threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him at a diſtance: Nay, he was
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:94482:181"/>
content even to die, ſo he might fall
with the Scepter in his Hands, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize
the laſt Scenes of his Life. Then
follow'd a formidable Riſing; all <hi>Africk</hi>
was in Arms, and <hi>Maximine</hi>'s Images
were demoliſh'd, and <hi>Gordian</hi>'s ſet up
in all the Towns and Cities. They alſo
honour'd him with the Surname of
<hi>Africanus,</hi> the Southern <hi>Lybians</hi> being
call'd <hi>Afri,</hi> or <hi>Africani,</hi> by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While theſe Things were doing, <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
was at <hi>Thyſtrum,</hi> where he ſtaid two
or three Days after he had taken upon
him the Habit and Character of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:
Then he march'd to <hi>Carthage,</hi> a
rich and populous City, where he might
in all Points maintain a Port and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
equal to the Emperors in <hi>Rome.</hi>
This City for Largeneſs, Wealth, and
Number of Inhabitants, diſputes the
Precedence with <hi>Alexandria</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
and is inferior only to <hi>Rome.</hi> There fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him all the Pageantry of a Crown.
The Soldiers and talleſt of the Citizens
went after him, in imitation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
Life-guard. Rods of Laurel
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:94482:181"/>
alſo, and Fire, Marks of Honour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
Princes from Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
were born before him in State;
inſomuch that <hi>Carthage</hi> for a ſhort time
repreſented the Imperial City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gordian</hi> ſent Letters to the Chief
Men in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the moſt eminent
of the Senators, the greateſt part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were engag'd to him by Friendſhips
and Alliances: He publiſh'd alſo Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
directed to the Senate and People
of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſetting forth the unanimous
Conſent of the <hi>Africans</hi> in his Election,
and the barbarous Cruelties of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Emperor, which he knew were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
abhorr'd. Then he gave all
the Aſſurances that could be of a gentle
and benign Government, baniſh'd all
common Informers, revers'd unjuſt
Judgments, and allow'd the Parties
aggriev'd the Benefit of a new Defence.
Thoſe that were exil'd he reſtor'd to
their Native Countries, and promis'd a
Dole to the People, and a Largeſs to
the Soldiers, greater than had ever been
given before. He alſo laid a Train to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:94482:182"/>
deſtroy <hi>Vitalian</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian</hi>
Band, who was a cruel and a
bloody Man, and a firm Friend to <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
and his Intereſts, to which he was
entirely devoted: For he foreſaw that
he would vigorouſly oppoſe his Deſigns,
and affright other People from ſtirring
in his behalf: So he ſent the <hi>Quaeſtor</hi> of
the Province, a bold brawny Youth,
that was in the flower of his Age, and
ready to run any Hazard in his Service,
and order'd certain Centurions and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to accompany him, and gave him
Letters ſeal'd with two Seals, in which
ſecret Intelligences are wont to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to the Emperor. They were
inſtructed to enter the City in the Night,
and go directly to <hi>Vitalian</hi> in his Office
where he us'd to take and examine all
ſecret Informations and Diſcoveries
which any way concern'd the Emperor's
Safety. As ſoon as they came to him,
they were to acquaint him, <hi>That they
had Letters for</hi> Maximine <hi>that contain'd
ſecret Advices, and that they were ſent upon
Buſineſs that nearly concern'd the Safety of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:94482:182"/>
his Perſon:</hi> After which they were to
deſire a private Conference, wherein
they might lay before him their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in the Affair they were ſent about;
and while he was viewing the Seals, they
might pretend to ſpeak to him, and ſo
fall upon him with their Ponyards and
kill him: All which ſucceeded as he
deſir'd. They came to him before it
was light, about which time he was
commonly ſtirring, and found him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended
and almoſt alone: Some were
not yet come, others had been at his
Levy, and were gone again. He was
at leiſure, ſo they were eaſily admitted,
and acquainted him with their Buſineſs,
and deliver'd the Letters; and while he
was poring over the Seals, they aſſaulted
and kill'd him; and when they had
done, bolted forth with their naked
Ponyards, and eſcap'd; the People that
were before the Door of his Office re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
in aſtoniſhment, and giving them
way; for they ſuppos'd that all had been
done by the Emperor's Order, who had
often rewarded the Services of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94482:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Favourites in the ſame manner.
Then they came into the <hi>Sacred Way,</hi>
and diſpers'd <hi>Gordian</hi>'s Declaration, that
was directed to the People, and deliver'd
the Letters to the Conſuls and the reſt,
and ſpread abroad Rumors that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
was ſlain: Upon which the People
ran about, as if they had been ſeiz'd
with ſome ſudden Frenzy; for the
<hi>Mobile</hi> in all Countries is the ſame, fickle,
inconſtant, Lovers of Changes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions;
yet of all Nations under the
Sun, the <hi>Romans</hi> are certainly the moſt
capricious, in regard they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of ſo many differing and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Mixtures.</p>
               <p>In this ſudden Tumult all <hi>Maximine</hi>'s
Statues were pull'd down, all Men flung
off the Maſque, now they were deliver'd
from the Fears which had oblig'd them
to wear it, and diſcover'd their Hatred
and Deteſtation of the Tyrant. The
Senate, without examining the Grounds
of the Report concerning his Death,
conjecturing only from the preſent
Stream of Affairs, proclaim'd <hi>Gordian</hi>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:94482:183"/>
and his Son Emperors, and abrogated
all the Honours that had been heap'd
upon <hi>Maximine.</hi> All common Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Court-Sycophants either fled, or
were cut to Pieces by thoſe whom they
had injur'd: The Procurators and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
thoſe Tools and Inſtruments of
Tyranny, were dragg'd by the People
into the Common Shore. Beſide theſe,
many innocent Men were ſacrific'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this Publick Diſorder; Debtors
kill'd their Creditors; and if any Man
had an Adverſary in a Suit then depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or the leaſt Ground of private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
againſt a Perſon, he boldly
ruſh'd in upon him, and with Force and
Arms rifled the Houſe, and flew the
Maſter. Thus, under pretext of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Peace, was the Empire thrown
into Convulſions, and felt the Effects of
a Civil War: And when <hi>Sabinus,</hi> a
Conſular Man, and Praefect of the City,
endeavour'd to repreſs theſe Inſolencies,
he had his Scull ſplit by a Blow which
he receiv'd on his Head with a Club: So
great were the Outrages committed at
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:94482:184"/>
this time by the People. The Senate
too had proceeded ſo far, that they durſt
not retreat for fear of <hi>Maximine:</hi> So
they ſet all Engines at work to make
the Provinces revolt: They ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
to the Praefects Men choſen
out of the Senate and Gentry of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and gave them Letters declaring the
Senſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> People and Senate
in relation to the preſent Juncture of
Affairs, and exhorting them to join with
them in aſſerting the Liberty of their
Country, and of the Great Council of
the Empire, and in perſwading the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
to perſevere in their Duty and
Obedience to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> in
whom the Empire of the World had
been lodg'd for divers Ages, and to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
that Amity which had been ſo
happily begun and maintain'd by their
Anceſtors. The Ambaſſadors met with
a kind Reception in moſt Places, and
found a general Diſaffection in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
to the preſent Government, which
they improv'd into an actual and open
Rebellion. Such Magiſtrates as adher'd
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:94482:184"/>
to <hi>Maximine</hi> were kill'd, and the reſt fell
in with the Faction in <hi>Rome.</hi> Some few
indeed there were that kill'd thoſe that
were ſent to them, or ſent them away
with a ſtrong Guard to <hi>Maximine,</hi> who
put them to exquiſite Torments. Theſe
were the Diſpoſitions of the People in
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximine</hi> upon receiving the News
hereof was much troubled in Mind,
but would not reveal his ſecret Agonies
to the World, but pretended to deſpiſe
all theſe Things as the harmleſs Efforts
of impotent Men: Nevertheleſs, he
ſtaid at home all the firſt and ſecond
Day after the News came, and advis'd
with his Council about the Meaſures to
be taken in the preſent Exigency. The
Army and People in thoſe Parts knew
very well the whole Riſe and Progreſs
of this Rebellion, and were aſtoniſh'd
at ſo bold an Attempt; but they held
their Tongues, and pretended Ignorance
of the whole Buſineſs; for ſo great were
the Jealouſies of the Emperor, that he
ſet Spies to obſerve not only the Words
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:94482:185"/>
but even the Nods and Motions of the
People. On the third Day he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Army to aſſemble before
the Gates of the City, where he read a
ſhort Speech to them, which his Friends
had compos'd for him, in the following
Words.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>I</hi> Have ſomething to impart to you which
is very ſtrange, and almoſt incredible;
tho' truly, in my opinion, it deſerves rather
to be laugh'd than wonder'd at. 'Tis not the
<hi>Germans,</hi> whom you have ſo often van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd,
that contemn the Reputation of your
Valour, and have taken up Arms againſt us;
nor the <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> who make ſuch conſtant
Applications to this Court for Peace; nor
the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who ſome Years ago over-ran
<hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> but are now glad to poſſeſs
what they have in quiet: The Glory of your
Arms, and their Experience of our Courage,
when we commanded the Army upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:94482:185"/>
has effectually deterr'd them from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
any thing againſt us: But (that I
may ſay no worſe) an Epidemical Madneſs
has ſeiz'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and they have,
either by Perſwaſion or Force, ſet up an old
Wretch, that is ready to drop into the Grave,
to act as it were the King in a Play. For
what Army can they have to ſupport his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
who are forc'd to make <hi>Lictors</hi>
execute the Commiſſion of <hi>Proconſul?</hi> Or,
admitting they had Men, what would that
avail without Arms? And 'tis well known
they have none, beſides the Half-Pikes which
they uſe in hunting Wild Beaſts. And for
Martial Diſcipline, there is no ſuch thing
amongſt them; but in ſtead thereof, Songs,
Dances, and looſe Raillery.</p>
                           <p>Nor would I have any of you diſheartned
by the Advices which we receive from <hi>Rome.
Vitalian</hi> is treacherouſly murder'd, and you
are all acquainted with the Levity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, and know
very well how much their Words are more
formidable than their Actions. Three or four
armed Men would put them all in diſorder;
and while every Man ſhifted for himſelf,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:94482:186"/>
they would all abandon the Common Cauſe. As
for the Proceedings of the Senate, 'tis no
wonder that my Temperance hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſteful,
and that his Luxury is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them, as ſuiting better with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Humour prevailing amongſt them.
There is nothing done worthy of a Man or a
Prince, but they brand it with the black
Epithets of Cruel and Tyrannical; and, on
the other Hand, the moſt ſcandalous Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities
are cry'd up under the popular Names
of Gentleneſs and Clemency. And this is the
Reaſon that they diſlike the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
'tis too regular and uniform for them;
and 'tis on the ſame ſcore that they extol
<hi>Gordian,</hi> to whoſe Infamy, I ſuppoſe, none
of you are Strangers. Theſe are the Men
with whom we are to wage War, if it may
deſerve that Name; tho' truly I and moſt
Men are of Opinion, that as ſoon as we ſet
Foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> they will all caſt themſelves at
our Feet with their Children, and with Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches
in their Hands, entreat for Mercy;
except ſuch whoſe Fears won't ſuffer them to
do even that. Their Eſtates will fall into

               <p>After he had deliver'd himſelf to this
effect, and had by the way thrown
many Reproaches upon the Senate and
People of <hi>Rome,</hi> menacing with his
Hands and Countenance, which was as
full of Indignation as if the Perſons that
had thus inflam'd him had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
he proclaim'd his Expedition for
<hi>Italy,</hi> and diſtributed great Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
among the Soldiers. The ſecond
Day after he began his March, with a
numerous Army, and the whole Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Force of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. There
follow'd him alſo ſeveral <hi>German</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
conſiſting of ſuch as he had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſubdu'd by Force, or prevail'd upon
by Perſwaſion to embrace his Friendſhip
and Alliance. He carried with him
alſo all the Engines of War which he
intended to make uſe of againſt the
<hi>Germans.</hi> He march'd the more ſlowly,
becauſe he was oblig'd to take up Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
and other Neceſſaries by the way:
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:94482:187"/>
For the Expedition being ſudden, due
Care had not been taken in providing
Things for the Uſe and Neceſſities of
the Soldiers; the Preparations, ſuch as
they were, being made in haſte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
So he judg'd it adviſable to
ſend out a ſtrong Detachment to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
<hi>Italy,</hi> before the Groſs of his Army
ſhould arrive. For this important Piece
of Service he pitch'd upon the <hi>Pannonian</hi>
Cohorts, being thoſe in which he moſt
confided, becauſe they were the firſt
that proclaim'd him Emperor, and had
on all Occaſions declar'd their Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to venture all they had in his
Service.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Maximine</hi> was upon his March,
the Deſigns of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Faction
went not on ſo proſperouſly as was
expected. <hi>Capellian,</hi> a Noble Senator,
was at this time Governour of <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania,</hi>
which by the <hi>Romans</hi> is call'd <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia,</hi>
and had conſiderable Forces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Command, which are maintain'd
for the defence of the Province againſt
the Inſults of Barbarous Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:94482:187"/>
There was, and had been for divers
Years, a Miſunderſtanding between <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
and this <hi>Capellian,</hi> occaſion'd at firſt
by a Suit in Law: So when <hi>Gordian</hi> was
declar'd Emperor, he nominated a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to ſucceed him, and commanded
him to depart out of the Province.
Netled with this Indignity, and being
beſides a great Stickler for <hi>Maximine,</hi>
(for 'twas he that rais'd him to this
Dignity) he call'd his Soldiers together,
and exhorted them to preſerve inviolate
their Faith and Allegiance to <hi>Maximine,</hi>
and march'd directly to <hi>Carthage</hi> with a
gallant Army, compos'd of brave Men,
in the flower of their Age, well appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and diſciplin'd, and by reaſon of
their frequent Rencounters with the
Barbarians, forward enough to give the
Enemy Battel.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Gordian</hi> was advertis'd of
the Approach of this Army, he was in
great Conſternation. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
were alſo alarm'd, and relying more on
the Number, than the Order and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of their Forces, march'd all out to
meet <hi>Capellian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:94482:188"/>
Some ſay, that <hi>Gordian,</hi> as ſoon as he
arriv'd at <hi>Carthage,</hi> conſidering the great
Strength of <hi>Maximine,</hi> and that there
was no Force in <hi>Africk</hi> able to oppoſe
him, ſtrangled himſelf; but the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
concealing his Death, made choice
of his Son to head them, and coming
to an Engagement, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were
ſuperior to the Enemy in Number, but
without Order, and undiſciplin'd. They
had liv'd a long time in an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Tranquillity, and were enervated by
Eaſe and Pleaſure, to which they had
reſign'd themſelves. Beſides, they were
unprovided of Arms, and all ſort of
Ammunition; only each Man brought
with him from home an Ax, or a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or a Hunting Lance, or a Stake
burnt and ſharpned at the end, for the
Defence of his Body. On the other
Hand, the <hi>Numidians</hi> were expert Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and excellent Horſemen, inſomuch
that they ride without Bridles, with a
Switch only in their Hand, with which
they could manage and command their
Horſes as they thought fit: So they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:94482:188"/>
put the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to flight, who
did not expect till the Charge was given,
but flung away their Arms, and fled
with ſuch precipitation, that more of
their Men were kill'd by their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that trampled upon and ran over
them in the Diſorder of the Flight, than
by the Sword of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gordian</hi>'s Son was kill'd in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with all thoſe that were near his
Perſon; and ſo great was the Number
of the Slain, that ſeveral Perſons of
Note, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Gordian</hi>'s
Son, could not be found to receive Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Honours. Of thoſe that fled, ſuch
only eſcaped as got into <hi>Carthage,</hi> and
put themſelves into a Concealment in
that large and populous City; but their
Number was but ſmall. As for the
reſt, while every Man preſs'd forward,
and endeavour'd to enter the Town,
they ſtopp'd and hinder'd one another,
and were all cut in Pieces by the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that purſu'd them, before the
Faces of their Wives and Children,
who expreſs'd all the Degrees of Grief
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:94482:189"/>
that ſuch a Tragedy might juſtly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>Others report, that as ſoon as <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>
who by reaſon of his Age ſtaid at
home, receiv'd an Account of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Iſſue of this Engagement, and
that <hi>Capellian</hi> had enter'd <hi>Carthage,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
his Condition as deſperate, he
withdrew into his Bed-chamber alone, as
if he would lie down upon his Couch,
and there ſtrangled himſelf in his Girdle.</p>
               <p>This was the End of <hi>Gordian,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long Courſe of proſperous Fortune,
dy'd in an imaginary Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capellian,</hi> immediately after his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the City, put to death all
the Men of principal Conſideration that
ſurviv'd the Battel, and ſeiz'd into his
Hands all the Treaſure both Publick
and Private, not ſparing even the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
He dealt alſo in the like manner
with the other Cities that had demoliſh'd
<hi>Maximine</hi>'s Statues, putting to death the
leading Men, and baniſhing the reſt,
giving up all the Country to the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Ravage of his Soldiers. This
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:94482:189"/>
he did under pretext of puniſhing them
for their Defection from <hi>Maximine;</hi> tho'
in truth his Deſign was to ingratiate
with the Soldiers, that if any thing
ſhould happen to <hi>Maximine,</hi> he might
have at his beck a Force ſufficient to
eſtabliſh him upon his Throne. This
was the State of Affairs in <hi>Africk.</hi>

               <p>Upon the News of <hi>Gordian</hi>'s Death,
the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> were in
great Conſternation. He was the Man
they chiefly relied upon; and they knew
very well that <hi>Maximine</hi> would never
forgive them. He always hated them
in his Heart, and now he had juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to proceed againſt them as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
Enemies. So a Conſult was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
upon, wherein they were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
about the Meaſures to be taken in
this hazardous Conjuncture. The Reſult
was, <hi>That there ſhould be a general Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
that two Emperors ſhould be choſen,
in whoſe Hands the Supreme Power ſhould
be lodg'd, that their Conſtitution might not a
ſecond time be endanger'd by Tyranny.</hi> The
Aſſembly was not held in the Senate-Houſe,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:94482:190"/>
but in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter
Capitolinus,</hi> to which the <hi>Romans</hi> pay
ſingular Veneration, as if nothing was
to be done but in the Preſence and
with the Approbation and Concurrence
of the God. Then ſome of the eldeſt
and moſt Noble of the Senators were
made choice of to be propos'd to the
Aſſembly; after which they proceeded
to vote, and the Majority being found
for <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus,</hi> they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
Emperors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximus</hi> had commanded ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
had been <hi>Praefect</hi> of the City, and
acquitted himſelf very honourably in
that Truſt; by which means he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
the Character of a Good Man
and a Prudent Governor. <hi>Albinus</hi> was
of a Noble Family, and had been twice
Conſul. He had govern'd divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
without Blame or Cenſure, and
in his Converſation was an open plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing
Man. After their Election, they
were proclaim'd, and inveſted in the
Imperial Dignity by Decree of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:94482:190"/>
While theſe Things were tranſacting
in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> the People came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what was in agitation, either
by ſome Rumours that were ſpread
abroad, or by ſome Intimation which
they receiv'd from <hi>Gordian</hi>'s Party. So
they went up in a tumultuary manner
with Stones and Clubs to the Gates, and
poſſeſs'd all the Avenues to the <hi>Capitol</hi>
with a numerous Mob, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to oppoſe the Proceedings of
the Senate. They excepted chiefly
againſt <hi>Maximus,</hi> as being too ſevere
and rigid for them. He had been very
active in executing the Laws upon bad
Men, ſo they were apprehenſive of his
Government, and declar'd their Diſlike
of him aloud, with their Clamours
mixing Menaces to kill them both as
ſoon as they came out. They demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Prince of the Race of <hi>Gordian,</hi> that
the Empire might remain in that Name
and Line. <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus,</hi> with
a Guard compos'd of the City-Troops,
and ſome Gentlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to force their Way out of the <hi>Capitol,</hi>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:94482:191"/>
but were beat back with Stones and
Clubs, till at laſt ſomebody found a
Way to impoſe upon the People.</p>
               <p>There was a young Lad, Son to <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>'s
Daughter, who was call'd after
his Grandfather: Him they order'd to
be brought to them, and ſent certain
Perſons to fetch him, who found him at
home, and at play; and ſetting him
upon their Shoulders, carried him
through the middle of the Mob, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to the People as they went
along, and crying aloud, <hi>Behold</hi> Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian<hi>'s
Grandſon!</hi> and calling him often
by his Name. The People all the time
expreſs'd their Affections to him in
Shouts of Joy, and as a farther Token
thereof, ſcatter'd Flowers upon him as
he paſs'd through them. The Senate
declar'd him <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in regard the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of his Age made him unfit to
have the Regency in his Hands; and
the Mob being appeas'd, the Emperors
Elect were ſuffer'd to go quietly to their
Palace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:94482:191"/>
About this time an Accident hapned
of very fatal Conſequence to the City
of <hi>Rome,</hi> occaſion'd by the Raſhneſs of
two Senators. The Senate met to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of the State of the Empire, and ſome
of <hi>Maximine</hi>'s Soldiers, that by reaſon
of their Age were excus'd from any
further Service in the Wars, and were
left in the Camp, being deſirous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
themſelves of the Matters then
under Debate, came without their Arms
to the Door of the Senate, and mixing
with the other Crowd, ſtaid there to
liſten; and two or three at the moſt,
that were more curious than the reſt,
preſs'd in, till they were got beyond
the Altar of <hi>Victory:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi>
a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> who had lately been
Conſul, and was then Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi>
together with <hi>Moecenas,</hi> who had been
<hi>Praetor,</hi> making up to them, ſtabb'd
them to the Heart with Ponyards which
they carried privately about them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could pluck their Hands from
under their Cloaks; ſo ſudden was the
Aſſault, and ſo little were they aware
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:94482:192"/>
of it. For about that time all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
wore Swords, and had worn them
ever ſince the late Tumult, either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
or privately, for the Defence of
themſelves againſt any Attempt which
might be made upon them by their
Enemies. The Soldiers that were ſtabb'd
fell down dead before the Altar, and
the reſt were ſo terrified with the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
that befel their Friends, and ſo
apprehenſive of the Rage of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
eſpecially at a time when they were
without their Arms, that they betook
themſelves inſtantly to their Heels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gallicanus</hi> ruſh'd out of the Senate
into the middle of the Crowd, and held
up his Hand and Sword all cover'd with
Blood, ſo as all the People might ſee
it, and then exhorted them <hi>to purſue
and put to the Sword all</hi> Maximine'<hi>s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Adherents, as Enemies and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to the Senate and Common-wealth.</hi> The
Mob was eaſily inflam'd, and applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Gallicanus,</hi> purſu'd the Soldiers as far
as they could, with great eagerneſs, pelt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them all the way with Stones: But
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:94482:192"/>
they were too nimble, and got into the
Camp before them, and ſhutting the
Gates, reſolv'd to defend themſelves as
well as they could; for they were but
few in Number, and the moſt of thoſe
too wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gallicanus,</hi> after this unparallell'd Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
was very induſtrious to embroil
the Empire in a Civil War, which prov'd
very miſchievous to the Publick Weal:
For he commanded the Publick Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to be broke open, and order'd every
Man to take out Arms for himſelf, tho'
they were altogether unfit for Service,
and intended only for Shew. The Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Schools were likewiſe open'd, and
the Gladiators order'd to march out in
their proper Armour. Nor was there
any Sword, Spear, Ax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any Shop
or Private Houſe, but was ſeiz'd upon,
and carried away by Force: And ſo high
ran the Popular Fury at this time, that
every Thing they laid Hand upon, if
it was poſſible, was preſently converted
into ſome ſort of Weapon. After they
were arm'd, they march'd in a Body to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:94482:193"/>
the Camp, and inveſted it, as if it had
been a Town which they purpos'd to
beſiege; but the Defendants were old
experienc'd Soldiers, and made ſuch uſe
of their Targets, and of the Shelter
which their Ramparts afforded them,
that the Aſſailants could not annoy
them; but, on the contrary, they gall'd
them with their Arrows, and puſh'd
them from the Walls with long Pikes,
which they repeated as often as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had Courage to renew their Attacks,
till at laſt the People grew weary, and
the greateſt part of the Gladiators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wounded, and the Night coming
on, all were willing to return into the
City: Which the Soldiers in the Camp
perceiving, and obſerving how diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and unguarded their Retreat was,
(for they did not imagine that ſo ſmall
a Number of Men durſt ſally out upon
ſo great a Multitude) they pour'd out
their whole Force upon them, and cut
off the Gladiators entirely, with great
Numbers of the Common People, which
periſh'd in the Hurry of this Action.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:94482:193"/>
After this Succeſs the Soldiers did not
think fit to purſue their Blow, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to their Camp, and kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
within their Walls.</p>
               <p>This Defeat ſerv'd only to exaſperate
the Senate and People of <hi>Rome:</hi> So their
Captains proceeded to the making their
Levies, and a general Rendezvous was
appointed, where all the Youth of <hi>Italy</hi>
met, and were arm'd as well as the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs
of the Occaſion would permit.
The greateſt part of them were led by
<hi>Maximus</hi> againſt <hi>Maximine:</hi> The reſt
were left at home for the Defence of
the City.</p>
               <p>In this Interval Aſſaults were every
Day made upon the Camp, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Succeſs; the Place was ſtill defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Aſſailants always ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
repuls'd by the Soldiers, who gave
them very warm Reception from the
Walls.</p>
               <p>'Twas too about this time that <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,</hi>
who ſtaid in the City, put out an
Edict, wherein he exhorted the People
to an Accommodation with the Soldiers,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:94482:194"/>
and promis'd the Soldiers an Oblivion
of all that was paſt; but both Parties
were inflexible, the People being ready
to burſt with Indignation, that ſuch a
Multitude ſhould be thus out-brav'd by
a Handful of Men; and, on the other
Hand, the Soldiers reſenting as heinouſly
the Treatment which they receiv'd from
the People, being more inhumane than
they could expect even at the Hands of
Barbarous Enemies.</p>
               <p>In concluſion, after many fruitleſs
Attacks made upon the Walls of the
Camp, it was reſolv'd in a Council of
War, that all Supplies of Water ſhould
be cut off from the Camp, by which
Means the Soldiers would be reduc'd
to ſuch Extremities for want thereof, as
would oblige them to ſurrender. In
order hereunto, all the Rivers that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the Camp were choak'd up, and
their Water drawn into new Channels:
But the Soldiers apprehending what
Danger they were in, and growing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
deſperate, open'd their Gates, and
ſally'd out in a Body, and after a ſharp
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:94482:194"/>
Diſpute, put the Multitude to flight,
and purſu'd them into the City.</p>
               <p>The People now perceiv'd they were
much inferior to the Soldiers in a Pitch'd
Battle; ſo they fled into their Houſes,
and threw down upon them Stones and
Tiles; the Soldiers not daring to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, becauſe they were unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Houſes. The Shops too, as
well as the Houſes, were ſhut upon
them; ſo they ſet Fire to the Doors,
and to the wooden Porches, whereof
there are great numbers in this City,
and by reaſon of the Cloſeneſs of the
Streets, and the great Quantity of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the Buildings, eaſily laid the beſt
part of the City in Aſhes.</p>
               <p>A great many rich Men loſt in this
Fire all their Precious Movables, and
indeed their whole Eſtates, and were
reduc'd to Beggary. Great numbers of
Men too periſh'd in the Fire, their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
being in a Flame about their Ears,
and all the Ways to eſcape poſſeſs'd by
the mercileſs Element. There was ſcarce
any rich Man's Houſe that was not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:94482:195"/>
pillag'd during this Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;
for all the poor Scoundrels, and
profligate Wretches about Town, fell
in with the Soldiers, in hopes to make
their Fortune by the Plunder: And, in
ſhort, there were as many Houſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
by this Fire, as would make a
very large City.</p>
               <p>While theſe Things were doing in
<hi>Rome, Maximine</hi> arriv'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſacrific'd upon the Frontiers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
upon his Journey, after he had
order'd his Men to keep their Ranks,
and march in their Arms. Thus we
have given a ſummary Relation of the
<hi>African</hi> Rebellion, of the Civil War in
<hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Maximine</hi>'s Atchievements
and Expeditions. The reſt we reſerve

of the Heats and Animoſities that
hapned between the Soldiers and People

Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximine</hi> was now with his Army
on the Frontiers of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſent out
his Scouts before him, for fear of an
Ambuſcade, which might be lodg'd
in the thick Woods on the <hi>Alps,</hi> or in the
vaſt Inequalities of thoſe Mountains.
Then he led his Army into the Plain,
and drew up his Legions into a Square
Body, not regarding in what Depth
they were rang'd, but taking care to
extend his Front, that they might take
up the more Ground. All the Baggage,
Beaſts, and Carriages were taken into
the middle; then follow'd <hi>Maximine</hi>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:94482:196"/>
with his Guards to cover the Rear. The
Wings conſiſted of Horſemen in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Armour, with whom were ranged
the Eaſtern Archers, and the <hi>Mooriſh</hi>
Darters. There were alſo divers Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
Regiments of <hi>German</hi> Horſe, which
<hi>Maximine</hi> always oppos'd to the firſt
Shocks of the Enemy, becauſe they are
very hot, and diſcharge their whole
Fury in the Beginning of an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that the Danger, if any
were, might fall upon the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
who might the beſt be ſpar'd. Thus
rang'd, he march'd over all that Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne
Country, till he came to the firſt
City of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is call'd by the
Natives <hi>Ema;</hi> 'tis ſituated at the Roots
of the <hi>Alps,</hi> on the utmoſt Point of the
Level. Here the Scouts return'd to
<hi>Maximine</hi> with Intelligence that the Town
was abandon'd, and that the Inhabitants
were fled, after they had burnt all the
Doors of the Houſes and Temples, and
carry'd away or deſtroy'd all they had
in the City or Country adjoining, and
left neither Proviſion nor Forage for Man
or Beaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:94482:197"/>
                  <hi>Maximine</hi> was glad to find the People
under ſo great a Terror, and hop'd to
meet with the ſame Diſpoſitions in the
reſt, and that none would be ſo hardy
as to abide his Coming: But his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were differently affected; they
thought it very hard that they ſhould
be oblig'd in this manner to conflict
with a Famine in the beginning of an
Expedition. Part of the Army lay that
Night in the City, in the open Houſes,
the reſt took up their Quarters in the
Fields, and in the Morning, as ſoon as
the Sun aroſe, they began their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to the <hi>Alps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Alps</hi> are a Chain of Hills rais'd
by Nature to be a Wall and a Bulwark
to <hi>Italy:</hi> They are ſo high, that they
ſeem to ſurmount the very Clouds;
and ſo extended in length, that they run
acroſs the whole Country, ſtretching on
the Left Hand to the <hi>Tyrrhene,</hi> and on
the Right to the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea. They are
all cover'd with thick Woods, and are
almoſt impaſſable, by reaſon of the
narrow Paths, craggy Rocks, and ſteep
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:94482:197"/>
Precipices. Some Tracks indeed there
are hewn out by the indefatigable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of the old <hi>Italians.</hi> Here the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was under great Apprehenſions, that
the Tops of the Mountains were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd,
and all the Ways block'd up by
the Enemy, to impeach their Paſſage;
and not without juſt Reaſon, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to any Man that conſiders the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Place: But after they had
paſs'd the <hi>Alps</hi> without any Difficulty,
and encamp'd on the other ſide, they
ſoon recover'd their wonted Courage,
and began to triumph as if they had
already vanquiſh'd; and <hi>Maximine</hi> did
not doubt of Succeſs now in whatever
he ſhould undertake, ſeeing the <hi>Italians</hi>
durſt not uſe the Advantages which the
Difficulties of the Place afforded them,
of laying Ambuſcades, and annoying
the Enemy without any Hazard to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and of engaging them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
with the Benefit of a higher
Ground.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had they paſs'd the <hi>Alps,</hi>
but the Scouts return'd with Advice,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:94482:198"/>
that <hi>Aquileia,</hi> the greateſt City of <hi>Italy,</hi>
had ſhut her Gates, and that the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonian</hi>
Regiments that were ſent before,
had made ſeveral vigorous Attacks upon
her Walls, but were always repuls'd
with Stones. Spears, and Arrows, which
the Beſieg'd ſhot at them without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion;
and that now being ſore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd
and harraſs'd, they had rais'd the
Siege. Hereupon <hi>Maximine</hi> conceiv'd
great Indignation againſt the <hi>Pannonian</hi>
Soldiers, for their Behaviour in this late
Action, and haſtned with his whole
Army to the Siege, thinking to carry
the Place without any Difficulty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aquileia</hi> is a City populous and large,
and as it were the Mart-Town of <hi>Italy,</hi>
ſituate on the Sea-coaſt, upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Illyria.</hi> She ſupplies all the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
that ſail that way with Proviſions
and other Merchandiſe from the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
which are brought down thither
both by Land and Water; and ſends
up alſo from the Sea into the Continent
ſuch Commodities as will not grow in
the midland Country, by reaſon of the
ſevere Winters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:94482:198"/>
Her Staple Commodity is Wine,
whereof the Product is ſo confiderable
in this Country, that all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Provinces, that have not ſo much as
a Vineyard amongſt them, are ſupplied
from hence: For which Reaſons not
only the Citizens are very numerous,
but the Reſort of Strangers and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
is very conſiderable: And at this
time their Numbers were vaſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
by the prodigious Confluence of
Boors and Peaſants, who abandon'd all
the adjacent Villages, and retir'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
truſting to the Largeneſs of the
Town, and the Strength of its Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which in truth were old and
ruinous, and for the moſt part demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd:
For the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> after the
Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
had no Occaſion for Arms or Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but enjoy'd for divers Years an
uninterrupted Tranquillity, and were
combin'd into one Body Politick with
the Capital City of the Empire: But in
this Extremity of Affairs they fell to
repairing the Walls, rais'd new Towers
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:94482:199"/>
and Baſtions, and encompaſs'd the City
with a Fortification, which the People
guarded Night and Day with that Skill
and Bravery, that they utterly baffled
all the Efforts of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>On this Occaſion <hi>Criſpinus</hi> and <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi>
two Conſular Men, were made
choice of by the Senate, and had the
Supreme Authority put into their Hands.
They took all imaginable Care to lay
in Proviſions for a long Siege; and as
for Water, they could have Plenty out
of the Pits, whereof were great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
within the Walls, and out of the
River that ran by the Town, affording
not only Supplies of Water, but the
Protection of a Trench to the Beſieg'd.
Theſe were the Preparations in the
City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximine</hi> hearing that their Gates
were ſhut, and that the City was in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of Defence, thought it moſt advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
to ſend Commiſſioners to treat
with them, and try whether by that
means they could prevail upon them to
open their Gates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There was in his
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:94482:199"/>
Army at that time a Tribune, a Citizen
of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> whoſe Wife, Children, and
Family were amongſt the Beſieg'd; him
therefore, and certain Centurions, he ſent
to them, ſuppoſing that his Advice
would have ſuch weight with his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens,
as would eaſily induce
them to follow it. When they came
to the Wall, they ſpoke to them to this
effect.</p>
               <p>GEntlemen, <hi>Maximine</hi> our Leige Lord
commands you to lay down your
Arms, and to receive him not as an Enemy,
but a Friend; and adviſes you rather to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to the Gods, than to ſpill the Blood of
Men. He would have you duely affected
with the Ruine and Deſolation of your
Country, which, if you be obſtinate, will
certainly enſue. 'Tis in your own Power to
preſerve at once both your Country and your
ſelves. So gracious is our Prince, that he
offers you Pardon and Indemnity for all that
is paſt, being well aſſur'd, that what you
have hitherto done, has intirely proceeded
from the Inſtigation and Practices of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:94482:200"/>
Theſe Words were pronounc'd by
the Commiſſioners under the Wall, in a
loud Voice, ſo that all the People that
ſtood upon the Walls or Ramparts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſuch as were upon Duty in the
remote Parts of the Town, heard what
was ſaid; for they all kept ſilence, and
gave attention; inſomuch that <hi>Criſpinus</hi>
began to be afraid, and not without
juſt Reaſon, conſidering the Inſtability
of the Multitude, leſt they ſhould be
won upon by fair Promiſes to make
a Peace with the Emperor, and to open
their Gates: So he ran to and fro upon
the Walls, exhorting them to a gallant
Reſiſtance, and beſeeching them to hold
it out to the laſt, and not to violate
their Faith and Allegiance to the Senate
and People of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He re-minded them alſo of the Glory
of being the Deliverers and Protectors
of</hi> Italy, <hi>which they would merit by a
brave Deportment in this Juncture; and
advis'd them not to believe the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of a perjur'd and a faithleſs Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
who was then actually contriving
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94482:200"/>
their Deſtruction, and made uſe of fair
Words only to diſguiſe, and thereby
more ſurely to effect his hidden Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
He told them,</hi> That it was better to
truſt to the Chance of War; that a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Soldiers had often baffled a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Army; and that a mighty Hoſt had been
often vanquiſh'd by a ſmall Band of Men;
that there was another Reaſon why they ſhould
not be diſmaid at his Numbers; for when
Soldiers fight for other Men, to whom all
the Advantages of Succeſs redound, they are
apt to fight but lazily, and as Men not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Iſſue of the Battel; for they
know very well, that tho' they are admitted
to a Share in the Hazards and Dangers that
muſt be encounter'd in the obtaining a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yet when 'tis obtain'd, the whole Benefit
of it accrues to other Men; whereas when
Men fight for the Preſervation of their
Country, beſides that they have better Grounds
of Hope than the others, (in regard they
don't invade other Mens Property, but only
guard their own) they go on too with more
Alacrity and Chearfulneſs, becauſe on this
Occaſion they don't obey the Commands of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94482:201"/>
other Men, but the Dictates of their own
Neceſſity, and contend for a Victory, the
whole Fruit and Benefit whereof will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
their own.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like Conſiderations
<hi>Criſpinus</hi> ſuggeſted to them, ſometimes
addreſſing himſelf to the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
ſometimes to particular Perſons.
He was a Man naturally of an auguſt
Preſence, and very powerful in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Eloquence; he was too univerſally
belov'd, by reaſon of the great Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Equity of his Government:
So he confirm'd them in their firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
and commanded the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
to depart from the Walls
without effecting what they came for.</p>
               <p>'Twas ſaid, that <hi>Criſpinus</hi> was anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the making this reſolute Defence,
by the Soothſayers, who upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and view of the Entrails of the
Victims, gave him great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than which nothing makes ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Impreſſions upon the <hi>Italians.</hi> There
was alſo a Report handed about, <hi>That
a God of the Country, call'd by the</hi> Italians
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94482:201"/>
Beles, <hi>and ſuppos'd to be</hi> Apollo, <hi>and had
in great veneration in thoſe Parts, had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
that he ſhould be victorious.</hi> And
ſome of <hi>Maximine</hi>'s Soldiers affirm'd,
<hi>That they ſaw the Image of this God fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Air in defence of the City.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this was true, or it was only a Story
contriv'd to leſſen the Reproach that
would otherwiſe fall upon ſo great an
Army, for fighting ſo unſucceſsfully with
an undiſciplin'd Mob, inferiour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Number, and therefore they
would appear to the World to have
been vanquiſh'd rather by Gods than
Men, I leave a Queſtion. However it
was, an Event ſo ſtrange and ſurprizing
made all Things more credible.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners return'd to <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
and their ill Succeſs ſerv'd only to
inflame him to a higher Degree of Rage;
ſo he made ſwifter Advances with his
Army towards the City: But when he
came to a River about Sixteen Miles
from the Town, he found it exceeding
broad and deep, it being the time of
the Year when the Snow that is frozen
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:94482:202"/>
upon the neighbouring Hills in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was melted, which had ſwell'd the
River to ſo prodigious a height, that it
was abſolutely impoſſible to paſs his
Army over it: For the <hi>Aquileians</hi> had
taken care to break down a large and
goodly Bridge, built there of ſquare
Stone ſome Ages ago by the Emperors
of <hi>Rome:</hi> So there being no Bridge, nor
any Tranſport-Veſſels to carry over his
Army, he was oblig'd to make a Halt,
being utterly at a loſs what Counſels to
purſue.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Germans,</hi> being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the ſtrong and rapid Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the <hi>Italian</hi> Rivers, ſuppoſing that
they flow'd as gently as thoſe in their
own Country, (which for want of a
quick and violent Agitation are ſoon
frozen) ventur'd to take the River with
their Horſes, which tho' they could ſwim
very well, were all carried down by the
force of the Stream, and drown'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximine</hi> entrench'd his Army, for
fear of a Surprize; and having ſtaid in
his Pavilion two or three Days, went
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:94482:202"/>
out to view the River, and contrive a
Bridge over it; but wanting Materials,
<hi>viz.</hi> Timber and Boats, he was inform'd
by his Engineers, that in the abandon'd
Villages there were great Numbers of
round empty Veſſels of Wood, which
the Inhabitants made uſe of to carry
their Wine in; theſe were made hollow
like Ships, and they were of opinion,
that they would float upon the Water
like ſo many Wherries, and if they were
faſtned together, and cover'd with Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and good ſtore of Earth caſt upon
them, they would be firm enough to
ſtem the violence of the Current.</p>
               <p>By the help of this Project <hi>Maximine</hi>
eaſily paſs'd the River with his Army,
and advanc'd towards the City. They
found all the Country-Villages, as they
march'd along, forſaken by their Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and burnt and cut down all the
Vines and other Trees, utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Ornaments and Glory of the
Country: For the Trees are rang'd in
ſuch beautiful Order, and the Vines ſo
artfully diſpos'd, that their Branches
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:94482:203"/>
mingle as they grow, and afford a moſt
delightful Proſpect; the whole Country
appearing to the Eye to be adorn'd with
Crowns and Garlands, as at ſome ſolemn
Feſtival.</p>
               <p>But now all theſe were rooted up by
the ravaging Army, after which they
advanc'd to the Walls of the City: But
in regard the Soldiers were ſore harraſs'd
in their March, <hi>Maximine</hi> did not think
fit to attack the Town preſently; ſo he
encamp'd out of the reach of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Arrows, and divided his Army into
Cohorts and Parties, aſſigning to each
of them a part of the Wall; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
one Day only for Reſt, prepar'd
the Day following for the general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</p>
               <p>Accordingly at the Day they made
their Approaches with all ſort of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Engines, and aſſail'd the Walls with
great Fury, leaving no manner of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
unattempted. This was repeated
almoſt every Day, freſh Attacks being
made with great Vigour and Gallantry,
and the Walls ſurrounded by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:94482:203"/>
Notwithſtanding this, the <hi>Aquileians</hi>
made a brave Defence; the Doors of
the Temples and Houſes were ſhut, and
all the People, without excepting even
Women and Children, mounted the
Towers and Baſtions to fight againſt
the Common Enemy. There was no
Age of Life ſo utterly uſeleſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
for Service, but on this Occaſion
was actually in Arms for the Defence of
their Country. The Suburbs, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Houſes were without the Gates of
the City, were demoliſh'd by <hi>Maximine,</hi>
and the Timber converted into Battering
Engines, with which he eſſay'd to make
a Breach in the Wall, at which his Army
might enter, being reſolv'd to plunder
the City, and lay it level with the
Ground, and to leave the Country
around waſte and deſolate. He thought
it would not be for his Glory and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to proceed on his March to
<hi>Rome,</hi> before the deſtroy'd from its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
the firſt City in <hi>Italy</hi> that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
his Arms: So he rode through his
Army (with his Son whom he had made
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:94482:204"/>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi>) mixing Entreaties with Promiſes,
to raiſe and excite the Courage of his
Soldiers.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Aquileians</hi> tumbled Stones
down upon them, and fill'd Barrels,
with long Handles fix'd to them, with
Pitch, Sulphur, and other Bituminous
Matter, and when the Enemy approach'd
the Walls, ſhowr'd down upon them
Streams of ſcalding Pitch, which, with
the other combuſtible Matter, lighting
upon the naked Parts of the Soldiers
Bodies, ſpread it ſelf all over them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that they inſtantly fell to ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
themſelves: Off went their Coats
of Mail, and all their other Armour,
and happy he that could get rid of
them; for the Iron was glowing hot,
and the Leather parch'd and ſhrivel'd
with the Fire. There you might ſee
their Arms lying on the Ground, like
Spoils taken from them, not by Force,
but Stratagem. The beſt part of the
Army had their Eyes burnt out, and
their Hands, Faces, and all the other
naked Parts of their Bodies miſerably
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:94482:204"/>
ſcorch'd. Moreover, they cover'd Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands
with Pitch and Rozin, and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them at the Ends like Arrows,
which being lighted and darted into the
Engines ſo as to ſtick faſt, eaſily ſet
them on fire. At the firſt Fortune held
the Scales pretty equal; but after a
while, <hi>Maximine</hi>'s Soldiers meeting with
warmer Entertainment than they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
grew weary and diſheartned.
Thoſe who they thought could not
withſtand the firſt Shocks of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
made a ſtout and reſolute Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
On the other Hand, the <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leians</hi>
receiv'd new Acceſſions of Courage
and Vigour, and by frequent Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
arriv'd to a tolerable Skill and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
in Military Matters, and made ſo
ſlight of the Enemy, that they could
not forbear drolling upon them, not
ſparing even <hi>Maximine</hi> or his Son, but
reproaching and reviling them as they
rid near the Walls, and treating them
with the laſt Degree of Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:94482:205"/>
This highly incens'd <hi>Maximine;</hi> ſo
being unable to pour out his Revenge
upon his Enemy, he was reſolv'd his
own Officers ſhould feel the weight of
his Hand: So he put moſt of them to
death, pretending they had not puſh'd
on the Siege ſo vigorouſly as they ought
to have done; which Cruelty only ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him more odious to the Army,
and more contemptible to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>It hapned that the <hi>Aquileians</hi> had ſtore
of all Sorts of Proviſions, great Care
being taken that the Town ſhould be
well furniſh'd with all Things requiſite
for the Support of Man or Beaſt:
Whereas the Army was forc'd to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
with a Dearth and Scarcity of all
Things; for they had deſtroy'd all the
Fruit-trees, and ravag'd the Country
around. They had ſome Tents indeed
pitch'd in haſte, in which part of the
Army lay; the reſt lay ſcatter'd in the
open Fields, expos'd to all the Inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Weather. No Proviſion or
Forage could be brought into the Camp;
for the <hi>Romans</hi> had block'd up all the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:94482:205"/>
Ways into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to ſtrengthen the
Blockade, had built there Walls and
Gates. Conſular Men, and Perſons of the
greateſt Conſideration and Worth in all
<hi>Italy,</hi> were appointed to guard the Coaſts
and Harbours, and to hinder the paſſing
of any Veſſels by Water, to the end that
<hi>Maximine</hi> might have no Intelligence of
what was done in <hi>Rome.</hi> All the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
and Roads were diligently watch'd,
and no Man ſuffer'd to paſs; by which
means it fell out, that the Army, which
pretended to be the Beſieger, was it ſelf
beſieg'd: For neither could they make
themſelves Maſters of the Town, nor,
if they rais'd the Siege, could they go on
to-<hi>Rome,</hi> for want of Tranſport-Veſſels
and Carriages, all which were ſeiz'd
upon before, and ſecur'd.</p>
               <p>There ſeem'd alſo ſome Ground and
Colour for the Rumour that was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about, (<hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) That the</hi> Romans <hi>were
in Arms; that all</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Illyria, <hi>as alſo
the Southern and Eaſtern Barbarians, were
engag'd with them; that they had concerted
to raiſe a Army, out of a general Hatred
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:94482:206"/>
and Diſaffection to</hi> Maximine; inſomuch
that <hi>Maximine</hi>'s Soldiers began now to
deſpair. They labour'd under a Want
of all Things, even of Water, thoſe
poor Supplies which they had being out
of the River that ran by the Town,
the Water whereof was tainted by the
Blood and dead Bodies which were
thrown into it by the <hi>Aquileians,</hi> for want
of a Convenience for burying them
within the Walls; together with ſuch
as died in the Army by Sword, Sickneſs,
or Famine; of all which, this River
was the common Receptacle.</p>
               <p>The Army being thus reduc'd to the
utmoſt Degree of Deſpair and Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
when <hi>Maximine</hi> was repoſing
himſelf in his Pavilion, (there being a
Ceſſation of Arms for that Day) and
moſt of the Soldiers were in their Tents,
or retir'd to their reſpective Poſts; the
Soldiers that belong'd to the Camp in
<hi>Rome</hi> under Mount <hi>Alba,</hi> and had their
Wives and Children there, fell upon a
ſudden Reſolve, which was, to aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the Emperor, that ſo they might
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:94482:206"/>
deliver themſelves from the Fatigues of
a long and almoſt endleſs Siege, and
that they might not contribute to the
Deſolation of <hi>Italy,</hi> to gratifie a Tyrant
ſo univerſally hated and abhorr'd: So
taking Courage, they march'd at High-Noon
to the Emperor's Pavilion, having
made his Guards Accomplices in the
Deſign, and after they had torn his
Pourtraict out of the Enſigns, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
and ſlew both him and his Son,
as he was coming out of his Tent to
ſpeak to them. The Captain of the
Life-guard was ſacrific'd at the ſame
time, together with all the Favourites of
the Tyrant: Their Carcaſes were thrown
out to be ſpurn'd at and trampled upon,
and afterwards to be torn in Pieces by
Dogs and Birds of Prey. Only the
Heads of the two Emperors were cut
off, and ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus fell <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
and his Son, receiving the juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of a Cruel and Tyrannical Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Emperor's Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made publick, the Army was
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:94482:207"/>
in great Aſtoniſhment. The News
was not equally agreeable to all. The
<hi>Thracians</hi> and <hi>Pannonians,</hi> who had been
the chief Inſtruments of his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were the moſt deeply afflicted;
but in regard the Loſs could not be
repair'd, they were reſolv'd to be as
eaſie under it as they could, and to
partake at leaſt ſeemingly of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Satisfaction which this Maſſacre had
given: So they laid down their Arms,
and approach'd the Walls attir'd like
Friends, and declaring <hi>Maximine</hi>'s Death,
requeſted the Beſieg'd to open their
Gates and receive them, who were now
their Friends, tho' before they had been
their Enemies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aquileians</hi> did not think fit to
comply with this Demand, but ſet out
the Statues of <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus,</hi> and
<hi>Gordian Caeſar,</hi> adorn'd with Crowns and
Chaplets of Laurel, expreſſing their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to them in Shouts of Joy, and
exhorting the Soldiers to do the like,
and to own thoſe Emperors whom the
Senate and People had in their Wiſdom
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:94482:207"/>
made choice of: <hi>The other</hi> Gordians
(they told them) <hi>were departed to another
World, and had taken their Places among the
Immortal Gods.</hi> Then they furniſh'd out
a Market upon the Walls of the City,
well ſtock'd with all ſorts of Victuals
and Wines, as alſo with Clothes, Shoos,
and whatever a rich and flouriſhing
City could afford.</p>
               <p>At this the Army was infinitely more
amaz'd, when they conſider'd, that the
City had Proviſions for a long Siege, and
that the Scarcity of all Things in the
Camp was ſo extreme, that they muſt
have periſh'd by Famine before they
could have made themſelves Maſters of
ſo well provided a Town. So the Army
ſat ſtill before the City, and was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with whatever they had occaſion
for from thence. The Soldiers and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
converſing together, maintain'd
an amicable Correſpondence, altho' the
Form of a Siege remain'd, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Army lay encamp'd around the
Town. This was the State of Affairs
at <hi>Aquileia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:94482:208"/>
In the mean time, the Couriers that
were ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Maximine</hi>'s
Head, made all imaginable Expedition,
and were receiv'd with open Gates by
all the Towns they paſs'd through, the
Citizens meeting them with Branches of
Laurel in their Hands; and having
paſs'd the Lakes between <hi>Altinum</hi> and
<hi>Ravenna,</hi> they found <hi>Maximus</hi> in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi>
drawing together the choiceſt of
the Soldiers both in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> He
had alſo a conſiderable Reinforcement
of <hi>German</hi> Auxiliaries, ſent to him by
that Province, as an Acknowledgment
of his great Care and Diligence in his
late Government in thoſe Parts; and
was raiſing an Army againſt <hi>Maximine,</hi>
when they arriv'd with the Heads of the
ſlain Emperor and his Son, and impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him the Tidings of Victory and
Succeſs, and that both Army and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were unanimous in their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Senates Choice of Emperors.</p>
               <p>Upon this News, ſo great and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
the Altars were loaded with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
and all Men join'd in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:94482:208"/>
a Victory which coſt no Labour
in the obtaining. <hi>Maximus</hi> having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd,
order'd the Couriers to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to <hi>Rome</hi> with the Heads, and News
of what had hapned.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they enter'd <hi>Rome,</hi> and
fix'd the Head of the Common Enemy
upon the Point of a Lance, ſo that all
the People might behold it, 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for Words to deſcribe the Jubile of
that Day. No Man ſtaid at home;
but all, both Young and Old, throng'd
to the Temples and Altars, and, as if
ſome ſudden Frenzy had ſeiz'd them,
ran about, congratulating one another,
and gather'd together into the <hi>Cirque,</hi> as
upon ſome ſolemn Aſſembly. <hi>Balbinus</hi>
ſacrific'd Hecatombs, and there was no
Magiſtrate or Senator but felt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Emotions of Joy on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
the Sword that hung over their
Heads being now remov'd. Couriers
alſo with Laurel Branches were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd
to communicate the News to
the Provinces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:94482:209"/>
While theſe Publick Rejoicings were
making in <hi>Rome, Maximus</hi> parted from
<hi>Ravenna,</hi> and came to <hi>Aquileia,</hi> having
paſs'd the Lakes which are made by the

his Arrival the Gates of the City were
immediately open'd, and the <hi>Aquileians</hi>
receiv'd him with all the Marks of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
Perſons of Condition were ſent
to him from all the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> with
Addreſſes of Loyalty: Their Attire was
White, and they had in their Hands
Branches' of Laurel, and brought with
them the Gods of their reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
as alſo Crowns of maſſie Gold;
and in token of their Affection, they
ſcatter'd Flowers upon him, which they
ſeconded with Wiſhes of Long Life
and Happy Reign. The Army too that
inveſted <hi>Aquileia</hi> met him with Branches
of Laurel, in the Habits of Peace. Tho'
this Publick Honour which they did
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:94482:209"/>
him, was not what any real Affection,
but an affected Zeal and diſſembled
Loyalty prompted them to, they put on
a Mask, that they might appear of a
right Complexion for the Times: For
moſt of them could not without Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Reſentment behold their
own Emperor baſely murder'd, and the
Senates Creatures ſitting at the Helm.
But <hi>Maximus,</hi> after he had ſpent two
Days in offering Sacrifice, upon the
third order'd the Army to be drawn
out into the Field, where from a Throne
there erected, he deliver'd himſelf in
the following Words.</p>

People, I doubt not but your own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Empire; and for the future if you
preſerve inviolate the Faith and Duty which
you owe to the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and to us your Emperors, you may live in
the quiet Enjoyment of theſe Advantages.
We are your Leige Lords, elected by the
<hi>Roman</hi> People and Senate, who were mov'd
ſolely by the Conſideration of our Archieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the ancient Nobility of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage:
For the Empire is not the private
Inheritance of any particular Perſon, but
belongs to the Collective Body of the <hi>Roman</hi>
People: We and you are only intruſted with
the Executive Power or Authority, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
that Empire. Now if you behave
your ſelves as becomes good and loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and pay us the Reſpect and Honour that
is due to the Perſons of Princes, you may
live happily under Us, in the ſecure Poſſeſſion
of all the neceſſary Supports of Life: And
beſides, your Example will have a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon all our Cities and Provinces, and
will incline them to render a ready and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Obedience to their ſeveral Governours.
You ſhall not any more be harraſs'd in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries, but ſhall live henceforth at
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:94482:210"/>
home, according to your own Humours and
Inclinations. To curb the Barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſhall be our Charge and Province. The
putting the Supreme Power into two Hands,
will facilitate the Management of Affairs in
<hi>Rome;</hi> and if any thing happen in Foreign
Parts, that may require the Preſence of an
Emperor, one of us will be always at liberty
to obſerve the Motions on that Side. And I
would not have any of you harbour a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
that any thing you have hitherto done
hath left any Impreſſion upon our Minds, or
upon the Minds of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, or
the Provinces that revolted for Injuries then
receiv'd; ſeeing what you did then was in
Obedience to the Commands of your Prince.
Let there be then a General Oblivion of all
that is paſt, and for the future a firm
League of everlaſting Amity and Friendſhip
amongſt us.</p>

               <p>After this Harangue, he promis'd
great Sums of Money to the Soldiers;
and reſolving after a ſhort Stay in <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia</hi>
to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> order'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the Forces into their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:94482:211"/>
Provinces and Quarters, only ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with him to <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Praetorian</hi>
Soldiers, with the Forces commanded
by <hi>Balbinus,</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> Auxiliaries,
of whoſe Loyalty he had a ſingular
good Opinion, in regard he had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
in thoſe Parts with great Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
before this Advancement to the
Empire. At his Publick Entry into
<hi>Rome,</hi> he was met by <hi>Balbinus</hi> and <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Caeſar,</hi> accompanied by the whole
Senate and People, who receiv'd him
with Acclamations of Joy and Triumph.
After this, they adminiſter'd the State
with great Order and Gravity, to the
general Satisfaction of all Ranks and
Degrees of Men. The People rejoic'd,
and glory'd in their Emperors, whoſe
Noble Birth and Perſonal Merit ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
them worthy of the Empire. But,
on the other Hand, the Soldiers were
violently bent againſt them; they were
offended with the very Acclamations of
the People, and the Nobility ſo much
cry'd up by them, miniſter'd Matter of
Diſguſt to theſe, which was encreas'd
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:94482:211"/>
by the odious Circumſtance of their
being elected by the Senate. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
alſo the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
them in <hi>Rome,</hi> gave them great
Jealouſie; they foreſaw they would
oppoſe their Deſigns, and ſuſpected a
Project was afoot to diſarm them, and
that the <hi>Germans</hi> were to execute it, and
to have their Places if they ſucceeded;
a late Inſtance whereof there was in
<hi>Severus</hi>'s Reign, who caſhier'd the
Guards that were concern'd in <hi>Pertinax</hi>'s
Aſſaſſination. So when the Games in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
in Honour of <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus</hi>
were to be celebrated, and all Mens
Minds were bent upon the Shews and
Publick Entertainments that were made
on that Occaſion, upon a ſudden the
<hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers threw off the Mask,
and boldly publiſh'd their Diſaffection
to the Government, which they had till
now induſtriouſly diſguis'd; and being
hurry'd on by a wild Rage, ran up to
the Imperial Palace, and ſurpriz'd the
Perſons of the Emperors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:94482:212"/>
It hapned at that time, there was no
good Underſtanding between the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
themſelves: For each ſtrove to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs
the Sovereign Power to himſelf;
ſo extravagant are our Deſires of Rule,
and ſo incommunicable is the Nature of
that Power we deſire. <hi>Balbinus</hi> laid
great ſtreſs upon his two Conſulſhips,
and the Illuſtrious Family from whence
he was ſprung, and thought they gave
him the Preheminence: And on the
other Hand, <hi>Maximus</hi> valu'd himſelf no
leſs upon his Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
his Skill and Addreſs in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Affairs: And, in ſhort, high
Birth and great Alliances puſh'd them
both on to the Deſires of ſole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſted
Dominion; which Thing ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
them both: For when <hi>Maximus</hi> was
advertiz'd that the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers
were in Arms, and reſolv'd to ſacrifice
them to their preſent Fury, he would
have ſent for the <hi>Germans</hi> that quarter'd
in <hi>Rome</hi> to quell this Commotion; but
<hi>Balbinus</hi> oppos'd it, apprehending that
ſome Intrigue or Practice was carrying
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:94482:212"/>
on againſt him; for he knew very well,
that the <hi>Germans</hi> were all devoted to
<hi>Maximus</hi>'s Intereſts, and declar'd open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they were not ſent for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the Inſolence of the <hi>Praetorians,</hi> but
to wreſt the Sovereign Power out of
his Hands, and lodge it entirely in
<hi>Maximus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this Heat and Debate between
the Emperors, the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers
(thoſe that guarded the Gates giving
way) broke into the Palace, and ſeiz'd
the Perſons of the Emperors, and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off their Clothes, which were courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than they ordinarily appear'd in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
dragg'd them naked out of the
Palace, treating them with all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Indignity imaginable, even
to the ſtriking, and calling them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion
<hi>The Senates Creatures:</hi> They pluck'd
them alſo by the Beard and Eye-brows,
and hal'd them through the middle of
the City to the Camp, not forbearing
the moſt irreverent and barbarous Uſage.
They were reſolv'd not to kill them in
the Palace, but to reſerve them for
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:94482:213"/>
more exquiſite Torments, of which they
would be longer ſenſible.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans,</hi> upon notice of this
Outrage, arm'd themſelves in great
haſte, and came running to aſſiſt the
Emperors; whereupon the <hi>Praetorian</hi>
Soldiers put an end to their Lives and
Torments together, all the Parts of their
Bodies being before moſt inhumanely
mangled. Their dead Bodies they left
in the open Street, and mounting <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Caeſar</hi> aloft, proclaim'd him Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
(becauſe at that time they could
find no body elſe) and cry'd aloud to
the People, <hi>That they had only deſtroy'd
thoſe Emperors that were made ſuch againſt
their will, and had elected</hi> Gordian, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
to that Noble Patriot of the ſame
Name, who was conſtrain'd by the</hi> Roman
<hi>People to take upon him the Empire.</hi> After
this they retir'd with their new Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
into the Camp, and ſhut up their
Gates, making no farther Effort at this
time: And the <hi>Germans</hi> finding they
were too late, and that they whom they
came to reſcue were ſlain, eſteem'd it
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:94482:213"/>
not adviſable to engage in a fruitleſs
War, on the account of Men that were
dead: So they return'd to their ſeveral
Quarters.</p>
               <p>Such was the cruel and undeſerved
Fate of theſe truly Worthy and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Patriots, who were juſtly rais'd to
the Empire, for their Noble Birth, and
eminent Vertues: And <hi>Gordian Caeſar,</hi>
who was then about the Age of Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
was declar'd Emperor, and began
his Reign.</p>
