         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How God is just in requiring that which we cannot perform. An Addition about power of keeping the Law evangelical. Adam lost his ability, not <hi>efficienter,</hi> but <hi>meritorie,</hi> God alwayes gives, or is ready to give power to do what he requires, if we be not wanting to our selves. How Christ hath fulfilled the Law: how we keep it by faith. 3. Why God promises life to the keeping of the Law if we cannot keep it.</item>

To make them able, by sanctifying and cleansing themselves: that ceremonial washing signified our spiritual cleansing: how we came to be polluted: how we must be cleansed. Why they were not to come at their wives. Of the danger and abuse of things lawful. 3. That they might not run too far, bounds were set. Of curiosity about things unnecessary.</item>

                  <item>What is commanded here. 1. A rest. 2. Sanctification. Rest is required not for it self, but for the duties of sanctification. Reasons that the Sabbath is not wholly nor principally remonial. Addition 21. out of the Authors other works declaring his meaning in two things. 1. That the Lords day is <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> 2. That the Jewish Sabbath is abolisht by Christs death, proved by him at large, out of Scriptures, and Antiquity, in his Speech against <hi>Trask</hi> in Star-Chamber.</item>

                  <item>Additional considerations upon the doctrine of the Sabbath, laid down in seven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions. 1. It is certain some time is to be set apart for publick worship, proved by School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Canonists, and Reasons. 2. Certain that the law of Nature doth not dictate the proportion of seven or any other in particular. 3. It is most probable that the seventh day was appointed by God from the beginning, as a day of publick worship in memory of the creation, and did oblige all mankinde: though the symbolical or typical rest afterwards was enjoyned to the Jews onely: This proved from Scripture, Fathers, Jewish Doctors, late Divines, reasons, &amp;c. How the Fathers are to be understood that deny Sabbatizing before the Mosaical Law. 4. The Lords day is of divine institution, proved by Scripture, Fathers, publick Declarations of the Church, Edicts of Princes, Canonists, some School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, late Divines. 5. The fourth Commandement is in force: for the moral equity, that at least a seventh part be given to God; literally it requires onely the seventh day from the creation, not a seventh day. The day altered by the Apostles by special authority. 6. The rest of the Iewish-sabbath partly moral, which continues still: partly symbolical, which is expired. How the rest of the Lords day differs from the rest of the Sabbath, rest from ordinary labours forbidden by God, but the special determination left to the Church. How the Lords day succeeds the Sabbath. 7. The Sabbath kept with the Lords day by the Primitive Christians till the Councel of Laodicea was not in a Jewish manner.</item>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>READER, here is offered to thy View, a post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous Work of a Reverend, and Famous Bishop, one of the greatest Lights which the Church of Christ hath had in this latter Age, and the Glory of our English Church, while he lived; A Work which may merit thy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, in Respect both of the Author, and the Subject which it handles.</p>
            <p>Of the first I shall need to say little, the very name of Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> proclaiming more, then if I should say that he was a judicious, profound, and every way accomplisht Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, an eminent Preacher, a learned Antiquary, a famous Linguist, a curious Critick, a living Library amongst Schc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the Oracle of our Church, and such a Priest, whose lips preserved knowledge, and at whose mouth the Law was to be sought. What admirable height of Learning, and depth of Judgement, dwelt in that Reverend Prelate, he that would know, may read in those living Images of his Soul: And as his other works praise him in the gate, so this which is now presented to thee, though composed in his younger years, when he was Fellow of Pembroke Hall in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,<note place="margin">Anno 15. 85</note> will demonstrate, that the Foundations were then laid of those great Parts and Abilities, wherewith he was furnisht, when he came to the Episcopal Chair, and the ground work of all those other learned La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, wherewith he afterwards enricht the Church; for in these Lectures, or Colledge Exercises (which were heard with the publick applause of the whole University, where scarce any pretended to the Study of Divinity, who did not light their Candle at his Torch) it will appear, that he had even then, gone through the whole Encyclopedic of
<pb facs="tcp:59534:11"/>
Divine and Humane Learning, and that as he was a rich Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of all Knowledge; so he had here contracted the Quintessence of all his vast Studies, and the high concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his great and active soul, into these Lectures, as into a common Treasury; for he that shall peruse this Book, shall finde, besides his perfection in all humane Learning, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy and the Arts, his exquisite knowledge in all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Languages; and that besides his skill in the sacred Text, (wherein his greatest excellency lay) he had read and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested the Fathers, Schoolmen, Casuists, as well as modern Divines, that he was throughly versed in all kinde of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and Histories, in Theologie, Moral, Scholastick, and Polemick, and no stranger to the Laws, both Civil and Canon, and which seldome concur in one, that he was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as well in the Rational and Judicial, as in the Critical and Historical part of Learning; so that what one of his School-Masters foretold of him, that he would be <hi>literarum lumen,</hi> was verified in those Colledge Exercises, wherein this Light began to shine betimes, and to cast his Rayes both far and neer; and what a Reverend Prelate said of him in his Funeral Sermon, may visibly appear to any Eye, in this great Herculean Labour, that those things which seldome meet in one Man, were in him in a high degree, <hi>Scientia magna, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moria major, Judicium maximum, at Industria infinita;</hi> His Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was great, his Memory greater, his Judgement exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both, but his Labour and Industry was infinite, and went beyond them all.</p>
            <p>For the Subject, it is the Decalogue, or those Ten Words, in which God himself hath epitomized the whole duty of Man, which have this Priviledge above all other parts of Scripture, that whereas all the rest were divinely inspired, but God made use of Prophets and Apostles, as his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, here God was his own Scribe, or Amanuensis, here was <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi> for the writing was the writing of God.<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 16. &amp; 31. ult.</note> These are the Pandects of the Laws of Nature, the fount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains from which all humane Laws ought to be derived: the Rule and Guide of all our Actions, whatsoever Duties are variously dispersed through the whole Book of God, are here collected into a brief Sum; whatsoever is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to doe in Order to Salvation, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced hither; for this is <hi>totunt Homin is,</hi> the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of upshot of all (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) to feare<note place="margin">Ecc'es 12. 13</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:59534:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God and keep his Commandments; and the Apostle tells us to the same purpose, that circumcision avayleth nothing, nor uncircumcision, but the keeping of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. And therefore, as <hi>Philo</hi> saith, that the Jews used to refer all that they found in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to these ten heads, (as the Philosophers reduced all things to the ten predicaments,) not that they were all literally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized there, but because for memories sake, they might be reduced thither; so hath the Christian Church reduced all the duties of a Christian to the same heads, which she hath enlarged, and made more comprehensive, as partaking of a greater measure of the Spirit then they had, and aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a higher degree of perfection in all Christian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a generation of men sprung <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, such as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> wrote against long since, in his Book <hi>contra ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarium legis &amp; prophetarum,</hi> that under colour of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Gods free grace in mans salvation, and affecting Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty, would abrogate the whole moral Law, as if it<note place="margin">Jer. 36. 23.</note> were worthy of no better entertainment among Christians, then <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> gave to <hi>Jeremies</hi> prophecies, when he cut the<note place="margin">See the fourth Addition In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trod. c. 14 p. 58</note> rowl in pieces, and threw it into the sire. And how far the tenets and principles of some others (who would seem to abhor such opinions) have promoted these pernicious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, I shall not need to shew; sure I am, that while some teach: that the Gospel consists properly of promises onely, that the moral Law is no part of the condition of the second Covenant, nor the observation of it (though qualified in the Gospel) required now in order to salvation, that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Gospel are absolute, and that Faith is nothing else but an absolute application of them, or an absolute relying upon Christ for the attaining of them, without the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of repentance and new obedience; that Christ came onely to redeem, not to give any Law to the world; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a man is in Christ, though he fall into the grossest sins, which are damnable in a man unregenerate, yet he is still, <hi>quoad praesentem statum,</hi> in the state of salvation, and though<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 1, 2.</note> he may lose the sence and feeling, yet he can never lose <hi>jus ad vitam,</hi> his right to heaven, what sins soever he walks in: I say, whilst men teach such doctrins, and yet cry out against Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, Libertines, and other Sectaries, what do they in judging others, but condemn themselves, for they
<pb facs="tcp:59534:12"/>
grant the premises, and deny onely the conclusion. If such doctrines were as true as they are common, this Author, and all others, that have written on this subject, might have spared their pains, and therefore we may say with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>It is time for thee Lord to work, for they have destroyed thy</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 126.</note> 
               <hi>Law.</hi> These men are like to <hi>Licurgus</hi> (who being cast into a frenzy by <hi>Dionysius</hi>) in that distemper thinking to have cut<note place="margin">Apollod. de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig. deor. l 3. p. 57.</note> down a vine, with the same hatchet slew his own son; so these being possest with a spiritual frenzy, which they call zeal, when they lift up their hatchet to cut off some errors, which like luxuriant branches have sprung up about the Law, these do unawares cut down the Law itself, both root and branch, making the observation of it arbitrary in respect of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or as a Parenthesis in a sentence, where the sence may be perfect without it.</p>
            <p>Such Errors are far more dangerous, then many that were held by the old Hereticks, which were chiefly about matters speculative, whereas these reflect upon matters of practise, and whilst they strike at the root of obedience to the Laws of Christ, they do directly take away the very way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the certain ruine of peoples souls, and do utterly overthrow the foundation both of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; so that wheresuch doctrines prevail, nothing but confusion, and dissolution of all Government can follow, as sad experience in too many places shews; where the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine fruits of such doctrines, appear to be no other, then to rob the Priest of his honour, the Prince of his power, the people of their Discipline and Government, Pastors of their Flocks, and Sheep of their Pastors, Preachers of their Churches, Churches of their Reverence, Religion of its Power, and the World of all Religion. <hi>S. James</hi> would have us to try our Faith by our Works, but these men will have their works tryed by their Faith. To the pure all things are pure; if Faith be in their heart, God can see no sin in their actions. We read of the Scholars of one <hi>Almaricus</hi> of Paris, who held, that what was deadly sin in others, yet if it were done by one, that was in Charitie or the state of Grace, it was no sin, or not imputed to him, for which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Hereticks. These men seem to be spit out of their mouths, for they would have sins distinguished not by their nature or object, but by the subject in whom they are: and hence they hold, that all their own sins, though never so

great (they being beleevers &amp; elect) are at the most but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, which cannot endanger their salvation, but the sins of all others are mortall and damnable, which impious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with the rest above mentioned from which it flows, howsoever they be varnisht over with faire shews of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the free grace of God, and the merits of Christ, and the depressing of mans power, yet are indeed no other then the old damned Heresie of <hi>SimonMagus,</hi> who, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, taught his Disciples, they were free from the obedience of the law, &amp; was condemned by the Ancient Church in <hi>Vasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides, Carpocrates, Epiphanes, Prodicus, Eunomius,</hi> and other impure wretches, and is call'd by <hi>Luther</hi> himself (whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary speeches have given too much occasion to these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, <hi>ultimus Diaboli flatus;</hi> The last blast of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Against these and such like doctrines, which make this and all other books of this nature superfluous, we must know; That though the Decalogue, as it was given by <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> was a part of that Covenant which God made with them on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and Sinai belonged properly to them, as appears both by the Preface, wherein their deliverance out of Egypt is urged as a motive of obedience, and by four other passages in the precepts, which have peculiar reference to that people, as that symbolicall rest required in the fourth precept in remembrance of their rest from the Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and the promise of long life in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the fifth. Yet seeing that the substance of it is no other then the Law of Nature written in mans heart at the first, and that by Christ our Law-giver it is made a part of the Gospel or second Covenant, though with some qualification) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it obliges all Christians, and that under the highest paines, and is therefore justly called the Law of Christ. All the parts of the Morall Law we may finde required in the Gospel, though upon other grounds then those were laid by <hi>Moses,</hi> (this second Covenant, being established upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Is. 33. 22.</note> promises) we have the same rules for our action, the same<note place="margin">Ja. 4. 12. 2. 8.</note> duties required, the same sins forbidden; the difference is this, that here God accepts our obedience <hi>in voto</hi> at our first conversion, when he freely pardons our sins past, and expects the actuall performance afterward in the course of our lives, and admits repentance after lapses, wheras the law, as it was part of the other Covenant, requires perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without any intermission, otherwise we having higher
<pb facs="tcp:59534:13"/>
promises, &amp; a greater measure of the spirit being now dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed under the Gospel, a higher degree of obedience to the law is now required, which is yet no way grievous or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome to a true beleever, for the power of Christs spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the height of the promises, make the yoke easie, and the burden light. Therefore Christs tells us expresly he came not to dissolve the law, but to fulfill it, or to fill it up, as the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

any law as necessary to salvation, but onely that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the Morall law given by Moses, and cleers it from the false corrupt glosses of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> which is directly contrary to the constant and unanimous doctrine of the Ancient Church, and to the text it self: for though it is true that Christ doth therein often reflect upon the expositions of the Jewish doctors who had corrupted the law; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it is as true, that in those chapters he delivers the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian law, and therein brings up the Morall law to a higher pitch, then ever it was by <hi>Moses.</hi> This appears by that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition so often made in that Sermon, between what <hi>Moses</hi> said of old, and what Christ saith, you have heard what was said to them of old, &amp;c. <hi>Ego autem dico vobis,</hi> but I say unto you, &amp;c.

We see then that Christ is so far from taking any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Morall Law, that he rather addes more to it, and therfore the matter of the Decalogue is still in force, and belongs to Christians as much as to any; Nay faith it self (which some of late have transformed into a meere <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicall Idaea</hi> abstracted from good works) I mean that Faith to which Justification and Salvation is ascribed in Scripture,<note place="margin">See the Hom. of faith &amp;c.</note> includes obedience as to all the commandments of Christ, so to the morall law, as the very life and form of it, without which as S. <hi>Jam.</hi>

               </gap>, it is as a body without a Soul, for what is Faith but a relying or trusting upon Christ for salvation according to the promises of the Gospell; now seeing that those promises are not absolute, but always require the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of repentance and new obedience; it can be nothing but a shadow of faith when these conditions are not. Its true that (to beleeve) in the proper and formal notion, is nothing else, but to assent to the truth of a proposition, upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the speaker, And (to beleeve in one) signifies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to trust &amp; rely upon him, &amp; doth not in its formal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, considered barely and abstractly by it self, include the condition of obedience or any other. And therefore we may be said to beleeve or trust in one, that requires no condition of us, but when the words are referred to one that commands or requires something of us to be done, and promises nothing; But upon such condition of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as nothing is more certain, then that Christ never promises remission of sins or life eternall, but upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Repentance and new obedience, In this case to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ must of necessity include obedience to the commandments of Christ, as the very life of faith, without which it is a meere fansie: and hence some have observed that in the New Testament, faith and obedience, and unbelief and disobedience are often promiscuously used for one and the same.

               <hi>esse bonam vitam,</hi> that a good life, is not onely inseparable from faith, but that faith is good life it self; and S. <hi>Cyprian, Quomodo se in Christú credere dicit qui non facit quae Christus facere praecipit,</hi> How can he say that he believes in Christ, who doth not the things which Christ hath commanded. And before them <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Credere in Christum est voluntatem ejus facere,</hi> to believe in Christ is to do his will. As for that generall faith, of the latter School-men, and the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, which they make to be nothing but an assent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed trueths for the authority of God the speaker (I say the latter School-men, for some of the Elder where they speak of <hi>fides charitate formata,</hi> which they make to be true faith, mean nothing else, but that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls, faith<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note>
               <note place="margin">Ja. 2. 22.</note> working by love, and Saint <hi>James,</hi> faith consummated by works) As also that faith of some amongst our selves, who would have it to be nothing but a perswasion that their sins are pardoned in Christ, &amp;c. Neither of these have any necessary connexion with a good life, and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is that faith to which the promises of pardon and Salvation are annexed in the Gospel. Not the first, as themselves acknowledge, and appeares by <hi>Bellar.</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prove by many reasons that true faith may be in a wicked man. Nor the second, for how doth it necessarily follow, that if a man believe all his sins past, present, and to come to be forgiven, that therefore he must needes live according to the Rules of Christ, whereas the contrary may rather be inferred. That he needes not to trouble himself about obedience to the commandments in order to remission of his sins, or salvation, who is perswaded that all hissins are pardoned already, and that nothing is required of him for the obtaining of so great a benefit, but onely to believe that it is so. And if they say, that the sence of such a mercy cannot but stir men up to obedience, too much experience of mens unthankfulness to God confutes this, The remembrance of a mercy or benefit doth not necessarily enforce men to their duty, for then none could be unthankfull to God or man,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59534:15"/>
Besides it is a pure contradiction, which all the Sophistry in the world can never salve, to say, that a mans sins are pardoned by believing they are pardoned, for they must be pardoned before he believes they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, because the object must be before the act, and otherwise he beleeves a lye, and yet by faith he is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and pardoned, (as all affirm) and the Scripture is evident for it, and so his pardon follows upon his belief, and thus the pardon is both before and after the act of faith; it is before, as the object or thing to be beleeved, and yet it comes after, as the effect or consequent of his belief, which is a direct contradiction.</p>
            <p>True faith then is a practicall vertue, and establishes the Law; and as this is the proper work of true faith, so to direct and quicken our obedience thereto is the whole scope of the Bible. There is nothing revealed in the whole Scripture meerly for speculation, but all is referd some way or other to practise. It is not the knowledge of Gods Nature &amp; Essence, but of his will, which is required of us, or at least so much of his Nature, as is needfull to ground our faith and obedience upon. That observation of some is most true, That in the Scripture, <hi>verba scientiae Connotant affectus,</hi> words of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge do imply affections and actions answerable. To know God, is not so much to know his Nature and essence, as to Honor and obey him, which those that do not, are said not to know him, though they know never so much of his Nature<note place="margin">Ro. 1. 28.</note>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 95. 10.</note> and atributes; knowledge without practise, is with God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted<note place="margin">Heb 9. 7.</note> ignorance, and hence are all sins tearmed <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances. Thus to know Christ, or to beleeve in him, or to beleeve the Gospel, Includes in the Scripture sence, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, new life, and indeed the whole duty of a Christian, because al these duties ought to follow upon this knowledge or belief, &amp; are <hi>actus imperati,</hi> as the Schools speak, acts which flow from belief, though the <hi>actus elicitus,</hi> be only an assent to the trueth.

And consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how this subject is handled, neither superficially and slightly as too many have done in our owne Language, nor yet, so coldly and Jejunely, as divers of the Casuists in their large and intricate disputes, who inform the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but work not upon the affections at all, but that as the matter is solid in it self, so it is clothed with emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call significant words, adorned with choise sentences, apt allusions, and Rhetoricall amplisications out of the best authors; besides pregnant applications of Scripture, and sundry criticall observations upon divers texts not vulgar nor obvious, it will be hard to say, whether the profit or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the reader will be greater. And as the works in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the generall subject may be usefull for all persons of what rank soever, so I doubt not but it may be of special use for the publique dispensers of the word, especially the younger sort of Divines, who besides many directions for usefull and profitable Preaching, may finde also variety of excellent matter upon any practicall Subject without Postills or Polyanthea, &amp; directions for deciding most cases of conscience, which out of the grounds here laid may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily resolved.</p>

Now concerning this Edition, and what is herein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, I am not ignorant, what prejudice attends the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the posthumous works of any; how easy it is to mistake the sence of an Author, especially where the work was not perfected by himself, and that diverse things in mens private papers would have been thought sit to be altered, omitted, or enlarged by the Authors themselves, if they had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for publick view; for which, and diverse other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, it might have been thought sit, not to publish, what the Author had kept so long by him, and had not fitted for the Presse, nor those reverend Persons, to whose care his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Writings were by his late MAJESTIE committed, intended to divulge; for who would presume to put a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to a Piece, which such an <hi>Apelles</hi> had begun: yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that there is already a rude imperfect draught, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some broken Notes of these his Lectures, which had passed through diverse hands, already crept forth in Print, to the great wrong, both of the Living and the Dead, and that the same is about to be reprinted, it was therefore thought necessary in vindication of the Author, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuse the Reader, to publish this Copy, there being no other way to prevent the further mischiefs of that Edition, then by another more perfect; for though I deny not but that there are many good Materials, in that indigested Chaos, which is already set forth, which an expert Builder may make good use of, yet the Reader will finde the whole to be nothing else, but a heap of broken rubbish, the <hi>rudera</hi> of those state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly structures, which that skilful Architect had made, which have been so mangled and defaced, so scattered and dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, like <hi>Medeas Absyrtus,</hi> that they appear scarce shadows of themselves, so that had the learned Author lived to see those <hi>partus ingenii,</hi> those divine Issues of his brain so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he might well have called them, not <hi>Benjamins,</hi> sons of his right hand, but <hi>Benonies,</hi> sons of sorrow; for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, there hath not been exposed to publick view a work of that bulk, stuffed with so much nonsence, so many Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies, contradictions, absurdities, and incoherences, since Printing was in use: there is not a Page, scarce a Paragraph, seldome many lines together in the whole Book which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perfect sence; the Method quite lost in most places, the whole Discourse like a body whose members are dislocated, or out of joynt: as if it had been tortured upon the rack, or
<pb facs="tcp:59534:17"/>
wheel, so that the parts cohere like the Hammonian sands, sometimes whole Paragraphs, whole pages, yea, diverse sheets together are wanting, as in the tenth Commandment, where the one half is left out, and half of the ninth is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to supply that defect; and the whole work, so corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, mangled, disjoynted, falsified, interpolated, and the sence of the Author so perverted, that the Author might well say of the Publisher with the Poet, <hi>Quem recitas mens est, &amp;c. At male dum recitas incipit esse tuus;</hi> the Book was his at first, but by this strange Metamorphosis, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher hath made his own.</p>
            <p>That the world therefore may not be longer abused by a shadow obtruded for the substance, here is presented the Authors own Copy, revised and compared with diverse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manuscripts, which though it were not perfected by himself, nor intended for publick use, yet being the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Copy he had, as is acknowledged under his hand in the beginning of the Book, and containing many Marginal Notes, and alterations throughout the whole made by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his latter years, as it seems, it may well be thought to contain the minde and sence of the Author more fully, then any of those Copies in other hands. This coming into the hands of one of those, to whom the perusal of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were committed, who was informed of the wrong done by that other Edition, and that a more perfect one was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and desired, out of his love to the memory of the deceased Author, and his eminent zeal for the publick good, considering of how great use the work might be, he was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily induced to part with it for so good a purpose, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by an able, industrious and worthy Gentleman, who hath otherwise deserved well of the publick, and had some rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Author whilst he lived, the work was taken in hand and revised, the sence in many places restored, defects supplied, and the whole discourse brought into a far better form, then that wherein it had formerly appeared. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that to purge this Augaean stable, and to restore a work so much corrupted, and whose best Copies were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, was no easy work, and that it contained such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of all kinde of Learning, both Divine and Humane, that he who would revise it, must not be a stranger to any, and that many Eyes may see more then one, such was his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and Modesty, that he was willing and desirous to
<pb facs="tcp:59534:17"/>
have the whole again revised, and brought to the touch, by some other, who as he conceived, might have more leizure and abilities then himself; whereupon it was again resumed, and after much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor &amp; travail, was at length brought to this form, wherin it now appears: wherein, that the Reader may know what is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Edition, he shall finde.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The true sence and meaning of the Author (the chief thing to be looked after in the publishing of other mens works) resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in many thousand places, which were corrupted &amp; mistaken, whereby the Author was made to speak contrary to what he thought, as if he had seen some vision after his death, to make him change his Judgement in his life time. This, as it was a work of much difficulty, requiring both time and study, by diligent comparing of places, weighing of Antecedents, and Consequents, viewing several Copies, and consulting with the Authors quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c. so the Reader will finde no small benefit thereby, arising from this Edition.</item>
               <item>2. The Method is here cleered, which was in a manner quite lost in the former Edition, and without which the Reader must needs be in a Maze or Labyrinth. This being the chief help to memory, &amp;conducing much to the understanding of the matter.</item>
               <item>3. Many Tautologies, and needlesse Repetitions of the same thing are here cut off, and those many great defects, wherein diverse Paragraphs, Pages, and whole sheets were formerly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting are supplyed and added.</item>
               <item>
                  <p>4. Whereas in some passages the sence of the Author might seem obscure or doubtful, and not to agree so well with his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, expressed in his other works, composed in his latter and riper years; his meaning therefore is cleared and vindicated, by adding his latter thoughts, upon the same points, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther collected out of his other works, which were perfected by himself, or the Reader referred to those other places, where he may be more fully satisfied. And where some things are omitted, or but briefly touched, a supplement is made out of his other works, or where it could not be had out of them, there is added what was needful to be supplied without prejudice to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and what is conceived agreable to the declared Doctrine of the Catholike Church of Christ, and of this Church in special; which (that the Reader may distinguish it from the words of the Author) is put in a different Character, save where, by mistake the same letter is used.</p>
                  <p>And here, as in some other points, so in particular about the
<pb facs="tcp:59534:18"/>
Sabbath, wherein the Author might be mistaken by many of both sides, out of his other works compared with this, here is declared what his Opinion was in that Controversie; and that it was no other, then which I conceive to come neerest to the truth) that as the symbolical rest, proper to that Nation, is abolisht, so the substance of the Precept is moral, and that the seventh day was hallowed by God for a time of publick worship from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in memory of the Creation, by positive Divine Law, obliging all mankinde; Instead whereof the Lords day is set apart for the day of publick worship, by the Apostles, as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Legats of Christ, in memory of the Resurrection, which is to continue unchangeable to the end of the World. This, as it is shewed out of the Authors other writings, so for the more full clearing of all questions upon this subject there is added a large discourse, containing the whole Doctrine of the Sabbath and Lords day, laid down in seven Conclusions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. in <hi>Com.</hi> 4. wherein I conceive, there is some thing offered, which may givc some satisfaction to those that are moderate of both sides.</p>
               </item>
               <item>5. For the better help of the Reader, every Commandment is divided into Chapters, and the Sum or Contents of each Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with the method how they stand, are prefixt to every Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Section. All which Contents, together with the Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Additions, are set together at the beginning of the Book, that so the Reader may at once have a general Idaea of the whole Book, and of what is handled in each Precept, and so may the more easily finde any thing he desires to read, without much Labour or enquiry.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus the Reader may in part conceive, what is done to render this work the more useful to him. And if the stile be not so accurate and exact, as in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors other sermons, he must consider, that as it was not polisht by the Author, nor fitted by him for the Presse, and that in the revising thereof, there was more regard had to the matter then to words; so having passed through diverse hands, it cannot seem strange, if some incongruities of speech do still remain: Errours we know of one concoction are not easily corrected in an other, and waters will contract some tincture from the Minerals through which they passe: besides that, the errours and mistakes of the Printer, which could not easily be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, may in many places obscure or pervert the sence. Let this therefore be taken in good part, which is intended for the publick good, and what shall be found needful to be corrected (as who can walk in so rough a path and never stumble) shall God willing be rectified in the next Edition; in the mean time make use of this, and if it shall contribute any thing to promote the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Religion, which is the scope of the work, the Publisher hath the fruit of his Indeavours and ends of his Desires; who desires further, the benefit of their Prayers, that shall reap any benefit by his Labours.<note place="bottom">In this Preface, Page 3. line 17. read <hi>asserting.</hi> l. 33. r. <hi>Laws.</hi> l. 38. r. <hi>wallows.</hi> p. 4. l. 11. r. <hi>they.</hi> p. 5. l. 10. r. <hi>Basilides.</hi> l. 21. for <hi>four</hi> r. <hi>some.</hi> p. 6. l. 10. r. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now out of these texts, three points naturally arise. 1.

               <p>There have been some, of opinion, (as may be seen, as well in the writings of the Heathen, as in the story of the Bible) that Religion should not descend

so low as to children, but that they are to be brought up licentiously and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberty while they are young, and not to be instructed, before they come to riper years, and then they should be instructed in Religion.</p>

               <p>After the Apostles times the first Catechist of any fame, was the Evangelist <hi>Mark</hi> in Alexandria, after him <hi>Pantenus,</hi> then <hi>Clemens, Origen, Cyril</hi> of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <hi>Gregory Nyssen, Athanasius, Fulgentius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and others.

                  <hi>Hegesippus</hi> (converted from Judaism to Christianity) in his Ecclesiasticall story reports, that this work of catechizing wrought so great effect, that there was no known commonwealth inhabited in that part of the world, but within fourty years after our saviours passion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We are not to come thither as to an ordinary place, but with an awful preparation, as<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 17.</note> in Gods presence. How fearful is this place (saith <hi>Jacob</hi>) this is none other but the house of God. And it is fearful in respect of the majesty of God, more fully here then<note place="margin">Psalm. 2. 11.</note> in other places, as being the presence-chamber of God, where he will be waited upon<note place="margin">5, 7</note> with all due preparation and respect.

                  <item>2. Another reason that we should be qualified with fear when we come, is, That<note place="margin">Proverbs. 1. 7.</note> because (as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks) fear is the beginning, or head, and chief point of wisdom, it must needs be the ground-work and foundation of our preparation.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>It is true and undeniable, that while man kept Gods Commandements, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his wisdom to Gods will, he was partaker of Gods goodnesse, and in the state of happinesse.

                              <p n="1">1. For Philosophers themselves say, that <hi>Honor est virtutis umbra,</hi> Honor is but the shadow of vertue, and we know, that we ought to follow the substance (which is vertue) and leave the shadow.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. In Honour, there must be as well the Honourer as the Honoured: and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, there are more Honourers then Honoured: so that there are many unhappy, and but few in felicity: if honour should be happinesse.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. As men may be honoured by some, so they are despised and envied by others, therefore men in honour are <hi>foelices in parte,</hi> happy in part onely, and therefore not truly happy.</p>

                              <p n="5">5. Honour is good, if it were <hi>sine sera &amp;clave,</hi> without lock or key, without dependance, which it is not; for honour dependeth upon other mens mouths, and hath no stability. Now that felicity, which is as mutable as a Camelion, cannot be true happinesse.

                  <head>How to come to God.</head>
                  <p>THe second general point is, that the means to attain to the end (that is to come to God) is by faith. <hi>Omnis motus ab appetitu est,</hi> every motion is prosecuted by desire, and <hi>ut moveatur cognoscenda est via,</hi> we must know the way before we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to motion, for <hi>ignoti nulla est cupido,</hi> a man hath no lust or desire to attempt that whereof he is ignorant. Therefore in the first place the way must be known to go to God, before we can come to him.</p>
                  <p>There are two wayes to come to God, one held by Hereticks which is by the reach of reason. 2. The other held by Christians, which is by faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Manichees</hi> (as Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> testifies of them) in opposition to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,<note place="margin">1</note> held that men were to come to God by reason, and not by belief: and therefore vaunted, that whereas others did <hi>imponere jugum credendi,</hi> impose a yoke of beleeving upon men desirous to come to God, that they would bring men to God, by opening <hi>fontem sciendi</hi> the fountain of knowledge onely, they would effect it by demonstration. This way because it was most plausible grew strongest, and prevailed long: In so much that if any Philosopher had entred Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he first became a <hi>Manichee:</hi> which appeared by <hi>Faustus</hi> the <hi>Manichee,</hi> whose heresy was most dangerous and of longest continuance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59534:29"/>
The like sectaries are in our dayes, who are called by the learned <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>,</hi> that must have a reason (forsooth) of every thing: and as long as you go with them in the way of reason, they will keep you company, so far will they go with you, and no further.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we are to prove, that the way to God by belief, is most convenient and necessary, and that the way by reason without faith is the worst and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient.<note place="margin">By Reason</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 If we must come to God by reason onely and knowledge, then it wil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> follow, that none shall be saved, but the learned, and those of excellent wit and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: for none but they are capable of demonstration: but that way (of all othe) is most inconvenient, that but few onely can go in. This is, as if many undertake a Journey together, and because some can climbe hedges and ditches, the rest must passe that way also. But Gods way is <hi>Via regia.</hi> The kings high-way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Againe, besides the excellency of wit and apprehension, there are great paines necessarily required to come to knowledge: and many are so weake by nature, that they cannot take the pains that shall be needful to acquire it: many also are so imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in several affairs, that they cannot spare somuch time as is requisit: and many (as we see by daily experience) that bend themselves that way, are cut off before they can attain to it: so that we may say, that if there were no other way to get the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God but by reason, there would be few that should enjoy that felicity: But God hath prescribed a more compendious way: we need do no more, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, <hi>&amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> we have attained it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 And whereas they object as <hi>Porphirie</hi> did to the Christians of his time, that too much Credulity is a signe of levity, and was an hindrance to many in coming to God by belief, we may 1 answer them by another saying of their own. <hi>Nemo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulus, nisi credis stulto aut improbe,</hi> No man is to be accounted credulous, but he that shall beleeve a fool or a knave. And of folly and impiety God must needs be acquitted, lest we fall into Blasphemy. for <hi>Deus,</hi> as he is <hi>perfecta veritas</hi> perfect truth and cannot deceive, so is he perfect wisdom and perfect righteousnesse too, even righteousnesse, truth, and wisdom it self, and cannot erre, therefore it is no danger to be taxed with credulity, for coming to God by belief.</p>
                  <p>Now, that this way by beleeving is the surest and most certaine way, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, because faith is grounded upon the word of God, though published and set forth by man. And this appeareth by four effects or circumstances, as <hi>Origen</hi> sets them down.</p>

                  <head>In the way of Faith, we are to observe four Rules.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. It was the Rule of the Heathen, that into what art soever a Scholar was initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, <hi>Oportet discentem credere,</hi> the Scholar must beleeve his Master: for whatsoever good we receive at the first, we receive it from our Teachers. And this ground, hath this principle, <hi>Actio perfecti in imperfecto recipitur,</hi> we are imperfect before we can come to any perfection, first imperfect, then perfect. Wood receives heat from fire before it can burn and be fire. So learners receive knowledge by faith from others,<note place="margin">Esa. 7. 9.</note> before they come to be perfect themselves. This is confirmed by the Prophet, <hi>Nist credideritis, non stabiliemini,</hi> if you will not beleeve, surely you shall not be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we have received by beleef, then we may seek for demonstrations, either <hi>a prieri,</hi> or <hi>a posteriori</hi> to confirm our belief, because, <hi>ut virtutum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ita &amp; religionis principia quaedam in nobis innata sunt,</hi> some principles of religion as of other vertues are inbred and natural to us, though much defaced and depraved by humane corruption: and <hi>principia religionis non sunt inter se contraria,</hi> the principles of religion are not contrary one to another, for then we should never come to any certainty of true knowledge. But reason and religion agree; and the true worship of God is proved by the principles of natural reason. True reason is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> help to faith,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 18.</note> and faith an help to reason: but faith is the Lady, reason her dutiful Handmaid. Eaith<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19.</note> and right reason are not contrary, but as a greater and a lesser light, yea faith is <hi>sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ratio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Having thus submitted our selves to belief, and strengthened it with reason, we must look for an higher teacher. For though faith be a perfect way, yet we being unperfect, walk unperfectly in it: and therefore in those things which transcend nature and reason, we must beleeve God onely, and pray to him, that by the inspiration of his holy spirit we may be directed, and kept in this way.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because this inspiration cometh not totally at the first, all at once, we must grow to perfection <hi>pedetentim</hi> by little and little: and come up by degrees, till it please him to send in full measure to us. <hi>Festinandum lente</hi> we must hasten, yet slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and take heed of, and avoid <hi>praepropera consilia</hi> rash attempts: according to the Prophets rule, <hi>Qui crediderit non festinabit,</hi> he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And thus much for this point of <hi>via ad Dominum,</hi> the way to come to God. 1. By beleeving. 2. By strengthening that belief. 3. By expecting the Spirit for our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recter. 4. And lastly by proceeding by degrees, in a right path.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p n="3">3 That we must beleeve there is a God. Misbelief in four things, 1. Autotheisme, 2. Polytheisme. 3. Atheisme. 4. Diabolisme. The reasons of Atheists, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. Religion upholds all states. The original of Atheisme, from 1. Discontent. 2. Sensuality.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe third point is: that we must believe there is a God. This is our third station or journey: for our better preparation and strengthening wherein, we are to note four obstacles or errors, which the Devil layes in our way. Misbelief seen in four points.</p>
               <p>The first is <hi>Autotheisme.</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> was in the state of perfection, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to perswade him, either 1. That he was a God, or 2. To worship any Creature as God, or 3. To believe that there was no God, 4. Or to worship the Devil as a God. And therefore he used all his art to deceive him, and perswaded him, that by eating the Apple his eyes should be opened, and that he should plainly perceive, that he should be like to God. And by his perswasion he departed from God by unbelief and presumption (to whom he must come again by belief and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation:) but in the same day wherein he transgressed Gods command, and followed the Devils counsel, he confuted that opinion (assoon as he had tasted the forbidden fruit) by hiding himself behinde the bush. So <hi>Alexander</hi> by his flatterers perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was drawn to believe himself to be a god; but being wounded at a siege, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>hic sanguis hominem denotat,</hi> his blood shewed plainly to be a man. And the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Claudius</hi> that was in the same humour, being scared with a clap of thunder, fled into his tent, and (hiding himself) could cry out, <hi>Hic Deus, Claudius non est Deus,</hi> this is God, <hi>Claudius</hi> is none.</p>
               <p>The second is <hi>Polytheisme.</hi> Because God was a help to Man after his fall, in making <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> him garments, directs him how to dresse the earth to yield him food, and gave him the use of the creatures, and this was a help and stay to man; the Devil by a false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version struck into the mindes of his posterity, that whatsoever was beneficial to man, was his god: and so saith the Philosopher, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which feedeth us, is a god: and so deriving that good to the instrument, which was proper to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, many gods were brought into the opinions of men: as Men, and Celestial Bodies: and at last they came unto such an extremity of absurdity, as that Cats, Crocodiles, and many other unreasonable creatures became to be worshipped as gods.</p>
               <p>The third is <hi>Atheisme.</hi> When this multitude of Gods grew so great, as that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> Poet said of them, <hi>Quorum nascuntur in hortis numina,</hi> they had gods growing in their Gardens: it soon became a question, and a doubt was made, whether there were a God or no. And this was the cause (as some conceive) why <hi>Diagoras</hi> first broached this doubt.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Diabolisme.</hi> After that the Devil had brought the World thus far, it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> impossible it should stay long there: therefore to shew his Master-piece, he brought himself, by his lyes, false and doubtful Oracles, and the like, first into admiration, and then even to adoration, causing the people to worship him as a god. And he wanted not worshippers, even of the most learned and greatest persons: As <hi>Appollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Tyaneus, Jamblicus,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostata, who being of no religion, fell to worship the Devil, and proved Necromancers, Sorcerers, and Conjurers. The like successe he had in the East Indies, where the Gospel was preached by S. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle. The people in after ages falling into contention about religion, they grew at length to worship him in an image called <hi>Thor,</hi> and continue his worship to this day.</p>
               <p>We shall insist especially upon the third Errour, Atheisme.</p>
               <p>They which have stood in defence of this errour, set down these five Heads for their grounds.</p>

But when men began to degenerate, and that Religion became too weak, not powerful enough to keep such bruitish people with in their bounds; then were Laws enacted, to be as bridles to untamed and unruly horses. But more particularly of these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The universality of the perswasion of the worship of God, is not onely writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the heart of every man, but it is confirmed by the consent of all History; for there is no History but it describes as well the Religion, as the manners of the people, and therefore it is impossible to be the invention of man. As for instance. The Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Countreys that have been discovered within these hundred years, by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards and Portugals in the Americane part of the World, both in the South and West, which had no entercourse or commerce with any other Nations: the Natives whereof, though in a manner they seemed barbarous, as having no apparel to cover them, nor lawes to govern them, yet were they not without a kinde of Religion, and something they had which they called and worshipped as a god, though they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but either natural instinct to lead and direct them to it, or general and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned tradition continued from the first parents of mankinde.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor can it be truly affirmed, that these Nations should have learned their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion meerly from others bordering upon them, in respect of the difference and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of Religion among them: there being as much variety therein as is possible and without the least proportion or likenesse of one religion to another; though in conditions they be very like.

4 If it be objected, that the reason, why Religion continueth so long, is, because they are kept in awe by it, that otherwise would be exorbitant.

               <p n="1">1 For the first, we may see it plainly in <hi>Diagoras,</hi> who as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> and <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> report of him, became an Atheist, affirming that there was neither God, nor Religion. Because when he had written a book of verses, which pleased him so well, that he intended to publish it, one stole the Poeme from him: and when for this fact, he was brought before the Senate of Athens, and took his oath that he had it not, yet afterwards put it forth to publick view, not in <hi>Diagoras</hi> name, but in his own. And because this perjured person was not presently stricken with thunder for his perjury, and abusing the name of their Gods and the authority of the Senate, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras</hi> immediatly turned Atheist. The like is to be observed in <hi>Porphyrie</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</hi> who at the first were Christians, but for some wrong done to them by some of the Church (as they conceived) for which they were not punished, became plain Atheists, though they were termed but Apostata's</p>
               <p>For the second, which is sensuality. This motive drew <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his fellows to be come Atheists: and to hold this brutish opinion that there came an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary benefit to them, because they might more freely enjoy their pleasures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restraint by any feare of future punishment. At the first they held with <hi>Diagoras,</hi> that there was no God. The main reason of their brutish opinion was grounded upon this; <hi>Ede, bibe, lude, post mortem nulla voluptas,</hi> there was no hope of pleasure after this life, because the soul was not immortal. But the very Heathen contemporary with them confuted them therein, and thus proved the truth against <hi>Epicurus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 In things that are corrupted together, corruption takes hold of the one as well as the other, both at once: but in age, when the body is weakest, the soul is strongest: therefore it is immortall.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The perfection of the soule appeareth most, when it abstracteth and separateth it

self most from the body: and therefore in the greatest separation of all others which is by death, it will be most perfect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that the soul is the subject of truth, but no subject of truth can decay, no more then truth it self, therefore the soul is immortal.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Archesilaus</hi> a chief Academique, seeing with what difficulty men attained to knowledge, and with what pains small learning was gotten, took a short course, and held that there was no knowledge at all. So these Epicures, seeing that Religion restrained men from all licentious actions, and pleasures, and how hard a thing it was to lead a Godly life, took a short course, and held there was neither God nor Religion.

               </argument>
               <head>That there is a God.</head>
               <p>THus much for the Negative: Now for the affirmative point, That there is a God: the belief whereof we may be confirmed in by uncorrupt reason, even from the writings of the Heathen themselves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a first mover, a first cause in all things, else there should be before eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mover another mover, and so <hi>in infinitum.</hi> And so of causes: and if so, this absurdity would follow, that infinite causes must have infinite times to produce infinite effects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there were no first cause, all would be instrumental causes, and no principal. And seeing no inferiour cause worketh without a superiour, and that if there were not a principal and supream mover of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, there would be no effects. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a Devil, therefore a God. There is a spirit in the world set upon mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which seeks to endamage men in their goods, and <hi>quantum fieri potest,</hi> as much as he can, to bring all mankinde to destruction, as is plain in sorcerers and witches. And as he is bent to the utter ruine of mankinde, so he would have effected it long before this time, had there not been a superiour power to restrain his malice. So that they were enforced to beleeve, first, that there was a Devil, and afterwards <hi>esse Deum, qui ejus potestati resisteret, &amp; quasi jura daret Tyrannidi,</hi> that there is a God, who resists the Devils power, and sets bounds to his tyrannous maliciousnesse.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another reason is from the frame of the world. There was a founder of it, the old Heathen Poets acknowledged a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a first Creator, from which these reasons may be gathered.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Though we dig long, and cannot come to the root of a tree, or finde out the head of a spring, yet we know, the one hath a head, and the other a root: so though we cannot easily come to the knowledge how the world had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet sure we are that a beginning it had. And <hi>Damascen</hi> reasoneth very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively, that it had a beginning, because it is alwayes in alteration and change.</item>
                  <item>2. Where divers things of great discrepancy in nature, are reduced and brought into a sweet harmony and concord (as in a Lute) we may argue and conclude, that surely some skilful Musician hath tuned and accorded them: So nothing being fuller of variety and contrariety of natures then the world, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in it, we must needs confesse, when we see what agreement,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59534:32"/>
and sympathy and consent is among them, that some excellent and skilful one, hath made this harmoniacal consent.</item>
                  <item>3. Of all things in the world, as laws, learning, arts and the rest, the beginning as well of them, as of the Inventors of them are known: for so the Heathen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse. And <hi>Plinie</hi> hath written much in his naturall history to this purpose. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus</hi> faith, that laws came from the Jews, and order in common-wealths from the Chaldeans: but this doubtlesse came also originally from Gods people, and by humane reason and different occasions was varied from the first institution.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now whereas they object, that <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> of nothing can nothing be<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> made. The answer to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is, <hi>Alia est conditio rei dum fit, alia cum facta est. Nutritur</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>quisque in utero per umbilicum, post partum per os,</hi> the condition of things in their creation and after their creation is different: A childe in the mothers belly is fed by the navil, after the birth by the mouth.</p>
               <p>And for that they say, that we know not, whether <hi>motus</hi> the motion, or <hi>Movens</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> the Mover were first, and therefore no beginning can be proved, we say, That<note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> we can no more certainly affirm, whether the <hi>systole</hi> or <hi>diastole,</hi> the rising or the falling of pulse were first, and yet we know, that the pulse and the heart from whence it comes had a beginning: and so say we of the motion and Mover.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, that of every thing, a beginning there was, it must needs be from one of these three. 1. From Chance, 2. Or from Nature, 3. Or from God.</p>
               <list>
                  <head>Reasons against Chance.</head>
                  <item>1. From Chance it cannot be. For if a man travail through a wildernesse or desert <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> place, and see a Cottage or Stye there, in his own reason he would conceive, that some body had been there to erect or set it up; and that it came not to be there <hi>forte fortuito</hi> by chance. If a man should see a circumference or a triangle (as <hi>Aristippus</hi> did) upon the sea shore, he would soon imagine that some Artist or skilful man had drawn it, and that it came not by Chance. No more are we to ascribe the making of any thing to fortune. For in our common talk, the generation of things we attribute not to Chance, but the corruption we call mischance. As when we see a house burnt, or the like, we use to call it a mischance. But things of generation and invention, we ascribe to art or counsail. In the Argonauts of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> the silly Countrey-man that saw the first ship arrive at Colchos could say <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> it had some skilful Pilot to guide it.</item>
                  <item>2. In <hi>fortuitis</hi> or things by chance there can be no order observed, no more then in casting of dice: but in the world there is a most excellent order in all things, except in the actions of men which are corrupt and confused.</item>
                  <item>3. Chance and purpose can never agree, for fortune is defined to be <hi>praeter proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> besides and contrary to purpose. If a man do any thing of purpose, it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to say that he did it by chance. But in the world there is a manifest purpose: for there is an eye, and that eye hath its object, that object its line, that line its <hi>medium</hi> and <hi>species,</hi> and so a counsel and mutual destination. So that it is not from Chance.</item>
               </list>
               <list>
                  <head>Reasons against Nature.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </head>
                  <item>1. The beginning was not from Nature. If it were, then all things must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to it, and there must be a naturall reason given for all things. But this cannot be: for the Philosophers cannot give a reason in Nature, for the ebbing and flowing of the sea. For the colours of the Rainbow. The strength of the neither chappe, which is able to knap in sunder even Iron it self, and yet hath a very weak upholder. For the heat of the stomach, which consumeth any meat, and yet hurteth not it self, nor any parts about it, and even the vertues, they make them not all naturall, but some <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> heroicall and coming from God.</item>
                  <item>2. If nature were the beginning of all things, then should nothing be done against nature, because nothing can oppose it self against the chief cause. And if nature had that power of it self to produce and set on work so excellent a frame as the world is, it would be of as great force to preserve and continue its course. But this it doth not, for we know that the sun stood still at the command of <hi>Joshua</hi> against natures course, and the sun had an Eclypse in the full of<note place="margin">Josh. 10. 12.</note> the moon against nature at our Saviours passion.<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 33.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59534:32"/>
Seeing then that the beginnings come neither from Chance nor Nature, it must neceslarily follow, that all things had their beginning from God, which we prove thus.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. All the Prophecies shew, the same which foretel things to come in plain terms: of which things there was no reason in nature: as that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> a hundred yeers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his birth. Of King <hi>Josiah</hi> three hundred yeers before he was borne. And that of reedifying of Jericho, five hundred years almost before it was repaired by <hi>Hiel:</hi> and all these <hi>in iisdem terminis,</hi> in the same words set down in those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The orderly and artificial framing the Creatures at the Creation tells us plainly, that Nature was not the beginning, but God, for even them, whom neither miracles nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> religion could move, the most base and contemptible Creatures have astonished and confounded, and drawn from them a confession of a supream and supernaturall power. <hi>Plinie</hi> was astonished at the little Gnat, that by her trunck makes so great a noise, and saith, that without a supream power above nature that creature could not have been so made. The like he acknowledgeth upon the sight of the Butterfly. And <hi>Galen</hi> after he had blasphemously treated of the most excellent parts of man, when<note place="margin">de usu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now as we are taught by those things which are without us, that there is a cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Nature, so likewise by the things that are within us.</p>
               <p>For first we have a soul (as we said before) indued with reason and understanding,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> immortal. This soul then must either be the cause of it self, or take its being from some other cause. But of itself it is not the cause.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it knoweth not itself, neither any parts of the body, but by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, <hi>at omnis causa novit effectum</hi> every cause (if it be reasonable) knoweth its effect, not onely after it is brought forth, but before, and by what degrees it is so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Our father in begetting, and our mother in conceiving, know not what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, what is conceived: but, <hi>in causa principali necessario requiritur, ut cognoscas effectum antequam existat, &amp; dum est in producendo,</hi> in the principal cause it is of necessity required, that it know the effect before it be: and while it is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, after we are brought forth, we cannot command every part of us, as thearteries and pulses that they beat not: and therefore it is plain that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not, nor are causes of our selves, but we are necessarily to seek a cause else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. For as there is none in the world that hath reason but man: so none above reason but God. And therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith <gap reason="foreign">

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> we are his generation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In our souls are certain sparks of the light of nature, principles of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and infallible truth: as to honour our parents and superiours, to do as we would be done unto, to defend our selves from injuries, to keep promise, to hurt no man, and the like, without observing whereof, no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety could be maintained, among which this is one. That there is a God, and that he ought to worshipped. And howsoever all other may fail, yet this never, as having taken deeper impression in mens mindes (that are not come to the height of Atheisme) then the rest. Insomuch as the pride of mans nature which will stoop and yield to nothing else, is content to submit to this, and will rather worship a peece of red cloth, then have no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at all. And this is so fast and deeply rooted in man, that it cannot be removed, unlesse you pluck out heart and all.</p>
               <p>But then it is objected, That if this Notion be so generall, how comes it that<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> there are so many Atheists? To which may be answered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With <hi>Seneca, Mentiuntur qui dicunt se non sentire esse Deum, nam etsi</hi>

2. But a better answer may be framed to this objection. A man may proceed to a great degree of hardnesse of heart, and blinding himself, yet this rule must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <hi>Specimen naturae cujuslibet, a natura optima sumendum est,</hi> the tryal or essay<note place="margin">De natura <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>But yet, though their hearts be fat, and they besotted as the horse and mule, yet if God put his bit into their mouthes, those natural sparks we speak off, will break forth and darknesse will not be able to obscure the light.</p>

                  <head>And this is to be seen in the worst of natures upon these occasions.</head>
                  <item>1.

               <p>But another main argument is this. There are in us naturall notions of God, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of his effence, therefore we must of necessity believe that there is a God.</p>

Reasons against divine providence, answerd: why God permitts evil: general reasons for a providence, particular reasons from all sorts of creatures.

               <head>Gods care of mankinde.</head>
               <p>The next station is. That God hath a care of men, to reward the good. For it is<note place="margin">4</note> not sufficient to know God in his Essence onely: but in his Providence also. For as to deny that God is, is Atheisme, so the doubting of his Providence and care over the Creatures is Semi-Atheisme. Nay if we look at the moral effect which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of a Deity works among men, it is all one to deny his Providence, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he is. And this was the Epicures error, who though they were forced by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to know that there was a God, yet they held, That God had no care of man. Now of Gods providence there are four opinions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That God hath no entercourse with man, but hath drawn the Heauens as a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain between him and us, that we should not know or see, what he doth, nor he what we doe.</item>
                  <item>2. That there is a providence, but that it extendeth onely to general things, and so is a general providence, setting in order second causes, but reacheth not to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular individual thing.</item>
                  <item>3. Another opinion granteth a providence as well of particulars, as generals, but that it is idle, as a spectator only, that beholds men act upon a stage, and neither rewardeth, nor punisheth.</item>
                  <item>4. The last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that as he hath providence over both sorts, as well particular as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> neral, so he doth not onely behold, but reward the good, and punish the evill. And this is the truth, which Christans hold.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The chief reasons which they use to alledg in maintaining that there is no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at all, are cheifly three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 The adversity of the good, and the prosperity of the wicked. For say they, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>vlla esset providentia, bonis bene esset, malis male,</hi> if there were any providence it would goe well with the good, and ill with the bad.</item>
                  <item>2. That although many abuse the gifts of God, yet he giveth them promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. And therefore, if there were a providence, the use of the gift would have been given with it, and no gifts would have been given to them that should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse them.</item>
                  <item>3. That the manifold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and evill effects in morral and natural things shew, that if there were a Providence, God would not suffer so many in either.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. To the first, we answer. If a man were absolutely good, no adversity would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide him, and if absolutely evil, no prosperity: but no man in this life is absolutely good or evil, but as the best are not without some evil, so the worst not without some good; And therefore it stands with the justice of God, to punish that evil which is in the good with temporal punishments in this life, and to reward the good which is in the wicked, with temporal blessings: that he may reward the one, and punish the other, in the other life. Hence it is that saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> saith, <hi>Domine hic secabic vre, modo ibi parca,</hi> Lord cut and burn, afflict me here, so thou spare me hereafter. We know what the Devil, said to God, in <hi>Jobs</hi> case. Doth <hi>Job</hi> serve God for nought? Therefore God,<note place="margin">Job. 1. 9.</note> to stop the mouths of the wicked and Sathan, punisheth the Godly here. And hence it is, that if good men live in prosperity, the Devil is ready to object, that their acts are but hypocritical: therefore God to make it appeare, that the Godly serve him not in respect of temporal blessings, and that vertue in them is not mercenary, but free, he oft times layes afflictions on his children, which they beare willingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The former answer might have served to confut this second reason: for as in onely the first, if it had been <hi>bonis bene,</hi> well to the good the Devill had well said, Doth <hi>Job</hi> serve God for nought? so in this case, If God had given the use of the gifts with the giftes themselves to every one, the Devil would have said, <hi>Job</hi> can doe no other but serve God. He is not left to his own election, God hath in a mnaner enforced him to it, and so his actions are not praise worthy, nor deserve any reward. For what extraordinary matter is it for fire to burn, since it is its nature and property. But when some of the wicked have as excellent gifts bestowed on them, as the godly have, and yet they abuse them: it takes away all cavils and exceptions from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and maketh much for the commendation of the Godly, and for the just reprofe and punishment of the wicked.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the third we say, that though there be defects, and evil effects, yet God is not the cause of them: he hath no part either in the evil action, or with the evil doer. <hi>Omnis actionis imperfectio, non a Deo, sed a male se habente instrumento,</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of every action is not of God, but from the indisposition or perversenesse of the instrument. In a Creple the soul is the cause of motion, and is in no fault, but the distortion of the body which is the instrument of the soul. So every action is from God, but if it have any deformity, it is of the crookednesse of the instrument. Now God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> evil in these respects.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Per privationem gratiae,</hi> by justly for sin depriving men of his grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followeth a defect of good: for if there were no defect, his infinite goodnesse could not have been so cleerly seen, nor would there have been any variety of good things, but one good onely.</item>
                  <item>2. If there were no defect, there would have been no order or degrees in things.</item>
                  <item>3. Many vertues would have been superfluous, as Justice, Temperance, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>4. Because it is necessary, that God should be loved for his All-sufficiency in the highest degree: and there is nothing that makes us love God more, then for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of his benefits: and his benefits are never more highly esteemed, then when we want them: for <hi>bonum carendo magis quam fruendo cernitur,</hi> we discern and finde what is good for us, more by being deprived of it, then by enjoying it. So that were there no defect, we should not be so sensible of the good which we want.</item>
                  <item>5. Nor would God ever permit evil,, but that thereby he can take occasion by his infinite wisdom and goodnesse, that a greater good may arise. As we plainly finde, that from the greatest evil that ever was committed (the betraying of our Saviour) God took occasion to draw the greatest benefit that ever befell mortal men, namely, the Redemption of mankinde. So much in answer to the first opinion.</item>

Now to prove that there is a providence, 1. In generals. 2. In fingular and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.<note place="margin">2.</note> 3. Not onely by the ordinary course of secondary causes, but immediately from God himself.</p>
               <p>There is a providence in general matters.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is natural to every one, <hi>ut curet quod procreavit,</hi> to have a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a natural love and affection to that which it bringeth forth; and this being the gift of God in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cannot be wanting in himself. <hi>Astorgia</hi> is a vice, and to be reproved in man,<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.</note> and therefore cannot befal God, but when it seemeth to fall in God, by his laying af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and troubles upon any of his creatures, it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or want of love to them, but a manifest providence over them, for whom he loves he chastens, and thereby furthers their chiefest good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No wise Artificer will give over his work before he have finished it, and brought it to perfection: but every day God bringeth forth some new thing, some new effect, things which are tending to perfection, for things are yet daily in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and therefore God hath his providence over them to bring them thereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In particulars. We see (with <hi>Aristotle</hi>) that the sea is far higher then the land,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the waters far above the brims of the earth, and water is an unruly element, apt to overflow by its natare: yet Philosophers being unable to render a satisfactory reason, why it overflowes not the earth, it followes, that it is of Gods providence, who limits the bounds thereof, and commands it to passe no further.</p>
               <p>And if any say, that the water and earth make one sphere or globe, and therefore the swelling of any part, is onely in appearance, that spherical figure being the natural figure of the whole; yet herein providence plainly appears, in that some parts of the earth are made hollow, to be receptacles for the sea, which otherwise should by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature cover the whole earth, and so the dry land appear for the use of Men and Beasts.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The next reason is from <hi>Plotinus.</hi> fetcht from the Plants, which if they stand between two kinds of soyle, soyle of two natures, one dry and barren, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moyst and fruitfull, they will naturally shoot all their roots to the fruitfull soyle. As also from lilyes and marigolds and divers other flowres, that of themselves natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally close toward evening with the Sun-set, lest they should receive evil and corrupt moysture in the night, and in the morning open again, to receive the heat of the Sun.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next is from Birds. Our Saviour in a sermon to his disciples concerning<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 24.</note> Gods providence, bids them observe and mark well. Consider (faith he) the ravens, for they neither sow nor reape, they have neither storehouse nor barne, and yet God feedeth them. And King <hi>David</hi> testifieth the like, that the Ravens are fed of God. And it is reported, that their young ones being forsaken by the damme and left bare,<note place="margin">Psalm. 147. 9.</note> a worme ariseth out of their doung, creepeth up to their bill, and feedeth them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is from fishes. <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth, that the little fish Pinnothera entring league with the Crab, taketh a stone in her mouth, and when the Oyster o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth against the Sun, swimmeth in with the stone in her mouth, so that the Oyster not being able to close again, the Crab pulleth out the meat, and they both divide the prey.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The next is from Beasts. we see that the Providence of God hath taken order, that wilde beasts should not be so generative as Tame, least by their multiplicity they should doe much harm. Secondly, Though they be naturally desirous of prey, yet God hath so disposed, that when the Sun ariseth in the day time, (when they might best fit themselves) they get them away, and lay them down in their denns; and Man goeth forth to his labour (and worketh securely) till the evening, as the prophet speaks. and when man goeth to his rest, then go they to seek their prey. Which must<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 22. 23.</note> necessarily be a great argument of Gods grovidence.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And so generally from all living Creatures; by discerning their several places of nourishment. As the silly lamb, among a multitude of Ewes, to choose out its own damme. As also in avoiding things noysom and hurtfull to them: as the Chicken to run away at the noyse of a Kite, even almost assoone as it is hatched; the lamb to flee from the wolfe, and the like.</p>
               <p n="7">7. From the extraordinary love of parents to their children, though never so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, in as great measure, as if they had no defect in nature.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59534:35"/>
8. Lastly from the sudden cry of every Creature in distresse, for which no reason can be given, but that it is <hi>vox naturae clamantis ad dominum naturae,</hi> the cry of nature, to the God of nature, as some of the Heathen have bin forced to confesse.</p>
               <p>And thus we see the providence of God in particular, concerning which <hi>Theoderet</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his 10.</note> hath written against those that were of opinion, that providence was but as a Clock,<note place="margin">Serm. de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia.</note> which after the plummets are plucked up, goes afterward of its own accord.</p>
               <p>The Third particular to be proved is, that the effects we see come not meerly of second causes, or by nature, nor by chance, but mediatly or immediatly from God.</p>
               <p>First not by nature or second causes alone.<note place="margin">Meanes or Nature.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We say that meanes work nothing of themselves, no more then bread can nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of itself. For there is a staffe of bread (as the Prophet tels us) which if it be broken,<note place="margin">Ezec. 4. 16. 5. 16</note> bread itself will do us little good. Christ calleth it the word, and the psalmist hidden<note place="margin">John. 6. 32.</note> treasure, which without Gods blessing will be put but as into a bottomlesse bag: as<note place="margin">Psa. 17. 14.</note> the Prophet speakes. This the Philosophers acknowledged, and called it Infusion of<note place="margin">Aggai. 1. 6.</note> strength, nature, and efficacy into the Creatures. And it must needs be from the first, and not from the second cause.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sundry things are effected without meanes: as because men should not think<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> the Sun to be the sole cause of Light, God created the Light before the Sun. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he created fruit with the seed, because we should not think, seed alone to be the cause or means of fruit. And we see in these dayes preferment cast upon some men that neither seek nor deserve it,</p>
               <p n="3">3. We see also some effects wrought contrary to Nature. As when Christ opened<note place="margin">John. 9. 6.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 2. 19.</note> the eyes of him that was blinde, with clay, which naturally is more proper to put<note place="margin">Gen. 39.</note> out the eyes then open them. So likewise <hi>Elisha</hi> made the the salt water fresh and sweet by casting salt into it. <hi>Josephs</hi> imprisonment, was the means of his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the unlearned Christians confounded the learned of their time. Therefore the effects depende not on means, or nature onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. not by chance.</p>
               <p>Fortune hath not the command of the issue and event of war, as some prophane men<note place="margin">See the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. folio. 63.</note> have given out, <hi>Sors domina campi,</hi> that Chance is the predominant Lady of the field; but we Christians know, that God is a man of war, and fighteth for his servants, and gives them victory, or else for their sins, and to humble them, gives them into their enemies hands, and maketh them Lords over them: and the heathens themselves made their worthies, <hi>Diomedes, Vlisses &amp;c.</hi> prosperous by the assistance of some god, and therefore in their stories, vsually there went a vow before the war, and after the victory, performance. In the very drawing of Lots (which a man would think to be Chance, of all other things) we see, it ordered some times by special providence against Chance; so that it must be confessed that somewhat was above it, as in the case of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>Jonas.</hi> And therefore it is that the wiseman saith, The lot is cast into<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 42.</note> the lap, but the whole disposing of it is in the Lord. Hence the mariners in the ship<note place="margin">Jon. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">pro. 16. 33.</note> where <hi>Jonas</hi> was, vsed this casting of lots acknowledging a providence, of God therein.</p>
               <p>And upon that which they call Chance medley it cannot depend, for there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Providence. <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> that being hated by his subjects for his cruelty, the people not unwilling to have another vsurper, in his absence, it came to his ears: he furiously alighting from his horse with entent to to have gone against the vsurper, his sword fell out of the scabbard, and run into his thigh or belly and killed him, which this Heathen writer ascribes to Providence, not to chance medley. And the Philosophers conclude, that chance is nothing else, but an effect of causes far removed, and if of them much more of things neer together, which plainly are to be referred to the divine providence. And it is a greater argument of providence to joyn things far asunder, then those which are neerer, and better known. Therefore the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects we see cannot be ascribed onely to Nature or Chance. To all which might be added that unanswerable argument from the fulfilling of prophecies, which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily proves a divine providence.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen, that there is a Providence in general. 2. That it worketh even when there are secondary causes. 3. Now that this Providence reacheth and extendeth to particulars as it doth to generals, and rewardeth each particular man, is proved by Philosophy and reason, thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The philosophers make Providence, a part and branch of Prudence: and Prudence
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59534:35"/>
is a practical vertue, and practical vertues have their objects <hi>in singularibus</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now it is certain that all the Attributes of God, are every one of equal latitude and longitude. His power is over all and extendeth to every thing, for <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis est maxime pertingere vel remotissima,</hi> that is the greatest power that reacheth to things farthest off. And his providence and goodnesse is of no lesse extent then his power.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There's no man but will confesse, that it is a more commendable thing to provide for every particular, then for the general onely. And therefore it is, that is storied for the commendation and honour of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who having many thousands in his army, was able to call them all <hi>nominatim,</hi> by their names: then <hi>si quod melius est, non agatur,</hi> if the best be not done, it must needs be out of some defect in the Agent, but there's none in God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now for the rest of the Creatures. If God have a care of heaven, which hath not the use of its own light or motion, but is to make inferiour things fruitful, and cattle have use of herbs, &amp;c. and man of cattle, and all other things, and the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers telling us, that that which hath the use of all things, is principal of all others; man having the use of all, must needs be principal: therefore, <hi>si sit providentia Dei in reliquas creaturas, ut in principalem se extendat, necesse est,</hi> if the providence of God extend it self to the rest of the Creatures, it necessarily follows, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it self to the principal.</p>
               <p n="5">5. King <hi>David</hi> first considereth the glory of the Heavens, then the eternity of<note place="margin">Psalm 8.</note> them, and wondreth how God could passe by those most glorious bodies, and put the soul of man (the most excellent creature) into a most vile lump of clay and earth. Man is the most excellent of all other of Gods artifice: for other Creatures know not their own gifts. The horse, if he knew his strength, would not suffer his rider upon his back; therefore the occultation of the gift from that creature which hath it, and the manifestation of it to man that hath it not, is an argument that man is Gods Count-Palatine of the whole world, and cannot be exempted from Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And this is that which made Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in a godly zeal (being displeased with man) to say, <hi>Appende te homo,</hi> consider thy self well, O man, art not thou better then all creatures else? Yet is Gods providence over the vilest of them, and so from them to man, and more especially to good men: for if he have a providence and care of those that onely have his image by nature, then where two images meet in one, one of nature, and another of grace by Christ, much more: for <hi>similitudo magnes amoris,</hi> likenesse is the loadstone of love, <hi>&amp; amoris providentia,</hi> and providence of love. If God care for all mankinde, then much more for these, who as it were hate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to love him, those that lose themselves to finde him, and that perish to live with him. Therefore his providence is over particulars.</p>
               <p>The second branch of this part hath two things considerable. 1. That God is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to be sought. 2. That his providence is to reward them that seek and serve him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the first place then God must be sought, for <hi>facientis finis est ipsemet</hi> the end of the actor is himself, and God being his own end, it must necessarily follow, that he wills all things for his own, either profit, honour, or pleasure.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For his profit we cannot seek him; for none can redound to him from us.</item>
                  <item>2. Nor for his pleasure, for wherein can we pleasure him?</item>
                  <item>3. Therefore it must be for his honour, for to that end did he create us, that for his honour we should seek and serve him.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. The next is that he rewards such as seek and serve him. Where there are two relatives, there is a grounded mutual duty between them as between a father and a son, love and obedience: between man and wife mutual love: between Master and servant, care and service: between the Creator and Creature, providence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Now between God and his true servants that seek him faithfully, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and love, and reward for it. And though we be but <hi>verna Domini</hi> Gods bond-men, and are bound to keep his laws, because he is our <hi>Legislator,</hi> Law-maker: yet he hath promised reward to them that keepe them,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59534:36"/>
and doth not as kings, who give laws, and yet give no rewards to them that keep them, but punish the breakers of them: Gods goodnesse is greater to us men.</p>
               <p>And as God hath a reward for his children that seek and serve him, so hath he retribution, viz. punishment for them that neglect him, and break his commandments, which we might easily prove, both by ancient and modern story.</p>
               <p>So that we may conclude this point, that Gods providence is manifest in reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good. And so much against the Epicure.</p>

In the search whereof we come into a <hi>Quadrivium,</hi> or way that hath four turnings, viz. the four principal religions of the world, In which the greatest part of the world have sought God. These are,</p>

                  <item>1. Paganisme. And this had once spread it self over all the earth, except one corner of Syria: and it cannot be denied, but that in the knowledge of arts, policy, and Philosophy, the Heathen exceeded all other nations, and their light shined that way, brightest above others; and that in these things we have all lighted our candle at theirs. And yet as the wisest of us may wonder at them for their extraordinary naturall and humane knowledge, so the simplest of us may laugh at them, for their absurdities in the worship of God, so dim hath their light burnt in matter of Religion.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Apostle in the place last quoted hath two arguments against them, to prove that there must needs be but one God, and they erred because they had many gods, many lords. And indeed many they had. <hi>Varro</hi> makes the number of them 30000 whereof there were 300 <hi>Jupiters,</hi> besides a number called <hi>dii majorum gentium, &amp; minorum, &amp; dii tutelares,</hi> tutelar gods, &amp;c. and as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speakeh <hi>Quis nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare</hi>

                  <hi>potest?</hi> the number was so great, that no man could reckon them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He, from whom al things are, can be but<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> one. The reason is, Inferiour causes are resemblances of superiour, and they of the Highest: but we see in all inferiour causes, many branches come from one root, many parts are ruled by one head, many veins from one Master-vein, and many rivers and chanels<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 6.</note> from one fountaine. So in Superiour causes, there are many causes from one, as many lights from one, and many motions from one motion:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59534:36"/>
therefore in the highest cause, this unity must needs be after a most perfect manner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In quem omnia concurrunt,</hi> in whom all things meet, as lines in the center. In the mutual order of nature all things depend upon one another, <hi>Mutuus ordo in se invicem est propter conjunctum ordinem in uno,</hi> that mutual order which is, is from order joyned in one, as all things flow from one, so they return to one again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one, and but one God.</p>
               <p>But their own reasons are sufficient to convince them, for <hi>Pythagoras</hi> saith, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there must be an infinite power in God, else mans understanding should exceed its cause, that is the Creator of it, because it is able to comprehend and conceive a greater thing then its cause, were it only finite: for <hi>si potest as infinita est, tum natura infinita, quia accidentis capacitas, non excedit capacitatem subjecti,</hi> if the power be infinite, the subject in which that power is, must needs be also infinite, because the capacity of the adjunct exceeds not the capacity of its subject. And there can be but one infinite, therefore but one God. If we grant two infinites there must be a line to part them, if so, then they are both finite, and have several forces, and being divided, cannot be so perfect as if they were joyned together and both one. But there can be no imperfectnesse in God. Therefore we cannot admit of two Gods.</p>
               <p>Again, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> argueth. If there be two Gods, and Gods attribute being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> omnipotency, they must be both omnipotent, of equal force and power, or unequal. If of equal, then they agree or disagree: if equal and both agree, then is one of them superfluous, but superfluity is excluded from the Diety. If they disagree, and be of unequal power, then the greater will swallow up the lesse, and so reduce all into one, and so the lesser is not omnipotent, and by consequent no god. And howsoever the Heathen outwardly held Polytheisme or many Gods, because they durst do no other, in policy to maintain and uphold their Common-wealths, yet privately they condemned it, and held it inconvenient. And therefore though they had many gods, yet to some they gave the place and title of a father, and to the other of children; to some of a King, and to the rest of Subjects.</p>
               <p>The advise of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> to his Shcolers was to search, till they came to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> unity in every thing. And <hi>Aristotles</hi> drift was to seek for <hi>primum,</hi> the first, and the <hi>omnium primum,</hi> and the <hi>primum ex primis,</hi> the first of all. <hi>Plato</hi> in his first epistle to <hi>Dionysius</hi> gives him this rule, that in those epistles which he writes of certain truth, he begins with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> God, and in those which contain doubtful things, he begins with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Gods, making God his note of truth, and Gods of uncertainty. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> rule to his Scholers was, <hi>Dicite plures, &amp; dicite nullum,</hi> say there be many Gods, and say there be none: and <hi>Sophocles</hi> held in truth, <hi>Vnus est Deus,</hi> there is but one God. So that among themselves they muttered the truth, howsoever either for fear of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or disturbing the peace of the Common-wealth, they thought fit to suffer the people to live in their errour of Polytheisme.</p>
               <p>But because Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that in the Primitive Church the Philosophers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <note place="margin">De civ. Deil 4</note> were ashamed of their multiplicity of Gods, and therefore gave out, that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were never so absurd as to worship many Gods, but onely gave one God diverse names, to distinguish their effects, and not conceiving that there were diverse Gods, but ascribed power to one God onely, we will consider it a little further.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For first, it is certain that they had diversity of Gods, 2. and secondly they erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several images to them. Now if they were circumscript, then could they be no gods, for <hi>Deus non potest circumscribi, quia infinitus</hi> God cannot be circumscribed, because he is infinite, and if an image could expresse them, they were circumscript.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, the whole course of Heathen religion sought no further then their eye led them, struck no further then the skin, looked only after outward actions, they neither would nor could search into the reins, nor had any remedy to restrain the heart and minde and the vices thereof, as hypocrisy, &amp;c. but true religion, such as is that of the Christians, forbiddeth concupiscence, and bridleth the affections, strikes deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then that of the Heathen, therefore have the Heathen, neither true God nor true Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They attribute but particular honour to particular Gods, in respect of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular benefits they conceive, that they receive respectively from them, as to some for the benefit of physick, to some, for their good successe in war and the like, but that God onely is to be honoured, whose providence extends universally,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59534:37"/>
and hath power alike in all things, which as they confesse theirs had not, and there fore are not Gods.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Again the objection of <hi>Cyrill</hi> to <hi>Julian</hi> (which made him to stagger) is strong against them. That it being the sinne of the body which defileth the soule, the soule had need of something to purge and cleanse it: but their Religion having nothing in it to cleanse the heart and soule as well as the body, cannot be the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That their Gods were no Gods but men appeares, in that their parents were known and confest by the Heathen writers themselves, as of <hi>Hesiod</hi> in his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognia. <hi>Tullie de natura deorum</hi> and others; as also by <hi>Cyril</hi> against <hi>Julian, Augustine</hi> in his bookes <hi>de Givitate dei; Eusebius de preparatione Evangelica,</hi> but best by <hi>Gregory Nyssen, &amp;cyprian de vanitate Idolorum.</hi> And <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Leo</hi> a priest of Egypt, was enformed by him that the Gods of the Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and other nations came out of Egypt, &amp; that the religion of the Greeks came from Egyptians by the meanes of <hi>Cecrops</hi> and from <hi>Phaenicia</hi> by Cadmus. That the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had theirs from the Greeks, by <hi>Numa Pompilius.</hi> And the Egyptian Gods were but men, for their descents were known, as <hi>Hermes Tresmegistus,</hi> and <hi>Escu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> who discended from <hi>Vranius</hi> and <hi>Mercurius,</hi> and yet these were reputed to be their Gods.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Again Their Gods were not onely Men but wicked men. For Religion being nothing but a faculty to make men perfect, and fit them for a more blessed life, by framing them in fimilitude to the actions and perfections of God, their Gods as they were but men and no Gods, so were they men of wicked lives and conversation, stigmatyzed with rapes, adulteries, and the like sins, as not onely their own stories testifie of them, but other historians also without exception as <hi>Eusebius, Cyrill, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> against <hi>Appion, Athanasius, Origen, Tertullian, Lactantius,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>But here will be made a question, or objection consisting of 2. parts 1. If their<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> Gods were but men, how came they to be worshipped <hi>Cultu divino</hi> with divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. 2. And secondly, how came Beasts to be worshipped by the Heathen with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> like worship.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To these may be answered. First, that after the flood, there being, a general<note place="margin">Answer.</note> revolt from religion and the true worship of God, except that among the Jews, there was infuced this Maxime into the minds of many, that men were to worship them that did them good, or delivered them from evill.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another cause of divine worship given to men, we have from<note n="*" place="margin">out of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor not now extant, named <hi>Sanchuntathon.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Porphyries</hi> relation, that <hi>Ninus</hi> having obtained the Monarchy, erected an image to the honour and memory of his father <hi>Belus,</hi> and because he would have it no lesse respected by others then by himself, he made it a sanctuary for offendours and debters. So that many having received benefit by it, and withal thinking to ingratiate themselves with<note place="margin">In Iside et Osyride.</note> 
                  <hi>Ninus</hi> (who then bare absolute rule) instituted feasts upon certain dayes to it: at which times they adorned the Image with garlands, and made hymns which they sang to the honour of father and son. Now the ground of this institution being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, they which succeeded in after times became so superstitious in this service, that they made prayers and offered sacrifices to this image, which was the same <hi>Bel,</hi> which in the broader dialect of the Hebrews was called <hi>Baal.</hi> Thus images erected to the memory of mens vertues became to be worshipped, when the cause of their erection was forgotten. And from Prosopopeia's and Apostrophes to the deceased they began to pray to the very images.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For the diefying of Beasts, the answer is this. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, that <hi>Osyris</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King of Egypt, and dividing his kingdom into Provinces, gave a several badge or cognizance to every one, according to the quality and condition of each province, as most natural to the things most abounding in it: as to that which consisted most in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he designed an Ox: to that which was most plentiful in woods, a Dog: to that wherein was most meadow, a Clod with a little grasse on the top, which we call a Turfe: and to that wherein was most water, a Crocodile. These he erected upon poles and placed them between his several provinces. Posterity forgetting to what end these were erected, conceived in them some Divine nature and power: and thereupon, he which lived by the plough worshipped the Ox, calling it <hi>Apis:</hi> the Huntsman the Dog, calling it <hi>Anubis:</hi> the Grasier the Clod, calling it <hi>Isis,</hi> &amp;c. And upon this, this kinde of Idolatry had its original.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59534:37"/>
The next objection is, If they were not Gods, how came some of them to work<note place="margin">Object.</note> Miracles, and give Oracles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is thus answered. That there is difference between true, and false<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> Miracles, the one being profitable to mankinde, as raising the dead to life, and healing incurable diseases, which not they nor their Magicians could ever perform, but onely wrought such as were fictitions and imaginary: and some of them were unprofitable, such as were <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his making a mountain seem to remove: and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Manlius</hi> his cutting a whetstone in two pieces.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the Oracles of the Gentiles, <hi>Porphyrie</hi> saith, that as great things were done by the Magicians of his time, as by those whom they supposed to be gods. Besides the Oracles which they uttered, were ever either ambiguous (being indeed not the Oracles of their Images, but of Devils that spake in them, (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth) or oft times false and frivolous, nay sometime contradicting one another, and might have been as truely conjectured by politick or wise men from the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition or concurrence of causes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And it is a strong argument, to prove that these oracles were uttered by the Devil, in that many of them were cruel and inhumane, tending to the sacrificing of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, whereas if they had been from God, they would have been rather to the preservation, then to the destruction and defacing of Gods image and workmanship. And when they would seem to be more milde, upon deliverance from war or danger, they commanded the institution of <hi>Gladiatores,</hi> sword-fencers, whereupon ensued much bloodshed and murder. And if they were not the cause of cruelty, yet of all kinde of obscenity, for if they enjoyned not the sword-playes alwayes, yet at other times they commanded Stage-playes, the effects whereof Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> describeth at large, whereby men grew to such a height of all lasciviousnesse, that the Romans<note place="margin">de civ. l 4. c 26</note> and Greeks banished them out of their territories, and made a decree, that all Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>players should die <hi>intestate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly it is common in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> and the Philosophers concerning their Gods, that if they named but Styx or Cocytus, they themselves would be afraid and tremble, and all the images would be in a sweat, <hi>jurato per Stygem terrorem Deorum,</hi> having sworn by Styx the terrour of the Gods. Now we know that no Prince is afraid of his own prison. And <hi>Socrates</hi> said, that a man might as well swear by an<note place="margin">In Apolog.</note> Onion or a Leek, as by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and used much to inveigh against the Athenian Gods, affirming them to be none, for which he was convicted: yet <hi>Laertius</hi> reporteth, that not long after his death there happened such a plague, that they never felt the like before or after. And consulting with the Oracle about the cause, they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that it was for putting the Innocent to death. In recompence therefore to <hi>Socrates</hi> they erected an Image, and ascribed divine honours to him that had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured their Gods: thereby condemning themselves, their own Religion, and their Gods. For this cause some of them misliked the Heathen Religion: but not finding a better they would not alter the old. And so much of Paganism.</p>

                  <p>Of Judaisme. The positions of the Jews. 1 That the Messias shall have an earthly kingdom at Jerusalem, confuted. 2. That Jesus is not the Messias. The contrary proved by Jacobs prophecy. Gen. 49. 11. By Daniels seventy two weeks. Dan. 9. 25. By diverse other reasons. 3. That the Messias is not yet come. The contrary proved by sundry arguments.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe second Religion is Judaisme, or the Religion of the Jews. The controversy between whom and us Christians is concerning Christ, whom we professe, and they deny. And because they acknowledge the Old Testament to be Gods word, as well as we, our proofs to maintain our affirmation shall be out of it, and those authors which are in most accompt with them.</p>
               <list>
                  <head>The positions which the Jews hold are these.</head>
                  <item>1. That the <hi>Messias</hi> shall have an earthly kingdom, and that this seat of his court shall be at Jerusalem.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59534:38"/>
2. That Jesus is not that Messias.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Messias is not yet come.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. For the first, if they would give credit to the Caldee paraphrast, and al the antient Rabbins, <hi>as Rabbi Jonathan, Rabbi Simeon, Rabbi Moses, Rabbi Hakedosh,</hi> that lived before the coming of Christ, the controversy would soon be at an end. but they give most credit to their late writers, who were all moved with envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It was foretold by the Prophet, that the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of<note place="margin">Esay. 53. 6. 8.</note> us all. But this they shift off, saying it was meant of the whole people. But in a few verses after, the prophet saith, <hi>Morietur pro populo suo</hi> he shall die for the people. And it were absurd to say, that the people should die for the people; and therefore it must needs be meant of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is said in the psalm. They have pierced my hands and my feet. They part my<note place="margin">Psalm. 22. 18.</note> garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. Which words cannot be understood to be meant of <hi>David,</hi> but of Chrst.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Prophet saith. Rejoyce O Daughter Jerusalem, behold thy king cometh <note place="margin">zach. 9. 9.</note> unto thee meek and humble sitting upon an asse &amp;c. And the prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> saith After 62. weeks, i. e. 70. seavens of yeares, shall Messiah be cut off. This the elder<note place="margin">Daniel 9. 26.</note> Jews could not conceive, and <hi>Philo Judeus</hi> understood it of the sanctification of the High Priest: but he might have easily gathered, that this place was meant of the Massi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,<note place="margin">Math. 11. 3. 2, 7.</note> by <hi>John Baptist</hi> sending two of his disciples to Christ, to know whether he was the Christ or not. But that place of <hi>Daniel</hi> so troubleth the Rabbins, that Rabbi <hi>Moses Ben Nisa</hi> fell into blasphemous speeches, and said that the Prophet was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and overseen.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The prophet <hi>Agge</hi> calleth him the desire or expectation of the Gentiles: but if the Messias should be onely king of the Jews, what desire or expectation could the Gentiles have of him? it being small comfort for a nation to have a stranger<note place="margin">Dent. 17. 15.</note> to rule over them, and indeed it was a thing forbidden the Isralites in the Law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Forasmuch as it cannot be denied, that the Messias should bring felicity to all the world, how can <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the dead be benefited by him, if his kingdom should be upon earth, they being dead many hundred years before? And in putting this off, by saying, that all true Jews shall return to life again, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more absurd then before; for how could that little Land of Judea, or the City of Jerusalem, or the Temple (which they say should be no bigger then it was) be able to contain all the Jews that ever were.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Lastly, they are by (this position) utterly injurious to the soules of the faithful, to call them out of a heavenly paradise Abrahams bosome, to an earthly Paradise.</p>
               <p>Their second erroneous tenet is, That Jesus is not that Messias.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is said in the prophecy of <hi>Jacob.</hi> The Sceptre shall not depart from Judea, nor a Lawgiver from betwixt his feet, untill <hi>Shilo</hi> come. It is certain, that before the captivity it was alwayes in <hi>Judah,</hi> and in the captivity, they had one of their brethren, who was called <hi>Rex captivitatis</hi> the king of Captivity. After the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity it continued, till <hi>Arostobulus</hi> and <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> striving for it, they were both dispossest, and <hi>Herod</hi> an Idumean placed in their room, in whose time Christ came according to the prophecy: and then the Scepter departed quite from <hi>Judah.</hi> The Jews denied Christ their king: and ever since have bin subject to the Scepters of several Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If they object against this prophecy, that the Maccabees were not of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> but of the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> we answer, that we must distinguish of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note> thus, That either a king or a Lawgiver should be of the Tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> and it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly manifest, that there was a Lawgiver in that Tribe till Christ came. For they confesse, that <hi>Simon Justus,</hi> whose <hi>Nune dimittis</hi> we have in our Liturgie, was the last of them, and that ever sincee, the whole company of their Sanedrim was disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the number never made up again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if they understand or conceive that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth not signifie a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but a Tribe, and that it is meant, that <hi>Judah</hi> should be and continue a Tribe till <hi>Shiloh</hi> come, they assent to us Christians: for the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> continued distinct and unconfounded till Christ the true Messias came: so that our Saviour Jesus was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59534:38"/>
known to be of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of the City of Bethleem, and of the posterity of <hi>David.</hi> Nor did the Jews, ever in the Gospel cavil at this: which they would have attempted, had the confusion of this Tribe given them just occasion. But not long after Christs death all the Tribes were confounded. And the Emperours of Rome, after they had heard, that <hi>Ex Judea nasceretur Dominus orbis,</hi> that in Judea the Lord of the world should be born, presently laboured to root out the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and forced them to confound their Genealogies, and upon all miscariages and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of the Jews, slue many thousands of them, and caused the rest to be dispersed into all coasts adjoyning, or to live in miserable slavery in Palestine.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> receiveth an Oracle from God by the Angel, that from the<note place="margin">Deu. 9. 25.</note> time the Oracle was given, there should be seven weeks, and 62. weeks, and one week, in the latter half of which last week Christ the Messias preached, and was slain and put an end to all sacrifices. Now what these weeks are is shewed in the scripture, that they should signifie so many weeks of years, not of dayes, so accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every week for seven years, it makes 49. years: and so many years was the Temple in building: for three years were spent in providing materials and gathering themselves together, and 46. years in building, as the Jews told our Saviour.

And the second Temple had none of these, and yet the prophet saith, that the glory of the Latter should exceed the glory of the former: how this prophecy should hold, they will never shew, unlesse in the time of Christ the Messias, whose presence made it more glorious, then the other things did the former, for we know that 40 years after our Saviours death the Latter Temple was destroyed.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Petrus Galatinus</hi> saith, that the disciples of <hi>Rabbi Hillel</hi> considering these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, (though they lived 50 years before Christs time) hoped the Messiah should be born in the age that they lived, being induced thereunto, by the saying of <hi>Esay</hi> in the person of the Lord; I the Lord will hasten it.

But it is observed (and certainly it was because of Gods wrath against the Jews) that in the greatest distresse of the Romans for want of water, upon a sudden the little brook Silo (which for many years had been so dry, as that men passed over it on foot) did so swell and rise with water, without any natural cause, that it served abundantly for <hi>Vespasians</hi> whole army.</p>
               <p>And to afflict the Jews the more, the Lord sent such a plague into the City, that (besides many thousands slain in the siege) they wanted ground within the wals to bury their dead, and were forced to cast them over: and such a famine, that they were compelled to eat their own children.</p>

The Jews being urged to tell of whom the prophet meant this, (having no other shift) say, that it was spoken concerning <hi>Joseph,</hi> who was sold by the Patriarchs for silver. But this prophecy was never more fully accomplished, then in our Saviour the true Messiah, &amp; in themselves, concerning the vengeance. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore suffered they that misery before mentioned and never since have been released, but scattered over the world almost these 1600 years; hated of all nations, and become little better then bondslaves, forsaken and scorned by all, insomuch that whereas thy were wont to hire Rabbins to teach them, the Rabbins are now forced to hire the Jews to be their Auditors.</p>

                  </gap> position or tenet of the Jews is, that the Messias is not yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> come.</p>
               <p>To answer them in this point (besides some of the arguments against their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond errour which fit this also) 1. It is said by the prophet, but thou Bethleem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee, shall<note place="margin">Nica. 5. 2.</note> he come sorth to me, that is to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting. This hath been, and is confessed by all, to be a plaine prophecy of the birth of the Messias in Bethleem. And now there is no such place as Bethleem, nor any memorial, where it stood: which shews plainly, that it could be prophecied of none but Jesus, who was born there, and that he is the Messias. In which respect they are put to their shifts to make this answer. That he was born there before the destruction of the second Temple, but hath ever since layen obscure insome place, God knows where, for they know not: but he wil at length manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

3. Since which time there arose one, that took upon him to gather together again, the dispersed Jews, who called himself <hi>Moses Cretensis:</hi> this man to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self great in their opinions, would take upon him to divide the sea, and with four hundred of his fellows would go through it dry-shod: but he and they were all miserably drowned, their friends, that stood upon the shore to see the event, being not able to save one of them.</p>

The time which some of them allotted to it was twelve hundred years, some thirteen hundred and ninetie, some more, some lesse. Some of them affirming, that the world should continue but six thousand years, which they thus apportioned. Two thousand yeers before the Law, two thousand years under the Law to Christs time, and two thousand years after Christ, under grace: of which are past above five thousand five hundred and seventy years already, and therefore the expectation of their Christ is now vain, and so is their Religion. So that now they are so ashamed of their former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and calculations, by failing of and in them so grossely, that they forbid all men to make any more, and that on pain of death. Thus are they given up and led <hi>spiritu vertiginis,</hi> so that though their eyes be open, yet they will not see, and their hearts are hardened, that they will not understand, as was<note place="margin">Esa. 44. 18.</note> prophecied of them long since.</p>

But it is a great wonder that the Astronomers at that time missed her not from heaven: seeing they have noted the very least Eclypse: but indeed it was a private miracle between them two: and a man of mean understanding would conceive it impossible, that so great a body should come into a little pair of sleeves.</item>

               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, concerning this religion, we have a more sure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, &amp;c. that is, we are certain and assured, that the Scriptures are true, and so were<note place="margin">2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And though there be but a small portion of them immediately from God, yet the rest which were delivered by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of Man, were inspired into them that left them to us, by the spirit of God, and therefore we must hold them as infallible truthes. And that the Scriptures and Christianity are so, is to be proved by four arguments, 1. from the antiquity of them, 2. from the continuance and preservation of them, 3. from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59534:40"/>
the certainty of them. 4. From the end whereto they tend, for we are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> both the word of God and Christian religion in all the arguments subsequent, except some few.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the Antiquity, we say, that seeing that a man is to come to God by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> some way or means, and that (as we have seen) religion is the onely way: it must necessarily follow, that this way is as ancient as man himself; else man should have been sometime without a way to come to his Creator, if at any time he had been without religion; and so consequently have been frustrate of the end of his creation. For <hi>religio est copula relationis,</hi> religion is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of relation between God and Man, the Creator and the Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>quod primum, id verum,</hi> that which is first, is true, and this<note place="margin">De <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> maxime holdeth as well in Religion, as in other things. For the Philosophers say, <hi>Prima entia sunt maxime vera,</hi> the first essence are most real and true. Because that as the ttuth is an affection of that, that is, so falsehood is an affection of that which is not: for falsehood cannot <hi>consistere in suo, sed in alieno,</hi> consist in any thing which is its own, but from another. Therefore falsehood must be after truth. But the Christians religion is in some sort included in that which the Jews had before Christ, so that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Law may be called the Old Gospel, and the Gospel the new Law. In the Law is <hi>Evangelium absconditum,</hi> the Gospel under a vail: in the Gospel is, <hi>Lex revelata,</hi> the revealed Law. So that the Jews agreed with us till the coming of Christ, and then left us.</p>
               <p>As for the Heathen Religion, part of their stories, which are the records there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is fabulous and part true.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That part which is fabulous began with their gods, and their original: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then that they cannot go. And <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> write not of them till after the Trojan war, and lived after the time of <hi>Moses</hi> above eight hundred yeers, and almost three thousand yeers after the Chronology of the Bible began, which is testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by divers of their own writers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if their fabulous part come short of our religion for Antiquity, then much shorter must that part needs be which is true. For <hi>Varro</hi> (who lived not above fifty years before our Saviours time) saith, that the true Story of the Heathen could not be derived above 700 yeers before his time. And it is sure that the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent records of theirs which are true, began with the seven wise men of Greece, of whom <hi>Solon</hi> was the chief and most ancient: and he was contemporary with <hi>Croesus,</hi> he with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Esdras</hi> with him. Now <hi>Esdras</hi> was one of the last Canonical wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the old Testament. So that we may safely conclude this against the Heathen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that almost the whole story of the Bible was written, before any authentique writer or record was extant of the Heathen story: and most part of it was written before the fabulous part of it was delivered to them in writing.</p>
               <p>Their ancientest Historiographer is <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who beginneth his story with the acts of <hi>Croesus.</hi> By all which we may plainly perceive, that Christian Religion is of farre greater antiquity then the Heathen. This also we may adde, that whatsoever is either good or true in their Religion was had from the Jewes. For the Druides among the Gauls, and the Bardi (an offspring of them) derive all theirs from the Greeks, as also the Romans, and the Greeks, from <hi>Cecrops</hi> an Egyptian, as also the Carthaginians from <hi>Cadmus</hi> a Phoenician. Now Phoenicia bordereth northward upon Jury, and Egypt southward. So that all that was good in the Heathen Religion must be derived from the Jews.</p>
               <p>The wise men of Greece enquiring of their Oracles, how they might get wisdom, and from whence the knowledge of arts was to be had, received this answer, that it was to be had from the Chaldees. <hi>Solus utique Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus sapiens,</hi> the Chaldean was truely the onely wise man. Which speech in the Greek idiotisme denoteth some particular part of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, which was the Jews. For <hi>Abraham</hi> coming from Chaldea, was reputed a Chaldean, and the Jewes from him, were termed Chaldeans.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orpheus</hi> also the Poet saith, that when God (being angry with mankinde) had destroyed all, he revealed all knowledge and wisdom <hi>uni Chaldeo',</hi> to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59534:41"/>
one Chaldean onely. And <hi>Plato</hi> in his Epimenides referred all learning <hi>uni Barbaro.</hi> If we enquire who by this <hi>Chaldeus</hi> or <hi>Barbarus</hi> was meant, the Egyptians tell us, by calling him <hi>Theut,</hi> which in the Chaldee language signifies a stranger, which in all probability must be applied to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was by God called out of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> (out of <hi>Manetho</hi>) testifies, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was had in such reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in those parts, that their chiefest Exorcisms were wont to be <hi>per deum Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> by the god <hi>Abraham.</hi> And the same <hi>Manetho</hi> alledgeth, that in many places of those countreys, in their Temples, and elswhere, his name was written, and engraven for memory of him.</p>
               <p>Again the verses of <hi>Phocylides</hi> the Poet (who lived in the fifty ninth Olympiad) seem to be translated <hi>verbatim</hi> out of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and may be particularly pointed at, in Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Exodus.</p>
               <p>But to examine their own records, <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith that <hi>Solon</hi> fetched all his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the Egyptians, and <hi>Plato</hi> his from Chaldea. <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had daily conference in Mount Carmel, and that in that mount were <hi>ambulachra Pythagorea, Pythagoras</hi> walks, and there be some of the Heathen that report him<note place="margin">Lib. 16.</note> to be circumcised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, (out of one <hi>Clearchas</hi> a Peripatetick) that though <hi>Aristotle</hi> were<note place="margin">Lib. 4 de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par Evang.</note> never in Egypt, yet he daily conser'd with an Egyptian or a Jew. And <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> (that was Librarie keeper of <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</hi> in Egypt) told him, that he heard the Disciples of <hi>Aristotle</hi> say, that divers Philosophers and Poets had attempted to translate the Old Testament into Greek. And in the same book, in the Epistle of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> it is said, that part thereof was translated before the Persian Empire began, long before it was translated by the Septuagint, or seventy men. But it appeareth, that it hath pleased God in a most strange manner to leave some Register or Chronicle in every famous Nation of it: as among the Egyptians, <hi>Manetho: Sanchoniathon</hi> among the Phoenicians: <hi>Berosus</hi> among the Chaldeans: In Asia Minor, <hi>Rabbi Abidelus:</hi> among the Persians <hi>Megasthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Herodotus</hi> we shall finde the storie of <hi>Sennacherib:</hi> the edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and almost the whole prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> though somewhat cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note>

               <p>It is storied by <hi>Josephus,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> being to travail towards Persia, and hearing that the Jews denyed to pay him tribute, and for some other affronts, (as he conceived) came towards Jerusalem, with purpose utterly to destroy the Jews. Whereupon <hi>Jaddua</hi> the High Priest in his rich and white ornaments, accompanied with other Priests, met him in the way.

                  </hi> Prophecy concerning his Monarchy, he gave large priviledges to the Jews, and dismissed them honourably.</p>
               <p>After his dayes by the means of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> in requital of the Interpreters pains taken in translating the Bible, the Jews Religion was much propagated. <hi>Laertius</hi> in the life of <hi>Epimenides</hi> saith, that the Athenians consulting with the Oracle, concerning the cause of a great plague among them, were answered, that they were not to sacrifice to their own gods (as in the Acts) but to another which was above<note place="margin">Acts 17. 23.</note> theirs, and had sent this plague among them: and withal that they must appease him by Sacrifice. But the plague neverthelesse continuing, they sent again to know, where they should sacrifice: the answer was, they should let the beasts go volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and where they staid they should sacrifice. The horses hereupon were turned loose with sacrifices upon their backs, and they stayed in the street of <hi>Mars,</hi> in a fair broad place, where they built an Altar, and dedicated it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God. The like is in the Roman story.</p>
               <p>The Romans in memory of a victory obtained of their enemies, erected a Temple to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> calling it <hi>Templum pacis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> the everlasting Temple of peace. And afterwards consulting with their Oracle, how long it should continue, received this answer, <hi>Donec peperit virgo,</hi> while a virgin should bring forth a child, which because
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59534:41"/>
they conceived would never be, they called it <hi>eternum.</hi> But at the time when Christ was born, in the shutting up of an evening the Temple fell to the ground of it self.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the Antiquity of Christian religion, and consequently for the truth of it, according to the Maxime of Philosophers. <hi>Quod primum, id verum</hi> that is true, which was first.</p>
               <p>The second way to prove, that Christianity is the true Religion, is the Continuance, and preservation of the scriptures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that Religion, is grounded.</p>
               <p>And this is so miraculous, as that no Religion devised or framed by Man, or any false God cannot shew the like. For it is plain, that the Jews were more under subjection to other kingdoms, and oftner in Captivity and bondage, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation in the world. As under the Egyptians, Philistins, Moabits, Amorits, Assyrians, Persians, Graecians, Romans, &amp;c. And yet, though all the Nations about them bare them deadly hatred, and sought to suppresse their Religion, and that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus</hi> the Great bent himself wholly to abolish the Copies of the Law, yet were they so wonderfully preserved, that they perished not. We see, that the works of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, Lawyers, Physitians, and the like who were accompted excellent in their professions, which were highly esteemed, and for preservation whereof, all means have been vsed, yet many of them have been lost, many come into the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and many very corrupt: yet on the other side, though the Jews were a people very odious and contemptible to other nations, and though much labour hath been to suppresse their Law; yet it stands firme and uncorrupt, withont addition or diminution, whole and perfect, notwithstanding all the worlds malice. And as of the Bible, so may it be said of their Religion, though they were transported into other Countries, and in Captivity to strange nations, they never changed it, whereas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught us, that with changing countryes, people commonly, or many times change their Religion.</p>
               <p>The third proof is, the Certainty of our Religion. Whereas all other Religions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are either 1. unperfect. 2. full of Contradictions. 3. Counterfeit. 4. or Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, And none of these can be attributed to ours, and therefore it is the true Religion,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It is most sure, that what Religion soever hath his original from Man, growes by little and little, by degrees, to that which they call perfection: But at the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Law of God, all that was necessary for the Church before Christ was delivered most absolutely by <hi>Moses,</hi> all the duties towards God or man required in that state of the church, being contained in his books, and to which nothing is or could be added, or detracted from it, and in the decalogue is the sum of all moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for all may be reduced to some of those heads.</item>
                  <item>2. For Contradiction, Mans Laws (as the Apostle speaks) are sealed with Yea<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 19. 20.</note> and Nay; but the Law of God, with Yea and Amen And the Fathers prove, that all Contradictions which seem to be in the scriptures, may be reconciled by the several Rules of contradictions in Logique.</item>
                  <item>3. That theirs are Counterfet may appear by this, that the best of their Authors have obscured their works, and kept them from the view of as many as they could, for fear of discovery of their falsities: and the best of their works, have been corrupt in some points, and gone abroad into the world, under the name of false Authors, and sometime those which have been supposititious or counterfeit have so neerly resembled the stile of the Authors, whom they have so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</hi> the end of true Religion is Gods honour, and professeth, that as God is the author of all essence, so also of all good, therefore all honour is to be given to him, none else must share with him init. But so doth no other Religion but the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, all other seek mans honour, either in whole, or in part.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Poets and Philosophers have much stood upon the natural power and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of mans free-will, and given him his <hi>igniculos &amp; semina naturae,</hi> sparks and seeds of nature, and thereby make him authour of his own perfection by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and encreasing what nature hath bestowed on him. But our Religion acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing good to be mans, but that all good comes from God, and must be referred to him. Again, in God there must be an vnity, therfore that Religion is false, that acknowledgeth any more Gods then one. And one of their own saith, that <hi>Moses</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diod Sie.</note> went out of Egypt meerly, because he would worship but one God. The Turks, though they seem to hold that there is but one God in Essence, yet when it cometh to this point, that there is but one God that doth good, then they will have their Mediators to that God, and so consequently many Gods: but we have but one Mediator.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now because we hold, that there is an innate and natural darknesse in every unregenerate man, therefore it cannot be, but that in the Religion prescribed by man, something that is good is not commanded, and something that is evill is not prohibited, and but that some lawful things are omitted, and some unlawful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: which we see plainly among the Athenians: for with them, the breach of faith was of so small account, that <hi>Graeca fides</hi> the Greek faith grew into a proverb. So likewise by that of <hi>Spartaneum furtum</hi> the Lacedemonians theft, we may gather the little regard they had to punish that sinne. And so likwise by the Lupercalia, Floralia, and Bacchanalia among the Romans, what liberty they took in wantonnesse and excesse, may easily appeare. No Nation of the Gentiles observed the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, or indeed any of the Commandments entirely; nay they were so far from keeping that of <hi>Neconcupisces,</hi> as that they thought Concupiscence no sinne: and for the rest, though they had some particular Laws respectively against the breach of some commandment, as against adultery, incest, and the like, yet they dispensed<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> with them, as persons, time, and place, ministred occasion to them. Which we may see in the story of a King of Persia, who being desirous to marry his own sister, and knowing that there was a Law against incest, brake his minde to the Magi, desiring their opinions: they told him, that though there were such a Law, yet there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the King might do what he would. Whereas our Religion is so far from dispensing either with that, or other the Laws of God, that the saints of God had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer death, then them to be broken; as in the case of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who told King <hi>Herod, Tibinon licet</hi> it is not lawfull for thee to have thy brothers wife, though<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 4</note> it cost him his head for saying so.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another argument to prove the truth of our Religion is, that both it, and the Scriptures by which we are guided, go to the heart, whereas other Religions pierce not the skinne. These stop the streames, theirs make the Lusts of the flesh, but affections, <hi>Adiaphora</hi> indifferent things to be avoyded or not, ours, by prohibiting Concupiscence, stop the fountain of all sinnes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, it is a necessary consequence, that, that which cannot come from man, comes from God. But there are some things in Scriptures which are truly Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall, and exceed the capacity of man, as that <hi>Jehovah Elohim</hi> is one God and three persons, trinity in vnity, that God should become man: that God should take upon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59534:42"/>
him to be the redeemer of Mankind, and that by his stripes and suffering punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment man should be healed: that God should create a world, and out of that, gather a Church to himself. These things and more cannot be comprehended by man, and are not to be conceived but onely by our Religion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Not to conceale the faults of a mans parents or friends, or to speake against a mans own countrey, stock, kinred, or his own self, is a thing altogether unnatural, and cannot come into any, but by a supernatural power. But we see, that <hi>Moses,</hi> when no necessity compelled him, spared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ot his own stock, but spake against his brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> for making the Golden Calfe, nor his sister <hi>Miriam</hi> in the case of murmuring, no, nor his own selfe at the waters of strife, and committed the same to writing, that Posterity should take notice of these things: Yea, and dispossessed his own children from succeeding him in the Magistracy, constituting <hi>Josuah</hi> in their stead: these acts cannot agree with the natural man, but must needs proceed from a higher cause: therefore the writers of these Scriptures, must of necessity be inspired by God himself.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whereas the whole scope of Philosophers, and of the Law makers among the Heathen was, to teach how Princes might enlarge their territories, and taught it as a point of wisdom, to win by all means the favour of princes, and great men; this Religion teacheth contempt of life, the world and worldly honours in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God: and such was the practize of the prophets, who were so far from seeking. the favour of Princes, that they reproved them to their faces, when Gods cause was in hand. Therefore this Religion is spiritual, and proceeds; not from man.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Again, we know that as God is a spirit, so must his worship be spiritual and this is the scope of the Scriptures, that God be honored without Images or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. And though in the vnity of God, that there is but one God to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, false Religion may agree with the true, yet in this point it doth not, their Religion and the worship thereof being onely corporeal, not spiritual. For though in the Old Testament there be many Ceremonial worships prescribed, yet God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth<note place="margin">Esa. 1.</note> them all, yea he abhorreth them, if they be performed without the inward<note place="margin">Psalm. 51. 17.</note> worship; and sets down the way of worship, wherein he most delighteth, namely in a broken and contrite heart and spirit. Therefore as man is bodily, and his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fall within the compasse of the Body, so is that worship, which comes from him, bodily, whereas Gods worship is spiritual, and not corporal onely.</p>

And none of theirs, either <hi>Homer, Plato,</hi> or any of them can say, as Saint <hi>John</hi> said, That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled. For they had theirs from others, and but upon bare report. Besides, neither any of their ancient or latter Historians, though they hated the writers of the Scriptures, durst at any time offer to set pen to paper against them.</item>
                  <item>2. For the honesty of our witnesses, there can be no better reason or proof given, then that which <hi>Tacitus</hi> giveth to confirme the testimony of an honest witnesse, which is, <hi>Quibus nullum est mendacii <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <item>3. For the credit of the Story itself. We know, that the Sybils oracles were in so great credit among the Heathen, that they were generally beleeved. Now, if they be true, which we have of them, as ther's no question but many of them are, (divers of which we refer to Christ, being mentioned in their own writers, Virgil, Cicero and<note place="margin">1 John. 1. 1.</note> others.) it will follow, that nothing can make more in their esteeme, for the credit and truth of the Nativity, life and death of Christ, then their Oracles, for we may see almost every circumstance in them. And by reading their verses divers of their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men were converted to Christianity, as <hi>Marcellinus Secundanus</hi> and others.</item>

The Augur's being likewise questioned about this appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their answer was, that he was then born, whom <hi>Angustus,</hi> the people, and the whole world should worship: whereupon (as it is storied) <hi>Augustus</hi> at the next meeting of the Senate, gave over his title of <hi>dominus orbis terrarum</hi> Lord of the whole world, and would be so stiled no more.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

But the Senate refused, because <hi>Pilate</hi> had written to <hi>Tiberius</hi> and not to them. A cheife man in this opposition was <hi>Sejanus,</hi> who afterward came to a miserable end.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The next, and none of the least general arguments to prove the truth of Christian Religion, is the progresse of it. For whereas nature and reason teach us, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59534:44"/>
in every action fit Instruments must be had, and used, or else the action will prove defective and vain: and that the matter must be well fitted and disposed before we can work it: in this case there were neither. For in the eye of man, there could be no unfitter instruments then the Apostles, they being rude, unlearned, and most of them Mechanique Men: And for the matter to work upon, they had it altogether unprepared, nay clean against them. For the Jewes, continued the hatred to the Disciples, which they had born to the Master, continually persecuting them. And the most learned among the Gentiles, were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est opposite to that which they endeavoured (namely the propagation of the Gospel) as might be: as,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vlpian</hi> the greatest Lawyer, who wrote many books against it and the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Galen</hi> the greatest Physician, <hi>Plotinus</hi> the greatest Platonist, <hi>Porphyrius</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Aristotelian, <hi>Libanius</hi> a great writer in the Greek tongue, <hi>Lucian</hi> a great scoffer, and <hi>Julian</hi> the great Sorcerer, who not onely made Dialogues between <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to breed hatred and contempt against Christianity, but (being Emperour) bent all his force against it, prohibiting Christian schools, &amp;c. Besides, if we consider the ten bloody Persecutions, wherein many thousands of Martyrs suffered, and that in most horrid and barbarous manner, and kindes. To which if we adde (which was touched before) the unaptnesse of the instruments, and the matter (the World) so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, ill disposed, and harsh to work upon, and yet to have the work effected, it cannot but be confessed, that Christianity is the true Religion, and that <hi>magna est veritas, &amp; praevalet,</hi> great is the truth, and prevaileth.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In the next place, if we consider how averse and unpleasing to flesh and blood the precepts of this Religion are, we must confesse the premises to be true. For they give us not leave to be Libertines, or licentious and carnal, as the Religion of the Turk, of which we spake before. For instead of taking revenge of our enemies for injuries done unto us, we are bound by them to love our enemies, and to speak good of them that persecute us. Instead of committing folly with a Woman, we must not so much as cast our eye upon a woman, to lust after her, there is not the least thought<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 28.</note> left at our pleasure. <hi>Non concupisces.</hi> Instead of covetous heaping up of riches, we must leave all for the truths sake.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The promises contained in the Scriptures to them that shall observe this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are not of the nature of those in the Religion of the Epicures and Turks, &amp;c. that is, honour, preferment, wealth, pleasure in this World, and the like; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 17.</note> as, They shall whip and scourge you; they shall binde and leade you whither<note place="margin">Mark 13. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But this a man would think were not the way for <hi>sequimini me,</hi> follow me, but <hi>discedite a me,</hi> depart from me; rather a deterring and disheartning, then any manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading. And in this there is a great resemblance between the Creation and the Regeneration. In the first, something was made of nothing, and here nothing to confound something, that we may plainly see and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that it is <hi>digitus Dei, qui hic operatur,</hi> the finger of God that bringeth this to passe, that strength should be confounded by weaknesse, something by nothing. Therefore this Religion cannot be but Divine.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Again, if we consider the times when <hi>Mahomet</hi> began to broach his forged Religion, we shall finde it to be in a dissolute time, a time of idlenesse and ignorance, when <hi>Heraclius</hi> and <hi>Constans</hi> ruled the Empire, the first being an incestuous Prince, one that married his brothers daughter, and exasperated the Saracens, in denying them pay in his wars: the other being a Monothelite, and bloody, having murthered his brother, both of them giving opportunity to the Saracens, not onely to enlarge their territories, but to propagate their Religion. And if we shall observe the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical story well, we shall finde that Age very much destitute of learned and pious men. Whereas on the contrary, when Christianity began and prevailed, the world was never so full of eyes, never so many learned men, as the Scribes and Pharisees, the Greek Philosophers, &amp;c. yet it pleased God to work upon the hearts of many of them, in converting them to it; as upon <hi>Paulinus, Clemens, Origen, Augustine, Ambrose,</hi> and others, especially many of the Jewish Priests before these. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 7.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And indeed Conversions are a great argument of the truth of Religion. The most memorable whereof we see in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a zealous Pharisee, who not only had a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59534:44"/>
warrant from the Counsel at Jerusalem to apprehend and imprison all sorts of people addicted to Christianity, but was a principal actor in the martyrdom of Saint <hi>Stephen.</hi> And yet he (neglecting the preferment he was like to come to, by this his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) was content upon a sudden, to expose himself to all dangers and disgrace, to whippings, perils by sea and land, &amp;c. and to embrace this, as the true Religion. And if any say, he aimed at honour and esteem among Christians, his practice shews the contrary: for when the men of <hi>Lyaconia</hi> would have sacrificed to him and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> with great zeal he opposed it, they rent their clothes and ran in amongst them, and told them, they were men like themselves, so far were they from vain glory.</p>
               <p>Insomuch as <hi>Porphyrius</hi> said of him, that it was great pity, that so great a Scholar, and so near to preferment, should have been converted to Christianity. The like may<note place="margin">Hier.</note> be said of <hi>Origen</hi> after him, the fairest for preferment of any in his time, who being scholar to <hi>Ammonius,</hi> and preferred by him before <hi>Plotinus</hi> (afterward loaded with honours in the Common-wealth) yet he was content to leave all, and to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a poor Catechists place in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he was every minute in danger of his life. Never in any other Religion appeared the like examples of life and manners, as in those of the Christian Religion, as of fasting, abstinence, continence, justice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, fortitude, and other holy vertues; insomuch as <hi>Plotinus</hi> (an unpartial wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) admiring their fortitudes said of them, <hi>Soli Christiani mortis contemptores,</hi> Christians are the only despisers of death.</p>
               <p n="17">17. It was an objection of the Jews we know, that our Saviour wrought his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Aug.</note> 
                  <hi>malis artibus,</hi> that he cast out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> But the heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Longinus</hi> was of another belief. For, saith he, They say that your Saviour wrought his miracles by the skill he learnt in magick while he was in Egypt, but I hardly believe it. For I reason thus with my self: If he were a Magician, and wrought by inferiour spirits, he could not <hi>triumphare de diis,</hi> triumph over the gods. And we may reason thus with ourselves, that if he and his followers wrought this way, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have commanded such austerity of manners and life, and forbid all such unlawful means. But sure it is, that the Christians of the Primitive Church were of such inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent life, that <hi>Pliny</hi> the second testifies to the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> that there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more innocent people then they: and gave him counsel, that if any of them were accused for Christianity he should enquire after them, because it was contrary to the laws of the Empire, otherwise, that he should forbear to trouble them, if there were no accuser.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The next general reason to prove the truth of Christianity is, the constancy of those that suffered for it: not onely of men able, and of strength to endure misery, but of old and feeble men, weak and frail women and young children: and that in so ambitious a manner, as that they conceived they could attain to no greater honour, then to receive the Crown of Martyrdom in defence of it. As we may see in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the woman with the childe in her armes, that crossed the Pro-Consuls horse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily, and being asked the reason, answered, lest she should come too late to suffer with the other Christians, whose names he had in his bill to be put to death, for I also (said she) am a Christian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath an excellent passage concerning this constancy of Christians: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">In Apolog.</note> (saith he) teacheth every man to be touched with shame or fear for the evil he committeth, and therefore malefactors desire to hide themselves, to shun discovery, trembling for fear of apprehension: Being taken and accused, they deny the fact, and confesse not easily though tortured. They lament when they are condemned, and rage against themselves, imputing it to the malignity of fate, or their stars, and renounce the fact, as knowing it to be evil. But Christians do not so, none of them is asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, none of them repenteth, but in that he was a Christian no sooner. If any man take notice that he is so, he glorieth: if he be accused and interrogated, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confesseth freely and voluntarily; being condemned, he is thankful. What evil is in all this? What, is it evil that he hath no shame, fear, denyal, repentance, or lamentation? What evil is it when the guilty person rejoyceth? whose glory it is to be accused, and whose punishment is his happinesse, &amp;c. Now there is no sect of the Philosophers, but one Edict commanding it to be left upon pain of death would dash it, as it did in the case of <hi>Pyrrho</hi> and his fellowes: but no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict could, or hath ever Glenced this Religion: No <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, either by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59534:45"/>
pen or sword could ever suppresse it, but the Christians ever tired and made their persecutors weary.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Another argument is, the horrid end of the opposers of Christianity. For all the opposers and persecutors of Christians, from and before the first persecution un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Claudius,</hi> to the tenth under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and all the Emperours that signed the Edicts against Christians, came to fearful, miserable, and untimely ends, except onely <hi>Libanius</hi> the Philosopher, that was converted to Christianity by S. <hi>Basil.</hi> As <hi>Herod,</hi> eaten with lice, <hi>Judas</hi> hanged himself, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> died in exile, <hi>Sejanus</hi> had a traytors death, &amp;c. So that one (alluding to the bad successe of persecutors) said to an Emperor, <hi>Parce nobis, si non nobis, pace tibi, si non tibi, Carthagini.</hi> Spare us, if not us, yet thy self, if not thy self, yet be good to Carthage.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The Devils testimony against himself may be another argument. For it is a maxime in Law, that how ill soever the witnesse be disposed, yet his testimony is to be taken, <hi>cum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And <hi>Zozomen</hi> hath a story, that <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostata being at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, and desirous to know why the Oracle at <hi>Daphnes</hi> in the suburbs of that City had not given answer as formerly it had done, went thither, and having offered his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the Oracle, or the Devil rather in it, answered, that he could not satisfie his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, till the body or tomb of <hi>Babylas</hi> the martyr were removed, so hard a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was for the Devil to do any thing there, where the bones and ashes of a poor Christian lay. And <hi>Tertul</hi> challengedthe Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> (who raised the fifth perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution against the Christians) concerning his religion, saying, Suffer me to come into your Temple, and have conference with any of the spirits in the images there, and if I or any Christian force it not to confesse as much as the foul spirit in the Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, and to come out of the image, let your religion prevail, and ours take the foil. And surely the Emperour had taken that large offer, had he not feared the event.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Lastly, <hi>Plotinus</hi> confesseth, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> report, that <hi>Apollonius Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aneus,</hi> and other of the Heathen, attempting to raise the images of <hi>Jupiter, Mars, &amp;c.</hi> and effected it: but they all confest, that endeavouring to raise the image of Christ, they and their spirits were forced away with confusion. This also (to close up this point) may be added: that their gods were afraid of <hi>Styx,</hi> but now we have found him before whom <hi>Styx</hi> itself, and all the powers of Hell do fear and tremble.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the two chief parties that lay claim to Christian Religion, Papists and Protestants. Their difference about interpretation of Scriptures. The Churches authority in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scriptures. An additional observation out of the Authors other workes. Rules about the sense of the Scriptures. Means for finding out the true sense: other means controverted. Addition about the Churches power in matters of faith, whether infallible. Decrees of Councels, Consent of Fathers. The Pope not infallible.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANd now having found out the true way, and being thus far entred into it, we are come where it is divided into two. For there are two sorts of Christians that lay claim to the true way, and each party pleads possession of it, each thinking the other to tread in a by-path, and to be out of the right way. We will therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, which of the two are in the right.</p>
               <p>Christian Religion, as it now stands in these parts of the World, consists of Papists and Protestants. It will not be amisse therefore, because the Papists build upon the Word of GOD as do the Protestant, to examine the main point between them in difference, which is about the interpretation of it: and to whom this interpretation belongeth properly.</p>
               <p>Hear what the sense of this reverend Authour was in his latter years, concerning<note place="margin">Addition 1.</note> points that are manifest, and matters controverted, in his sermon on <hi>1 Timothy 3. 16. page 18, 19.</hi>

                  <q>Blessed be God that among diverse other mysteries, about which there are so many mysts and clouds of controversy raised in all ages, hath yet left us some clear, and without controversy, manifest and yet great, great and yet manifest: a false conceit is crept into the mindes of men to think the points of religion that be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,

to be certain petty points, scarce worth the learning. It is not so. Those that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary he hath made plain, those that are not plain, not necessary. This were a mystery, yea a great one, (Religion hath no greater) yet manifest, and <hi>in confesso</hi> with all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. A way of peace there shall be whereof all parties shall agree, even in the midst of a world of controversies. That there need not such ado in complaining, if men did not delight rather to be treading mazes, then to walk in the wayes of peace; for even still such a way there is, which lieth fair enough, and would lead us sure enough to salvation, if leaving those other rough labyrinths we would be but shod with the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the gospel of peace. Yea further the Apostle doth allure us, that if where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are come, and wherein we all agree, we would constantly proceed by the rule, those things wherein we be otherwise minded, even them would God reveal to us. <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> 6. 15. that is, he makes no controversy, but controversy would cease, If conscience were made of practise of that which is out of controversy.</q>

               </p>
               <p>The Papitts hold that the Scriptures are to be interpreted by one of these four wayes. 1. Either by the Fathers. 2. Or Councels. 3. Or the Church. 4. Or the Pope, whom they call the chief Father of the Church. Concerning which we do partly agree, and partly differ from them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We hold that there is a certain and infallible rule, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a man may relye, else we may begin to build, but not upon a Rock, and then our building will be subject to be overthrown and beaten down with every blast of false doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Scriptures (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us) not being of any private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> we are to beware that every man interpret it not after his own fancy, because (as the same Apostle speaks elsewhere of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> epistles) some things<note place="margin">3. 19.</note> are hard in them to be understood, which they which are unlearned and unstable may wrest, which ought not to be: but we are (as <hi>Hilary</hi> saith) <hi>referre sensum Scripturis, non auferre,</hi> to give to the Scripture its proper sence, not take it away, or devise one for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We hold, that God hath given the gift of interpretation to some (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirms) and they are such to whom God (as he saith) hath revealed it by his<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 10.</note> Spirit; that is, a naturall man cannot interpret them aright; nor yet the vulgar or<note place="margin">12. 10. 14.</note> common sort, whom (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) <hi>non vivacitas intelligendi, sed sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitas credendi salvos reddit,</hi> rather their simplicity in beleeving, then vivacity or quicknesse of apprehension and understanding bringeth to salvat on. And if the Eunuch a man of great place, were not able to interpret without Saint <hi>Philip,</hi> much lesse the vulgar sort.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Now forasmuch as God (according to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) divides his gifts <hi>singulis prout vult,</hi> to every one according to his good pleasure, it were hard to restrain it to<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Now the means to finde out the true sense of the Scriptures are many, but may be reduced to six.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Some means there are wherein all agree, as namely, there is, <hi>pietas &amp; diligentia adhibenda,</hi> goodnesse and diligence must be used. And in the first place, Prayer. <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> saith, <hi>Oratio postulet, lectio inquirat, meditatio inveniat, contemplatio degustet &amp; digerat,</hi> let us ask by prayer, seek by reading, finde out by meditation, tast and digest it by contemplation.</item>
                  <item>2. The second means is by conference of places. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that the<note place="margin">de doct. Christ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 8.</note> lesse plain place in Scriptures, is to be referred to that which is more plain, and the lesse in number to the more in number.</item>
                  <item>3. The third seemeth to be according to the counsel of the holy Ghost, <hi>Inspectu fontium,</hi> the better to discern the signification of the words to consult with the Original tongue; with the Hebrew for the Old Testament, and with the Greek for the New.</item>
                  <item>4. To be acquainted with the phrase of the holy Ghost, and this is to be gotten<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 10.</note> by the knowledge of the Dialect, Idiome or Stile of the holy Spirit, as the Apostle speaks, by use to discerne it, as the crucifying of the flesh, mortifying the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, &amp;c. for sometimes the holy Ghost in Greek, sends us to the holy Ghost in Hebrew. And these three last are for understanding of words, the two next are for understanding of sentences and chapters.</item>
                  <item>5. The first is that which the fathers call <hi>Oculus ad scopum,</hi> to have an eye to the<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> intent: as what was the intent of giving the law, in setting down such a prophecy, doing such a miracle, and the like: as Saint <hi>Paul to Timothie</hi> reasoneth from the end of the law, against those that made evil use of the law. So saith <hi>Hilary, Ex causis dicendi, habemus intelligentiam Doctorum,</hi> we finde out the meaning of the learned, by finding out the cause why a thing was spoken.</item>
                  <item>6. The last is that which the wise men among the Jewes say, we must look round about us, behinde and before us, that is, we must well weigh the Antecedents, and Consequents, and every Circumstance, to understand any sentence and chapters, whereof we doubt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To these may be added those of <hi>Ireneus</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> That every one of these<note place="margin">l 2 c 45. 47.</note> rules serve not for every thing, but to diverse things, diverse wayes and means may<note place="margin">de doct. Christ. l 2.</note> be applyed for the true understanding of words and sentences in the Scripture. And therefore <hi>Stapleton</hi> committed an errour.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because he perceiving that some of these rules were not necessary to all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that it was not necessary at all.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59534:46"/>
2. Because we attribute not the interpretation of the true sense of every place, to each one of these, but to all together, he therefore concludeth that they were not sufficient at all.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now besides these means, and those of prayer and diligent study wherein they agree with us, they propound these four following (as is before said) and hold them infallible.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The interpretation of Scriptures by the fathers.</item>
                  <item>2. The exposition of them by Councils.</item>
                  <item>3. The practise of the Church.</item>
                  <item>4. The definitive sentence of the Pope.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Concerning the first and second of these in general we say, that as there may arise some doubt or scruple in some places of Scripture, so may there also in their expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And for the two last a question may be made, whether the Chuch they mean be a true Church, and whether the Pope may not erre in his sentence.</p>
               <p>Again, as we unfeignedly hold and acknowledge, that some of their means are commendable, yet we say that they are not allowable, where they are evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our rules or without them. And if ever they took the right course, it was by using our means, and if they erred, it was by relying wholly on theirs, and excluding ours. But take their means without or against ours, and they may erre.</p>
               <p>As the word of God is the rule and ground of faith, so it cannot be denied but that<note place="margin">Addition 2. of peoples sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the judgement of the Church.</note> the expounding and applying hereof, is in ordinary course left by Christ to the Church, to whom he hath committed the feeding and government of his Flock, for Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all to hear the Church; and the Prophet tells us, the Priests lips are to preserve knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth. <hi>Mal. 2.</hi> and if the duty of the Church be to teach and instruct her children, no question, but it is their duty to learn of<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> her, and to submit their judgements to hers: yet this makes her not infallible in her<note place="margin">Math. 18. 17.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11. 14.</note> determination, but gives her this priviledge, that she ought to be heard, and beleeved,<note place="margin">Hec. 13. 17.</note> unlesse it appear evidently, that for some corrupt and sinister end she prevaricates from the truth. It is not possibility of erring, but actual erring which makes our faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, for otherwise one that beholds the sun could not be certain that he sees it, for there is a possibility of error in the sense in judging an object. It is sufficient therefore to make our faith certain, if the rule be infallible, and that it be applied with moral evidence, so that the propounder do not then actually erre, though he be subject to a possibility of errour, and that after the use of moral diligence fit in so great a matter, there appears no probable cause why we should not assent, nor any reason why in prudence we should doubt; so Suarez. himself. <hi>Dsp. de fide 5 sect. 1 num 5. non requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur infallibilitas permanens in proponente, sed sufficit quod actu non erret licet errare potest.</hi> Obedience to the Churches decrees doth not necessarily infer her infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, for then the civil magistrate, natural parents, and all superiours must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, because obedience is due to them by divine law, and yet we know they ought to be obeyed, unlesse the thing commanded be evidently unlawful. And therefore none ought upon probable reasons to reject the determination of the Church, or of a lawful Councel, for besides that the command from God, of hearing the Church is cleer and evident, and therefore we ought not upon reasons that are doubtful or not evident to reject her doctrine: but follow that rule <hi>tenere certum, dimittere in certum,</hi> besides this, I say, the Church and her governours have more, and more certain means of finding out the truth then any private persons have, as the prayers of the pastors, their fastings, dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, their skill in divine things, wherein their senses are exercised, and (which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows thereupon,) a greater assistance of the spirit, and the best means (as where many learned and pious men meet from diverse parts of the world) to know what the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Churches is in the matter in question, and what hath been the received sense which from time to time hath been delivered to the Churches; now it is a received rule among the Casuists, that in things doubtful, after diligence used, one may safely and ought to acquiesce in the judgement of the major part of pious and learned men. <hi>Reginald prax. lib. 12. n. 90, 91. &amp; l. 11. n. 25, 26.</hi> Besides this the Church is in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of her authority, and therefore ought in things doubtful to be heard, for <hi>in dubiis melior cst conditio possidentis,</hi> but if the contrary be evident, then the case is not doubtful.

               <p>The fundamentals of Religion which are absolutely necessary for all to know and practise, are plainly set down in Scripture, and of them there is no controversy; in matters doubtful the safest way is to submit to the judgement of the Church, yet not neglecting other means, as prayer, reading, meditation, conference, &amp;c. especially practising what we know, <hi>fol. 7. 17.</hi> and so we are sure to be kept from all damnable errours. In all other professions, common reason teaches, if any doubt arise, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the judgement of the skilful in those professions, as in Law, Physick, &amp;c. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have no such special promises as the Church hath from Christ of being lead into all truth, and if this be not observed in the Church, it must needs prove destructive to all order, and overthrow the being of a Church, taking away that distinction which Christ hath set between pastor and people, when all shall presume to interpret, and to be as wise as their teachers, as we see now by woful experience. We submit to the judges in point of law, yet no man thinks them therefore infallible, and so may and ought we to submit to our Bishops and Pastors in point of Religion, so as not to oppose their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, but reverently to receive what they deliver, when the contrary shall not evidently appear: I say evidently, for in doubtful things if their judgement may not turn the scale, when it hangs in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> either there is some fault in the beam, or their authority is very light. And therefore external obedience is required at least, so as not to oppose publikely in things we assent nor to. This agrees with what our learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hath left in his other works, composed in his riper years, when his judgement was fully setled, by which this and what else he delivered in his younger time ought to be expounded and corrected. In his sermon on <hi>Matthew 6. 17. p. 223.</hi> he tells us, <q>that no man hath God to be his Father, that hath not the Church to be his Mother, and that once and twice order is taken in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> as to keep to the precepts of our father, so not to set light by the laws of our mother, <hi>Proverbs 1. 8. &amp; 17. 25. Ira patris &amp; dolor matris</hi> are together in one verse, he that grieves her, angers him, and he cannot but grieve her that little sets by her wholsom orders — but now she erres, or at least is said to erre at every bodies pleasure. &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now come to the particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the fathers, It is a vain speculation, to beleeve that the fathers concurre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all in one exposition of all places of Scripture. And if we must take them where they all agree, we shal finde many places which they do not expound alike, <hi>yet, where they all agree, as in articles of faith and matters fundamental, wherein we finde a joynt harmony, their exposition ought to be received, for therein they deliver the sence of the whole Catholick Church derived from the Apostles, which in such points is by Christs promise free from errour, otherwise Christ might have no Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In their expositions, they did not usually keep the literal sense, except in point of controversies which fell in their times: for in their Homilies they followed the tropological or figurative sense, drawing from thence diverse necessary doctrins, and applications necessary and tending to good life and manners. So saith S. <hi>August. contra Julian.</hi> that in controversies which fell not in their times they spake more carelessely.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, <hi>Basile</hi> saith of <hi>Dionysius</hi> a Father, that he spake many things <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <note place="margin">Epl. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>disputationis gratia</hi> by way of disputation, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>definitive</hi> positively against against the Heretiques of his time: and therefore in many things the fathers must be taken to have spoken <hi>per modum contradicendi, non docendi,</hi> by way of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and not positively.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Cardinal Cajetan</hi> affirmed in the Councel of Trent, that if he knew a true and sound exposition upon any place of Scripture, not vsed by the fathers, he would hold, and maintain it <hi>contra torrentem omnium Doctorum &amp; Episcoporum</hi> against the current of all Doctors and bishops. And <hi>Andrad.</hi> saith as much, and all of them vse to deny the fathers in their schools. And now in regard that the fathers often dissent, they lean to that which the greatest part of the fathers say.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There was a controversy between Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> whether<note place="margin">Epl. 1 1.</note> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> reproof of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> were real or not? <hi>Jerome</hi> maintaining that Saint<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 10</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> did it onely <hi>pro forma formally,</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> that he did it simply, and from
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59534:47"/>
his heart. And though <hi>Jerome</hi> quoted the opinions of divers fathers to strengthen his, yet <hi>Augustine</hi> would not alter, holding this among other rules, that we are not to regard <hi>quis,</hi> but <hi>quid,</hi> not who, but what any man speaketh. And <hi>Jerome</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his own exposition of the Psalms, saith, that he had delivered diverse thing, contrary to the tenet of those times: <hi>that is, in matters praeterfundamental, wherein liberty of dissenting may be indulged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, the Papists themselves reject the exposition of many of the Fathers<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 18</note> upon this text, [<hi>Tu es Petrus, &amp;c.</hi> Thou art <hi>Peter</hi> and upon this rock I will build my Church.] many of the Fathers holding, that it was meant of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> faith, not his person. As also they leave all the rest of the Fathers, and adhere to Saint <hi>Aug.</hi> onely in the division of the commandments: for the current of the Fathers divide them as we do, but they following Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> make but one Commandment of the first two, and divide the last into two: <hi>but these were not matters of faith.</hi> But S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was carried away in this, by a conceit of having but three command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the first Table in reference to the Trinity, as may be seen in his division of the Decalogue.</p>
               <p>For the Councils which are divided into Action or Agitation of a point, and Canon.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Action commonly is such errour, that they are forced to lay all upon the Canon, and say, that it matters not much what the premises be, so the Conclusion be good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for the Canon, we may finde in some Councils, that the Canons of one are flat and direct against another, as in the case of marriages of Priests, some for them, some against them. We see the two Councils of Constance and Basile, both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and both confirmed, one by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, and the other by <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the fourth. The Bulls of which (though the Canons agree) be opposite to each other. The one holding, <hi>Concilium posse errare, non Papam,</hi> that the Council may, but the Pope cannot erre: the other, <hi>Papam errare posse, non Concilium,</hi> that the Pope may erre, but the Council cannot. And the Canon of the Council of Ferrara holding against that of the Council of Florence, one, that the Pope is above the Council, and the other that the Council is above the Pope. <hi>All this shewes, that Councils are not simply infallible, but may erre, now where it is evident that they erre, being drawn into parties and factions, by corrupt interests, none is bound to beleeve their determinations, but where there is no such evidence they ought to be obeyed, as those authorised by Christ to direct and guide us in matters of salvation, and even when we are not bound to believe their decisions, yet for the peace of the Church their decrees tye us to external obedience, that is, not to oppose them, if there be no fundamental errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Church and the practise thereof. This is as uncertain as the other. For the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Churches of the East and West agree not in diverse points, and among other, in the case of the Popes supremcay, the Eastern Church totally opposing it. And if we urge the practise of the Church, it will be found, that at some time most of the Bishops<note place="margin">De spiritu san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto. e 27.</note> were Arrians. So that in this there's both ambiguity and peril. And <hi>Basile</hi> saith, that in the case of Baptism, the Children at the first were dipped but once, and afterwards<note place="margin">de trina <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> thrice, and we know at this day, they are but once dipped.<note place="margin">Addition 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, these shew that the Church is not simply infallible, especially in such points<note place="margin">Of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches power to interpret scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> as these, which touch not any fundamental article, and that particular Churches may differ in some lesser points, and yet maintain the same faith, and keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace: but all this hinders not, but that the Church is the ordinary interpreter of Scripture to her children, and that they ought to submit to her because she is accountable to God for them, Heb. <hi>13. 17.</hi> and that none ought to reject her doctrine upon probable or doubtful reasons, but upon such as are evident, that is, such as not onely seem evident to them, for every contradicting spirit will affirm the most doubtful things to be evident to him, but such as to other pious and learned men not interested seem evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Reginald.</hi> l. <hi>17.</hi> c. ult. n. <hi>234.</hi> This seems to have been the judgement of this learned Prelate in his latter thoughts. As serm. on <hi>Act. 2. 42. p. 27.</hi> where he hath these words, fit to be written in letters of gold. <q>The ancient fathers thought it meet, that they that took upon them to interpret the Apostles doctrine, should put in sureties, that their senses they gave were no other, then the Church in former time hath acknowledged. It is true, the Apost. spake from the spirit, and every exposition of theirs was an oracle, but that was their peculiar priviledge, but all others after them, are not to utter their own fancies;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59534:48"/>
and to desire to be beleeved upon their bare word, but onely on condition, that the sense they now give be not a feigned sense, but <hi>such an one as hath been before given by our Fathers, and fore-runners in the Christian faith.</hi> Say I this of my self (Saith the Apostle) saith not the Law so too, give I this sense of mine own head, hath not Christs Church heretofore given the like: which one course, if it were strictly held, would rid our Church of many fond imaginations, which now are stamped daily, because every man upon his own single bond is trusted to deliver the meaning of any Scripture, which is many times nought else but his own imagination. This is the disease of our age. </q> Thus he.</p>
               <p>The last way they prescribe is that of the Popes. And that they may erre in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> their interpretation may appear in that many of them were not sound in the faith. Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> saith that <hi>Damasus</hi> Pope, did consent <hi>ad subscriptionem hereseos</hi> to the subscription of heresy: and <hi>Ambrose</hi> reporteth that <hi>Liberius</hi> the Pope, though for a while he was orthodox, and for not subscribing to the condemnation of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> he was banished into Thrace, but shortly after he became an Arrian, and at one of their Councels subscribed to heresy. <hi>Honorius</hi> the first, after his death was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed and condemned, in the thirteenth Action of the sixth general Council of Constantinople, held <hi>anno</hi> 680. under <hi>Constantinus Pogonatus</hi> the Emperour, <hi>quia impia dogmata confirmavit,</hi> for confirming wicked opinions: which were those of the Monothelites. But to shift off these things, they have nothing to say, but that the Councils were corrupt, and not onely they but the writings of <hi>Beda</hi> shall be corrupt. So that we see that none of these rules severally are infallible, Let us see them a little together.</p>
               <p>In the administration of the Sacrament of the Lords supper to infants, we may see they fail: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Let a man examine himself, and so eat, &amp;c. which a Childe<note place="margin">

Cor. 11. 28</note> cannot do, And in this and other things wherein they fail, they are forced to say, We beleeve not the Fathers, because they say it, but because they say it according to rules. And if they beleeve it in respect of the person that speaketh, not the <hi>quid,</hi> the reality of the thing, they erre much, though <hi>Stapleton</hi> say, that the interpretation of a Bishop, though unlearned, is to be prefer'd before that of a learned Divine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his office and authority. <hi>Andradius</hi> yet saith, The Fathers are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, not in whatsoever they say, but in whatsoever they say according to their rules: and so say we.</p>

               <p>IN the next place, we are to treat of the Summe of Christian Religion it self in it self. And this according to the ancient division consists of</p>

               <p>The Law, that is, the moral Law, as it is explicated and enlarged by Christ, is a part<note place="margin">Addition 4. that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law is an essential part of the gospel or second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> of the condition of the second covenant, and therefore an essential part of the Gospel, which consists not barely of promises, but of precepts too, and those more high and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then any before Christ, and therefore is the Gospel in the Scripture often called the Law of Christ, and so usually stiled inall antiquity. The moral Law, as it shews men their sins, and so convinces them of the necessity of Christ, so the knowledge of it may be needful before the Doctrine of faith: but as it is the rule of Christian obedience, and a condition of the second covenant, which is the most proper consideration of it, so it ought to follow the doctrine of faith, and so it doth in the most authentick Catechism of this Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the common prayer Book. It is true that, <hi>Luther</hi> and after him many Protestant Divines in their heat against the Church of Rome about the matter of justification, seem to make the Gospel a Doctrine consisting meerly of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59534:48"/>
promises, and to say that Christ gave no Law, but onely explicated and vindicated the Law from the false glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees, in <hi>Matth. 5. 6.</hi> and <hi>7.</hi> as if the moral Law were no part of the Gospel, or what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the works of that Law were to be extended to the Laws of Christ also, and the works of the Gospel, and that the onely or chief use of the Law now, is to bring men to Christ, from which and other the like principles unawares by them laid, and by the <hi>vulgus</hi> of our Divines swallowed without examination, the Antinomians, Libertines, Familists, and other Sectaries have by necessary consequence drawn those damnable Doctrines, which these Divines little dreamt of, or if they had considered, I suppose they would have revised these principles and retracted them, or else have spoken more warily then they have done. The truth is, that in that sermon on the mount Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the new Law or Law of the Gospel, wherein the substance of Christian religion, and the way to salvation is contained, and that he doth not therein onely barely expound the Decalogue given by <hi>Moses,</hi> but as a Legislator delivers his Law to be observed by all that beleeve on him according to the tenure of the second Covenant, was the constant opinion of all the Fathers, and of the whole Church, as among others is fully proved by the incomparable <hi>H. Grotius</hi> both in his comments on <hi>Matth. 5.</hi> and in his book <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> belli &amp; pacis, l. 1. c. 2. n. 6.</hi> and if any desire a list of names, and testimonies of Fathers, and ancient writers to that purpose, they may read them in a tract written by a learned and judicious Divine <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hamond,</hi> in the passages between him and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cheynel p. 129, 130 &amp;c.</hi> And that this learned Prelate was of the same minde, is evident in his other works perfected by himself, especially in his sermon on <hi>Psalm 2. 7. p. 16, 17.</hi> where among other things we read thus. <q>The very Gospel hath her Law, a Law Evangelical there is, which Christ preached: and as he did, so must we do the like. It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger to let any such conceit take head, as though Christian Religion had no Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points in it, consisted onely of pure narratives: beleeve them, and all is well. And true it is, that such points there be, but they are not all, there is a law besides, and it hath precepts, and they are to be preached, learned, and as a Law to be obeyed by all. Look but unto the grand commission (by which we all preach) which Christ gave at his going out of the world. Go, saith he, preach the Gospel to all nations, teaching them to observe the things which I have commanded you: lo, here is commanding, and here is observing: so the Gospel consists not onely of certain Articles to be beleeved, but of certain commandments also, and they are to be observed. Now I know not how, we are clean fallen from the tearm Law, that we are even fallen out with it, the name of Law we look strangely at, we shun it in our common talk, to this it is come, when men seek to live as they list. We have Gospel'd it so long, that the Christian Law is clean gone from us: and I shall tel you what is come by drowning this tearm, Law, Religion is even come to be counted <hi>res precaria,</hi> no Law, no no, but a matter of mere entreaty, general perswasion, &amp;c. The reverend regard, the legal vigour, the power, the penalties of it are not set by. The rules, no reckoning made of them as of: Law writs, none but onely as of Physick bills, if you like them, you may use them, if not, lay them by, and this comes by drowning the tearm, Law. If the name once be lost, the thing it self will not long stay. And after. Christian Religion was in the very best times called <hi>Christiana Lex,</hi> the Christian Law, and the Bishops <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Legis Episcopi,</hi> Bishops of the Christian Law, and all the ancient fathers liked the tearm well, and took it upon them. To conclude, Gospel it how we will, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel hath not the Legalia of it, acknowledged, allowed, and preserved to it, if once it loose the force and vigour of a Law, its a signe it declines, it growes weak and unprofitable, and that is a signe it will not long last, we must go look our salvation by some other way, &amp;c.</q> Thus we see how he contradiets the popular errours of these times about Law, and Gospel, and therefore it cannot be conceived that his discourse here tends to the nourishing of such dangerous and novel opinions as our solifidians do now cry up.</p>
               <p>If we have the summe of these two we may assure our selves, that we have as much as is needful for our salvation: and the summe of them both are necessary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. The Evangelist hath them both in one verse. The Law was given by <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 1. 17.</note> but Grace and truth came by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Seeing then that these are the two parts, we are to consider in the first place, which of them is first to be handled. We say we must speak first of the Law.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59534:49"/>
1. First because the Law and the Gospel are nothing else, but two Covenants which God made with mankinde, and in that respect are called the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments, considering them not as they are in the Books (for so in the old Testament; there is the Gospel also, the Law being as <hi>S. Aug.</hi> saith, <hi>Evangelium absconditum,</hi> and the Gospel <hi>Lex revelata</hi> the Law revealed: the Gospel the new law, and the Law the old Gospel) but as they be Covenants. Now taking them as Legacies in a will, there are in a Testament two parties necessarily required. 1. The <hi>Testator</hi> or <hi>Legator.</hi> 2. The Legatee, or the party to whom the Legacy is bequeathed. So in each Covenant, both of Law and Gospel, there were two parties. The first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and <hi>Adam;</hi> the Covenant on Gods part, was to give to <hi>Adam,</hi> paradise, felicity: and on <hi>Adams</hi> part to return to God perfect obedience.</p>
               <p>This did <hi>Adam</hi> receive power and strength to perform, but he abusing this power, and opposing it against God, justly incurred the forfeiture of his felicity, and the penaltie of <hi>morte morieris,</hi> death and misery, opposite to Paradise, from which the strength given to him by God might have preserved him. Now this Covenant being broken and made void, it pleased God in his mercy (not regarding this forfeiture) to make a new Covenant, the Covenant of faith in which there were two bonds: one between God and Christ, and another betwixt Christ and us: on Gods side fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, on Christs part satisfaction to God for us, on our side faith unfeigned, with new obedience, but this not by our own strength, but by the power of Christ, and his Spirit. For as man fell, and by his fall lost all that he had, so, if he would recover that which was lost, he must make satisfaction for it: but this he could not now do, and therefore Christ undertook it for him, suffered for him, and removed the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, satisfyed the forfeiture, and thereby restored to man all that he had lost.</p>
               <p>Now Christ had a double title to heaven, one of inheritance, and the other of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase; the right of inheritance he had by nature, in that he was the Son of God, which he claimeth to himself, the other he giveth to them that lay hold on him <hi>side viva, non ficta,</hi> by a lively and unfeigned faith; and therefore this is called the Covenant of faith, which we have not by our own strength, but <hi>in Christo,</hi> by the power of Christ.</p>
               <p>And the reason of this second covenant was, that now <hi>Adam</hi> having lost his own strength by breach of the first, all power and strength should be now from God in Christ, and all the glory be given to him. For if <hi>Adam</hi> had stood by his own strength in the fist, howsoever God should have had most glory, yet <hi>Adam</hi> should have had some part thereof for using his strength well, and not abusing it when he might; but kept his standing: but that God might have all the glory, he suffered the first Covenant to be broken, and permitted man to fall, for which fall he was to make satisfaction, which he could not do but by Christ, nor perform new obedience, but by the grace of God preventing us, and making us of unwilling, willing, and of unable, able, to do things in that measure, that God will require at our hands.</p>
               <p>So that the first Covenant (the Law) was weak and imperfect, standing upon a promise in figure, and a curse without figure; a curse indeed: but the promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed in Christ, and the curse abrogated by his death, then came those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect things, and <hi>imperfecta abiere,</hi> the things which were imperfect were done away,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 10.</note> as the A postle speaks.</p>
               <p>The first covenant <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is said to be given by <hi>Moses,</hi> yet was it not received by us, we had not the hearts to take it, till the coming of Christ: but in the Gospel it was not onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> given, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> brought to passe and fulfilled <hi>per Christum</hi> by Christ.</p>
               <p>And we must observe withall, that the moral Law it self is not changed, but the ceremonies onely taken away by Christs truth, and the curse thereof by Grace: so that the bond of the keeping the Law, is not cancelled by Christs coming, but<note place="margin">

Think not that<note place="margin">28. 20.</note> I am come to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it. Christ came not to repeal his fathers statutes, when he spake his last words to the Disciples, Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded. Now these things standing thus, and the Law being first in time and order (for we begin with the imperfect) that is first to be taught.</p>

                  </gap>. Another argument of this Order is, That humiliation is first by the Law, and the course of teaching, is first by humbling men by the Law, in letting them see what they are, which hath beene the order vsed from the beginning of the world. It was the course of Gods own proceeding upon the violation of the first Covenant, for after <hi>Adam</hi> had transgressed, and remained till evening in expectance and fear<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 9.</note> of punishment for breach of the Law, and therefore had hid himself; then first began the Law to passe upon him, by way of judicial proceeding. First he is called forth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>

But yet presently after came the Gospel, the promise of Christ. So God came first with his <hi>vbies?</hi> and that is the Law, and after came <hi>Semen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the seed of the woman, which is the Gospel. And God likewise took the same order after the floud, when he taught <hi>Abraham, Ambula coram me &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> walke before me, and be thou perfect, which is the onely end and scope of the Law, so that the Law was first given to him, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> then was he instructed in the Gospel,<note place="margin">22. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>In semine tuo benedicentur omnes netiones terra,</hi> In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.</p>
               <p>And this was the way that <hi>Moses</hi> taught the people. Take the Book of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy, which is the iteration of the Law, after the three first chapters, in the fourth<note place="margin">Deut. 18. 15.</note> he begins to teach the Sum of the Law, Therefore shalt thou keep &amp;c. till the 18. Chapter, and there he tells them the Gospel, That God would raise up a Prophet<note place="margin">Act. 7. 37.</note> from the midst of them, like unto him, &amp;c. Which Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> applied to Christ. This was also the Course of the Prophets. Esay in his first 40 Chapters, (though<note place="margin">Esa. 40.</note> in grosse there be some promises of the Gospel intermingled) yet the scope and beginning of it is to teach the whole sum of the Law, and the rest is the sum of the Gospel. But more plainly in his first Chapter, from the beginning to the 18. verse, theres a bitter invective, and denunciation of the Curse of the Law; but from<note place="margin">C. 1.</note> thence to the end of the Chapter is the promise of the Gospel. Come then &amp;c. If your sins were as red as scarlet &amp;c. And the first psalm is nothing but a recapitulation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> the Law, with the promises and Curses thereunto annexed, and the second Psalm, a prophecy of the coming of Christ, and of the Gospel. So Saint <hi>John</hi> the Baptist<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 7.</note> beginneth with the Law, and tels them of the axe laid to the root of the tree, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the next verse ends with the Gospel, <hi>Ego baptzio vos,</hi> I baptize you.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
               </p>
               <p>And its Christs own order too (who was the great prophet of the New <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 12.</note> and whose method ought to be our Jnstruction) He that humbleth himself shall be exalted, first Humiliation, and then exaltation; now theres no humbling but by the Law, and therefore it is called <hi>Humiliator,</hi> the humbler.</p>
               <p>It was also the practize of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the Romans, (which is held to contain the sum of Christian Religion) after his proemium, in the 17 first verses from the 18 of the first Chapter to the 21 verse of the 3. Chapter, he speaks all of the Law, all under sinne, Jews and Gentiles, and unregenerate and regenerate, and at last includes himself in the number: but after, he delivers the sum of the Gospel, shewing in what Covenant we must looke to be saved. And this Epistle the learned will have to be our warrant for this practize.</p>
               <p>And such was the form of instructing in the primitive Church taking pattern from Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> First Repentance from dead works, which includes the Law, and then<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> faith in Christ, which shews the Gospel. So that this must be our Order, The Law first, and then the Gospel. So much for the Order.</p>
               <p>Now the Law containeth three things.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

               <p>Our answer is. That they lived not before <hi>Moses,</hi> without the Law. They had<note place="margin">Resp.</note> many parts of the Law, some of the Ceremonial Law, by special Revelation from God, and all the moral Law written in their hearts, they had the knowledge of beasts cleane and uncleane, of sacrificing, of praying or calling upon God: of the younger Childrens subjection to the elder. <hi>Abraham</hi> had the Law of Circumcision: he and <hi>

                  </hi> paid Tithes; and many other Laws they had before <hi>Moses</hi> wrote them. And as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, The Gentiles (both before and after) doing by nature the things contained in the Law, these haveing not the Law, were a Law unto themselves:<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14, 15</note> what to doe? not what they listed, but the work of the Law, written in their hearts, instead of Tables of stone.</p>
               <p>That is, the effect of the Law, which is equivalent to the Law it self, which he

proveth thus, because their conscience bare witnesse, and their thoughts reflected on their actions, accused or excused themselves in what they did.<note place="margin">De Trin. l. 14. c. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that every man had this law in his heart, which is to be understood after the fall, for before that, all was <hi>perfectum,</hi> perfect. <hi>Mali multa recte laudant, multa recte reprehendunt, quibus autem regulis faciunt hoc? ubi eas vident? unde illud habent? quod homines sic vivere debeant, cum ipsi non sic vivant, sunt regulae justae, mentes eorum injustae, regulae immutabiles, mentes eorum mutabiles, vel hoc argumento, &amp;c.</hi> Evil men commend many things truly, and reprove many things as justly: but by what rules do they so? whence have they it, that men ought to live so, seeing they live not so themselves? why, these rules are right and good, though their minds be not so, the rules are unchangeable, though their mindes be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,<note place="margin">John 1. 5.</note> &amp;c. Yea, he concludes, that they finde them in <hi>libro lucis,</hi> in the book of light and truth, howsoever they are blinde, (and as S. <hi>John, the light shone in darknesse, and the darknesse comprehended it not</hi>) which truth being in God, as a seal, makes the same impression in the minde of man, yet keeps it self whole, and where this print or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is fet, it can never be wiped out. And thus we see, that all men ever had, and have the effect of the Law in them.</p>
               <p>And this we will prove from the performing the duties required in the law before it was given, this may appear before the written law in all the ten Commandements.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For the first Commandement. Though it be not very plain, that <hi>Terah</hi> with<note place="margin">Gen. 11. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham, Lot</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> departed out of <hi>Vr</hi> of the Chaldees into Canaan, because of the idolatry of the inhabitants, yet soon after there is a very plain place for it. <hi>Jacob</hi>

                  <item>2. For the second. <hi>Jacob</hi> buried the idols under an Oak, and in that <hi>Rachel</hi> hid the<note place="margin">35. 4.</note> images under the Camels litter in a godly zeal, as some think.<note place="margin">31. 34.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. For the third. <hi>Abraham</hi> caused his Steward to put his hand under his thigh,<note place="margin">24. 3.</note> and swear by the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that he should not take a wife for his son<note place="margin">31. 53.</note> of the daughters of the Canaanites. And we may see a solemn oath taken between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban.</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>4. For the fourth. We may see the observation of it plainer before the giving of<note place="margin">Exod. 16. 23.</note> the Law, in <hi>Exodus,</hi> in speech about gathering a double portion of Manna of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths Eve.</item>
                  <item>5. For the fifth. we may finde in one place, how <hi>Esau</hi> cryed for his fathers<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 38.</note> blessing: and in another, how he stood in awe of his father, though he were<note place="margin">41.</note> otherwise prophane, for he would not kill his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> while his father was alive.</item>
                  <item>6. For the sixth. we see a plain precept. Whosoever sheddeth mans blood, by<note place="margin">9. 6.</note>

                  <item>7.

                  <item>8. For the eighth. The putting of <hi>Josephs</hi> cup into the mouth of the sack was<note place="margin">44. 7.</note> enough (though among the Egyptians) to clap his brethren in prison, and God forbid (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <item>9. For the ninth. Because <hi>Judah</hi> had promised to send a kid, he performed it, though<note place="margin">38. 17.</note> (as he thought) to a harlot.<note place="margin">20.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>10. For the tenth. There was no act, nor purpose of heart in <hi>Abimelech</hi> against <hi>Sara,</hi> as appeareth, yet the sinne of concupiscence was punished in him, by God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 3.</note> thou art buta dead man, because of the woman which thou hast taken.

               </list>
               <p>By this we see, that there was a Law before the written Law.</p>
               <p>The summe of the Law is this: <hi>Ambula mecum,</hi> walk with me, or before me, and<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> the means to do this, is Love. Can two walk together (saith the Prophet) and not be agreed? if they love they will not part. So that love must be the ground, and to<note place="margin">Amos. 3. 3.</note> love Christ is to keep his Commandements. Now there is no Love but between<note place="margin">John. 14. 15.</note> likes, so that we must be <hi>integrl</hi> perfect,, both in body and soule, not outwardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but inwardly too.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59534:51"/>
The Law consists in two Duties. 1 In avoiding or not doing Evill. 2 Jn doing that which is good. Both put together by the Prophet. Cease to do evill, learn<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 16.</note> to do good. And by the Psalmist. Eschew evil, and do good.<note place="margin">17.</note>

               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his directions to <hi>Titus</hi> giveth these rules, that as we must deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> (theres the abstinere) so we must <hi>facere</hi> too, live soberly, justly and Godly; that is, 1. <hi>Pie,</hi> Godly, towards God. 2. <hi>juste,</hi> justly, towards our neighbours. 3. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brie,</hi> soberly towards our selves.

               <p>AND thus we see, that Gods written Law, which is Natures Law, hath all those conditions that any Law should have. For this Law, which was before <hi>Moses,</hi> was nothing else but <hi>Moses'</hi>s Law in the hearts of men: as if a man would get a thing by heart that is not written. For what Laws then they had from GOD they kept in their hearts by tradition.</p>
               <p>But now peradventure they will say, that these Laws and the four Rules, appear onely in the Scripture, and were observed by the Jewes and those mentioned in the Scripture onely, but other Heathen took no notice of them, nor used them by the light of Nature, and therefore think themselves not bound to them, but are at liberty to use, or not use them.</p>
               <p>To this we say, that by the writings of the Heathen themselves it appears that they had these rules written in their hearts, and received many of them, the son from the fathers ascending even to <hi>Noahs</hi> sons, <hi>Sem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> though in some of the Commandements it may not seem so plain as in the rest, for in every Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement they introduced some corruptions of their own heads, and declined diversly from Gods Law.</p>
               <p>First, for six of the Commandements it is manifest, as the 3. 5. 6. 7. 8 9. the more<note place="margin">1 The action.</note> obscure are the 1. 2. 4. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the third Commandement. It was a law among the Egyptians, <hi>Perjuri poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na capitali plectentur,</hi> let the perjured be punished with death, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> reporteth. And it was the law of <hi>Rome</hi> in the 12 Tables <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="5">5. For the fifth, <hi>Homer</hi> saith of one that had a misfortune, that it came <hi>quia pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes non honoravit,</hi> because he honoured not his parents, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="7">7. For the seventh, it was the saying of <hi>Licurgus, Fuge nomen Moechi, si mortem fugies,</hi> Avoid adultery, so shalt thou avoid untimely death: and <hi>Stephanus</hi> out of <hi>Nicostratus</hi>

               <p>Now in the other four they had a dimmer light, for they were not so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the first, though wee finde most of them speaking of gods in the plural number, yet it was well known to the Philosophers, that there was but one God, and especially to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who could say, <hi>Si quis se deum dixerit paepter unum qui omnia fecerit, novum faciat mundum,</hi> If any one shall say that he is a god, but he that made all things, let him prove it, by making a new World.

               <p n="2">2. For the second, they agreed, that every god should be worshipped according to the manner that himself should think best. So <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Plato's Respublica,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> every god should be worshipped as he liked. And this is the very foundation of the second Commandement. But for the thing it self, <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Civ. l. 4.</note> out of <hi>Varro</hi> saith, That <hi>Varro</hi> did much approve of the Jews religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">31.</note> it excluded Images, holding it the best way to keep Religion undefiled by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding them; and that if all people else had taken that course, it had been a means to take away much trifling.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the fourth, very little is to bee found, and yet they had this Canon among them, that <hi>numerus septenarius,</hi> the number of seven was <hi>numerus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etis,</hi> a number of rest, and that it was <hi>Deo gratissimus,</hi> a number pleasing to God.

               <p n="10">10. For the tenth, <hi>Menander</hi> hath this saying, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, do not <hi>concupiscere,</hi> or desire, so much as another mans pin or button. And indeed, though in their Lawes they never touched this, yet the scope of them all did tend and drive to this end, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>non concupiscere,</hi> they were against concupiscence. And hence we may conclude with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2. 15. That the Gentiles, having the Law written in their hearts, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable.</p>
               <p>Now to shew that the Heathen had also the rules and grounds before mentioned, we may thus prove.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Questions about the Law. 1. Why it was written by Moses, seeing it was written before in mens hearts. How the light of Nature became Divine, three causes of it: it was deserved in three respects. Why the Law was given at this time. Why onely to the Jews. All the four parts of a Law are in the Law written. 1. The Act. 2. The Manner. 3. The Rewards. 4. Punishments. 2. Whether any can keep the Law. How God is just in requiring that which we cannot perform. An addition about power of keeping the Law Evangelical. Adam lost his ability, not <hi>efficienter,</hi> but <hi>meritorie.</hi> God alwayes gives, or is ready to give power to do what he requires, if we be not wanting to our selves. How Christ hath fulfilled the Law, how we keep it by faith. 3. Why God promises life to the keeping of the Law, if we cannot keep it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw here a question may be made. If the law of <hi>Moses</hi> were thus written in<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> their hearts before, to what end was it given them, or what needed God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to have written it in Tables of stone?</p>
               <p>We answer, the reason was, because the former law, though it were whole in<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Paradise, yet afterwards by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, it was broken into shards and fragments, all to pieces, and afterward every piece was broken smaller and smaller, so as the light of Nature thereby grew dimmer and dimmer. And therefore lest it should be clean put out, because the writing in the heart would not be sufficient, but daily decayed, it was necessary that it should be written in tables of stone, and set before the eyes of all, that by daily viewing it, it might be brought again into their hearts.</p>
               <p>If it be questioned again, how it came to passe, that these laws of Nature were blotted out, and how the light thereof came to be dimmer and dimmer, we answer, that the reasons are three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because men did what they could, to blot it out themselves. <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> men would not understand: and the reason why they would be so ignorant was, because when they had done ill and communed with their own hearts, they found presently an accuser in them; so that not daring to look into themselves, when they had done ill, they would not be checked, and as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>facti sunt fugitivi a cordibus suis,</hi> they became fugitives from their own hearts. Therefore to cure this evil, it was expedient, when they had put it out of their hearts, that the law should be written, to be ever in their sight, that thereby it might be brought back again into their hearts, <hi>unde fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerunt,</hi> from whence they had driven it.</item>
                  <item>2. Because as Christ said, there came a <hi>Super seminator,</hi> another Sower, the Devil,<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 25.</note> who sowed tares (false principles) in their hearts, as <hi>Eritis dii cognoscentes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Bonum est quod prodest,</hi> that is to be counted good that doth us good, and the like Now thesetares overgrowing and overmastering the good wheat, it was fit that the good seed should be sowen again: and that it might not be corrupted again, it was necessary that the Law should be delivered in Tables of stone, to remain ever to be looked upon, and not forgotten.</item>
                  <item>3. Thirdly, God inflicted the punishment of blindnesse upon them, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Lege infatigabili spargit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </list>
               <p>And thus having spoken of their knowledge, let us now see their practise. And by this, they deserved the losse of the light of Nature three wayes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In respect of God.

For stealth and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery that was accounted no sin, their Law bare them out: as in Sparta it was but, <hi>Tu quoque fac simile,</hi> do thou the like, And for Adultery they allowed their <hi>nagas libidines,</hi> extravagant lusts, their abominable feasts to <hi>Venus,</hi> and their Stewes to maintain them.</p>

No marveil then if in these respects, all those things considered, that God plagued them with blindnesse and darknesse, for such intollerable abuse of that light they had.</p>
               <p>Thus mans heart being an ill <hi>Custos</hi> or keeper of the Law, and <hi>ignorantia</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance being made <hi>poena ignorantiae</hi> the punishment of ignorance, and so the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost blotted out, it was necessary it should be written, so as it might abide for ever. When God had made an end of communing with <hi>Moses</hi> upon mount Sinai, he gave him two Tables of Testimony, Tables of Stone written with his<note place="margin">Exo. 31. 18.</note> own finger, which had a signe and resemblance, and indeed contained summarily the Law of nature. But after they were broken in pieces by <hi>Moses</hi> moved to wrath against the Israelites for their idolatry to the Molten Calf, then were two Tables<note place="margin">32. 19.</note> made again by <hi>Moses,</hi> but the Law was written in them by God, this Law was<note place="margin">34. 1.</note> called <hi>Moses</hi> Law, because it was delivered to the Israelites by his ministery: ever since it hath been delivered to succeeding ages by the ministery of Man.</p>
               <p>Now it was necessary that this Law should be given at this time in these respects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because now, not onely the Gentiles walked in the vanity of their own hearts, but the Israelites the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (to whom God had bound himself<note place="margin">Ezech. 20. 7.</note> by promise) were addicted to the Idol-worship of Egypt, and having lived long in Egypt, had almost lost the knowledge of sacrificing to, and tru ly worshipping of of God. So that had not God at this time taken his people apart from other Nations into the wildernesse, and there as it were schooled them apart, and taught them his Law, and given it to them written, to be preserved for posterity, the whole world (in probability) would have been (if dim before) stark blinde at length, and wholly ignorant of Gods Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor did God give his Law to all the world at once, nor write it in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and different tongues of the Nations, but first imparted it to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Elders of the Jews, that by them it might be communicated to the whole body of that people, in the ancient tongue kept ever since <hi>Adams</hi> time by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, as is commonly thought. And then did God make this his people so famous in regard of the wonderful miracles wrought amongst them, his admirable dealings with them, his temple and worship granted to them: that the world before Christs coming could not plead ignorance. Besides whereas the Gentiles had departed from God, yet such was his mercy, that he left the way open for the Israelites to call them

again to the truth, and for their reentrance into the true Church, and becoming Pr selytes.</p>
               <p>Now then come we to shew, that in this written Law of <hi>Moses</hi> are all the four properties which are in all Laws. 1. <hi>Preceptum,</hi> a rule for our actions. 2. <hi>Modus</hi> the manner how to observe that Rule. 3. 4. <hi>Praemium &amp; poena,</hi> The reward for keeping, and the punishment for breaking it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, that it is a Rule and precept for our Actions. The Psalmist saith. The Law<note place="margin">Psa. 19. 7.</note> of the Lord is a perfect Law, &amp;c. Every Law else is unperfect.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For the Manner. It requireth that <hi>Toti,</hi> we be whole observers of the Law,<note place="margin">82</note> it commands, that we do it with our whole soul and body. For we consist but of<note place="margin">1 Toti.</note> those two parts. And the soul likewise hath two parts, the Minde and the Heart. Now God must be <hi>perfectus mentis scopus,</hi> the mark at which the minde must whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ayme, the end of all our actions, there must be <hi>plena intentio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

O that there<note place="margin">2 Totum.</note> were such a heart in them, that they would keep all my commandments alwayes:<note place="margin">5. 29.</note> and it were very absurd to except any. For whereas God is perfectly wise, if some of his precepts were needlesse, then might he be taxed with folly, in not leaving out them which were superfluous. And as none of Gods Laws must be left unkept, so none but his or what is grounded upon them, or not repugnant to them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by lawful authority derived from him, must be kept; for then his wisdom would be likewise impeached, if any thing thing besides his Law or without subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to his, were to be kept; and the Law it self would be imperfect, but it is neither defective, nor hath any thing superfluous in it: and therefore God saith. Whatsoever thing I command you, observe to do it, thou shalt not adde thereto, or<note place="margin">12. 32.</note> diminish from it. Nothing must be commanded in Gods name, as immediately from him, but what he hath prescribed.</p>
               <p>For the Continuance. <hi>Tota in vita est <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The place before quoted sheweth, by the word [alwayes] that to<note place="margin">5. 29.</note> continue all our lives in his obedience, is a part of the Law. And the same in effect, he commandeth elsewhere, Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God, and keep his charge,<note place="margin">11. 1</note> and his statutes, and his judgements and his commandments alway. And in all places too, for though the place includeth not the time, yet the time includeth the place, and therefore the house of <hi>Rimmon</hi> is not, nor can be excepted.<note place="margin">2 Kin. 5. 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly for reward. If the Law be kept, there is promise of reward. This Saint<note place="margin">3 Reward.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> confirms. Godlinesse (saith he) is profitable to all things, having promise of the<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> life that now is, and of that which is to come. And our Saviour saith, that they that have done good shall come forth of the grave to the resurrection of life. Saint<note place="margin">John 5. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth before <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that the twelve Tribes do rest in hope of a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.<note place="margin">Act. 26. 7.</note> And the opinion of the Sadduces that held the contrary was ever odious to the best Jews.</p>
               <p>Fourthly for punishment. If the Law be not kept after this manner, first wholly,<note place="margin">4 Punishment.</note> but in a double heart, then comes the Curse, which the prophet denounceth, Cursed is<note place="margin">Jer. 48. 10.</note> he that doth the work of the Lord negligently. And for the <hi>Totum.</hi> He that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the whole Law is accursed. Cursed is he that confirmeth not all the words<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 6.</note> of the law to do them, and all the people shall say Amen. which very words Saint<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note>

And these being Gods Curses, they are sure: for as when he said <hi>fiat lux,</hi> let there be light, and it was so; so if he say Cursed, it will be so too. And as there is a fulnesse of blessing to them that can keep this Law, so there is a fulnesse of his wrath to them that break it: a Curse without a blessing for the one, and a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 15.</note> without a Curse for the other.

               <p>Now if the question be asked, which of us, nay doth the best of us fulfil the Commandments, or who hath so clean a heart that never lutted, or indeed that lusteth not daily? We answer confidently, None. And to prove this Saint <hi>

                  </hi> shall tell you (in the first seven chapters to the Romans) that both Jew and Gentile were defective, and came short herein. Saint <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>In mult is offendimus omnes,</hi> in<note place="margin">James 3. 2.</note> many things we all offend. The prophet <hi>David</hi> by way of question saith, <hi>Delicta</hi>

And holy <hi>Job</hi> confessed, that he could not answer one for a thousand. Lastly (to omit many)<note place="margin">Job 9. 2.</note> K. <hi>David</hi> speaks positively in regard of fulfilling the Law, that, In Gods sight shall no<note place="margin">Psal. 140. 2.</note> man living be justified, that is, if God should proceed according to strict justice.</p>
               <p>If then the case of the best be so, another question ariseth, Whether God be just in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> things to be kept, and promising that whereof no man can be capable, because no man can keep the Law.</p>
               <p>We answer that God is most just, and there is no injustice in his proceedings. Though the matter be never so crooked, yet the rule ought to be straight, not like a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rule. For God being perfectly just, his Law must needs be perfectly just <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: for else if he had left out any part of the Law, he might have seemed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> sin.</p>
               <p>And if it be demanded, why we were not made able to fulfill and perform it. Some answer thus, That <hi>Adam</hi> was at first made fit and able, and received strength to keep it, in that perfection which was required: but he lost it. For <hi>Adam</hi> was like an evil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>But against this some object, that seeing man lost this ability, not <hi>efficienter,</hi> but<note place="margin">Addition 5.</note>

And therefore as God requires obedience under the gospel, so he enables us by his grace, or is ready to enable, if we seek to him to do what he requires: as to avoid every known and wilful sin, and to perform the substance of every good duty, though we are still subject to sins of Infirmity, which we must labour against, and though we come short of perfection in some degree, yet we must aim at it, and not rest in a perfection of parts. Thus euery Christian may and ought to keep the law of God, as it is qualified and moderated in the Gospel, so as to be free from all raigning sin, and to perform every act commanded in sincerity, and as this is possible by the grace of the gospel, so it is necessary to salvation in all after their conversion, and Repentance. As for that absolute perfection or freedom from all sin, it is commanded too, but not as actually necessary to salvation: but onely in our true and constant endeavour, as that which we must aim at, and come as neer to as we can, though we do not attain it in this life. And thus it may be truely said, that the Law, though it cannot be kept in that absolute and exact manner, which is required in the Covenant of works, that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least omission, or intermission, in which sense God doth not now require it of us to salvation, yet as it is required in the second Covenant according to the equity and moderation of the gospel, it may by the grace of Christ be kept, and must be kept by every true Christian, so far as God requires it of us now: and this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which the Scripture often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to, and the Catholike Church of Christ ever acknowledged. God having made a second Covenant, wherein there is a Law to be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59534:55"/>
kept as well as promises to be beleeved, requires obedience now not by vertue of the first covenant which is void, but according to the second which is still in force, whereby he is alwayes ready by such means and various dispensations as are agreable to his wisdom and justice to enable us to do what in this covenant is required.</p>
               <p>But an answer to the first question, and that more fully, you shall have in the words of the Apostle <hi>Romans</hi> 8. 3. What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likenesse of sinful flesh, and for sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned sin in the flesh. That the righteousnesse of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. In which words are two things principally to be observed.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Law cannot now, nor ever could justifie men: yet he layes not the fault on the Laws weaknesse (it being most perfect) but on our corrupt flesh. It is the flesh that cannot do that which the Law requires.</item>
                  <item>2. The second ariseth out of the former: that is, seeing that neither the Law could justifie us, nor we perform what the Law required, God, (rich in mercy and goodnesse) sent his Son into the world, that being incarnate here should die for us, and by that means take away the guilt and dominion of sin in us, and enable us to keep his Laws by faith and love, which is the perfection and fulfilling of the Law.</item>
               </list>
               <list>
                  <head>To shew more plainly how Christ did this, and that was two wayes.</head>
                  <item>1. By fulfilling whatsoever was promised and prefigured, in the Law and the Prophets, As <hi>semen mulieris,</hi> the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> serpent: and, In thy seed shall all the nations of the world be blessed: with diverse<note place="margin">22. 18.</note> other of the like nature. He also fulfilled the ceremonialls of the Law, while he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Priest offered himself as a sacrifice. Besides, he spiritually circumciseth beleevers, by substituting Baptisme instead of Circumcision. He is our Passeover, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eucharist instead of the Paschal Lambe: and indeed, he is the full comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfection of the Law and the Prophets.</item>
                  <item>2. Christ fulfilled the Law by satisfying in most absolute manner the will of God; being the holy of holies, without spot or sin at all, for in him is the love of God most perfect, and righteousnesse most absolute. And this in regard of the merit and satisfaction thereof, he communicates <hi>gratis</hi> freely to us most imperfect, to us, I say, if we beleeve. God was in Christ (saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) reconciling the world to him,<note place="margin">2. Cer. 5. 19.</note> not imputing their trespasses to them: for he hath made him to be sin for us, who<note place="margin">21.</note> knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him. So <hi>Abraham</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3.</note> beleeved and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse. For by faith we rely upon Christ, whom we beleeve to have made satisfaction most fully to God for us, and that God is so pleased with us in Christ, that he accepts us, as now become the Sons of God.</item>
                  <item>3. But this faith, by which we beleeve in Christ is not by our nature or merits, but is wrought in us by Gods grace, through the Spirit given into our hearts. And this, abiding there, enflames them with love of Gods Law, and desire to expresse the same by good works: which though we do not perform as we ought by reason of the infirmity of our flesh, yet God allowes our endeavours in Christ. Nor did ever any of the Saints (though he strove and resolved to keep the Law as far as he could) trust or rely upon his own merits but upon Christ. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not, for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, Who shall deliver me out of this body of death: and presently addeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24, 25</note> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord, that is, I thank him that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me from death by Jesus Christ. And it follows, There's now no condemnation<note place="margin">8. 1.</note> to them which are in Christ Jesus, &amp;c. So that a faithful man moved by Gods Spirit to do that which is good, as far as he is able, and as the second covenant requires, and that out of love of God, and not onely for fear of the Curies threatned in the Law, may be said to fulfill the Law in such manner, that God in Christ accepts of him. So much in answer to the first question.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To the second, why God would promise life to them that should keep the Law,<note place="margin">2.</note> seeing no man can keep it in a legal and exact manner, we answer.</p>
               <p>1. First, besides that, it may be doubted, whether God doth offer or promise life now otherwise then upon the conditions of the Gospel, which may be kept, some do further answer, that God sheweth hereby, that he abides the same, and the Law still the same, though we be changed from what he made us. 2. Secondly, Hereby man
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59534:55"/>
seeth his own weaknesse, and is driven out of himself to seek Christ. For (as the Apostle saith) if there had been a Law given, which could have given life, verily righteousnesse should have been by the Law, But the Scripture hath concluded all men<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 21, 22</note> under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. 3. Because Christ took on him our nature, and dying for us, hath purchased the promised inheritance, to be communicated to us, by faith and new obedience or sanctification. 4. Lastly, Though man cannot keep the Law exactly, yet upon his faith in Christ, and his resolution and indeavour to keep the Law, and actual keeping of it, by the assistance of Gods grace, so as is above declared, God accepteth of him in Christ, and takes the will for the deed, in some things, and accounts him righteous, and makes good the promise unto him.</p>

                  <p>Of the preparation before the giving of the Law. 1. To make them willing, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of 1. his benefits; 2. Gods right, as Lord; 3. Their relation as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

That ceremonial washing signifyed our spiritual cleansing. How we came to be polluted. How we must be cleansed. Why they were not to come at their wives. Of the danger and abuse of things lawful. 3. That they might not run too far, bounds were set. Of curiosity about things unnecessary.</p>
               </argument>
               <head>Now concerning the Preparation to the hearing of the Law.</head>
               <p>THough in the Preface something hath been said concerning the preparation of the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> upon the words <hi>venite &amp; auscultate,</hi> yet before we come to the particular explication of the Law, we shall further adde some thing in this place about our preparation to the hearing of it. For we can receive no benefit at Gods hands, if we be not prepared for it.</p>
               <p>God himself commanded the people to prepare themselves before the hearing of<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 10.</note> the Law, and so of the Gospel also. Prepare ye the way of the Lord, saith the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 3.</note> And to these adde, that the primitive Church appointed <hi>Vesperas diei Dominici,</hi> Vespers of the Lords day, and so they had for other holy dayes, and solemn feasts, and to the solemnest Sunday, Easter day, they prepared fourty dayes before. And forasmuch as the Sacrament is an appendix of the word, and the seal of it, surely we cannot be excused, if we prepare our selves for the one, and not for the other. The<note place="margin">Eccl. 5. 1.</note> Preacher gives this advise; Keep thy foot (look to thy self) when thou goest into the house of the Lord. And again we ought to know that preparation is as necessarily required of the Hearer, as of the Speaker.</p>
               <p>Now this preparation consists of three things or means.</p>
               <p>The first means to preparation, is to make the people willing to hear the Law,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> and that is grounded upon the speech of God to the Israelites in Exodus. Ye have<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 4.</note> seen (saith he) what I have done unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on Eagles wings. And a little after, Go to the people and sanctifie them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their cloathes. And let them be ready against the third <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> day. And, Thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about the Mount, saying,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Take heed unto your selves, &amp;c. In which words there are three things prescribed, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> the fourth is implyed by circumstance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The will in every action is to precede, the people were to be made willing to hear and receive the message that was to be delivered. And therefore to make them willing God (in the first place) gives them a catalogue of his Benefits and goodnesse. So that one way to stir us, and our will to embrace Gods Law is the meditation and consideration of the benefits, which either We, or our Countrey, Parents, Friends, or kinred have received at his hands, for the remembrance of them will stir up a love in us, and love will make us do our duties with delight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another way to prepare us, is by taking notice of the right and interest God hath in us, as he is our Creator, and so hath power to command us absolutely.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59534:56"/>
We are as Pots in his hands, either to be made or broken as he pleaseth: we are his servants or born subjects, and he may command us to do what he pleases, for which he needed not to reward us, if e had not tied himself by promise to reward us as the Subjects of <hi>Nebuchodonozor,</hi> who if they performed his will, had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> if not, the fornace was heated seven times hotter. We are <hi>Dei Vernae,</hi> Gods bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and as the Poet saith, <hi>Quae premiae Vernae,</hi> what rewards may bond-men expect? we are bought with a price. Thers nothing that takes so deep an impression in us,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 20.</note> as the consideration of Gods benefits to us, and interests in us, and dominion over us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we consider our selves, as we are his Creatures. The Dragons, the snow,<note place="margin">Psal. 148.</note> winde, storm, hail, are (as it is in the psalm) to praise him; so that if it had pleased God, to have made us but winde or snow, yet being his Creatures we were bound to praise him; how much more then, for that he hath given us a living soul, and secondly the vse of natural faculties in every member, the value or estimate whereof may be made, by the want of an eye, or an arme, for the supply whereof, how much would we think our selves beholding to any that should restore us the use of them: and therefore seeing God gave us all our Limbs, how much more ought we to be thankful to him for the use of all. But thirdly, when we shall enter into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God hath given us a reasonable soul, it should procure a third degree of thankfullnesse. The value of which is such, that as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that every man had rather <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> cum ratione Lamentari</hi> to Lament ever with understanding, then <hi>ridere sine ratione,</hi> to laugh without reason.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the fourth transcends all the rest. If we consider the goodnesse of God in choosing and preferring us above all other people to be his Church, and to pertain to him in the New Covenant, and the death of his Son, all other benefits will seem as miseries without this. And this benefit we shall the better value. If we consider the Saints of God (who were wiser then the sons of men) how they have Laboured to be of the number of this Church, Gods elect people, enduring infinite calamities,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25.</note> and rejecting the preferment of this world, and (with <hi>Moses</hi>) rather induring to suffer affliction, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Again, we may divide Gods benefits, as God divideth them himself in the verses before mentioned. Into them that are past, and them that are promised; 1. Deliverance. 2. Eagles wings.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Them that are past. Deliverance. For this we need no other argument, then that which God himselfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In which as in a Type we have seen how God hath delivered us from the spritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, the kingdom of sinne and Satan, and this deliverance from the shadow of death, ignorance, blindnesse, and Gods judgements, doth incomparably passe, that from <hi>

                  <item>2. I have not onely delivered you from the Egyptians, but I have carried you on Eagles wings, saith God. In the Revelation, saith he, to the woman (that is to the<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 4.</note> Church) that he gave her two wings of a great Eagle: which, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the learned, are,</item>

2 For his especial grace, preventing, and following appears 1. In vouchsafing his onely Son for the worlds redemption, and remission of sins. 2. In giving us a measure of Sanctification, and vertue in some degree to live well. 3. In giving us the ministery of his Word and Sacraments, as seals of his promises, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apostles, and Saints esteem so highly. 4. In giving us <hi>pulsationes spiritus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 20.</note> standing at the doors of our hearts, and knocking, inspiring into us good motions to do well, So that if we would in particular weigh these good guifts of nature and grace, which God hath bestowed upon us, we could not but think, that he who doth thus for us, must needs love us, and that if he love us, he will command us nothing, but that which shall be acceptable to him, and profitable for us.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But to make his providence appeare full, adde to these the benefits promised, which are yet to come. We have them in the fifth and sixth verses. If ye will heare my voice, ye shall be &amp;c. and as they had their promises under the Law, so have we under the Gospel better promises for the life to come. In respect of which all the rest are as nothing: When we have the kingdome of heaven, and the blisse thereof, no more can be added to us. These cannot be valued by the Eye, nor by the ear, nor by the heart. The Prophet tels us. The eye hath not seen, nor the ear<note place="margin">Esay 64. 4.</note> hath not heard, nor can the heart under stand, the joyes that are provided for them that seek God. Now we know, that the eye may see much, for our Saviour saw<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 8.</note> all the kingdoms of the world at once; and the Eare may hear many things; but the heart may conceive infinite things in comparison of the senses for apprehension, yet not all them so much as this: therefore the joyes of the world to come must needs be infinite: we usually call that which we cannot value or reckon a <hi>Nemo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> This is that name, which S. <hi>John</hi> speaks of in the Revelation, that no man knoweth, but he<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 17.</note> that receiveth it.</p>
               <p>And whereas the heaven and earth are too good for us, yet he promiseth to create a<note place="margin">Esay 65. 17.</note> new heaven for us, as if this present were not pay good enough for our service. Now the consideration and remembrance of all this, is to this end, to stir up a love in us; for love will make us to do our duties, with ease, diligence, delight, and perseverance, all these will follow love.</p>
               <p>There are but three things that are motives to love. 1. Beauty. 2. Neernesse of nature, or kinred. And 3. Benefits: and these three do even make the brute and savage Beasts to love. Now these three are in God eminently.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For his excellency of Beauty, it appears most gloriously in those things, which he hath made, the world, and the inhabitants, and creatures therein, which being so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in themselves argue a far greater in him. The Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> admiring it,<note place="margin">Zach. 9. 17.</note> breaks out into these words, O how great is his beauty.</item>
                  <item>2. For neernesse in Nature, what neerer Relation can there be, then that of the Creator, and the Creature? Parents are but instruments of our Creation, yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt them the neerest: but God is our Father indeed, not onely by Creation, but<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 5.</note> by a second bond of Adoption, we are his adopted sons. You know that <hi>David</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5.</note> made it a great matter to be son in law to a King; but we are neerer: sons indeed.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 18</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. For benefits: if those which God hath bestowed upon us, and are mentioned before, be not sufficient, take one more. Such was his love to mankinde, and delight to do us good that he spared not his onely son, but made him come down from heaven, to dye for us. So that if these benefits make us not willing to do his will, well may the saying of the Prophet <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>coelum,</hi> be astonished O ye heavens. And so much for the first means of preparation, willingnesse.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The second means of preparation begins at the tenth verse. God said to Moses,<note place="margin">2.</note> Go to the people and sanctifie them to day and to morrrow, and let them wash their clothes, and let them be ready against the third day, for then will I come down, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the first was to make us willing, so the second is to make us able, fit, apt, and capable of his law, In the primitive Church they began their Liturgie with <hi>Sancta sanctis, munda mundis,</hi> so here none are capable of holy and clean things, but holy and clean persons: therefore we must san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie our selves, or else we are not fit to receive the Law of God. The reason is, because if we put an uncleane thing to a cleane, not onely the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59534:57"/>
unclean is no whit the cleaner, but the clean thing is made unclean by it. It is the Prophet <hi>Haggai's</hi> allusion. And our Saviour maketh it plain in the case of new<note place="margin">Agg. 2. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 9. 17.</note> wine and old bottles. If you keep not a proportion between the wine and the bottles,<note place="margin">Luke 5. 37.</note> both will perish, as is said before: so if there be not a proportion between the word and the hearer, he is not fit to receive so holy a thing, and it will turn to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the hearer, and the frustration of the word heard.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The time of preparation or sanctifying prescribed by God here, is two dayes, to day and to morrow, &amp;c. to shew that a convenient time must be allowed for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, not like <hi>Sauls</hi> preparation, who being to encounter his enemies called for<note place="margin">1. Sam. 14. 18.</note> the Ark and the Ephod, and would needs fall to prayer first, before the battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: but hearing of the approach of his enemies, and fearing to loose time by prayer, layes all aside, and sets his people in array, and so his preparation was all in vain: for he did unadvisedly herein. God would have us to continue in our preparation, and therefore he wishes, O that my people would do thus alwayes: for the time<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 29.</note> that is bestowed and spent in prayer is not lost, nay it is the best time that can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed of any.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The sanctification here, was at that time but a Ceremony, a washing, which being a figure to them of Israel, they are examples to us. And as the Apostle speaks,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 11</note> are recorded for our admonition: for every Ceremony hath its equity, to which we are all bound. And though we be not commanded to put our Clothes in the water, yet we must be careful to wash our souls.</p>
               <p>The garments of the old Law, were <hi>Tunica, &amp; stola,</hi> the inward and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward garment, which Saint <hi>John</hi> seems to allude unto: which have washed their<note place="margin">Apoc. 7. 14.</note> robes white, &amp;c. And Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Cleanse your selves from all filthinesse of the<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 1.</note> flesh. We must be cleansed both in flesh and spirit. Now the best way to make our selves clean, is, to see how we became foul, that when we be once washed we may keep our selves clean. Now there is a two-fold pollution whereby we became foul, as in a garment. 1. <hi>Pollutio externa,</hi> outward pollution and aspersion, as spots, or 2. <hi>interna,</hi> grown within, as by Moths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If a man (in the Law) did touch a dead corps, or one that had an issue, by that<note place="margin">Lev. 15.</note> very touch he is made unclean; and by this is allegorized the pollution we receive of the World, by ill examples, ill company, or the like: there is uncleannesse that will defile us with the touch. And secondly, if a man have an issue in his own flesh, he is unclean, that is, the inward corruption which is within us, the concupiscence of our unruly affections, arising from the blindnesse of our mindes, and resistance of our will: and all these had need of washing, and separation. Therefore as the Apostle (upon the first place in Leviticus) speaketh, we must come out from among them, and be separate, and touch not the unclean thing: and it was the same Counsel<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 17.</note> which the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> gave long before. For the second (within our selves)<note place="margin">Esa. 52. 11.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that we are <hi>Templa spiritus sancti,</hi> temples of the holy Ghost:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 16.</note> upon which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Quisque Christianus templum habet in templo, templum in domo, templum foris, ubique &amp; semper templum ambulans,</hi> every Christian hath a temple in his temple, a temple in his house, a temple every where abroad, and ever a walking temple. And because there must be no pollution in a temple, none in Gods<note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 27.</note> temple. <hi>Nihil inquinatum ingredietur in illud,</hi> there shall in no wise enter into it, any thing that defileth: we had need to be careful to wash us so, that all things may be clean unto us, and then all shall be <hi>munda mundis</hi> clean to the clean.</p>
               <p>But if we be once cleansed, we must take heed that we be not defiled or polluted again. He that washeth himself after he hath touched a dead body, and toucheth it<note place="margin">Ecclus. 34. 25</note> again, is defiled, saith <hi>Sirach.</hi> We must not therefore be like the Dog that returns to his vomit: nor like the Sow that walloweth again in the mire. How then may<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 22.</note> we be cleansed? Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> tells us, that there is <hi>balneum erectum a Christo, balneum sanguinis ejus,</hi> by the bath of Christs blood. And this is it, wherein both our aspersions and fluxes may be cleansed away. Of which bath, the water of Baptism is a representation. <hi>Baptismus abluit omnia peccata,</hi> saith the same Father, Baptisme washeth away all sins. <hi>Et Aqua illa non solum sordes corporis mundat, sed animam a peccatis liberat,</hi> that water doth not onely cleanse the spots of the body, but frees the soul from sin.

with us to the worlds end, and wherewith we are daily baptized, for as fire scoureth and cleanseth mettal from drosse, so doth the Spirit of God the filth of our souls. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Spiritus sanctiopus est, &amp; diligentes sanctificare, &amp; sanctos costodire,</hi> to keepus, as well as to make us holy.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But because the Spirit and fire may be quenched, there is another matter added to<note place="margin">John 15. 3.</note> feed it, The cooperation of the word, ye are clean through the word, saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:<note place="margin">Jer. 2. 22.</note> the hearing of the word is a cleanser too, it cleanseth like niter or fullers earth.<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 2.</note> The daily applying of the word checketh that which is amisse in us, and cleanseth our corruption. By this the Spirit purgeth us both within and without: for outwardly<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 25.</note> we must be clean too, or else we come short of a Scribe or Pharisee, for he maketh clean the outside.<note place="margin">15. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But the inward cleansing, washing of the heart and spirit is specially for Christians,<note place="margin">Exod. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> because out of the heart cometh all uncleannesse; and if no concupiscence were, there would be no issue at all: so that he that can scour the foul, shall have no issue.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter of preparation it is said, be ready against the third day: come not at your wives, which seems to be an addition to Gods commandment, and a counsel given by <hi>Moses:</hi> not that this was unlawful, or did pollute, but because it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient at that time, and might perhaps have endangered them, from being so clean as they should be.</p>
               <p>The Jews report, that beside the Law of God, the most ancient saying among them, (that is, of such as they called <hi>Dicta sapientum,</hi> the sayings of wise men) was <hi>facite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> legi,</hi> make a limitation to the Law. As when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Israelites not to enter league or covenant with the Gentiles, they (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 2.</note> they would be sure not to offend against that precept) would not so much as keep company with them, nor drink with them. And <hi>Job,</hi> (whereas the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement<note place="margin">Job 31. 1.</note> was, not to covet another mans wife) made a covenant with his eyes, and not so much as thought upon a maid. So <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the Chapter which is called the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> Chapter of expedience, confesseth, that it is lawful to marry, yet it was better to forbear in that time of persecution; he made a hedge about the Law, abridging the use of a lawful thing, that they might not fall into unlawful.</p>
               <p>Now God forbiddeth none of these in any place of Scripture: It was not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to drink with unbelievers, nor to look upon a maid, nor to marry. Yet we see their counsel and <hi>Moses,</hi> here, come not at your wives. This teacheth us a good point of wisdom, not to go too neer the edge of the bank, lest we fall into the ditch, not to come too neer the pit, lest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in.</p>
               <p>And the ground of the equity of this command brings in a third reason, to shew, that we have need of inward cleansing. A clean thing may be defiled, not onely by an unclean thing, but by a thing that is not of as high a nature and degree, as it self, that is, not as good as it, though it be clean. As a holy thing being touched with that which not as good as it self, is unhallowed. If one hear holy flesh (its the Prophets<note place="margin">Haggi 2. 12.</note> question) in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oyl, or any meat, shall it be holy? and the Priests answered, No. And<note place="margin">Isay 1. 22.</note> the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> tels us of two things to the same purpose. 1. That their silver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came drosse, and their wine was mixt with water. Now the drosse defileth the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, because it is nought, but water defileth wine, because it is not of so good a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it self. So is brasse with gold. So we, if we set our souls upon inferiour things, and earthly, make a mixture; and though they be not unclean, nay, though they be lawful, yet there will be a pollution. And in what respect it comes to defile, the<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> Author to the Hebrews sheweth, and makes a distinction; telling us, that we must not onely forbear sin, that besets us, but also lay aside every weight that hinders us in our Christian race. This weight is not properly sin, but an impediment, and because<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12.</note> it hindreth, it must be laid aside. He argues thus. All things are lawful, but all things are not expedient: Lawful things, when they hinder, must not be used; if lawful things begin once to be unexpedient, a Christian is not to use, but eschew them. By the use of indifferent things we are sometimes brought under their power, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come predominant over us: And therefore we are so to use them, as that we come not under the power of them, that we may forbear them when we will, and use them when we will. Though the use of mariage be lawful, yet because as <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, it may be a hinderance to fasting and prayer, it is not to be used at such times
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59534:58"/>
as those duties are required. For the Devil insinuates into us, and deceives us, not onely by evil things, but also by those which are good in their own nature; by Gods<note place="margin">Psal. 69. 23.</note> good creatures, by his gifts, and we are no lesse to take heed of him in indifferent<note place="margin">109. 7.</note> things, then in evil. Our tables may be a snare unto us: And the thing which should<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 5.</note> be unto us for our welfare may be an occasion of falling. So Prayer (one of the most<note place="margin">2.</note> excellent duties of a Christian) may be turned into sin. The like may be said of Almes. These things are spoken to this purpose, that as <hi>Moses'</hi>s counsel was, Come not at your wives, which is a thing lawful: yet if by circumstance of time or place, or the like, these lawful things make a man slow in the service of God, we ought to refrain them, and to follow the counsel of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third and last point in preparation is set down in the 12 and 21 Verses, which<note place="margin">3.</note> was to set bounds and marks about the mountain, which the Israelites were not to passe. And the repeating of it, must needs cause us to conceive that there is some weighty thing in it of which we are to take notice. For the Scripture hath nothing vain or needlesse: but as <hi>Joseph</hi> said of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreams, that the doubling of them did shew the certainty, so the doubling here shews the danger if this command be not kept. And the command is to keep the Israelites within their bounds: for as the first part was to make them willing, and the second to make them able; so because a man may be overwilling, or rather curious, and may run too far, here he is abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this third means to preparation sets limits and bounds to our curiosity, that we passe not the marks which God hath set in knowledge of him and his will, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with the knowledge of such things as are needful for us, and revealed to us.</p>
               <p>And here we may take notice of a foolish affection that we naturally have, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding necessary things, by our curiosity in those that are needlesse: and not onely in adventuring things necessary for those which are unnecessary, but with too greedy<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 3.</note> a desire of them, to break Gods Commandements. So we see in the beginning Gods prohibition gave the Devil occasion, to tempt <hi>Eve</hi> to be over-curious to know that she should not. And afterwards, a little before the Law given, <hi>Moses</hi> commanded,<note place="margin">Exod. 16. 19.</note> that none should reserve Manna till the morning, and yet some of them itched to try<note place="margin">25.</note> conclusions, and saved it; so it stank. And they were charged not to go forth on the Sabbath day to gather it, for they should finde none, yet some would needs go out, but they were deceived. The men of <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> would needs be prying into the<note place="margin">1 Sam. ó. 19.</note> Ark of the Lord, but they paid for it: for fifty thousand and threescore and ten of them died for their foolish curiosity. And therefore in this place God commanded, that on pain of death, nor man nor beast should passe their bounds.</p>
               <p>God prohibited the people because they had murmured, not to go into Canaan,<note place="margin">Num. 14 44.</note> yet they would needs go up to the hill too, and were discomfited. It was no necessary<note place="margin">45.</note> thing to go up, yet go they would: and here they were not it seems so hasty to hear and to know, as to gaze: it was not the Law they desired to know, but the place and the Mount, and to be idlely occupied: and therefore God gave the charge three times: for curiosity is an odious thing to God.</p>
               <p>And we see that this very affection of curiosity reigned afterwards in the sons of<note place="margin">Acts 17. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> in moving curious questions, concerning Heaven and Hell, how and where<note place="margin">1. 6.</note> they be, omitting many needful things in the mean time; like the Athenians, that gave themselves to nothing but to tell or hear new things. The Apostles must needs be asking our Saviour, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom? and tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the signe of thy coming, and of the end<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 3.</note> of the world? But as Christ answered them, It is not for you to know the times and seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. So here <hi>Moses, Non est vestrum ascendere montem,</hi> It is not for you to come near the Mount, or to see what is done there, it belongeth not to you.</p>
               <p>This then must be our wisdom, to be content with the knowledge of that which God hath revealed to us: and not to be too curious in prying after those things which he hath reserved to himself. <hi>Secreta Deo, aperta &amp; revelata, nobis &amp; filiis nostris,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> said, secret things belong to God our Lord; but those things which<note place="margin">

And this is the same which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle counselleth us to do, to keep within the limits which the Holy Ghost hath set us: Not to think of our selves more highly then we ought to think, but to think soberly,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59534:58"/>
to be wise to sobriety. This curious enquiring and searching after needlesse matters, hath been the decay of learning. And the Apostle saith, that such curious inquisitors,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 4. 2 3. 7.</note> shall languish, and be sick with foolish questions, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <hi>Qui inventa veritate</hi> (saith <hi>S. Augustine) aliud quaerit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We have a fearful example of it in <hi>Solomon:</hi> I gave my heart (saith he) to know<note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 17.</note> wisdom, and to know madnesse, and folly: his too great curiosity made him stray too far, and by degrees to connive at most grosse idolatry. <hi>Qui scrutator est divinae maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis opprimetur a gloria,</hi> they which are too inquisitive in seeking out things too high for them, shall perish in their folly. Therefore it is best for us to know our bars, and keep our distance. And thus much for the several means of Preparation.</p>

The terrible delivering of the Law, compared with the terrour of the last judgement, when we must give account for the keeping of it. The comparison in all the particulars. The use of this.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is added also by the learned another point, not a point of Preparation, but a<note place="margin">The manner of delivering the Law.</note> necessary observation in the delivery of the Law, fit for meditation, and it is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the manner of the delivery of it, in the before mentioned Chapter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> upon which the Apostle seems to Comment. For whatsoever might seem<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 18.</note> terrible to man, God made it to concur with the delivery of the Law. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord told <hi>Moses,</hi> he would come in a thick cloud.<note place="margin">Vers. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. With thundering, with lightning, with the sound of a trumpet.<note place="margin">16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now all these as they are fearful sights and objects, so was it done purposely by God, that his Law might be received with the more reverence. And we see it took<note place="margin">Exo. 20. 18.</note> effect and wrought upon them: For upon the quaking of the Mount, and those ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible sights, the people removed and stood afar off, and said to <hi>Moses,</hi> Speak thou<note place="margin">19.</note> with us, and we will hear, but let not God speak withus, lest we dye. Nay, the sight of these things was so terrible, that it wrought upon <hi>Moses</hi> himself, for there we read that <hi>Moses</hi> said, I exceedingly quake and fear.<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>These sights and sounds affect us not, because they are past: but yet the Apostles argument may affect us. If the delivery of the Law was so terrible, how dreadful<note place="margin">25.</note> shall the account be how it is kept? And if the Law being delivered by the ministery of Angels (as <hi>S. Stephen</hi> said) were thus terrible, how dreadful shall it be when God<note place="margin">Acts 7. 53.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 2.</note> in the power of his Majesty shall come to require account of it? Now this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more plainly, by comparing the circumstances in the delivery of the Law, with the day of judgement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which is first mentioned, is a thick and dark cloud. And the Prophet speaking of the day of judgement, saith, The day of the Lord is darknesse, and no<note place="margin">Amos 5. 18.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">19.</note> light. <hi>S. Jude</hi> cals it, the blacknesse of darknesse. And the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> gives the<note place="margin">Jude 13.</note> reason: because the Sun and Moon shall be darkned, and the stars shall withdraw their<note place="margin">Joel 3. 15.</note> light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second, there were thunder-claps. And <hi>S. Peter</hi> saith, that when the day<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 10.</note> of the Lord shall come, the Heavens shall passe away with a great noise, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments shall melt with servent heat, and the Earth shall be burnt up. And no man doubts but these things are more terrible to the eye and the ear, then the noise of a thunder-clap.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is lightning or fire, which then was but upon the mount of <hi>Sinai</hi> only: but at the last day, it shall be all over the Earth. This fire was but as that in the Bush,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 10.</note> which was not consumed by it, nor <hi>Sinai</hi> by this. But our God is a consuming fire,<note place="margin">Apoc. 19. 3.</note> and such a fire as will torment for ever. <hi>S. John</hi> saith, the smoke of it shall ascend for<note place="margin">Mark 9. 43.</note> ever, and the fire shall never be quenched.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is the sound of a trumpet, that pierced the ears of the living onely: but there shall be a more shrill trumpet, that shall be heard, not by the living onely,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59534:59"/>
but by the dead in their graves. The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, saith <hi>S. Paul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 52.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Another thing (which was an effect of the former) was the shaking of the Earth, there but one mountain quaked; but at the last day it is said, Yet once more<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 26.</note> I shake not the Earth, but also Heaven. This removed not the mountain, but that<note place="margin">Luke 21. 11.</note> shall remove both Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>Thus we see the circumstances of both conferred; now let us compare the effects of them. The giving of the Law made onely <hi>Moses</hi> to shake and tremble, but at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of an account of it, there shall be like trembling of all, the very just shall<note place="margin">Nahum 2. 10.</note> tremble too: but the wicked, they shall smite their knees together. They shall go<note place="margin">Esay 2. 19.</note> into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth for fear of the Lord, and<note place="margin">Hos. 10. 8.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 23. 30.</note> for the glory of his Majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. And as our<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 16.</note> Saviour (quoting the words of the Prophet) speaks, They shall say to the mountains, coverus, and to the hils fall on us, and that to hide them from the wrath of the angry Judge. So that we see, by these comparisons, that the delivery did in some sort pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure the requiring of it; but the terriblenesse of that day cannot be expressed. This sound may awake us now; and therefore let us say, as the people said here to <hi>Moses,</hi> let us hear it by the ministery of man: and as the Apostle saith, let us have grace to<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 28.</note> serve God with reverence and fear. For no doubt when Christ shall come from Heaven, he will bring with him a fiery Law, even fire and brimstone, like to the <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 2.</note> Law mentioned and foretold by <hi>Moses.</hi> So much for the circumstances and effects in the manner of delivering the Law.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The end of the Law as given by Moses. 1. It brings none to perfection, and that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of mans corruption, as appears, 1. by the place, a barren wildernesse, a mountain, which none might touch, 2. By the mediatour Moses. 3. By the breaking of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, &amp;c. 2. It brings us to Christ, because given by Angels in the hand of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour: It was to be put into the ark: Given fifty dayes after the Passeover: Moses had a veyl: The fiery Serpent: Our use of the Law, to know our debts as by a book of accounts, then to drive us to seek a surety to pay the debt, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ, and to be thankful and take heed of running further into debt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is yet one thing to be considered, namely, the use and end of the Law,<note place="margin">The end of the Law.</note> which we will collect from the words of the Author to the Hebrews. It bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man to perfection. The Law (that is the Mosaical Law, or the Covenant of<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 19.</note> works, but not the moral Law considered as it is a part of the Covenant of grace) made nothing perfect; but it was the bringing in of a better thing. So that 1. It brings no man to perfection. 2. It brings us to a better thing, that is (as it is in another place,) the Law was our Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; but the principal end of the Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24.</note> as it is delivered by Christ, and become a part of the Gospel, is to be a rule to direct us, and the way to leade us by walking therein to life and salvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the first end. Though it be a Law which carrieth with it the character of the Lawgiver, as those of <hi>Solon</hi> did, (which was mildenesle) and of <hi>Draco,</hi> which was cruelty. So this of God, holinesse, justice, goodnesse, &amp;c. And though it be <hi>manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum sanctum,</hi> an holy Law, in respect of the duties to God; and <hi>justum,</hi>

                  </gap>, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 12.</note> of the duties to men, and <hi>bonum,</hi> good, in respect of our selves: yet by occasion of our corruption and transgression, it bringeth no perfection with it, which appears by seven circumstances.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first is of the place where it was given. That was a vast and barren Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse yeelding no fruit: to signifie, that the Law should be so barren of fruits, that it should not yeeld one soul unto God.</item>
                  <item>2. The second is of the Mountain, which was <hi>Sinai.</hi> And this <hi>S. Paul</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 24. 25.</note> to have relation by way of allegory to <hi>Agar.</hi> It is a mountain in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and therefore holdeth of <hi>Ishmael</hi> the son of <hi>Agar</hi> the bondwoman, and therefore to be cast out with her children, and not to receive the inheritance with <hi>Isaac.</hi> So they which think to bring forth fruit by their own righteousnesse, are like <hi>Ishmael</hi> who
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59534:59"/>
was born by nature, not by promise, as <hi>Isaac</hi> was, whose birth was supernatural: therefore the children of the Law are to be cast out with their mother, because they cannot be perfected by it.</item>

But the condition of grace, the Gospel, is otherwise. We must<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> ascend to <hi>Sion,</hi> the hill of grace, and that with boldnesse. And many have gone up to it. The Prophet speaking of the Gospel of grace, saith: Many people<note place="margin">Esay 2. 3.</note> shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, &amp;c.</item>

But we finde that he was a transgressour of the Law, before he received it, and<note place="margin">Numb. 20. 12.</note> therefore was never partaker of the promise of the Law, that is, to enter into the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Again, his miracles often were destructive, as to drown <hi>

                     <p>Lastly, when <hi>Moses</hi> came down from the Mount, his face did so shine, that<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 33.</note> no man was able to behold him, unlesse a veil were put over his face: which<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 13.</note> shews, that the cleannesse and perfection of that Law is rather to dazle the eyes, then to enl ghten them: but Christ came into the world with so milde an aspect and countenance, as needed no veil.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. The next is of the Law it self. The Tables were broken before they could be delivered, which the Fathers expound to signifie, how that covenant should be made void, and another come instead of it.</item>
                  <item>6. Of the Time. In that very time that the people should have received the Law, they were in the greatest transgression of it that could be, namely, in idolatry and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the golden Calf, and in that respect, very unfit to receive a Law, and so it was broken before it was given.</item>
                  <item>7. Lastly, of the Manner. It was delivered by the terrible blast of a trumpet, to terrifie the people; shewing thereby, that it was a Law of terrour, and would require terrible things at their hands. But the delivery of the Gospel was clean contrary; for that was delivered in a comfortable song, by a Quire of Angels, praysing and giving glory to GOD: a song of peace and joy: whereas the trumpet serves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to denounce war.</item>

                  <item>1. It was delivered by the ministery of Angels. It was ordeined by Angels in the<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 19.</note> hand of a Mediatour, saith the Apostle. Now we know that a Mediatour hath power to end matters as he pleaseth, either to establish or abrogate a Law. So Christ our Mediatour, because for our salvation it could not be otherwise, took upon him in his own person to satisfie God, and abrogate the old Covenant, to establish a new. So the Law brings us to this Mediatour.</item>
                  <item>2. There was a charge given to <hi>Moses,</hi> that the two Tables should be put into the<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 2.</note> Ark of the Testimony, which was but a signe of Gods presence with them: which<note place="margin">8.</note> signe was perfected in Christ, in whom God is present with us, for he is our <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us indeed.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Moses</hi> must have a veil, which was but a Ceremony, to shew the mitigation of<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 14.</note> the rigour of the Law by Christ; for by him the veil is removed. The veil also signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ceremonies of the Law, which referred to Christ, and by him are done away.</item>
                  <item>4. The time when the Law was delivered, was fifty dayes after the celebration of the Passeover, the time of first fruits. And at that very time, the same day, fifty dayes after, at Pentecost came the Holy Ghost in the Gospel. And though we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all we should, yet because those fifty dayes are the time of first fruits, we may offer up our first-fruits, and <hi>inchoatam obedientiam</hi> inchoate obedience accepted by Christ. And this inchoate obedience we shall have, when we shall have new hearts, not of stone, but of flesh. A new heart will I give you, &amp;c. as the Prophet speaks,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 26.</note> which as the Apostle expounds it in the New Testament, written, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of our heart, whereby we shall be made able to offer up<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 3.</note> our first fruits</item>

               </list>
               <p>To make this more plain. Christs wisdom in the Gospel must be ours: for he saith, a man must call himself to account, how he hath used his talent; for God is one that<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 19.</note> will take account of his servants how they have imployed the talents which he hath delivered them, and we must expect to be called <hi>ad calculum,</hi> to account for our talent, and not hide them in the ground with the foolish servant.</p>
               <p>This is the first use of the Law, that it is <hi>tabula supputationum,</hi> our book of <hi>Debitor</hi> and <hi>Creditor;</hi> the tables that we must make our account by, and lets us see, how we stand in case of profit and losse; and in that respect it is <hi>remedium igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia,</hi> a remedy for ignorance.

               <list>
                  <item>1. For the wisdom of God, it appears in the Laws themselves. <hi>Moses</hi> justifieth<note place="margin">Deut 4. 8.</note> it, and challengeth all the Nations of the earth to match them. What Nation (saith he) is there so great, that hath statutes and judgements so righteous, as all this Law? And the wisdom of a Law is best seen in the equity of it. But a little before (to shew more plainly his wisdom) he tels them, that it was their wisdom to keep them, for the Nations which should see that they were kept, would presently conclude and say, Surely this Nation is a wise and understanding people, which they would never do, if they had not conceived wisdom in the framing of them. So that certainly we must<note place="margin">Esay 28. 29.</note> needs confesse with the Prophet, that it came from the Lord, who is wonderfull in counsel.</item>
                  <item>2. For his Authority, (which is <hi>rerum agendarum telum,</hi>) it is plainly demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God himself in the second verse; and manifested by the deliverance of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites out of Egypt, by strong hand. In every Edict and Law proclaimed, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is with the stile of the Prince, intimating thereby his Prerogative Royal, to make Laws, and to publish and see them obeyed. And therefore his authority is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, as to the Law in general, so to those particular Laws which have a reason an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed. As to the second. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, &amp;c. To the third. For the Lord will not hold him guiltlesse, &amp;c. To the fourth. For in six dayes the Lord made Heaven and Earth, &amp;c. and it is the Sabbath of the Lord. Now, if it be true that men expect no reason to perswade them to lay hold of a benefit, then there needs none to make them observe the Law, because it is a benefit; for the Psalmist<note place="margin">Psal. 107. 20.</note> so accounts it. He hath not dealt so with any Nation, neither have the Heathen know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Laws. Yet it pleased God to adde his reason from his own person, though indeed profit be a sufficient Orator. And thus doth God in divers places, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 21. 8. 12. 15. 23. As also <hi>S. Paul</hi> mentioneth it for the New Testament. As I live, saith<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 11.</note> the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confesse to God, which<note place="margin">Esay 45. 23.</note> words are taken out of the Prophet.</item>

Now if we did conceive that any man in the world had our life at such an advantage, that with his very countenance he could make or destroy us, certainly we would be marvellously cautelous to offend him, and very obsequious to please and observe him.

               <p>VVE divided the Law into a stile and a Charge; the first hath been handled. The charge remains, whereof we will now speak. And this is contained in<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 28.</note> the ten words which we commonly call the ten commandments. So doth <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 10. 4.</note> as well to deter men from presuming to adde any more, (in which respect, God wrote<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 15.</note> both sides of the Tables full to prevent the adding to them) as also to take from man, the excuse of being so many that his memory could not bear them. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but few, whereas those of the heathen are infinite.</p>
               <p>These ten for better order and memory sake, receive a division from the subject,<note place="margin">37:</note> and are divided according to the two Tables. which our Saviour in his answer to<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 40:</note> the Lawyer, divideth according to the objects, God, and Man. And this is not his<note place="margin">Mark. 12. 30:</note> own division onely, we finde it in the time of the Law. Our duty towards God is<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 5.</note> set down in Deuteronomy. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy hea t,<note place="margin">Lev; 19. 18.</note> and with al thy soul, and with all thy might. Our duty towards man in Leviticus. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self. From both which places this division of of our Saviour hath its ground.</p>
               <p>Now because love is so often repeated, <hi>S. Paul</hi> makes the end of the Law to be<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 5.</note> love. And in another place, after he hath recapitulated the Law, he reduceth it to this. Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self; for our love proceeding and<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 9.</note> ascending up to God, when we descend and come to our Neighbour, it is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberation of the love we have to God, and every reverberation or reflexion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth a direct beam, so that every man that loves his Neighbour, hath God first in his direct motion, as the immediate and direct object of his love, and then his Neighbour in and for God.</p>
               <p>And as these ten precepts are divided into the two Tables by God, so in the sorting<note place="margin">105.</note> of the precepts to each Table arises some doubts. 1. Between Jews and Christians, and 2. between Christians themselves. 1. The Jews make an even division of them, five in one Table, and five in the other; and they take their warrant from the Psalmist, I have said ye are Gods, and ye all are Children of the most Highest:<note place="margin">Psalm 82. 6.</note> therefore they infer that the fifth Commandment must be referred to the first Table, which immediately concerns God. But seeing in that precept inferiours also are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and they are no Gods, we must exclude out of the first Table the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as not pertaining directly to God, but man. And the Apostle Ephes. 6. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this in expresse words, making this Commandment the first with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that is, the first of the second Table, for otherwise it is not the first with promise.</p>

2. The Church of Rome, and some Protestants, as the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> make the two first Commandments but one, and the last they divide into two, against the consent of most of the Fathers, whom they pretend in other things to follow, thus they make the coveting of Neighbours house or goods the ninth, and the coveting or lusting after his wife, the lusts of the flesh the tenth. That it cannot be thus, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the reasons against it in the tenth Commandment, as you shall hear hereafter) the whole current of the Church hath consented to the division of four and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of theirs. Yet himself in his questions <hi>veteris &amp; novi testament.</hi> q. 7. divideth them plainly as we, and the reason that moved him to the contrary was but weak, upon a bare conjecture that there should be three in the first, because there are but three persons in the Trinity, but by the same reason we may adde the fourth, because of the Unity in the Trinity. <hi>Canisius</hi> hath an argument of great force with them, that the reason of the Law must be be annexed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: but in our division the reason is in the second [for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God] therefore all before is to be referred to the first commandment. But we say that the generall reason went before the Charge, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Preface, and was not to be annexed to any of the Commandments; and that this is a special reason added to the second Commandment, as some other precepts have their special reasons annexed. But howsoever they be divided, if the whole Law be delivered, and we be careful to keep it, the matter is not much, otherwise it will be to little purpose, <hi>si bene numeres, male vero Custodias,</hi> as <hi>Musculus</hi> saith, and therefore we come to the precepts themselves.</p>

               <p>True Religion generally considered and abstracted from the modifications of Jewish<note place="margin">Addition 6.</note> and Christian, rested alwayes principally upon four Articles or propositions. 1 That <note place="margin">concerning the 4 princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of religl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on implyed in the 4 first command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> there is but one God. 2. That none of these visible things we see are God: but that he is of a higher invisible nature. 3. That his providence extends to humane affairs, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God cannot be conceived, but onely in the minde. 3 The third supposes Gods knowledge of humane actions, even of thoughts, for this is the ground of an oath 4. In the fourth God is acknowledged the Author of the visible frame of heaven and earth, in remembrance of which the sabbath was instituted, and that with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er strictnesse then other rites, for here the punishment was capitall, if any offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in others arbitrary: for the wilfull violation of this precept did imply a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall, that God created the world. And from these contemplative notions, arise those practicall vertues, of loving, fearing, honouring God, invocation, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c. The consideration hereof shews the wisdome of God in the excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and perfection of the first table, the like may be shewed in the second table, when it comes to be handled. <hi>Vide Hug. Grotium. De jure belli &amp; pacis. lib. 2. cap. 20. n. 45.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law of the Lord, saith the Prophet <hi>David</hi> is a perfect Law, and therefore commandeth all things that we are to do, and forbiddeth all things that are not to be done: which if it be interpreted onely according to the letter, we shall omit the hundreth part of those things which are commanded or prohibited im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely in them, therefore there must be an interpretation of them.</p>
               <p>This we must hold for an infallible conclusion, that every Law standeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Synechdoche. The reason is, because the Law being to take order for actions, and the actions of man being infinite, both in variety and number (because the circumstances, objects, and degrees, are infinite,) it followeth that the rules also should be infinite, and so exceed the memory of man. Therefore hath God onely set down generall things, and so doth man after his example. And these generalls are to receive Interpretation, and to be applied to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>Now if it be demanded, where, and whence this interpretation is to be had?<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 8, 9</note> The resolution of this we have from <hi>Moses.</hi> If there arise a matter too hard, &amp;c Thou shalt come to the Priests and Levites, &amp;c. and they shall shew thee, &amp;c. And<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> tells us, The Priests lips preserve knowledge, and they must seek the Law at his mouth: and the reason he gives, for he is the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of the Lord of hosts. The Lord Treasurer to <hi>Candace</hi> Queen of Ethiopia, could not go forward without <hi>Philips</hi> instruction. How can I understand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">Acts 8. 31.</note> a Guide?</p>
               <p>But this may beget a second doubt, which is, Whether every thing they deliver be good, or the interpretation they make of every thing be true, and infallible? To this we answer, That there are rules to be observed in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. And unlesse their interpretation be according to those rules, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor true: and if it manifestly swerve from them ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour Christ reprehended the Lawyers, for not interpreting according to the rules: the condition of a Law standing upon a more particular respect,<note place="margin">Matth. 20.</note> there must be more particular rules then the bare letter or sentence affordeth; the interpretation must be to shew the compasse of the Law, how far it exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and how far it restraineth: so that to know the true meaning of every precept, these two things are to be considered to which the rules of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do referre. And they are but two.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Amplificatio,</hi> the extent.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Limitatio,</hi> the exception or restraint.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">The first rule is generall, <hi>viz. Intentio ad scopum,</hi> because the Law depends not meerly upon the letter, but upon the meaning, <hi>Certum est quod is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit in Legem, qui Legis verba observans contra voluntatem Legislatoris fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,</hi> it is without question that he offends against the Law that by observing the words of the Law, goes against the will of the Law maker. Now the purpose of the Law is best known by the intent of the Lawgiver: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio Legislatoris voluntas Legis,</hi> the intent of the Law-maker is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59534:64"/>
the will of the Law, for as the Law is <hi>regula mentis,</hi> the rule to square the minde by, so <hi>mens Legislatoris est regula Legis,</hi> the minde of the Lawmaker is the rule of the Law.</p>
               <p>The intent of the Lawgiver is known by his end, for as <hi>bonitas Ethica,</hi> so <hi>bonitas Theologica pendet a fine,</hi> Divine as well as moral goodnesse depends upon the end, therefore in our interpretation we must consider Gods end and, make that ours. The supream end of the Law is Gods glory, as it is in the Prophet. My glory<note place="margin">Esay 42. 8.</note> will I not give to another, and the subordinate end is, <hi>vult omnes salvari,</hi> he will<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 4.</note> have all men saved, as the Apostle testifies. But (as is said before) the best way to take our direction more particularly to know the meaning of a law, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these two, the extent, and restraint or limitation. And first let us take a view of some rules concerning the first.</p>
               <p>Of Extent.</p>
               <p>And for direction in this, the Jews have set down thirteen rules which may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> reduced to these. First, (as they say) in every commandment there is <hi>praeceptum faciens &amp; non faciens,</hi> if the commandment be affirmative it implyeth also the negative, <hi>&amp; e contra,</hi> according to the rules of Logique, <hi>si <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> est faciendum, ejus contrarium fugiendum,</hi> if this be to be done the contrary is to be avoided. And to this purpose, Eschew evil and do good, (saith the Psalmist,) there is<note place="margin">Psalm. 34. 14.</note> the Rule. The affirmatives of the Decalogue are but two, which are the fourth and fifth. The Rabbins finde in the books of Moses two hundred fourty eight affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative commandments, according to the number of the joynts in a mans body, and the negatives in the five books of <hi>Moses,</hi> three hundred sixty five according to the number of dayes in the year: both which added, make six hundred and thirteen, according to the Hebrew letters in the ten commandments.</p>
               <p n="2">The second Rule is, That wheresoever a thing is commanded or prohibited,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there all the <hi>homogenea</hi> (or of the same kinde) to it are forbidden or enjoyned. The same may be seen in mans Lawes. A Law is extended either <hi>Specifice,</hi> or by <hi>Equipollens.</hi> 1, <hi>Specifice</hi> is, when a thing is done that is of the same kinde, but by circumstance is diverse. 2. By <hi>Equipollens,</hi> the Rabbins call those by two names: first, when the ballance hangs equall, the Logicians call it <hi>a pari,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 6.</note> as in the commandment against theft, to set a mans house on fire is as evil as to steal. Secondly, when one is lighter or heavier then the other, from<note place="margin">Esay. 7. 13.</note> the lesse to the greater, <hi>a majori</hi> (as they call it.) If one be bound to honour his Parents, much more to honour God.</p>
               <p n="3">The third Rule is peculiar to the Law of God, which is spiritual. The last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> forbidding the inward desires of the heart, is added as a rule how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> all the rest. When you have extended them <hi>specifice,</hi> and <hi>per equipollens,</hi> then they must be extended to the Spirit: <hi>Lex humana ligat manum, lingua divina comprimit animam,</hi> Mans Law binds onely the hands, but Gods the soul. The true worship of God is in Spirit; and the reason is good, for the heart is the fountain<note place="margin">John 4. 23.</note> of all evil. Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, saith our Saviour. This appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 19</note> by the dream of <hi>Polydorus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch de sera numinis vindicta,</hi> that dreamed in the night, that his heart came to him and said, <hi>ego tibi omnium horum malorum sum author,</hi> I am the cause of all these evils which have befallen thee. The heart therefore is first to be cleansed, by truely planting the fear and knowledge of God in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, that the Heathen would have restrained the heart if they could, but because they could not, they forbare it. The Law of man faileth two wayes, First for want of knowledge of the offender, because they knew not the heart. Secondly, for want of power. As when the number of offenders is so great, or their power of such force, as there is no resisting them, tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must be. Frst, But though with men faults may be so closely carried as that it cannot be found where the fault is, or how it may be remedied: yet with God and his Lawes it cannot be so. For the heart is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (as the Prophet truely saith) above all things, and desperately wicked,<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>quis cognoscit idem,</hi> who knows it? but in the next verse, he answereth himself, that there is a <hi>quis,</hi> a who he is that knoweth it: I the Lord search the heart, I try the<note place="margin">10.</note> reins. There is no defect of knowledge in God. Secondly, neither can there be
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59534:64"/>
so many Offenders, but God is able to destroy them. It is his power by which he rules, saith the Prophet. Did not he in his last act of benefit bring the handfull of Israelites from the power of <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> and indeed who is able or hath resisted his power.</p>
               <p>Concerning the first, the omniscience of God. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, If the candle burn he seeth thee, if the candle be out he seeth thee, he seeth all thoughts, both present and past, and thy thoughts to come; therefore it is justly said, that the Law is spiritual.</p>
               <p>Now for the thought, we may observe therein these several steps and degrees.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Cogitatio ascendens,</hi> the suggestion arising from some former voluntary act or neglect.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Inclinatio voluntatis,</hi> the entertainment of the suggestion.</item>

               <p>And though mans law cannot take hold of all these, yet Gods Law doth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Rule of extension is that, which mans Law hath prescribed. <hi>Cum quid prohibetur, prohibentur omnia per quae pervenitur ad illud, &amp; e contra,</hi> when any thing is prohibited, all things likewise are forbidden, that are the means to it, and so on the contrary. The Jews say, <hi>Ambulandum est in praeceptis per viam regiam,</hi> we must walk in the commandments, not by a by-path, but in the rode, in the Kings high way. The reason is, The goodnesse of a way or motion dependeth on the end: so that if these or these means bring to an evil end, they are evil, and consequently not to be used in good things, neither are we to seek God by them. We must not so much as stand in the way of sinners. So if a thing be good, the omission as also<note place="margin">Psalm 1. 1.</note> the means be evil, <hi>Bonae legis est, non solum tollere vitia, sed et occasiones vitiorum,</hi> it is the property of a good law not onely to take away sin it self, but the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also of sin,</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Rule is, <hi>Cum quid prohibetur vel jubetur, prohibentur vel jubentur omnia, quae consequuntur ex illo,</hi> when any thing is prohibited or commanded, the consequents that follow thereupon, and the symptomes of them are also forbidden or enjoyned. As in the case of Pride, the holy Ghost condemns the symptomes of it, a proud look, and a high stomach. And the prophet condemneth walking with<note place="margin">Psalm 101. 7.</note> stretched forth necks, and mincing gates. And the Apostles <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and <hi>S. Peter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">131. 1.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Esay 3. 16.</note> frizling and platting of the hair, and vain apparel. And God himself threatens to<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 9.</note> punish such as should be clothed with strange apparel, because all these are not the<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 3.</note> signes of modesty and decency, but Consequents of pride. God will have the signe<note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 8.</note> go with the thing signified.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The sixth Rule is, That we must not be accessory to the sins of others, but seek to hinder sin in others, and to draw others to the observing of the commandment, as well as to keep it our selves. <hi>S. Paul</hi> speaks of some, and reproves them that<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 10.</note> consent with them that do things worthy of death. For <hi>accessorium sequitur natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram principalis, &amp; agentes &amp;consentientes pari poena plectantur,</hi> both principal and accessory were to be punished alike, and the reason is, because the law is not onely to be observed, but preserved; we must not only be observers of it, but take care too that it be kept by others. <hi>Sic luceat lux vestra,</hi> saith our Saviour, let your light so shine before men, that they seeing your good works may glorifie your Father<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 16.</note> which is in Heaven. God will have glory from us, not for us, from others by us. We must have a care that God may be glorified both in our selves and others; so that we must not be accessory to any thing whereby God may be dishonoured, and we be made guilty of other mens sins, and so they become ours.</p>
               <p>Now there are seven waves whereby we become accessory and partakers of other mens sins. The first two concern Magistrates, and all other Superiours: the other five all men alike.</p>
               <p>The first is in Magistrates and Superiours. <hi>Jubendo</hi> by commanding, if (as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Prophet saith) they decree unrighteous decrees; and command any thing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful<note place="margin">Esay 10. 1.</note> by way of law. As <hi>Nebuchadnez.</hi> that enacted a law for Idolatry, that the people<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 4, 5. 6.</note>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon the Magistrate for commanding it, and he is accessory to Idolatry<note place="margin">1. Sam. 22. 18</note> if the people commit it. So <hi>Saul</hi> was guilty of killing the Priests, hough <hi>Doeg</hi> slew them becau se it was his command. So, though <hi>Ananias</hi> rose not out of his seat to strike <hi>S. Paul,</hi> yet because he was stricken at his commandment, the<note place="margin">Acts 23. 2, 3.</note> blow reached unto him, and <hi>S. Paul</hi> called him a painted wall for it, and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Gods judgement against him for it. <hi>David</hi> did not in person put <hi>Vriah</hi> in the forefront of the battel, but <hi>Joab;</hi> yet because he wrote to <hi>Joab</hi> so to do, the murther<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11. 15</note> of <hi>Vriah</hi> was laid to <hi>David</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Nathan. Jezebel</hi> was far off when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12. 9.</note> was stoned, but because she wrote to the Elders of Israel to proclaim a fast and<note place="margin">1. Reg. 21. 8.</note> to set <hi>Naboth</hi> on high among the people, and to set wicked men to witnesse salfly<note place="margin">9.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">10.</note> against him, and to put him to death, she was made guilty of his death.</p>
               <p>The second is, <hi>Permitten to</hi> by toleration, and is the other way whereof the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Magistrate or Superiour may be guilty, by Permission or Connivence at anothers sin. As when a man is in authority, though he command not an evil thing, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath power to restrain men from committing evil, and doth it not, he shall be in fault. If the people of the land do any wayes hide their eyes from the man<note place="margin">Lev. 20. 4.</note> when he giveth his seed unto <hi>Molech,</hi> and kill him not. Then will I set my face<note place="margin">5.</note> against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off That is, if the people in whom it lay to execute punishment for it neglected, and suffered the Malefactor to live, the fault should be theirs as well as his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith that the Magistrate hath the Sword committed into his hands, <hi>Vt mali, si non dimittant voluntatem, amittant facultatem peccandi,</hi> that wick d men should be disabled of their power, if not of their will to sinne. <hi>S. Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing a Civil Magistrate, saith, that he bears not the Sword in vain, and tells the<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note> end wherefore he bears it, as a Revenger to execute the wrath of God upon him that doth evil. And the same Apostle (to set down a rule for the Ecclesiasticall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate) inveigheth against those of Corinth, for not excuting an Ecclesiastical Censure upon an open Offendor, but suffered him to continue in the Church. And<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> this rule extends also to Domestique government, as that of fathers concerning their Children. Because the sons of <hi>Eli</hi> made themselves vile, and he restrained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For a perpetual oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bry<note place="margin">John. 19. 16</note> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> it is recorded, that he delivered Christ to the Jews to be crucified. What a fair shew made he? What washing of his hands, with much other pretexts, as publishing his Innocency (before all the people) concerning Christs death? yet because he was chief of the Province, and had authority to have kept the Jews from putting Christ to death, he was guilty of the death of our Saviour. <hi>

And it pleased the Holy Ghost throughout the whole course of the history of the Kings of Israel and Juda, to leave this as a blot upon wicked Kings <hi>quia non sustulerat excelsa,</hi> because they permitted high places to stand. And therefore <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith very well to all in authority. <hi>Tu imple officium tuum, alioquin Deus &amp; de te &amp; de ille implebit suum,</hi> be sure thou do thy part, and perform that which thy place requires, else God will perform his, both upon thee and the offender. And it is better <hi>sentire lenitatem patris quam seueritatem judicis,</hi> to feel the lenity of a father, then the severity of a Judge.</p>
               <p>The third is <hi>Provocando,</hi> by provocation. The two former were subsequent to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> actions, the two next are antecedent. Provocation is two ways, <hi>Vrgendo, Alliciendo,</hi> by urging or alluring.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By urging as, <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, dost thou still retain thine integrity? Curse God and die. Or when men by provocation, urge men to blasphemie or<note place="margin">Job. 2. 9.</note> anger &amp;c.</item>

               </p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Suadendo,</hi> by perswading. A man may be accessory by giving evil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> or advice.

In Ezra, evill Counsellors were hired to hinder<note place="margin">Esr. 4. 5.</note> the building of the Temple. <hi>Absalom</hi> commited incest with his fathers Concubins,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 21.</note> yet the sinne is imputed to Achitophel, that put it into his head. <hi>Herods</hi> wives<note place="margin">Mar. 6. 24.</note> daughter asked <hi>John Baptists</hi> head, but <hi>Herodias</hi> the mother counselled her to ask it,<note place="margin">John, 11. 50.</note> therefore his blood is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And these two last precede the Action.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Consentiendo,</hi> by consenting to other mens sinnes, and this brings us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> within compasse of accessory.</p>

               </list>
               <p>The last is <hi>Defendendo,</hi> by maintaining. When we commend and flatter men in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> sins, or excuse them, when they have offended. He that saith unto the wicked, thou<note place="margin">Pro. 24. 24.</note> art righteous, him shall the people curse. And the wise man in another place, <hi>lactant</hi>

                  <hi>amicos suos &amp;c.</hi> enticing his neighbour, and this <hi>lactatio peccatorum,</hi> alluring of sinners is the way that leadeth to destruction. For though suck kinde of mens words seem to be softer then butter, yet there is war in their hearts, and though they seem smoother<note place="margin">Psal. 55. 22.</note> then oyle, yet are they very swords. By good words and fair speeches such men deceive the hearts of the simple. But there is a woe pronounced by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 18.</note> against such men. Wo unto them that call evil good. And another Prophet calls<note place="margin">Esa. 5. 20.</note> them dawbers, that say peace, and there was no peace &amp;c. And a little after he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth<note place="margin">Ezech. 13. 10.</note> a woe against them that sow pillows under mens arms. Such were <hi>Ahabs</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18.</note> false Prophets. But especially <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> which made himself horns of iron, and said (falfly) <hi>ic dicit Dominus. Non semper corrupta mens male oper antis, at semper corrupta</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kin. 22. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>male defendentis,</hi> the minde that doth ill is not ever corrupt, but that which defends<note place="margin">11,</note> ill, is.</p>
               <p>Lastly, besides these, there is another way whereby a man may be guilty of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> another mans sins, <hi>ratione scandali,</hi> by giving of scandal, or by doing some act where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by another stumbles and fals into some sin, thus <hi>per accidens</hi> a man may partake of anothers sin, and that not onely in actions sinful, by giving evil example but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in things lawful, and indifferent, clothed with such circumstances, whereby the weak, that is, the ignorant may be drawn to some unlawful act; as when some did
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59534:66"/>
eate of things sacrificed to Idols, no way in it self unlawfull, others were thereby occasioned to commit Idolatary, Romans, 14. Yet here we must consider, that if the thing we do be indifferent in it self, yet if commanded by lawfull authority we must not forbear it: <hi>potius scandalum admittatur, quam veritas amittatur,</hi> as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, rather let offence come, then the truth be lost; I may adde, rather then any act necessary <hi>vi pracepti;</hi> be omitted, and so a sinne of omission follow: for this is <hi>scandalum acceptum, non datum,</hi> a scandal taken, and not given, and in this case we may say as Christ of the Pharisees, if they will be offended, let them be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but if the thing be not <hi>sub pracepte,</hi> but wholly in our own power, and no way necessary, we ought to forbear till the weak brother may be informed of the lawfulnesse of the action; but if he will not be informed or rectified, tis not weaknes but wilfulnes in him after sufficient means of information, and no man need to abridge himself in his liberty for the pleasing of such persons.</p>

               <p>The commandment against swearing the Pharisees restrain it, either to, Thou shalt not forswear, or, Thou shalt not swear by the name of <hi>Jehovab.</hi> But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour<note place="margin">Math. 5. 34.</note> by the second rule of extension saith, Thou shalt not swear at all, but your conversation should be yea and nay; and so forbids all unnecessary oathes, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares from the end of an oath, which as the Author to the Hebrews, Heb. 6. 16. saith, is to be an end of all weighty controversies and not to be used upon every light and triviall matter.</p>
               <p>They restrain the Commandment, Thou shalt not kill, that is, not the innocent, and restrained it to the outward act, and thought it fit for a man to revenge an injury.

               <p>They in the Law against adultery held, they might have as many wives as they would, by way of divorce. But Christ by the fourth rule of extension tells them, they must avoyd all occasions of adultery; we must not look upon a woman to hust after her.</p>
               <p>They restrained the word [neighbour] in the parable of the Samaritan, to them<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 30</note> that dwelt neer them: but Christ by the rule of <hi>aequipolleus</hi> extendeth it to every man; so that Christs interpretations warrant extensions.

               <p n="1">1. Every Prince challengeth to himself a prerogative Royall to dispense with his<note place="margin">2.</note> own Laws: the word cometh <hi>a dispensando</hi> proper to a Steward; so are all princes to God. This priviledge, as it is allowed to earthly Princes, of great right doth God challenge it. For their dispensations commonly proceed from will or affection, which oft times is corrupt; but Gods will and his justice go together, therefore there can be no danger in his dispensations. Their rule is, <hi>Quod licitum est ex superve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niente causa mut atur,</hi> that which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> may be changed by a cause which may come unlooked for; and so in some cases, God hath somtimes restrained his Law. The warrant of this, is either by his word, as the setting up of the brasen serpents image against the second commandment, or by ratifying by some special signe, and blessing men extraordinarly above the course of mankind, when any pretend exemption or special dispensation, these dispensations are exemptions from the common Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are priviledges, and are to be restrained to the persons to whom they were granted. It is a maxime in Law, <hi>Quae exorbitant a jure communi non sunt trahenda in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentiam argumenti vel exempli;</hi> things which agree not with the common Law are not to be drawn into the consequence, either of argument or example. Though wee are willing to make many restraints, yet they are but few which God allows; as he said of the good Emperours, so may we say of them, they may all be graven upon one side of a peny: and therefore the more restraints we make, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury we do to God. It is the commendation of a Law to have the fewest excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and priviledges; for where the dispensations are fewest, there is most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>: and therefore it is, that in Gods Laws there are not so many as in others.</p>
               <p>The slaughter of <hi>Phinees,</hi> the robbing of the Egyptians are not restraints, and if they were, yet it is certain, that they are not for us, nor our times, nor have we the special warrant of the voice of God for them; and it may be sufficiently proved, that many things in the old Testament (supposed to be restraints) were not so, but kept to the uttermost. And this is to stop the mouthes of vain persons, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain themselves within the ordinary course, and we have but little use of this rule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second rule is from the nature of a precept, which in sundry cases gives a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59534:67"/>
As in the fifth commandment to honour superiours; as to Princes, who having no superiour on earth are exempted from this, (saving the reverence they owe to their natural parents.) And in the fourth which is an affirmitive precept, the practise is not required at all times. The rule of an affirmative precept is <hi>Semper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The School-men say, that affirmative precepts binde <hi>semper</hi> but not <hi>ad semper,</hi> they binde allwayes, but not to the actual performance at all times, but at convenient and set times: but negatives binde <hi>semper &amp; ad semper,</hi> we must at no time go against a negative precept. For the nature of doing a good thing well, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus, that there must be a concurrence of all due causes and circumstances toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which belong thereto. <hi>Malum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now all causes and circumstances cannot alwayes concur, and consequently affirmative duties cannot alwayes be practised; therefore in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative part we are exempted by the nature of it, and secondly, the ardour of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is required in doing good, sheweth, that it cannot be practised perpetually, or at all times,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third and last is of greatest use. And this upon sundry occasions receiveth diverse judgements. The case is called <hi>Antinomia,</hi> a conflict of Laws.

And this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itus</hi> is to be had, one of these two wayes, first, If the two precepts can be reconciled between themselves then there's no perplexity or necessity of sinning, for he may, as the Schools say, <hi>de ponere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>If they cannot be reconciled, then <hi>Agendum est id quod est major obligatio,</hi> that must be done, which we are most bound to do; for God hath ordained things in order 1. The first and principal end is his own glory, 2. The next is a mans own salvation, 3. The next is the salvation of our brethren. Therefore Gods glory must be preferred before our own salvation: if these two could stand in competition: and our good before our brothers, we must not commit sin to deliver him from sin; yet our own temporal good must not be preferred before his spiritual good, we ought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now Gods glory being the end of the first Table, and the good of our selves and our brethren, the end of the second Table, we see the order between them, and how the one ought to give place to the other; but usually it falls out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wise; for, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith the love of temporal commodity, and the fear of temporal displeasure so blindes the eyes of men and poisons the love of God: upon this ground we may resolve, when there's a conflict, as it is somtimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the first commandment and the fift, obey God, and obey your rulers; when this <hi>Antinomia</hi> falls out, it is easily reconciled.

               <p n="3">3. There is a maxim in our Common Law, that <hi>Juris interpretatio non debet laedere jus regium,</hi> and if there be not a restraint to <hi>obedite praepositis vestris,</hi> Obey your Rulers, we shall prejudice Gods authority, and what is this, but <hi>laedere jus regium,</hi> all Rulers are onely <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now follows the conflict of the Commandments among themselves.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In the first Table three Commandments are moral and perpetual, the fourth temporary or positive and ceremonial in part. <hi>Cedat temporale <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <item>2. In the second Table, the Table of Justice hinders not the civil Magistrate from doing justice according to to the fifth Commandment; for we know that the nature of justice is, <hi>Vt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A man is either to fulfil the Law <hi>faciendo quod debet,</hi> by doing that which he is enjoyned, or <hi>patiendo quod debet,</hi> by suffering that which belongs to offenders, and the Magistrate in Gods right is to punish him, <hi>ut, si non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <item>3. If any of the second Table come in competition with the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to give place, because that is <hi>de communi bono,</hi> the other <hi>de privato.</hi> And it is an undeniable rule, that <hi>commune privato praeferendum,</hi> that which concerns the common good is to be preferred before any mans private, the general before the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. And for the five last Commandments, which forbid any wrong or damage to our neighbour, that excellent order, in which God hath rancked them, shews which are to give place to the other; for damage against life is greater then against chastity; and against chastity, greater then against his estate; and against his estate or goods, greater then against his fame: for life is more precious then chastity, chastity then substance, substance then fame: and again, sinful actions are greater then words, and words then thoughts, which are last. There can be no better order then God hath set down for all; therefore the Schools resolve well, not onely <hi>charitas,</hi> but also <hi>ordo charitatis cadit sub praecepto.</hi>

               <p>THese are three especial points to be further observed throughout the whole course of the Commandments.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Commandments run in the second person singular, Thou shalt not do this or that. The stile of Gods Laws is not like the stile of the Heathen Laws, in the third person plural, <hi>Deos adeunto caste.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That (except two) they all are negative.</item>
                  <item>3. That (except the fourth and fifth) they all run in the future tense.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the first. We see in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> God speaketh to the people of Israel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 5.</note> as unto one man. <hi>Audi Israel non habebis alios Deos coram me,</hi> Hear, O Israel, thou shalt have no other Gods before me. He speaketh to all, and to all alike, as well to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as to the meanest of the people. It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of equality in respect of the bond of observing the Law of God, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one is excepted more then another. As we see in that Commandment, <hi>Non maechaberis, Nathan</hi> said to King <hi>David, Tu es bomo,</hi> thou art the man. And<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>John Baptist</hi> to <hi>Herod</hi> though a King too, <hi>Non licet tibi, &amp;c.</hi> it is not lawful<note place="margin">Matth. 14. 4.</note> for thee, &amp;c. So neither do the Commandments leave us in a generality that so we may slip our necks from them: but they are in the second person that whosoever heareth or readeth them, they shall be as strong to him, as if there were as many <hi>Tues,</hi> as persons that hear them.</p>
               <p>Therefore every one upon reading or hearing the Law in the second person, ought to apply it to himself, and the speaking of it in this manner is as forcible as if God himself did speak to every particular man.</p>
               <p>By the using a negative or countermand, there is implicitely a confirmation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that which is contrary. It is held in Logique, that <hi>ad plura se extendit negatio, quam affirmatio.</hi> It was Gods purpose to have his commandments beaten out as far as the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59534:68"/>
rules of extension used by Christ would permit: and his intent is, that affirmative duties should be done after the impediments are removed. And though <hi>ad negatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, non sequitur affirmatio oppositi,</hi> yet the Rule of Logick holds onely in bare affirmative and negative propositions, not in affirmative or negative precepts, for in these, <hi>Qui negat prohibens, jubet promovens.</hi> In Laws, <hi>Qui prohibet impedimentum, praecipit adjumentum,</hi> he that forbids the obstacle commands the helps.</p>
               <p>And this also serves to shew how full of weeds our nature is, that it is not capable of a command, but first of a countermand. We are not capable of good, before that which is ill in us, be weeded out of us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the future tense is so much used in the Commandments, it is an implicite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> touch of our transgressions past, and that for the time to come it is doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain what we will be: for the time past it shews that we have been grievous transgre ssours, and is withall a warning of the pronenesse of our nature to ill for the time to come: that even then we will be as ready to do wickedly as ever before; for as there is one that will say, <hi>facies,</hi> so there is another as ready to say <hi>faciam.</hi> Evil suggestions, evil examples, our own corrupt natures, and <hi>Sathan</hi> besides will egge us forward; and therefore we must keep a diligent watch and abridge our selves of things lawful; we must flee from the smoak, abstain from all appearance of evil<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 22.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> (as the Apostle speaks) that the body of sin reign not in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in the second place, it imposeth a continual keeping of the Law, so long as we live. It is for to day, to morrow, and to our lives end, and therefore our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare against sin must be to blood and death, and before such time we are not discharged from the obligation of the Law.<note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the commandments themselves.</p>
               <p>The end of the Law is to make a man good, and here also are some things to be noted from the order here observed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Impediments are to be removed that we may keep the Law, therefore this first Commandment runs negatively. As when the frame of a building is to be erected, if a tree be standing in the way, it must be cut down, or if the ground be not sure and dry it is not meet to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> an house upon: or as in a cure in Chyrurgery, if the whole Body be corrupt or some member be dead, and the flesh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that must first be cut away before any thing be applyed to the grieved part. Ground must be fallowed before corn be sowen. And so God hath provided by his Law running negatively,<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 3</note> and that in the front of it, <hi>Non habebis, &amp;c.</hi> false Gods must be renounced that the worship of the true God may take place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second observation followeth, that that be done first which is first in Order. As in a building the foundation is first laid, and in natural generation the heart is first: this also is done here. First, <hi>Non habebis deos alienos coram me,</hi> thou shalt have no other Gods before me. This is the foundation of all worship, inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and therefore in the first place mentioned. We are to observe our former rules, <hi>fines mandatorum diligenter observandi sunt,</hi> we must therefore know what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God had in giving this Commandment.</p>
               <p>One end of the Law as is said is to make men good. And the ultimate end or scope of this, and all other Commandments is the glory of God. The whole first<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 13</note> Table refers to Godlinesse, Holinesse, Religion: Now Religion being an action, it mvst needs proceed from some inward principle and so doth it; which is from the soul of man, and principally from the spirit of it, which in this regard is compared to a Treasury, out of which good men bring good, and evil men evil things. Our<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 25</note> worship and service of God will be according to the treasurie of our hearts, the spirit: if that be good our outward worship will be so too.</p>
               <p>We see then, that inasmuch as the spirit is the chief and principal thing in Gods worship, our chief and principal care too, ought to be had for this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual worship. And indeed it is the scope of this first Commandment. It is said, that according to the superiour end, the Commandment is to be esteemed. <hi>Quo prior finis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> prior necessitas,</hi> hence it is that the first Table is to be preferred before the second; because spiritual worship required in the first, is before outward worship, prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the second Commandment. So man was made the end of the Sabbath, not the Sabbath the end of man. <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 27. therefore the breach of the external part of the Sabbath must yeeld to the necessities of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59534:69"/>
                  <hi>Whereas the worship of God is commonly divided into spiritual and bodily, or inward</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Addition 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and outward, and the one said to be commanded in the first, the other in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;</hi>

                  <hi>this must not be so understood, as if they were several kindes of worship: for the same act of Religion may be both inwardly and outwardly performed; as we see in mental and vocal prayer, but they import onely the different manner of performing, as either by the heart alone, which is onely spiritual, or by the heart and outward man, which is the same spiritual worship performed by the body, and therefore called outward: for the outward worship of the body proceeding from the heart or spirit may be truely called spiritual, because the exteriour act proceeds from the spirit, and God accepts such worship, though it be outward in respect of the act, as a worship in spirit and truth, when</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 4.</note> 
                  <hi>it is accompanied with truth and sincerity of heart: and therefore as all worship and obedience is the same both inward and outward, so in some sence that commandment which requires the one, requires the other; for every precept is given to the whole man, though chiefly to the soul, and to the body as the instrument of the soul: yet in regard that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wip may be performed either by the heart alone, or by the whole man, therefore that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction may be in some sort admitted, and so it may be said that the first commandment looks chiefly to the heart, though not excluding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <argument>
                  <p>In the first Commandment three things are contained. 1. We must have a God. 2. We must have the Lord for our God. 3. We must have him alone for our God.

               </argument>
               <p>THis first precept is <hi>primae necessitatis,</hi> and therfore first to be regarded, it was never dispensed withal, nor ever shall be. And according to the first Rule of extension, <hi>Praeceptum faciens &amp; non faciens.</hi> It being a negative implyeth an affirmative.

               </p>
               <p>There are three propositions which naturally arise out of this Commandment.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That a God we must have.</item>
                  <item>2. That we must have the Lord for our God.</item>
                  <item>3. That we must have him alone for our God.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The meaning of the first is, that we should not be Gods our selves (which was<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note> the beginning of all mischief, <hi>Dii eritis,</hi> ye shall be Gods) in judging good and evil at our own election: but to acknowledge a superiour power from whence we are to take our rules and directions, both in following good and abstaining from evil, and not to be led by our own affections. And to this superiour power so instructing us, and promising to bring us to the full fruition of the chiefest good, we should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our selves, acknowledge him, and tye our selves to him, which acknowledging and tying our selves to him, is the proper act of Religion, which is therefore called <hi>

                     </gap>, a religando,</hi> as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> derlves it: this is in the first place to have a God, and a Religion, and consequently to worship him as God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The meaning of the second is to inform us, that the Gods of the Nations are but Idols no Gods, and therefore the service and worship done to them is false and Idolatrous. But <hi>

                  </hi> our God who hath manifested himself many wayes to be the true God, is the onely God, and his religion true religion, and therefore we are to shake off, all worship and service to others, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

1. Now the opposite sinne to the first is called Prophanesse, when a man will be carried by his own affections in every thing, and do that which seemeth good in his own eyes, when he will be under no yoke or bands but breake them, giving credit to nothing but what his own God (corrupt reason) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. The sinne contrary to the second is false worship and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> religion. The holy Ghost is pleased here to call it the having of other Gods, as in the Scripture he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And this is forbidden in the second pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.<note place="margin">Psa. 81. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The sinne against the third, is that which <hi>Elias</hi> called mixt worship; halting between two opinions, mingling Gods religion with others, following both God<note place="margin">1 Kin. 18. 21;</note> and <hi>Baal,</hi> Like the Samaritans, that feared the Lord, when he sent lions among them, and yet served the Gods of the nations whence they came, they sware by the Lord, and by Miclcom. A sinne that divers of the kings of Israel and Judah were taxed with. 2 Kings, 13.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Now these are three things which the devil aymeth at. and hath helps in our nature to set forward and bring to effect his purpose. According to his own name <hi>Belial,</hi> he is without yoke, so would he have others to be also. His argument in the first temptation, was to have <hi>Adam</hi> cast off his yoke, and be under no director. Tast but the apple, and thou shalt be a director to thy self, and be able of thy selfe without any other guide to judge of good and evil. And this vain desire of licentiousnesse, whereby men (by corruption of nature) delight dissolutly to follow their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, and in all things to sit Judge in defining good and evil, is the high way which leads to the greatest transgression, opening the door to prophanesse and Atheisme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So in the second place there is a marvilous itching desire in us of change, which the Devil also nourisheth, Stollen bread, matters of secrecy, strange flesh, &amp;c. And where once prophanes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he faileth not to adde a curious longing to search beyond the truth, till at last he causeth them to finde a lie in stead thereof, for there was never any error broached, but it sprang from a desire of innovation and a wandring out of the beaten path. And this he brought <hi>Solomon</hi> to, who having the knowledge of true Religion as much as any, yet not content, fell to enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after forrein Religions, mystries and conceits. and so fell to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the third, there is also a great desire in us to reconcile God and Mammon. And<note place="margin">Math. 6. 24.</note> though our Saviour said it was impossible to serve both, yet are we desirous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond measure to heape up temporal things and get eternal too, to have a Paradise here and else where; there is a desire in us to communicate our selves to all, and to use a like freedom to good and bad, thinking that while we are in the world, the world will do us good. and when we come to heaven, God will do us good too. And this the devil misliketh not, for he runs not upon <hi>soli</hi> or <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> for when he<note place="margin">Math. 4. 9.</note> tempted Christ with promise to give him all the kingdoms of the earth, it was not upon so strict a condition to worship him onely, but to joyne him with God in his worship and service.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now the reasons whereby these are forbidden are these. We must confesse that the nature of man hath recieved a great wound, insomuch as none can be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of true happinesse by his own guidance or conduct as other creatures attain in some sort: and therefor the heathen confesse with us, that there is a maime and a main defect in mans nature. But we our selves were the cause of it, as appears by the History of the Bible, namely by dealing with the tree, in being our own choosers. And therefore this choosing of ours, this making Laws to our selves must be left, we must leave and submit our selves to the will and choyce of a superiour nature, that knoweth what is best for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the second the reason is evident. that seeing a God we are to have, we ought in all reason to desire a true God. No man would willingly erre, even they that bend themselves to deceive others, cannot endure to be deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And no man desires to think that to be which is not, nor that not to be which is.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59534:70"/>
The reason of the third is. That there be sundry things that a man cannot have, but he must have them alone, without partner or competitor. Of which number a master is one. And God is our Master, he is pleased to call himself so. And our<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.</note> Saviour saith <hi>Nemo potest duobus Dominis servire,</hi> no man can serve two masters,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 24.</note> the service to a master must be to him a lone, else not. And the prophet in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of God faith, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="4">4. Another reason may be added. The joyning of God with any other thing must needs be much to his dishonour and derogation; for he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <argument>
                  <p>In the 1. proposition of having a God, is included, 1. Knowledge of God wherein, 1. The excellency, 2. the necessity, 3. how it is attained. The contrary forbidden is, 1. Ignorance, 2. light knowledge. What we are to know of God. Impediments of knowledge to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved. Rules of direction to be followed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>For the 1. consideration of the proposition. S. <hi>Pavl</hi> saith that an Idol is nothing &amp; we know it, and that ther is no other God but one. And therefore it may seem strange,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 4.</note> that (in respect that Idols nor ought elie be Gods) he should command us to haue no other Gods.</p>
               <p>We say, though a man take armes against his Prince, yet he is his Prince still and he hath no other, and this having, is onely true inrespect of the superiour: yet the rebellious subject hath him not for his Prince or atleast will not have him, because he accompts him not his Prince, the like is between God and us. He is our God and his law is <hi>lex ferrea,</hi> it will hold us and have us, whether we will or no. Yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we rebel against him and endeauor to exempt our selves from his service and obedience, in breaking his laws, we have him not for our God. It is the course of the holy Ghost to use this phrase. They had <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Ashteroth,</hi> not that they were Gods, but that they in their accounts had them for Gods.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again (as the Philosopher) a thing is said to be had, when it is known to be had, for if a man have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> under his ground and knows not of it, he hath it not. Besides a man cannot be properly said to have, that, which he makes no account of, as if he have rushes or cobwebs in his house, and caring not for them, he cannot be said to have them. Therefore a man cannot be said to have that which he knoweth not of, or knowing he hath them regards them not. And so he that will be said to have God, must both know and regard him, and this is that which is meant by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a God.</p>
               <p>It hath been formerly said that the spritual worship and having of God was the end and scope of this commandment. The worship of the spirit is divided as<note place="margin">Devt. 6. 5.</note> the soul. The principall parts of the soul (as God himself makes them) are two.</p>

So if we be ignorant of God, we shall never desire or Love him. and so we shall not have him at all. God must first be known, then Loved.</p>

               <p>Of these Justice and mercy are the two principal, and concerne us most, the other eight have influance upon these two parts to make them the fitter objects of our faith, fear, love, and hope, &amp;c.

In the second place adde the same also to his mercy, that he which loveth us, is 1. A King of eternal majestie and life, 2. Infallible, 3.

                  <item>1. The fruit of hope is 1. Invocation and prayer, for what we want, 2. thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in acknowledging whence we have received it.</item>
                  <item>2.

               </list>
               <p>We are further to understand, that the Holy Ghost in the scripture is pleased by the figure Synechdoche for shortnesse of speech oft times to name one of these, and in that one to comprehend the whole worship of God, as in Saint <hi>John,</hi> all the<note place="margin">John. 17. 3.</note> worship of God is attributed to knowledge. This is life eternal to know thee the onely true God, And in a nother place all to fear, feare God and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 13.</note> for this is the whole duty of man.

And so of the rest, under the name of one duty Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochically are comprehended all the other and this without injury to the rest of the duties, for they all have good dependance one of another.</p>
               <p>Now to these we are to adde the duties of the second proposition. [That we must have the Lord for our God] that is true religion. And of the third [to have him onely for our God] that is pure religion, against joyning of it with other worship. And besides these out of the word [shalt] it must be perpetual, till, <hi>non erit,</hi> swallow up our, <hi>erit,</hi> which implieth the vertue perseverance throw all the Commandments. And <hi>corum facie mea</hi> before me includeth sincerity of heart, against hypocrisy, and these make up the manner of Gods worship.</p>
               <p>In the resolution of this first commandment, the first thing is knowledge of<note place="margin">1.</note> God which in regard of the excellency of it Saint <hi>John</hi> saith (as before) This is life eternal to know thee the onely true God.<note place="margin">John, 17. 3.</note>
               </p>

That therefore our knowledge<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 1.</note> may be right we must pluck from us our peacockes feathers, the gifts of nature, as strength, wisdom, riches, birth, &amp;c.

                  </gap> is the chief knowledge of man to know that of himselfe he is nothing, and that whatsoever he is it is of and for God. And this is the use we must make of our Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is the Necessity of this knowledge. It is not the excellency of this knowledge that altogether worketh upon the desires of all men, and the hearts of many are so dull and heavy that they desire not to be excellent, a meane degree of perfection contents them in it. But when we come to perceive that <hi>necessitas incumbit,</hi> there lies a necessity upon us to get it, a <hi>ferrea ratio</hi> that strong &amp; forcible persuasion; and stricketh to the heart, for the Law is <hi>Doctrina agendorum</hi> and no action can be without moving, no motion without the will, no will without desire, and no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire without knowledge of that we desire. So that take away knowledge, and take away all, and then nothing shall be done.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied but that evil men are in action, they are practicall enough, but their knowledge being deprived of the true end and obejct, we must also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that they must needs erre and fall upon false ends and wayes, wandring in by pathes and never attain to the right end; butthey walk in darknesse, and so they misse of the end for which they came into the world.</p>
               <p>The Apostle saith that without hearing there can be no knowledge, for hearing is<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> called the sense of discipline, and without knowledge ther's no beleife, without faith there can be no love and without love ther's no obedience. And therefore in as much as faith, love, and obedience are necessary, it follows that it is necessary to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as the ground of all vertues whatsoever.</p>
               <p>There is in all these vertues inchoation in this life, and a consummacion in the life to come. The schoolmen call them a first and second perfection or <hi>

                  </gap> tast of that blessed knowledge we shall have in the other. And as the Apostle makes<note place="margin">Rev. 20. 5. 6.</note> two Resurrections, the first and the second, and saith that Blessed is he that hath his part in the first, for he shall have it also in the last. So there are two degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the first is <hi>fides,</hi> faith, the second <hi>visio dei</hi> or <hi>vita aeterna</hi> the beatificall vision, and blessed is he that hath his part in the first, for he shall have his part in the second, the beatificall vision of God. And as in the second Resurrection none shall have part, but they which have part in the first, so none can have their portion in the second knowledge but they that had in the first.</p>
               <p>A witnesse without exception of this, is our Saviour. <hi>Martha</hi> troubled her self<note place="margin">Luck, 10. 42,</note> about many things (and no doubt necessary to the honorable entertaining of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>) yet we know that Christ said <hi>vnum necessarium,</hi> there was one thing necessary, and <hi>Mary</hi> had chosen it, to sit down at Christs feet and learn his will. So that if this be onely necessary, and without it ther's no getting to the end, then have we done with the first part, wherein we see the use and necessity of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the knowledge be so necessary, by what means shall we attain to it? In know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there is a teacher and a learner, we must either finde it of our selves or learn it from others. For our own abilities the Propher hath told us long since what they<note place="margin">Jer. 10. 14.</note> are. Every man is brutish (or a beast) in his knowledge, if he haue none to direct him but his own natural parts he shal attain no more knowledge then the brute beasts. The wise-man saith that we are all vain by nature. We are vain in our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons saith the Apostle. And according to holy <hi>Job,</hi> we utter but vain knowledge,<note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 9</note> therefore having no hope to learn the true knowledge of our selves, and being as<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> far from learning it from other natural men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> our selves, we must look after another<note place="margin">Job. 15.</note> teacher, that hath deeper knowledge then we have. And who that is we shall finde<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 3.</note> in the book of <hi>Samuel, Deus scientiarum Dominus,</hi> The Lord is a God of knowledge, it is he onely that can teach us; and as he is able so is he willing too. Our Saviour<note place="margin">Joel, 6. 45.</note> tells us that it is written in the Prophets, and they shall be all taught of God, for
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59534:71"/>
so saith the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> And thy Children shall be taught of the Lord. And the<note place="margin">Esay. 54. 13.</note> kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> gives the reason, Because that with him is the well of life,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 34.</note> and in his light we shall see light. Though we be naturally blinde, and have no light,<note place="margin">psalm. 36. 9.</note> neither in, nor of our selves, yet in his light we shall see light. And therefore he it is that must be our teacher, and as he must be our teacher, so we may be sure that this teacher is willing to instruct us. Gods loving practise tells us that he is. He began it with <hi>Adam,</hi> and preserved it in the Patriarchs, and then it beginning to decay, he continued it by tradition. After that, people being corrupted, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge decaying, more and more, he wrote the Law, which being broken, he took<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 7.</note> order for a new writing, and enjoyned them to hear it, and appointed Priests and<note place="margin">Neh. 8. 8.</note> Levites; who by interpreting it, caused the people to understand it: for (as the<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> text saith) they read the Law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. When they failed and false interpreters came, he raised up prophets to give the true sense of the Law, and when this was not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, he sent his onely Son, the last and most perfect teacher or doctor of the Church,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> with gifts, for the instruction and edification of his Church, and to continue a<note place="margin">Matth. 28. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> succession of them to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Now as God is the Author of this knowledge, so he provides what is necessary for us to attain it. <hi>viz.</hi> the outward ministery of man, and the inward work of his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the first, we have the Eunuch sitting in his Chariot, and reading a place<note place="margin">Acts 8. 28.</note> in <hi>Esay,</hi> and being desirous to know the meaning of the place, God provides him a Minister, <hi>Philip,</hi> to expound it to him. And so, when <hi>Cornelius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing<note place="margin">10. 30.</note> in fasting, from the fourth hour to the ninth, and falling to prayer, God sent <hi>Peter</hi> to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the second, Our Saviour hath promised on Gods behalf, that God shall<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 13.</note> give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him. So that the outward means being diligently performed on our part, we may rest assured that God will perform his part. Christ in the Gospel perswades the Pharisees, and us in them to search<note place="margin">John 5. 39.</note> the Scriptures, to come to the true knowledge of him, and so to life. That which<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 20. 27</note> remaineth God will supply by the unction of his Spirit, there will be no defect on his part, provided that we look to ours. But the fear is on our part, and it appeareth by the commandment here laid upon us, that we are not willing; for a good man is a Law to himself: but we have a commandment to stir us up to knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now further in this, as in all the other Commandments, we are to consider two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That which is commanded, Knowledge: of which we have now spoken.</item>
                  <item>2. That which is forbidden, Ignorance: of which in the next place.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The affirmative, and the negative part. In the affirmative is commanded. 1. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.<note place="margin">Col 3. 16.</note> 2. A rich measure of it, according as our vocation will permit, <hi>non solum sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, sed etiam bene scire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this negative two things are forbidden. 1. Ignorance. 2. Light superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial knowledge, for the rule in Divinity is, <hi>Peccatum non tantum est appetitus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, sed etiam desertio meliorum.</hi> Where fulnesse is commanded, not onely empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but scarcity is forbidden also. So not onely ignorance, but a light, fleeting and superficial knowledge is forbidden.</p>
               <p>Ignorance, The Church of Rome is taxed to justifie it, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin">1.</note> be found that they are Patrones of it, but onely faulty in allowing small superficiall knowledge in the people, yet if any man conceive, that Ignorance of God is justifiable, let this perswade him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

The second thing forbidden, is a light knowledge, contrary to the Apostles rule,<note place="margin">2.</note> according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith: so that not onely<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> the whole want of faith, but the want of the measure of faith is condemned. When a thing is commended to us in measure, not onely the not having it at all, but the not having the measure of it is a fault: and not onely that, but it is also required<note place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note> that according to our years and guifts our knowledge should increase. We must<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 20.</note> (according to the Apostles rule) be men in understanding and children in malice.<note place="margin">Esay 28. 9.</note> The Prophet goeth lower, Whom shall he teach knowledge, and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. This is as low as may be. Therefore as we grow in years, we must grow in knowledge, and not be ever taught and never learning. To have precept upon<note place="margin">10.</note> precept (as he speaks in the next verse) line upon a line, here a little and there a little, not too much at once.

And it is that which is inveighed against in another place,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> that the Hebrew Christians after much time spent in learning profited no better, but still needed to be catechized in the principles of religion.</p>
               <p>It was prophecied before Christs time, that the succeeding ages should have<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 3.</note> great knowledge, as by <hi>Daniel.</hi> They that be wise shall shine as the brightn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And by <hi>Esay,</hi> All thy children<note place="margin">Joel 2. 28.</note> shall be taught of God, and great shall be the peace of thy Children. And this was<note place="margin">Esay 54. 13.</note> foretold of the primitive Church by the same Prophet. The people that sate in<note place="margin">9. 2.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>S. Paul</hi> was so confident of their knowledge in his time, that he asketh a question, not by way of doubt, but of full perswasion of it, and that not in small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but high mysteries; Know ye not (saith he) that the Saints shall judge the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 2, 3.</note> world? And in in the next verse, Know ye not that we shall judge the Angels?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 34.</note> And we may see that the Corinthians were so forward in Religion, that the women thought themselves able to dispute and teach the weightiest points in it; so that the Apostle is forced to make a prohibition to them, not to speak in the Church,<note place="margin">Acts 18. 3.</note> which argueth much knowledge, though too great boldnesse in them. In the Acts of the Apostles, we see <hi>Aquila</hi> was but a Tent-maker, yet he afterwards attained to such knowledge that he became a pillar of the Church. The Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall story makes mention of <hi>Severus,</hi> that he was at first but of mean condition; yet, afterwards for his knowledge was chosen Bishop of a great<note place="margin">Evagr.</note> See (Antioch.) Now if we consider these, and see how carefull they were to exceed in knowledge we shall think it an odious thing to be of the number of the ignorant. And if, that which the prophet speaks of, prevail not with us, (I have written to them the great things of my Law, but they were counted<note place="margin">Hos. 8. 12.</note> as a vain thing:) because we may pretend the profundity as an impediment. Yet let the tax upon the Hebrews work shame in us, that whereas we<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> should be past the principles, we have not that measure of knowledge in us.</p>
               <p>The extent of our knowledge must reach, as to a discerning <hi>quid verum,</hi> what is true, so to a giving of reason, <hi>quare verum,</hi> why it is true. To prove that we say<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 21</note> or know, as the Apostle; and as our Saviour speaks, to know our own Shepherd and<note place="margin">John 10. 5.</note> his voice; or at least with <hi>S. Peter,</hi> to give a reason of that we hope. Yet is it not<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 15.</note> fit with our Sciols, for the people to enter into dispute of controversies, of discussing great and hard questions: this is not required of them, but of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and others to whose office and place it wholly belongs; for in such things, <hi>sancta simplicitas est virtus Laicorum,</hi> holy simplicity is a vertue in Lay-men: yet as it is not required or expedient they should jangle about every quiddity, so must they not be like them, that know not, nor will understand, but walk in darknesse: nor such as will take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Psalm 82. 5.</note> them to check or controll their teachers, for herein they shew their own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: for if the foundations be out of course, that is, the teachers, how can the building stand, and as <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> If darknesse be upon the tops of the mountains, there must needs be mist in the valleys.</p>
               <p>Before we leave this vertue of knowledge, it will be needful to adde a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,

1. The Object of this knowledge, and 2. Such Rules as are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the use of means to attain it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Object is God, and his Son Christ Jesus.

It is sufficient then for us to know<note place="margin">1.

                  <note place="margin">3. 6.</note> is to be referred to his worship and obedience, therefore so much is necessary for us, as that without which we cannot worship and obey him: more particularly we are to know him in the unity of his Essence, and Trinity of person, as also what he is to us by creation, providence, redemption, and what he requires of us to be done. Therefore it is said, They shall know that I am the Lord their God, which<note place="margin">Exod. 29. 46.</note> brought them forth of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell amongst them. And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place God proclaims himself by his Attributes. The Lord God, merciful, and<note place="margin">34. 6.</note> gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodnesse and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, &amp;c. Besides which knowledge of God, in his nature, and attributes,<note place="margin">7.</note> actions, and relations to us, we are to know what we are to do for him, namely, we must have the knowledge of his will, both in regard of the general duties, what all are to do, and in respect of every one of us in a particular calling, what every one of us is to do in our several rancks and callings.</p>

                  <item>2. The impediments without us are, 1. Taking religion from our fathers onely<note place="margin">1.

It is said of <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> that he sought the Lord of his fathers, and walked<note place="margin">2. Chro. 17. 4.</note> in his commandments, and not after the trade or doings of Israel. The custom or fashion of the place or times is an impediment without us which must be removed,<note place="margin">Amos. 5. 13.</note> except it agree with our rule: for there are evil times, as the Prophet speaks, and<note place="margin">12.</note> what fashions the people then used he shews the verse before.

               </argument>
               <p>THe next inward vertue of the minde, is faith. This supposes a knowledge of<note place="margin">Faith</note> the object or things to be beleeved, which being propounded sufficiently, as credible, our assent thereto is called faith, which rests upon divine authority, though it see not the proper reasons to enforce assent; for seeing we cannot by meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason attain sufficient knowledge of supernatural truthes, but that divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is needfull, therefore besides natural knowledge, faith is necessary, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecives them for this authority of the speaker. To explain this. There is in every proposition an affirmation or a denial. 1. Sometimes a man holdeth neither part, because he sees that equall reasons may be brought on both sides; and that is called doubting, 2. If we encline to one part, yet so as we feare the reasons of the other part<note place="margin">Luke, 12. 29.</note> may be true; then it is called Opinion. As <hi>Agrippa</hi> was almost perswaded to<note place="margin">Act. 26. 28.</note> be a Christian, 3. If we consent to one part, that is called kowledge, which goes beyond both the other, and arises from evidence and assurance of the truth.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Knowledge by sense is such as was that of <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren, that had seen him before they sold him into Egypt, and therefore knew him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Knowledge by discourse. Such as <hi>Jacobs</hi> was, when he saw the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 27.</note> come out of Egypt, he conceived straightway that his son was alive.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That by relation of others; as <hi>Jacob</hi> knew that his son yet lived, when his sons told him so.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the first, when a thing cannot be present to the sense, then must we rely upon the third [Relation.] The Queen of Sheba did first heare of <hi>Solomons</hi> wisdome<note place="margin">1 King. 10. 1.</note> in her own land, before she came and heard him her self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For point of reason, ther's nothing absent from that, but that which is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and above our understanding; when a thing exceedeth the capacity of meer natural reason without divine illumination, as we see in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a great <hi>Rabbi</hi> in<note place="margin">John, 3. 9.</note> Israel. For concerning mysteries in religion, the Apostle saith out of the prophet, eye<note place="margin">1 Cor 2. 9.</note> hath not seen, or eare heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man: that is, they<note place="margin">Esa. 64. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> exceed both the capacity of the sense and reason, and therefore we must come to the third way, which is by faith; for as <hi>Job</hi> speaks. God is great, and we know<note place="margin">Job. 36. 26.</note>

                  </gap>: therefore it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily<note place="margin">Esa. 7. 9.</note> follow, <hi>Nisi credider it is non stabiliemini,</hi> as the Prophet assures us, if ye will not beleeve, ye shall not be established. And yet this restrains us not so far, but that after we have beleeved, we may search after a reason, that we may be able and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (as the Apostle bids us) alwayes to give an answer to every man that asketh a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">1 pet. 3. 15.</note> of the hope that is in us. For grace doth not annihilate and make nature voyd; faith is aboue, and not contrary to right reason, it is as a greater light to the lesse, yea <hi>religio est summa ratio,</hi> it is the quintessence of reason, or reason exalted or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. But we are to use reason, as the hand-maid to faith, (for faith must bring the understanding of man into captivity to the obedience of Christ, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 5.</note> saith) and we must expect from the holy Ghost the teaching of these things, which<note place="margin">Act. 4. 31.</note> our nature neither can nor is able to conceive.</p>
               <p>Now faith differs from science thus. In science there is first an enquiry after the reasons and causes, and then the assent follows. But in faith there is first the assent, and then the understanding of that to which we have assented <hi>Auditu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It is <hi>conceptus cum assensu,</hi> because the object of our faith is not propounded with such evidence to the understanding, as to constrain us to beleeve, but the will holdeth the understanding prisoner, and keepeth it captive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus faith becoms a free act, an act of obedience; whereas if things were propounded with that</hi>

                  <hi>God hath so ordered it, that matters of faith are propounded, as</hi> summe credibilia, <hi>highly credible, such that in prudence we may safely assent unto, yet not with that evidence which necessitates assent; for then there could be no trial of obedience in beleeving, nor any pretence left for reward to beleevers, or punishment to unbeleevers.

               <p>Now the reason why it pleased God thus to order the matter in production of faith is, because if reason of it self could have attained to the things pertaining to God, little or no glory at all had come to God by it. Again, seeing matters of faith cannot be attained by reason, this shews the vanity of the wisdom of the flesh, and we may see how God doth confound and abase it. For in Religion, the ground is contrary to that in Philosophy; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not to beleeve, is the way of Philosophy, and <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>For the warrant of beleeving or assenting before we know, something hath been said before: we will adde a little more in this place. Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> in his fift <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Cyprian, Chrysostome,</hi> and other of the ancient fathers prove against Philosophers, that <hi>Quic quid fit, fide fit,</hi> whatsoever is done, is done by faith. This appeares in all civill affaires wherein men go upon a civill faith, without certain knowledge of the things, and therefore much more in matters of religion, which are supernatural, may we live by faith. Thus we see the husbandman, who though he sees the weather unkindly &amp;c. yet fits himself to till and sow his ground, and bestows his cost, though he have no demonstrative knowledge, whether he shall reape any profit or no. And so the Merchants, though their goods and ships are subject to storms, pyrats &amp;c. yet they run the hazard, and adventure upon this Civill faith, So in marriage, though some may be barren, yet they marry in hope to have children, and so in warfare, though the victory be uncertain, yet the souldier goes one to battel &amp;c. The Schoolmen after the fathers goe a subtiller way to work, and hold, that <hi>

                     </gap>, fide scitur,</hi> that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve even those things we know: for by our senses and understanding we know many things, and herein they are our witnesses, which we beleeve, yet all confesse, that these witnesses are very doubtfull in many things.</p>
               <p>For the eye, which is the most certain and chiefe of all the outward senses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it apprehendeth more differences, and apprehends its object after a more special and spiritual manner: yet they which are skilful in the Optiques, reckon up 20 wayes<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59534:75"/>
how it may be deceived, and what greatimperfections are in it. And for our reason or understanding, we see how uncertain it is in our younger yeers, and how we cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect former errours, as we grow in years, when we are children we speak as children,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 12.</note> reason as children, and conceive as they do, but when we are men we put away childish things. Ploughmen cannot reason of the formall causes of things, because they cannot see them, but tell them of labour, that they can conceive, and so in respect of a more sublime understanding they come far short. And therfore we also may be deceived in things that are above us. and therefore the third way of knowledge that is by relation is necessary.</p>
               <p>The certainty of faith is grounded upon the condition and qualitie of the relaters, and hath onely two exceptions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Either against the authors, that they want skill, and are ignorant of the things they relate.</item>
                  <item>2. Or else that they are such upon whose fidelity we cannot rely.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now in either of these cases if the party relating want skill and cannot relate the truth, or is not honest, and will not, his testimony is not to be taken. So then there is no more certaine way then this, that whereas the knowledge of faith, and grounds of Religion are to be built upon such witnesses, as want neither skill nor fidelity, but for their skill can, and for their faithfulnesse will deliver the truth, we are to embrace what they deliver as certain truths.</p>
               <p>The Apostle saith not, I beleeve whom I know, but <hi>scio cuicredo,</hi> I know whom<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12.</note> I beleeve. We know that whom we beleeve is Amen, just and true. That cannot lie,<note place="margin">A poc. 15. 3.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And for the manner of giving his testimony. The termes in Scripture are 1. <hi>Dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Jehovaeh,</hi> and <hi>Dixit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</hi> the word of the Lord, and thus saith the Lord. And because mans stipulation and promise is more certain then his bare affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 2.</note> therefore God hath made promises to us, and his promises are precious, as the<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 13.</note> Apostle saith. 3. And for our greater comfort and assurance hath confirmed his promise<note place="margin">2 pet. 1. 4.</note> with an oath. 4. Again, because if we have a mans handwriting, we give greater<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17.</note> credit to that then toan oath, we have his own handwriting, written with his<note place="margin">Exo. 31. 18.</note> own finger. 5. And for confirmation of that he hath put to his feal. 6. And lastly,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11</note> (beyond which no man goeth, nor any man desireth more to strengthen a promise)<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 22</note> he hath given an carnest penny, a true Gods penny as we call it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now that which may be objected against this is, that the immediate voice of God is not now amongst us, and that which we heare is from <hi>Moses, Esay,</hi> Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> Saint <hi>Paul &amp;c.</hi> Yet this we must know, that though we heare it from them, being but men, yet did they not speake of themselves, not of their own braines, but as they were inspired by the holy Ghost. And this Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">2 pet. 1. 21.</note> the Prophecy (saith he) came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost. For a Prince usually speaketh not to the people immediatly from his own mouth, but by Edicts and proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons published by others in his name. And as the Scepter or mace which is delivered to them that publish those Edicts is a signe and token that they come from and for the Prince, so the Scepter of Gods extraordinary power was committed to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apostles &amp;c. The Jews required no more then a signe of our Saviour, which with them was the Scepter. And our Savionr desired no more of them then that, if<note place="margin">John, 2. 18.</note> they would not beleeve him for his words, yet they should for his works. And<note place="margin">10. 38.</note>
                  <note place="margin">15. 24.</note> that if he had not done among them, the works which no other man did, (those were his miracles,) they mighe have been excused for their unbeleefe. Upon which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that either we must grant that they were done, or else, that without miracles all the world was converted, and became Christians, which is a greater miracle then all the rest which he did, and so we must grant miracles whether we will or no. And this is our warrant that these men, the Prophets and Apostles came from God, and that God hath spoken to us by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next quere is, whether he is able to performe those things which he hath promised by them. To that we say with the Angell, that with God nothing<note place="margin">Luc. 1. 37.</note> shall be unpossible. The Prophet saith, His hands are not shortned, it is able to reach all<note place="margin">Esa. 59. 1.</note> things. When <hi>Moses</hi> mistrusted Gods providence to feed 600000 men, saying shall<note place="margin">Num. 11. 23.</note>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59534:75"/>
all the flocks and the herds be slain, or all the fish of the sea be gathered together to suffice them? God answered, is the Lords hand waxed short? Thou shalt see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my word shall come to passe or not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lastly, for his Will, take a place of a Father for all, <hi>Scio pcsse, scio scire, cupere,</hi>

                  <hi>velle,</hi> for, The Lord is good to them that trust in him, to the soul that seeketh him.</p>
               <p>That faith is necessary, may be thus proved, it is called the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence, ground, or demonstration of things not seen; both<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> which argue the necessity of it; for <hi>in totis ordinatis,</hi> (as Religion hath its order) the first part is <hi>substantia reliquorum,</hi> as the substance of a house is in the foundation, of a ship in the Stern, of a tree in the root. The Apostle compareth it to a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to a root, and he saith there is <hi>naufragium fidei,</hi> a shipwrack of faith, and<note place="margin">Col. 1. 23.</note> so consequently it is compared to the sterne of a ship. If faith then be necessary, as<note place="margin">2. 7.</note> the root and foundation of all religion, then without it nothing can be done by a Christian, which is accepted of God, <hi>ad salutem,</hi> to salvation. If we stand, it is by<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 24.</note>
                  <note place="margin">5. 7.</note> faith. If we walk, we walk by faith, whatsoever we do, if we do it not by faith, it is<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> not pleasing to God, <hi>ad salutem.</hi> And it is in this respect that faith is called, <hi>Mater obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiae,</hi> the mother of obedience, because all duties arise out of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> hath a saying, (which is true if it be taken in a good sense) that in faith all the Law is fulfilled, before we have fulfilled any part of it in act, because it is the root from whence all Christian obedience arises, and wherin it is vertually contained; and therefore in regard of the necessity of it, it pleased God to reject all the high titles of the learned wise men of the world, as Philosophers, &amp;c. and to entitle his flock onely by the name of believers. And <hi>Euseb. Emisenus</hi> gives a good reason<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 21.</note> for it: for the first word of a Christian is <hi>credo,</hi> and that which maketh him a<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> Christian; if we be not faithful, then are we no Christians. God giveth Christians<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> no other name then he gives to himself. <hi>Fidelis est Deus,</hi> God is faithful. And his<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 8.</note> Son is called the author and finisher of our faith, and his word is called, <hi>sermo fidelis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> the word of faith, and his family, the houshold of saith, and prayer is called by<note place="margin">James 5. 15.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> Saint <hi>James,</hi> the prayer of faith. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Sacraments, the seals of faith.</p>
               <p>So we see that faith leadeth us through all duties: and not onely this, but that which hath bin said of knowledge, may be said of faith; that it is the beginning of our blessednesse. Our Saviour saith to <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> Blessed are they that have not seen,<note place="margin">John 20. 29.</note> and yet have beleeved. There is an apt similitude in the Prophet to express this, I will betroth thee to me in faithfulnesse, and thou shalt know the Lord. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choation<note place="margin">Hosea 2. 20.</note> of marriage is <hi>in sponsalibus,</hi> when hands are given, so are our <hi>sponsalia in fide</hi> in this life, the marriage is consummate in heaven.</p>
               <p>It is said, <hi>Qui non crediderit condemnabitur,</hi> he that beleeveth not, shall be<note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> damned, nay further, (as <hi>S. John</hi> hath it) his sentence is not deferred, but it is gone<note place="margin">John 3. 18.</note> already upon him, he is condemned already. Therefore for the necessity of it we<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> may conclude with the Apostle. Without faith it is impossible to please God. And the reason is, because there is no man but thinks it a disparagement not to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, and the greater the person, the more desirous he is to be beleeved. A private man would be beleeved upon his honesty; and a man of greater state upon his honour; the Prince upon his own word, he writes, <hi>teste meipso,</hi> to argue the sufficiency of his word, and a disgrace he accounteth it to break it, and if any of these persons should not be credited on these terms, they would think that a great discourtesy were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them.</p>
               <p>If then there be a God, he must needs expect more then a Prince, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently he may of greater right say, <hi>teste meipso,</hi> because he is above all Princes. <hi>Job</hi> saith, Is it fit to say to a King, Thou art wicked, or to Princes, Ye are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly?<note place="margin">Job 34. 18.</note> though they be so; much lesse to a good Prince, and least of all to God. Now he that beleeveth hath set to his seal that God is true. And on the contrary, He<note place="margin">John 3. 33.</note> that beleeveth not, maketh God a Lyar: and there can be no greater disgrace to God, then to say, he is a Lyar. therefore <hi>S. Bernard</hi> upon that place, <hi>Impossibile est sine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. John 5. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>fide placere Deo,</hi> it is impossible to please God without faith, saith, <hi>Quomodo potest placere Deo, cui non placet Deus?</hi> how can that man please God, who is not pleased with God: and such is every one that believes him not. And thus much for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of faith. Now we come to our Rules.</p>

1. As we have seen the affirmative, and what is commanded, so we must see the<note place="margin">1.</note> negative, and what is forbidden: that is unbelief. It is a note of the reprobate, to be children of unbelief, whether it be by the lifting up of a mans soul, as the<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 6.</note> Prophet calleth it, by a proud imagination and conceit of our own reason, or by<note place="margin">Abak. 2. 4.</note> contempt, or any other kinde of wretchednesse, or carelessenesse, when we come to hold <hi>Machiavels</hi> position, <hi>Non curandum quid boni credat, sed quid faciat.</hi> And in this case they must be punished with that the Apostle tells us, God shall send them strong delusions that they should beleeve a lie, for rejecting the truth. <hi>Quia</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Christum non crediderunt in nomine Patris venientem, veniet alius nomine suo, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valebit, eique credent,</hi> because they beleeved not Christ coming in the Fathers Name, there shall another come in his own name, and prevail, him they shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: so shall it happen to those that will not cleave to the truth, they shall be given over to the untruths of this world, and in the world to come, that punishment shall befall them, as it did to the Lord, on whose hand the King leaned, that would not believe <hi>Elisba</hi> that prophesied plenty. <hi>Videbis, &amp; non gustabis,</hi> thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof; for when he had seen that come to passe which<note place="margin">2. Keg. 7. 2.</note> the Prophet foretold, he was troden to death, before he could eat or taste of that<note place="margin">17.</note> plenty. So shall they that are incredulous see the glory of others, but not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate of it in the life to come. <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> compareth such men to a coal covered with ashes, <hi>Infidelitas non potest claram narrationem habere, nam sicut carbo cinere suo coopertus obcaecatur: It a &amp; hi erroris tenebris circundati luce carebunt,</hi> unbelief<note place="margin">In 1 Cor. c. 16</note> cannot have a glorious narration, for as a coal covered with ashes is obscure, so the unbelievers shall want light being covered with the darknesse of their errour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as unbelief is forbidden, so is also resting in a small measure of faith. The Apostle mentioneth a full measure of faith, and if we want that, or labour not to<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> attain it at least, we are not of the number of the faithful, which our Saviour speaks<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 10.</note> of; I have not sound such faith, no not in Israel; and in another place, O woman, great is thy faith. There is a great faith. And that of <hi>S. Peters</hi> was a little faith,<note place="margin">15. 28.</note> when for want of it he began to sink, a faith mingled with many doubts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">14. 31.</note> we are to pray with him in the Gospel, <hi>Domine credo, adjuva <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Our faith must be in a full measure, we must endeavour for full assurance. Interpreters think, that it is a metaphor taken from a ship under full sails.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghost resembles man in this life to a Champion, and therefore for his better defence advising him what weapons to furnish himself withall, puts faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of all weapons. As <hi>Scutum fidei,</hi> the shield of faith, a special safegard against the<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 16.</note> Devil and his fiery darts. And against the world, he saith, This is the victory that<note place="margin">John 5. 4.</note> overcometh the world, even your faith. Lastly, against the flesh, he willeth us to be<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 8.</note> sober and put on the breastplate of faith. And no marvel, for the Author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 33.</note> attributeth all the great atchievements of the Saints to faith. Besides we see that<note place="margin">Matth. 14. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Peters</hi> faith made his body so light, that he walked on the sea, and sunk not: and on the other side, our Saviours hands were restrained, so that he could work no more<note place="margin">Mark 6. 5, 5.</note> miracles among the Jews, because of their unbelief.</p>
               <p>So that it appears by this, that by Gods own ordinance, he will have helps of our faith, or else he will do nothing among us: not but that he can work miracles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, but that he hath so ordered and disposed it. And this proveth the necessity of the concurrence of our faith, with the mercy of God. If thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> beleeve, all things<note place="margin">Mark 9. 23.</note> are possible to him that believeth. The want of faith hindred the working of the Apostles; for whereas Christ had given them power to cast out Devils, yet they could not dispossesse the mans son, and asking the reason of our Saviour, he tells them it was because of their unbelief.<note place="margin">Matth. 17. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this is more strange, seeing that in the case of the woman with the issue of blood, we do not finde that Christ spake a word, but her faith cured her, as if it had been against his will, she conceiving, that if she could but touch the hem of his garment she should presently be cured, and Christ not aware of it, her faith, as <hi>Origen</hi> saith, <hi>Vim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Christo,</hi> got her cure by force from him. And the same Father compares faith to the Loadstone, that by a hidden quality and vertue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth iron to it. Neither is this to be marvelled at, for it prevaileth also
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59534:76"/>
even with God himself; for the Angel, when he perceived that <hi>Jacobs</hi> faith was so prevalent that he would not let him go, nor he could prevail against him, told him that his name should be no more <hi>Jacob,</hi> but <hi>Israel,</hi> because he had power with<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 28.</note> God, and men. Now if we be <hi>Jacobs</hi> and prevail with God thus, we shall also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with men. We see that the woman of Syrophoen. gave our Saviour the foyl, and<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 28.</note> he was forced to say, O woman great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt; for indeed faith is so wonderfull a thing that it became wonderful to him to whom<note place="margin">8. 10</note> nothing else is wonderful, Christ himself wondred at the Centurions faith.</p>
               <p>To avoid errour we are to know, that Divines make three kindes or degrees ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of faith. 1. General. 2. Legal. 3. Evangelical. And all these are necessary in their place and order.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The general stands in beleeving that God is, &amp;c. He that cometh to God must<note place="margin">Hebt. 11. 6.</note> 1. beleeve that God is, and 2. that he is a rewarder of them that seek him, and that he will finde means to bring them to felicity. And this was the faith of <hi>Adam</hi> in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, and is supposed in the other two as the foundation of all Religion.</item>
                  <item>2. The Legal stands upon the Law, and the belief of the promises and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </list>
               <p>The object of all faith is the word of God, which, as it is said, profited not the<note place="margin">Hebr. 4. 2.</note> Jews because it was not mingled with faith, when it is was preached to them. So that there must be a mixture of faith with the word, for the word and faith continue the Spirit of God in us. Our Saviour tells his Disciples, that his coming upon earth was, <hi>fovere ignem,</hi> to cherish and keep fresh the Spirit, which is there compared to a<note place="margin">Luke 12. 49.</note> fire. <hi>S. John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> calls him the Baptizer with fire, and the Holy Ghost; and<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 11.</note> therefore it is, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> adviseth, not to quench the Spirit: and that which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 19.</note> it is in the next verse, Despise not prophecy, which is <hi>lampas fidei,</hi> the oyl<note place="margin">20.</note> of faith. The word is the matter of this fire. If it come into a man, it is but as a lamp without oil, which flameth for a time, it is but a blaze in the Hearers, when it is not mingled with faith, it bideth but a while if this nutriment be wanting. And it is wanting in the wicked, <hi>Non quia dicitur, sed quia creditur, sicut credis ita sit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Augustine</note> 
                  <hi>tibi. Non est semen immortale, nisi credas esse a Deo, qui est solus immortalis.</hi> And this is the necessary use of faith. Thus much for the first Rule.</p>
               <p>The second and third rules are of little use in this Commandment.</p>
               <p>The fourth rule is concerning the means to believe: about which we need not much to labour, because it is certain, that the first way whereby we come to believe, is the relation of others. The Q. of Sheba believed <hi>Solomons</hi> wisdom upon report. And<note place="margin">1. Reg. 10. 6.</note> the reports of Saints who reposed their whole confidence in God, may be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us, else (which cannot be) we must think that all the Patriarchs and Prophets were either unwise or dishonest, and their faith in vain: but they according to their own experience, left that which they found to posterity. Thus the testimony of the Church is the first motive and inducement to belief, though not the sole or the the principal, for this is divine authority, <hi>viz.</hi> the word of God derived and conveighed unto us by the Church of God, into which our faith must be finally
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59534:77"/>
resolved, and ultimately terminated, upon which when our faith is grounded we may say as the Samaritans to the woman that had related to them the passages between her<note place="margin">John 4. 42.</note> and Christ at <hi>Jacobs</hi> well, Now we beleeve not because of thy saying, for we have heard him our selves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. And so we may say, we finde by experience the truth of what we have<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> heard: therefore the proper and especial ground of faith is the word of God. Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, as the Apostle saith. And after it is preached, we must take the same course that we held in knowledge, or meditation and conference &amp;c, to acquaint our selves with it, after we hear or read it, as it is in <hi>Deuteronomy 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because he cannot be faithful in much, that is not so in a little; and as Christ saith, If we beleeve him not in earthly things, we shall come far short in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief<note place="margin">Luke 16. 10.</note> of heavenly; therefore the learned have distinguished faith into <hi>fidem Coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um<note place="margin">John 3. 12.</note> &amp; Terrestrium,</hi> by faith of heavenly and earthly. And the latter of these is a means or way to the former. Therefore it being a way or preparation to faith, somewhat is to be said of it as a special and most effectual part of faith, and is rather to be called <hi>fiducia</hi> or <hi>confidentia</hi> then <hi>fides,</hi> confidence or trust then faith.</p>
               <p>It pleased God to prepare and make way to faith by the last of the two, that a man may repose himself, and rely wholly upon God: and he that can be brought to this <hi>etiam vacuo penu,</hi> when there is no hope of good, being unfurnished of all earthly means and help, will be able also to put his confidence in him for heavenly things. But when the storehouse of faith in earthly things is empty, we cannot be furnished with faith in heavenly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now this faith or rather confidence in God is considered two wayes. 1. Either he that hath it hath the means also; 2. or he that hath it is utterly without the means. Both here are enjoyned. If we have them we are to use them, because it hath pleased God to ordain them as ordinary means to work with; as <hi>Jacobs</hi> care<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 30.</note> was to provide for his family. And <hi>Isaac</hi> said to his father, here is wood and fire,<note place="margin">22. 7. 8</note> but where is the sacrifice? <hi>Abrahams</hi> answer was, <hi>Deus providebit,</hi> God will provide<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 5.</note> the rest. If we do our parts, God will do the rest. We must not do as the Tempter would have Christ do, cast himself from the pinacle, when there was an ordinary way to come down from it, for this were to neglect the ordinary, and seek out for extraordinary means which is not warrantable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as we are commanded to use them, and not presume without them, so on the other side we are forbidden to trust in them, and rest upon them, whether it be in the private art we practise to sacrifice to our own nets, that is, to ascribe all to our<note place="margin">Abak. 1. 16.</note> own skill, or in our wealth, which <hi>Job</hi> accounted as a great fault. If I have made<note place="margin">Job. 31. 24, 25</note> gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence. If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced because my wealth was great, or because my hand had gotten much. Or if our trust be in great men, as the Prophet, who denounceth a curse against him that trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 5.</note> in man or maketh flesh his arm. And not onely in great personages, but in<note place="margin">Psalm 146. 3.</note> Common-wealths, and the strength of them, and their chariots and horses. Or in<note place="margin">20. 7.</note> wisdom. Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom. Or in outward priviledges.<note place="margin">Jer. 9. 23.</note>
                  <note place="margin">7. 4.</note> Trust not in lying words, saith the Prophet, saying the Temple of the Lord, &amp;c. Or<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 30.</note> as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in ordinary coming to sermons, (as the people did to his) and so to rest, doing no good works, and reaping no fruit by them. But to use these things well, not trusting in them, which may be done. 1. By a right judgement of them. 2. By a right use of them.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For the first, <hi>Moses</hi> saith, It is not bread that man liveth by onely, but by the word of God, his will and decree. In nature bread should nourish, but it is withall,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 3.</note> if God give the staffe of bread with it. His blessing gives a nutritive vertue to bread, and this is the staffe. The Psalmist look'd upon his bow and his sword, and yet could<note place="margin">Ezek. 4. 16.</note> not be confident in them. I will not trust in my bow, saith he, it is not my sword that shall help me. And, except the Lord build with us, and watch with us, our building<note place="margin">Psalm 44. 7.</note> and watching will be to no purpose. It is the Lord that must give the staff of building,<note place="margin">127. 1.</note> watching, nourishing, &amp;c. else all our means will be used in vain, nothing can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper without his blessing. Every thing depends upon God, both in <hi>esse</hi> and in <hi>operari,</hi> as the Schools say, and no second cause can work without the influence of the first cause; and this must be our judgement concerning the means.</item>

2. The right use, is the second, and this because the means are of no force without a blessing annexed, we are to seek for some thing further that may adde vigor and strength to them, which, as the Apostle saith, is thanksgiving and prayer to sanctifie the means. And this thanksgiving and prayer are not to be formall. It was that<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 4. 5.</note> which <hi>Job</hi> feared in his sons: for he knew by his good education of them that they omitted not thanksgiving nor prayer every day, but feared that they performed not those duties as they ought, and therefore every morning he offered burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings<note place="margin">Job. 1. 5.</note> according to the number of them.</item>

               <p>And in doing thus we shall make the right use of the means, and be in the number of the Saints, whose practise we shall finde in scriptures to be the same. Jacob<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 9.</note> in reconciling himself to his brother, used all the means that could be, as in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing messengers before he met him, thereby to feele his affection towards him, not forgetting presents to make his way the better, and withal instructing his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to separate his wives and children and droves in several stations, that if his brother should set upon one, the other might escape, yet for all this we see, that in the first place he giveth himself to prayer, thinking that all the means he used could be of little force, except God blessed the means, So in Exodus we finde,<note place="margin">Exo. 17.</note> that in the war with the Amalekites, all things were provided, <hi>Iosua</hi> made Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the battle set in order, but knowing that all this was not available with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods blessing <hi>Moses</hi> went up to the top of the mount with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> to pray, and we see, that no longer then <hi>Moses</hi> listed up his hands, no longer did the Isralites prevail. We finde in the fathers two several wayes whereby a man may know and certifie himself whether his trust be more in the means then in God the author and giver.</p>

               <p n="2">2. And secondly, what we set down in our minds as our last refuge, and this is too commonly seen to be the means. The wiseman saith. The rich mans wealth is his<note place="margin">Pro. 10. 15.</note> strong city, which the fathers expound thus, when the Justice and goodnesse of his cause, when God and good men, and all else forsake him, then will that stick to him (as he conceives) and help him at a pinch, and he is perswaded that <hi>argento respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent omnia, pecuniae omnia obediunt,</hi> when we are like to them (against whom the Prophet denounceth a woe,) that devise iniquity, and worke evill upon their beds, and when the morning is light they practise it, because it is in the power of their<note place="margin">Mic. 2. 1.</note> hand.

               <p>Nay when we can trust in God, though means be wanting. The Greeks have a proverb, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> while the pot seetheth their love seetheth, and so we can be content to hold out so long as our means hold out and no longer. And this is the cause that provoketh God in his just judgement to give the means without the blessing, as also to bring many things to passe without means. For as, where the blessing of God is, there it falls out, that mens bellies are filled with Gods hidden treasure,<note place="margin">psal. 17. 14.</note> there is thriving and growing, no man can tell by what means. So where he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the means, it fares with them, as with those in the Prophet, ye have sowen much and bring in little, ye eat but ye have not enough, ye drink but ye are not filled with drink: ye cloth you, but ye are not warme, and he that earneth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,<note place="margin">Agg. 1. 6</note>

earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes, whatsoever means they use, it pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers not. And the experience of this we see in king <hi>Asa,</hi> albeit Physick be the ordinary means to recover health, yet because he sought to the Physicians before<note place="margin">2 Chr. 16. 12.</note> he sought to God for help, his physick was accursed and he pined away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Achitophel</hi> the Oracle of wisdome and policy, gave wise counsel, but because he looked not up to God, God did not determine to blesse it, but (as the text saith)<note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 1.</note> defeated it, and made the Counsel of <hi>Hushai</hi> to be taken and his rejected, and we<note place="margin">14.</note> see what became of him afterward, he seeing his counsel was not followed, sadled<note place="margin">23.</note> his asse, went and set his house in order and hanged himself. And so the wisdome of the Egyptian Counsellors became foolish, <hi>infatuavit cos</hi> God besotted them, the Lord<note place="margin">Esa. 19. 11.</note> made them give foolish counsel. Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses,<note place="margin">Psal. 20. 7. 8.</note> but we will remember the Name of the Lord our God, they have stumbled and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, but we are risen and stand upright.</p>
               <p>Now as these ordinary means of clothing, food, Physick, and wisdom are many times accursed, so God to shew how little he dependeth on secondary means, doth effect his purpose, somtimes without means, and somtimes contrary to means. As in the fall of the walls of Jericho upon the blast of Rammes horns. <hi>So Gideon</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jos. 6. 20.</note> encouraged by the exposition of a dreame of a barly loofe, with three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundred men with trumpets and empty pitchers in their hands and lamps within them put all the Midianits to flight, and to run upon themselves. As also the great host of the Syrians were put to flight, none pursuing them, but a panick terrour came<note place="margin">Jud. 7. 13.</note> suddenly uppon them, and a certain imagination that they heard the noise of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, horses, and a great army of the Hittites and Egyptians that came to aid the Isralites.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seeing then that God gives the means when he will, and blesseth them when he will, it is our parts to trust in him, whether we have the meanes or no, and to be affected as King <hi>David</hi> was, though he were in the midst of ten thousand men armed<note place="margin">psal. 3. 6.</note> and compassed round with them on every side, yet he would not be afraid, but as<note place="margin">4. 9.</note> it is in the end of the next Psalm would lay him down and sleep trusting in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and as <hi>Moses</hi> counselled the children of Israel, when the Egyptians pursued them with their chariots, though their enemies were behinde them, and the red sea before them, and no way seen whereby to escape, yet to stand still and put their trust in the Lord, and they should see the power of the Lord, which they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly<note place="margin">Exo. 14. 13.</note> found.</p>
               <p>So the Apostle describing a true pattern of faith, sets before us that of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18. &amp;c</note> who had neither means in himself or his wife whereby to beleeve Gods promise of a Son, she being barren by nature, and having a dead womb, and he a hundred years old past child getting by course of nature, yet he staggered not, but was strong in faith, being fully perswaded, that he which had promised was able to performe, and therefore received the blessing in the birth of <hi>Isaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And as we are thus to trust in God, though we see no means, so must we be far from the course of the wicked, who if God once fail them, do not onely des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of his help, but cast him off, and betake themselves to his enemy, and to unlawful means, and such are they, that despairing of Gods assistance in their health, leave him and the lawful means, and flee to Sorcerers, a thing utterly condemned by the<note place="margin">Esa. 8. 19.</note> Prophet. We see that <hi>Saul</hi> lost both the favour of God and his kingdom for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing<note place="margin">1 Chr. 10. 13.</note> with a familiar spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Besides, there is a woe denounced against another sort of people, that<note place="margin">Esa. 29. 15.</note> (as the prophet speakes,) seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, that thinke by their policy and deep wisdom, they can deceive God as they do men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are others that take advantage of other mens weaknes, and think that that which they get by over reaching others in bargains is their own, but the Apostle tells such, that God is an avenger of them.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 6.</note>

               <p n="5">5. The fift rule of our exposition, directs to speak of the signes of faith, it is not enough that a man can say, <hi>Credo in deum,</hi> I beleeve in God, we must have more particular signes of it. For as the Apostle saith, all men have not faith;<note place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 2.</note> therefore that of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> must be added, the trial of faith is much more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then gold.<note place="margin">1 pet. 1. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first signe therefore of faith, is according to Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> when a man is not <hi>ingeniosus ad causas,</hi> ready to pick quarrels, and to make excuses for not beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">Chr. Ro. 4. 19.</note> How many causes might <hi>Abraham</hi> have found out not to beleeve? and that it was impossible for him to have had a son? yet we see that true faith overcame all difficulties, so that he neither excepted against the promise in respect of <hi>Saras barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> or his own weaknesse, but <hi>Credidit</hi> he beleeved. But among all the rest there was one exception which might have tried one that had been very faithful, and that was the long time he had been without a childe before and in his younger dayes, and therefore there was little hope for him in his old age. And therefore he might have concluded with them in the Prophet. It is in vain to serve God, what profit<note place="margin">Mal 3. 14.</note> is it to trust in him? I will beleeve no longer. But this is against that rule of Esay, <hi>Qui crediderit ne festinet,</hi> hast and impatiency are no fit companions of faith, he that will<note place="margin">Esa. 28. 16.</note> see the event in hast, his faith is in vain. Therefore our faith must not waver, if we<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 26.</note> see not the fruit of it speedily, but we must wrestle, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did with the Angel, and not let God go till we get a blessing from him, as was said before. We see that<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 23.</note> the woman af Canaan weake by sex and an alien from the promise, though she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">24.</note> three repulses from our Saviour, yet by not making hast she confirmed<note place="margin">26.</note> her faith to be true, and received the reward of a true faith, by obtaining what she desired.</item>

                     <p>2. The second signe is our freedom from worldly cares and thoughts, the ground of this is taken out of the great Scripture of faith, when we run not a madding after<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> worldly preferment, the scraping together of wealth, and seeking to have a portion in this life is an argument, that we are born citizens of this world, not as the Saints and Godly men that shewed themselves pilgrims in this world and that they sought another country, a heavenly country, and so God was not ashamed to be called their God.</p>
                     <p>But a more particular and special example is that there of <hi>Moses,</hi> who being in great<note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> possibility to be a Prince (for he should have been the onely son to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter) yet we see his coldnes to the world, and to the preferment thereof was such, that he waved it, and chose rather to suffer affliction with his brethren, the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a time, for so he accounted the preferment of the world.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The third signe is taken out of the 11. to the Hebrews, from the definition of<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note>

faith which is there called Hypostasis or a substance, (and thereupon the faithfull are called Hypostatici) now we know that a thing which hath substance is able to receive a great waight without shrinking or crushing. And such are the Saints of God. <hi>David</hi>
                     <note place="margin">psal. 46. 2.</note> was hypostaticus, he would not fear though the earth be moved, and the hills caried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">3.</note> the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof rage and swell, and though the<note place="margin">11.</note> mountains shake at the tempest of the same, yet the Lord of hosts is with us, the<note place="margin">Psal 112. 6. 7. 8.</note> God of <hi>Jacob</hi> is our refuge, as he concludeth that psalm. And in another psalm he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But the condition of him that wanteth faith is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. If there come but a gale of wind, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sinks, when holy <hi>Job</hi> on the other<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 30.</note> side in the fullnesse of this substance of faith can say, <hi>Etiamsi occiderit tamen sperabo in</hi>

               <p>If the heart be once possessed with this belief, then, as the Apostle speaketh, I beleeved, therefore have I spoken, then it will come into the tongue, and not onely<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 13.</note> so, but, as the Psalmist, All our bones will speak, every member will make profession<note place="margin">psal. 35. 10.</note> of it, for as it is said before, according to the Physicians rule, <hi>Judicium a corde fit per brachium,</hi> the heart makes the pulse beat, and that not by little and little, or in a long<note place="margin">Mat. 17 18</note> time, but presently, and so is faith when it is in the heart, it hath its effects presently, <hi>eadem hora sanatus,</hi> he that beleeved was healed the same hour.</p>
               <p>The prophet saith, who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? shall<note place="margin">Esa. 66. 8.</note> the earth be made to bring forth in a day or shall a nation be born at once? for assoon as Zion travelled she brought forth her children.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59534:79"/>
mutual affection of the minde and heart; for if the heart love not, the minde will not long beleeve; and if the minde beleeve not, the heart will not love long.</p>
               <p>Faith in regard of the <hi>actus elicitus</hi> (assent) is an act of the minde: but in respect<note place="margin">Addition 11 of the seat of faith.</note> of the <hi>actus imperati</hi> (as the Schools speak) which flow from assent, and belief, as love, fear, obedience, &amp;c. So it is in the heart, and whole man, so that the duty of a Christian may be called the work of faith, because it is commanded and produced by faith, though belief be the formal and onely proper immediate act of it.</p>
               <p>Now the heart is the seat of the affections, and the affections are about such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as are partly agreable to our nature, and such as we wish for and imbrace, and partly such as we desire not, but turn from. Of the former sort are love, hope, joy, and of the other are fear, grief, hate. And God hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> both of them to a double use, as those of the second sort to restrain us from evil, or after we have committed evil to torment and punish us. So of the former, either they are provocations to good, or after we have done well to cherish and comfort us for so doing.</p>
               <p>It is the work and office of faith to stir up these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in us, the first of which is fear towards God; and the reason is, because the word of God being the object of faith, whether we take it in whole, or in grosse, the five books of <hi>Moses,</hi> or the four Gospels, in all we finde punishments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to such as should transgresse, which threatnings being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and so they restrain from sin, or fear of the punishment in those that have offended, and so they stir up to repentance: for in the very beginning we see, faith had a word of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to apprehend. In what day soever <hi>Adam</hi> should eat of the fruit of the tree he<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> should die, and this was before the promise, that The seed of the woman should bruise the serpent head. Now faith apprehended Gods justice, which with his<note place="margin">3. 15.</note> other attributes made it seem more fearful, and the conscience telling that an offence was committed by eating, fear must needs arise out of the consideration of it.</p>
               <p>And this is it which was remembred before in our Saviours speach to the Jews.<note place="margin">John 5. 56.</note> If ye had believed <hi>Moses,</hi> ye would also have believed me. First <hi>Moses</hi> was to be believed, then Christ, first the Law, then the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The first is a faith in Gods justice. There is a manifest example of this in the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevites,<note place="margin">Jonah 3. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Crediderunt Deo, &amp; timuerunt,</hi> they believed God and feared; which is <hi>Moses</hi> fear, a faith in Gods justice.</p>
               <p>Among many motives to fear given by writers, the chief is <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> legis,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law, and this works <hi>contritionem,</hi> a grinding to powder by fear of that which the Law brings into their hearts. And of this the Psalmist speaks, telling us<note place="margin">psal. 119. 120</note> what is the true object of fear, My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements. This is the effect of faith upon the knowledge of Gods Justice.</p>
               <p>The reason why it pleased God to set justice and fear in the first place is, because before any thing can be effected, the impediment, and that which hindereth must be taken away. We cannot possesse God, and the reason is, because as the Prophet tells<note place="margin">Esay 59. 2.</note> us, there is a separation between him and us, our sins do separate between God and<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 14.</note> us: a partition wall, as the Apostle calls it. Now seeing there is a necessity to have God, and that this partition wall keeps us asunder, in the first place we must not build this wall higher, but we must cease to build sin upon sin, and look for Christ to beat down that which is already built. That which causeth us to cease from sin is the fear of God, <hi>Expulsor peccati timor Domini,</hi> saith the Wise man, we must not say, shall<note place="margin">prov. 8. 13.</note> we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid, saith the Apostle. And<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 1.</note> this is the reason why God commandeth fear, because it maketh us to leave sin.</p>
               <p>Besides fear there are two other affections which cause men to live well, though it pleased God here to make choice of fear: as 1. Shame. 2. Pain and grief. Make<note place="margin">psalm 83. 16.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Esay 28. 19.</note> their faces ashamed, O Lord (saith the Psalmist) that they may seek thy Name: and for the other, <hi>Vexatio dat intellectum,</hi> affliction brings understanding. If a man smart for any thing, experience will give him understanding. But we see that in the multitude of offenders there is no place for shame, and for pain we have <hi>terrenas consolatiunculas,</hi> poor worldly comforts, at least if not to drive it away, yet to season it, and therefore God foresaw that neither of these would strike so deep as fear. But fear (which it pleaseth God to set before us, and to require at our hands) is that affection which toucheth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59534:80"/>
us neerest, and when other fail, fails not. Examples we have of it in offenders.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> being naked, and clothed onely with fig-leaves, might have been ashamed, yet he walked up and down Paradise confidently, and his humbling came not till<note place="margin">Acts 24. 25.</note> he heard the voice of the Lord, and then he was afraid. <hi>Felix</hi> was a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt governour, and made no conscience of it, yet hearing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> discourse of Justice, and Temperance, and especially of Gods Judgements, he fell into a trembling.</p>
               <p>And this affection is not onely in men, but predominant in beasts also, and in those<note place="margin">Num. 22. 23. &amp;c.</note> beasts which are most stupid and brutish. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> asse fearing the angel of the Lord, notwithstanding all his Masters beating fell down flat, and would not stir a foot to<note place="margin">James 2. 19.</note> run into danger. Nay, further the Devils which fear nothing else, yet in respect of God, <hi>S. James</hi> tells us, <hi>Demones credunt &amp;contremiscunt,</hi> the Devils believe and tremble. And therefore this must needs be a prevalent means; and that man is far gone, and in a fearful case that feareth not.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected. That since God speaketh so much of love, why should we not be brought to obedience by love rather then by fear?</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but that were a more acceptable way, but our case is so, that love will not prevail with us, for he that loveth a good thing must have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and that comes by a taste of it. Now if his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be corrupt, as theirs is that are feavorish, nothing can please him, but that wich pleaseth the corrupt taste, wholsome things are distasteful to him, yet (though they love not those things that are good for their disease) this reason will prevail against their liking, that if they take it not, their fit will be sharper, or their life shorter: so fear in them worketh more then love. And so is it with men, whose first taste <hi>in spiritualibus</hi> is corrupted. If love could cause us to taste spiritual joyes, fear were super fluous. But vain delights in earthly pleasures, ease and evil company have so cloyed and corrupted our tastes, that we are not able to desire that which is truely to be desired, and that which is hurtful to us we desire. And therefore there is nothing can alter our taste, but that if we continue in taking those earthly pleasures, and not take that which is spiritual, our fits will be sharper, and our life shorter: this fear is necessary to be set before us.</p>
               <p>To this may be added; that to this love we are brought by fear, for <hi>Odium peccandi,</hi> the hate of sin cometh from fear, for fear causeth us to abstain from sin, this abstinence bringeth a good life, and that, a good conscience, being possest with that, we shall be without fear, and have peace of conscience, which breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth love to God and godlinesse. <hi>A timore bona vita, a bona vita bona conscientia, a bona conscientia amor.</hi> And love and fear in this respect are compared by Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> to a needle and threed, the needle tarrieth not, but bringeth the threed after it; first we must fear, and that will bring love after it. <hi>Discat timere, qui non vult timere; discat ad tempus esse solicitus, qui vult esse semper securus,</hi> let him learn to fear that would not fear; let him be solicitous for a time, that will be secure for ever. So we see that the use of fear is to restrain us from evil, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure love in us.</p>
               <p>The Common definition of fear is, <hi>Expectatio mati,</hi> the expectation of evil, upon which may arise a doubt to them that are not well versed in Divinity. How a man may be said to fear God, seeing there is no evil in him, for he being wholly goodnesse it self, and the fountain of all goodnesse, therefore should not be said to be feared. But it is soon resolved. For God is not to be feared as he is God and goodnesse, and no evill in him, but <hi>ab effectis</hi> in respect of his Judgements, the effects of his Justice, they are first to be feared, and God se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily.</p>

Now that God is able, appears by three things considerable in a party to be feared.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first is authority. Though a childe be a King, or a woman bear rule over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <note place="margin">prov. 16. 14.</note> fear him, saith the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And why? An earthly kings wrath is as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <note place="margin">19. 12.</note> of death, and as the roaring of a lyon, then what is the wrath of the King of kings? And besides, by best right he may challenge this fear, for being King of kings his authority is highest and above all others. And he is not onely a king, but such a king, as to whom all the celestial powers and principalities lay down their crowns, and fall on their faces before him. And therefore it was the song of them that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came<note place="margin">Rev. 15. 4.</note> the beast, Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name?</item>
                  <item>2 The second is power. A man if he have a mighty adversary, though he have no authority, yet he is to be feared. Might is to be feared; and therefore we are counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be at peace and have good correspondence, and in no case to strive with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Ecclus. 8. 1.</note> man. If the mighty men upon earth are to be feared, how much more the mighty God, whose power as it exceedeth all other powers, so it hath compelled them that were mighty on earth to fear him. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> when he perceived the power of<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 24.</note> God working beyond the course of nature, that three men should walk in a fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace without hurt either to their bodies or garments, was so terrified and astonied, that he repealed his former decree and published another, and that a sharp one against them that should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And so we read that the people were astonied at the mighty works of our Saviour. Power breeds terrour then.</item>
                  <item>3. The last is his omniscience. No sin that we commit but he takes notice of them.<note place="margin">psalm 69. 5.</note> My sinnes (saith king <hi>David</hi>) are not hid from thee. When <hi>Moses</hi> saw no man by,<note place="margin">Exod. 2. 12.</note> he was bold to kill the Egyptian. But when he perceived that some were privy to it,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59534:81"/>
he feared and said, surely this thing is known. There is no creature but is manifest in<note place="margin">14.</note> his sight; for all things are naked, and open before him. In respect therefore that he<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 13.</note> knoweth our transgressions, our fear is to be fixed on him. And this putteth a difference between the fear of God and the fear of man, which they call <hi>malum diuturnitatis custodem,</hi> an ill keeper of continuance, for the fear of God is <hi>bonus diuturnitatis custos,</hi> a good keeper of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And now according to the first rule for exposition of the Decalogue, we are to<note place="margin">1.</note> see in this what is commanded, and what forbidden. 1. Here are commanded both the fears, servile and filial.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first the School-men call <hi>timorem servorum,</hi> servile fear, such fear as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants shew to Masters, a fear of punishment, and this is a good fear though it be ignorantly condemned by some. True it is, that the Apostle saith, that the sons of God have not received the spirit of bondage to fear; but the spirit of adoption<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> whereby they cry, Abba Father: the spirit of bondage is inferiour to the spirit of adoption; yet that spirit is better then the spirit of <hi>Belial,</hi> or that of slumber, of<note place="margin">Esay. 29. 10.</note> which the Prophet speaks, whereby mens eyes are closed.</p>
               <p>It is a maxime, that <hi>actio perfecta non recipitur, nisi imperfecte primo,</hi> there is no perfect action, but at first it is imperfect, and is perfected by degrees. It is a good thing to be a son; yet it is better to be a servant, a door-keeper in the house of God,<note place="margin">Psalm 84. 11.</note> then to dwell in the tents of ungodlinesse; better to be a hired servant then a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal son. It is good to be in Canaan in the land of promise, but (in the mean time)<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 19.</note> it is better, to be in the wildernesse then in Egypt. So fear and spare not, <hi>fac</hi> (saith <hi>S. Augustine) si nondum potes amore justitiae, at timore poenae,</hi> do it, if not for love of goodnesse, yet for fear of punishment; and his ground is out of a place in <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie cap.</hi> 5. Nothing brought the Jews to the love of God, but the terrour<note place="margin">Dent. 5. 29.</note> they conceived out of the strange sights before them, yet God wisheth that they might have such a heart in them alwayes, that they would fear him: yet this was but a servile fear, procured by the strange sights at the deliverie of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second they call <hi>timorem filiorum,</hi> filial fear. This they illustrate by an example from the son of a poor man, that hath a reverend fear not to offend his father, though he be assured that he can do him neither good nor hurt. And these two fears are distinct and different. The first ariseth from the fear of punishment, and this from love, and may be called reverence. This is the fear, which the Psalmist calleth clean, and endureth for ever, and thus we perfect, or work out our salvation with<note place="margin">Psalm 19. 9.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> fear and trembling.</p>
               <p>The reason why, though we may and ought to obey God out of love, yet it hath pleased him to command fear, is threefold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To overthrow the vain sp culation of some erroneous people, that dream of an absolute perfection in this life. The Wise man saith, <hi>Beatus qui semper pavit,</hi> happy<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 14.</note> is the man that feareth alway. And either there is no perfection in this life, or else fear is superfluous, he that cannot fall, need not fear. But because in this life there be degrees of perfection, and though we have obtained perfection of parts, that is, all vertues and graces required in a Christian; yet there are several degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, wherein we must still be growing; for a childe, though it have all the parts of a perfect man, yet it hath them not in that degree of perfection, which one of yeers hath attained to; therefore this fear is alwayes necessary. None stands so fast, but he may fall, and therefore must alwayes fear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Inasmuch as the children of God often feel in themselves a feeblenesse in faith, a doubt in hope, coldnesse in prayers, slownesse in repentance, and a debility in all other pious duties, in some more, in others lesse, according to the measure of the Spirit communicated to them, as it was in King <hi>David;</hi> therefore fear is necessary to recover themselves, and he that looseth it not, his heart shall never be hardened, nor fall into mischief, as the Wise man intimates, in the place before cited. Fear is a good preservative for the heart; though all other duties fail, yet if fear continue, we shall never need to despair.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, I know it for a truth, that for the keeping, continuing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the vertues and duties, which God hath commanded, there is nothing more profitable and available then fear; when the grace of God is with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59534:81"/>
us, and when it is departed, so that ther's nothing left but fear; yet this fear wil never leave us, or let us rest, till we have made our selves fit to receive it again, <hi>si deficit timor, deficis et tu,</hi> if fear decay, thou decayest with it &amp;c. when we have recovered the grace that was lost, fear will preserve it; for fear of a relapse will make us more circumspect. Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> calls it <hi>Custodem omnium virtutum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Because the excellent duty of love, the effect of feare, might not fail and grow. carles, In the Canticles the Spouse fell asleep with her beloved in her arms, &amp; when she awoke her beloved was gone, in her bed she sought him, but found him not, so that if there be not a mixture of fear with love it will grow secure, and fall a sleep, and lose her beloved. Therefore that we may be sure to keep our love awake, when we think we have Christ in our armes, there must be a mixture of fear with it. So for these three reasons fear is necessary even for them that think themselves in a perfect estate. And withall <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of<note place="margin">Cant. 3. 1.</note> wisdom, so did his father before him And the same <hi>Solomon</hi> concludes his book of<note place="margin">pro. 1. 7.</note> the preacher, with fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the end of all,<note place="margin">psal. 111. 10.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 13.</note> and the whole duty of man, And in another place he saith, it is <hi>fons vitae,</hi> The fear<note place="margin">pro. 14. 27.</note> of the Lord is the fountain of life, to avoid the snares of death. As faith is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Christian religion, as the first principles are in every science in <hi>ordine credendorum,</hi> so is fear the first work or first beginning, in <hi>ordine agendorum,</hi> of things to be done: and as <hi>timor servilis,</hi> servile fear is the first work, so <hi>timor castus,</hi> a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and filial fear is the last worke and conclusion of all things.</p>
               <p>Now wee have seen what is Commanded, wee are to see what is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
               <p>That is first want of fear, the effect whereof is hardnesse of heart; which is of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> two sorts, the first being a degree or way to the second.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first ariseth from the prosperity or present impunity of the wicked, which draweth with it an erroneous perswasion of our own freedom from danger. Because<note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 11.</note> sentence (saith the Preacher) against an evill work is not executed speedily,<note place="margin">psal. 36. 1.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 11.</note> therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evill. They harden<note place="margin">psal. 50. 21.</note> their hearts; because wicked men escape punishment, and conclude with him in the<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> Psalmist, that God is like themselves, and thus the want of fear opens a way to all<note place="margin">pro. 29. 1.</note> wickednesse, whereas they ought to have reasoned, as the Apostle doth, that God deferreth his punishment, that we should not defer our repentance, and that he that hardeneth his neck being rebuked, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, as the Wise man saith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is the absolute want of fear. There ought to be ever a proportion, between the object and the power apprehending. The Psalmist saith, who regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth<note place="margin">psal. 90. 11.</note> deth the power of thy wrath, for thereafter as a man feareth, so is thy displeasure. Our fear should be proportionable to Gods wrath. But though we cannot fear in that proportion, <hi>etiamsi conteremur ad palverem,</hi> though we should grinde our selves to powder, though we should tremble till one bone fall from another; yet some measure of fear ought to be in us, at least our fear ought to go beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men; not be like those whose fear towards God was taught meerly by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men, Esay. 29 13. Math. 15. 2. if we fear onely when mans law punishes, our fear comes short; the trial is, if we make the like conscience of those things to which mans law reacheth not, as of those which are forbidden both by the laws of God and man, other wise we are voyd of fear.</p>
               <p>Now as the want of fear is forbidden, so on the other side to fear that we should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not is also prohibited. The Psalmist among other notes of the wicked sets this down for one, they were afraid where no fear was. And <hi>S. John</hi> saith, that the fearful,<note place="margin">psal. 53. 6.</note> (that for fear have transgressed) shall have their part in the lake which burneth with<note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 8.</note> fire and brimstone. And our saviour bids us not to fear them that can onely<note place="margin">Luc 12. 4.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 7</note> kill the body. <hi>Pharoah</hi> was afraid the Isralites should grow into a greater number<note place="margin">22.</note> then the Egyptians, and therefore made Edicts to kill the male children of the Isralites. So <hi>Jeroboam</hi> fearing that the hearts of the people would return to <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kin. 12. 27.</note> their true Lord, if they should go up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifice, and therefore set up two Golden calves, and brought the people to Idolatry. <hi>Herod</hi> was afraid that he should loose his kingdom, and therefore commanded to kill all the male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 10.</note>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:59534:82"/>
in Bethlehem and the coasts round about, from two yeers old and under. And the Jews were afraid, that if they suffered Christ to proceed in his doctine and miracles, all would beleeve on him, and the Romans would come and take away<note place="margin">John 11. 47.</note> their kingdome, and therefore they conspired to put him to death. The Wise man saith, <hi>Quod timet impius id accidet ei,</hi> that which the wicked feareth shall<note place="margin">pro. 10. 24.</note> come upon him. And so it happened in the four examples mentioned. The Romans dispossest the Jews of their kingdom. <hi>Herod</hi> missed of his purpose, and lost his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Jeroboams</hi> issue was rejected in the next generation. And the Israelites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased and prevailed against <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egyptians.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that this duty of fear is so necessary, and that the Prophet in the<note place="margin">Esa. 66. 2.</note> person of God tells us, that to him will he look that trembleth at his words, it stands us upon to keep this fear ever in our hearts. And the best motives to induce us, is to take to us the consideration of Gods judgements, and to consider with the Apostle, How fearful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God, for if he shall be<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 31</note> extreme to mark what is done amisse, no man shall abide his wrath.<note place="margin">psal. 130. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. And the first is the consideration of the examples of the judgements of God in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, left upon record in holy Scriptures. Of which the Apostle saith That al these<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 11.</note> things (meaning the judgements spoken of him in the former verses of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) hapned unto them, for ensamples, and are written for our admonition. They should be our monitors, <hi>Quot habebis jndicis Dei historias in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, tot habes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciones,</hi> The histories of God judgements in the scared Scripture, are as so many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to us, to move us to the fear of God. As when we see his justice upon his Angells, upon man in Paradise, upon his whole posterity in the deluge, upon the five Cities, upon the Egyptians, upon his chosen people the Jews, upon his own Church Jerusalem, and last of all upon his own, and dearly beloved Son, in proceeding against him, in the fullnesse of bitternesse at his passion: insomuch as one of the fathers saith upon it, <hi>O magna amaritudo peccati qui tantam amaritudinem pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit,</hi> Oh the great bitternesse of sinne that brought forth so great bitternesse. Can we read and hear these things and not fear and tremble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as the judgements of former ages are to be considered, so those which are more neere ourselves, especially these three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Mala inherentia,</hi> those crosses that it pleaseth God to let us feele in some measure, as sicknesse, povertie, afflictions by bad children, and the like.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Mala impendentia,</hi> those crosses which we do not feel at the present, but hang over, our heads, and which we have cause to fear may daily fall upon us, as pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence sword &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Malum excubans prae foribus,</hi> as they cal it the horrour of a guilty conscience, which is alwayes ready to accuse and terrifie us, in which regard God told <hi>Cain,</hi> that sinne<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> lieth at the door, though conscience seem to sleep, yet it lies like a mastive at the door which when the conscience shallbe awakened will be ready to fly in our faces.</item>

               <p n="3">3. Besides these, we should consider those <hi>tria novissima,</hi> as they are called, those three last things, death, judgement, and hell torments, first the terror of death which is <gap reason="foreign">

And that this shall be eternal, we may see by the<note place="margin">Esa. 66. 24.</note> words of our Saviour taken out of Esay. where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.

               <p>The signes of fear are these.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first signe of fear is. If we give credit to that which is taught by them that have authority and knowledge for <hi>timor est credulus,</hi> as the heathen man said, fear is credulous or easy of belief, and if we be not desirous to busie our selves in questions and frivolous distinctions for this questioning of what we hear is a signe we fear it not, but do as they did, and said to <hi>Moses.</hi> Goe thou neer and hear all<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 27.</note> that the Lord our God shall say, and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak to thee, and we will do it and hear it.</item>
                  <item>2. The next is diligence, negligence is an ill signe, <hi>Qui timent Dominum nihil negligunt,</hi> fear is very diligent. <hi>Jacob</hi> being in fear of his brother, could not rest all<note place="margin">Gen 32.</note> night, but was either praying to God, or sending messengers to his brother or ordering his family.</item>
                  <item>3. Another is humility. <hi>Jacob</hi> fell seven times to the ground before he came to his brother. The Philosopher saith, <hi>Timor contrahit non intendit,</hi> fear shrinks up the heart it maks it not to swell. The wiseman hath a good medicine against Pride. Be not wise in thine own eyes but fear the Lord.</item>
                  <item>4. The surest signe of fear is, the fear of sinne, which is all one with the fear of God.<note place="margin">psal 34. 11.</note> Come ye children (saith King <hi>David</hi>) and hearken unto me and I will teach you the fear of the Lord. And both these fears are joyned by holy <hi>Job,</hi> of whom it<note place="margin">Job 1. 1.</note> was said. <hi>Job</hi> was an upright man and one that feared God and eschewed evill, and as it was his practise, so was it his opinion, The fear of the Lord is wisdom and to depart from evill is understanding, <hi>Timor est fugitivns</hi> fear bids us not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist but fly, and he that fears cannot be armed sufficiently though he put never so much harnesse on his back. A thief being pursued, fear will make him <hi>demittere furtuns</hi> drop that which he hath stollen, or at least not have it about him. So if we fear God, we will be sure not to have sinne found about us, we will be afraid of that, lest it condemne us. And this is a sure signe.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="6">6. The last is given us by <hi>Moses.</hi> And now Israel what doth the Lord thy God<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 12.</note> require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all his wayes, to love him and to serve him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. And as we are to have this signe of fear in our selves, so are we to wish with the Prophet, that all the earth may have this fear. Let all the earth fear the Lord<note place="margin">psal. 33. 8.</note> stand in awe of him all ye that dwell in the world, and it is a fault where this desire is wanting. The want of this desire argues the contrary affection, that is turning others from the fear of God, which God condemns by the prophet and calls it strengthening the hands of the<note place="margin">Ezech. 13. 22.</note> wicked.</p>
               <p>Thus then we see that fear is the end of the Law.</p>

Humble your selves under the mighty hand of God, upon which one of the fathers saith <hi>Tanquam sub securi ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementi</hi>

                  <hi>loquitur,</hi> the Apostle speaks as if Gods hand were lifted up with his Axe ready to strike us, and we shrink down for fear. And so should a man do, cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59534:83"/>
down, and be content with whatsoever it shall please God to lay upon him, and such a dejection of our selves is the effect of fear. And this as it humbleth us towards God. My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; so the like effect it produced towards men, even from good men, when they<note place="margin">pfal. 119. 120.</note> were in fear of men. <hi>Jacob</hi> bowed himself seven times before he came to his brother.<note place="margin">Gen. 33. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The like we read of the wicked. <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of Syria, and his nobles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stricken with the fear of <hi>Ahab,</hi> girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes<note place="margin">1 Reg. 20. 32.</note> upon their heads, and came to him, and said, Thy servant <hi>Benhadad</hi> saith, I pray thee, let thy servant live. And if the fear of mans wrath work so upon us, much more ought the terrour of Gods justice, that by it we should be presently cast down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we can say with Prophet, <hi>Adhesit anima mea pavimento &amp; pulveri,</hi> my soul<note place="margin">Psalm 119. 24</note> cleaveth to the ground, yea to the dust. We see also that the Patriarchs and Prophets have shewed this humiliation by putting on sackcloth, as judging themselves not worthy to be better clothed, and in throwing dust and ashes upon their heads, thereby professing themselves fitter and worthier to be cast under the earth, then to tread on the ground any longer. We must have that in truth, which they signified<note place="margin">Psalm 7. 5.</note> by those types and emblemes; we must be even with the ground, and as the Psalmist speaks, lay all our honour in the dust.</p>
               <p>When we are thus humbled, and have given all glory to God, and none to our selves, then followes our exaltation; for when God hath brought us to the nethermost pit, and as it were to deaths and hels door, when we are at the very bottom of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and can go no lower, then are we fit to begin a foundation to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We must first set our selves in the lowest room, and the Master of the feast will bid us sit up higher. And this should be the true Myrrour of every Christian,<note place="margin">Euke 14. 10.</note> the true <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or self knowledge which is to be commended, not in the sense the Heathen took it, to know and see the excellency of himselfe, and so be puffed up, but to see the imperfections of our soules, and know our wants.</p>
               <p>Pride never gets footing of us, but either for want of knowledge, or upon a false knowledge. And therefore the Heathen considering the excellency and nobility of man, and having a false apprehension of Gods Justice, it was that which made them fall into that proud conceit, that the preaching of Christ was foolishnesse, and<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 18.</note> for the same reason it became offence also to the Jews, insomuch as when Christ came to exalt and heal them, they were high and sound enough already. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Superbis Phariseis viluit Christus,</hi> Christ seems vile to the proud Pharisees. Their pride made them have a base esteem of him. Not that we deny, but that the nature of man is most excellent, yet withal remembring, that the more excellent a thing is, the worse it is if it degenerates.</p>
               <p>And therefore seeing our estate is so vile, and that it hath pleased God to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe us Christians a better way, we are to follow it. And this is by the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a man himself, wherein there must be. 1. <hi>Humilitas mentis,</hi> humility in the minde or understanding, which is when the minde apprehends the infinite excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God, and our own basenesse; and this belief of the minde will raise a sutable disposition in the heart, for from hence follows the second. 2. <hi>Humilitas cordis, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, &amp; affectuum,</hi> the humbling of the heart and will, &amp;c. whereby a man thinks himself not worthy of food, apparrel, or any comforts of this life, but is abased in his own sight. This restrains the appetite of pride, which is to be measured by that<note place="margin">pfalm 131. 1.</note> which is in every man, and makes him not to exalt himself, seeing there is no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in him, and to say with the Psalmist, O Lord, I am not high minded, I have no proud looks, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We see then that the end and use of humility is to bring a man out of conceit with himself, and to cause him to resigne all his acts to the glory of God, and upon this the foundation of the building is to be laid. For as the Heathen man said well, <hi>Superbus miser est &amp; indignus misericordia,</hi> a proud wretch deserves no pity. And in<note place="margin">Ezek. 17. 24.</note> the Prophet God saith, I have brought down the high tree and exalted the low, I have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish. And for this cause it is<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 3.</note> that our Saviour saith, Except men be humble and have no more pride in them then babes, there will be no entrance for them into heaven. Though God can afford other things to men, yet <hi>gloriam meam alteri non dabo,</hi> he will not give his glory to any,<note place="margin">Esay 42. 8.</note>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59534:84"/>
we must be altogether emptied, before his grace can fill us. And thus much for the nature of Humility. Now for the command and prohibition: and first for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the affirmative part.</p>
               <p>The thing here commanded is the making our selves low in our own eyes, and it is defined to be an opinion or conceit of a man proceeding out of true knowledge of himself, whereby a man is vile in his own judgement.</p>
               <p>And to be made thus low it hath this priviledge, that we cannot fall lower, <hi>Qui jacet in terris non habet unde cadat.</hi> Rise it may, but lower it cannot fall, for theirs nothing under it. A man that stands may fall, <hi>Qui stat videat ne cadat;</hi> he that stands let him take heed lest he fall, but he that thus humbleth himself is out of this rule. The<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 12.</note> usuall phrases of the Holy Ghost against the high minded are casting down, hewing down, cutting down, but the humble that hath cast himself down already, feareth not Gods casting him down, for he hath done it already, and his next hope is of exaltation: and this is a further priviledge this humiliation hath, that God hath made a promise of exaltation to this vertue. He that humbleth himself shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted. As God in the beginning made all things of nothing, so he keepeth that course still; to make high the things that are low, and humilitie the way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation.<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In this Humiliation there are three things included.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It must not be onely a bare base conceit of our selves and our nature, which goes no further then the brain, the object whereof is the Majesty of God, but there must be also <hi>humilitas cordis,</hi> the humbling of the heart; we must be Christs disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in this, meek and lowly in heart, we must assume nothing to our selves, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any glory, but that God may have all: and say with the prodigal son, that we<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 29.</note> are not worthy to be called sons, the degree of a hired servant will be sufficient for us.<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 19.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, our appetite must be subdued and restrained, and be proportionable to the gifts which God hath endowed us withall. And this is against the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the world, where men aspire and account themselves worthy of higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees then they deserve: and as <hi>S, Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>quod adepti sunt nummis, meritis attribuere,</hi> what preferment they buy for money, they ascribe to their deserts. King <hi>David</hi> is a pattern for us in this point. <hi>Domine, non est exaltatum cor meum, &amp;c.</hi> Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes losty, nor do I exercise my self in great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<note place="margin">Psal. 131. 1.</note> or in things too high for me. But this is more proper to another place.</item>
                  <item>3. The third is, to think better of other mens abilities then our own, and not vilifie that which we see in others, and extol that which we think we have in our selves, which is far from humility. But we are to follow the Apostles counsel; In lowlinesse of minde let all esteem of others better then themselves. And this point also will fit another place better.<note place="margin">phil. 2. 3.</note>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the first of these which is proper to this commandment, as our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility must be hearty not superficial, so it must be of continuance; as fear is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end of the commandments; so there must be humility in the beginning, and humility to perfect all. For the first, God used never to work any excellent thing by any, but did first prepare him by humility. As <hi>Joseph</hi> was first sold to the Ishmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites and then to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> before he came to his place of honour. And <hi>Moses</hi> was fourty yeers in Egypt, and fourty yeers after that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, before those excellent things and wonders were wrought by him. The like we read of <hi>David</hi> and others. And this is <hi>a parte ante,</hi> this goes before exaltation and deliverance, both in this life, and that to come, to make us more sensible of our future condition, and endear the mercy of God therein to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other is <hi>a parte post.</hi> Our humility must continue to the end, as fear is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, so must humility be: else it will befal us, as it did <hi>Noah,</hi> who was by his fear preserved in the midst of a wicked generation from the general deluge; but the flood ceasing, and he growing careles and destitute of his former humility and fear, fell so grossely, that he was a scorn to his own son. So <hi>Lot,</hi> as long as he was in Sodom, and hambled by danger, he kept himself in the fear of the Lord; but being high in minde in the mountain, where he thought himself safe from danger, he committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest with both his daughters. The like may be said of King <hi>David,</hi> who being humbled by <hi>Sauls</hi> persecution, kept himself in the fear of God; but coming to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59534:84"/>
the kingdom, and living in his palace, fell in a short time into two grievous sins, Adultery and Murder. And therefore <hi>S. Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Perit omne quod acquiritur,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 8. Moral.</note>
                  <hi>si non humilitate custodiatur,</hi> all the goodnesse a man gets is lost again, if it be not kept with humility. And our Saviour Christ well knowing this, after he had taught to pray for remission of sins, the next petition he adds is, not to be led into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; shewing thereby, that in the greatest peace and safety lies most danger: and therefore when our sins are forgiven, we must be most careful not to fall into sin again. Much more might have been said concerning this vertue of humility, but this may suffice to have been spoken, because of the affinity between these two kindes of humility, and the two kindes of fear formerly handled. And now we come to that which is forbidden, the negative part.</p>
               <p>As humility is commanded, so pride the opposite to it is forbidden. Pride and humility are thus considered; let the offence be what it will which a man commits, yet humility overweigheth it and obtaineth pardon for it. On the other side, let a man do never so many good works, and yet pride weigheth them down, and choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and maketh them all of no value. It is one and the chiefest of the four impediments to Gods service, three of which are formerly spoken of. 1. Ignorance. 2. Infidelity. 3. Security. 4. Pride. And this last taketh deeper root then all the<note place="margin">Luk. 3. 5.</note> other. It is the highest mountain that stood in Christs way, and except <hi>John Baptist</hi> take the pains to remove it, he can never come to us.</p>
               <p>This vice by the Fathers is called, <hi>Morbus Satanicus,</hi> the Devils disease, from its first original, as <hi>Morbus Gallicus</hi> is so called from the persons from whom first it sprang. It is highly descended, and taketh hold of them that are highly born; for it was first born in heaven. <hi>Ero similis altissimo,</hi> I will be like the most High. It was <hi>Lucifers</hi> vaunt, he would have part of Gods glory, and be above his degree;<note place="margin">Esa. 14. 12, 14.</note> and that made him fall. The Devil hath knowledge and fear, but wants humility. And <hi>Adam</hi> took this infection from <hi>Satan,</hi> and we as his heirs. The Devil, as he said of himself, <hi>Ero,</hi> I will be; so he told <hi>Eve, Eritis sicut Dli,</hi> ye shall be as Gods.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note> He would not suffer them to be content with that honourable estate, in which God had placed them, but perswaded them ambitiously to seek an higher. The Apostles came joyful and proud in a bragging manner to Christ, and told him that the<note place="margin">Luke 10. 17. 20.</note> Devils were subject to them, they gave not glory to God. But that which Christ said to them may be an instruction to us; Rejoyce not that they are subject to you, &amp;c. for I saw <hi>Sathan</hi> falling from heaven like lightning, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Pride consisteth especially in two things. Either 1. <hi>a nobis,</hi> or 2. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> to our selves, or for our selves, our own glory. And both these are comprehended in the speech of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Is not this great Babylon, which I have built <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 30.</note> for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, (there is the first) and for the honour of my Majesty, (there is the second.) If we assume any thing either as our own act, or for our ownglory, that is pride. Of which there are divers degrees.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conceive that we have greater abilities then we have, (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is when we have none at all) as the Church of Laodicea, that said she was rich, and had need of nothing, and knew not that she was wretched, miserable,<note place="margin">Revei. 3. 17.</note> blinde and naked. None are so subject to this as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, novices, that are green and shallow, and therefore apt to be lifted up with pride, and fall into the comdemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 6.</note> of the Devil.</p>
               <p>This is one degree. Of this <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> saith, That it is no commendations for a servant to be humble, but if a man either for place or parts have wherewithall to be proud, and yet is humble, this deserves commendations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second degree is, when we esteem that little we have more then it is worth, when we conceive we are better then indeed we are: when (as the Prophet<note place="margin">Ezek. 8. 12.</note> speaks) we seal up great sums, and think that we are full of wisdom, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 14.</note> in beauty. Stretching our selves (as the Apostle) without measure. This the Devil makes use of, and either shewes us our selves by a false light, or makes us look upon our selves through a mist, whereby we seem greater then we are, making us drunk with self love, causeth us to see <hi>gemina objecta, &amp; geminos soles,</hi> every thing seemes double to us, as to a drunken man.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59534:85"/>
3. The third degree of pride is, when we conceive that we are the causes of that good which is in us; for it is a more excellent thing for a man to have a thing of himself, then from another: if we have it of our selves, we conceive the glory is the more. But the Apostle nips this conceit, and abateth the edge of this degree of Pride, by saying, What hast thou that thou hast not received?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth degree of pride is, when a man conceiveth, that though he have it not, yet he deserveth it, and ought not to stand to the courtefie of another. And this is <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note> also laid flat on the ground by <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was as well deserving as any. O Lord, I am not worthy of the least of thy mercies. All we have is of Gods mercy, not of our own merit.</p>
               <p>The Church of Rome is charged with the two kindes of pride mentioned in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> and for our selves we professe, that we are so far from thinking that we <note place="margin">James 1. 17.</note> have any good of our selves, that we say, we have received all from the Father of lights. But how true it is that we so think will be tryed by these two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. If we take it into due consideration, that whatsoever we have, we are not Proprietaries, but Dispensators and Stewards, that we must not account of it as our own, but that there is a Lord over us, that doth commit them to our good and orderly usage of them; and herein we fail, by mispending our means and misimploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our gifts, as if we were owners and not stewards; and if we be reproved, we are ready to say, It is my own, I may do what I will with it.</item>
                  <item>2. And secondly, if we know that we have no other propriety in them, but that they are onely committed to our trust, then if we consider, that when the Owner calls for it we are willingly to restore it. And this consideration comes not seriously into the mindes of many; for let but God withdraw any of his gifts, there is such murmuring and grudging, that it shews plainly they are not willing to restore them freely, and it is a hard task to perswade them, that they were but Feoffees in trust, onely to dispose of them as it best pleased the owner.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="5">5. Another thing there is which makes us guilty of this sin of pride. If our gifts be but equall with other mens, yet if we imploy them better then others do, we conceive a greater excellency in us then others. And this was the fault of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee, who boasted of the use of those gifts which God had given him; as, absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, justice, chastity, and withall acknowledged from whom he had them; for, O God (saith he) I thank thee, this gratitude was good: but then, I am not as other men, as this Publicane, this spoiled the rest of his actions, he reputed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more excellent then others, and in ascribing the use of these gifts to himself, he fell into contempt of his brethren. And this singularity hindered his prayer from being accepted: it is a sin not onely odious in it self, but a special impediment of Gods grace.</p>
               <p>The common place of humility is very strange in these times, and why? Because the Papists use it: but it were to be wished, that we would make use of whatsoever good thing they use; for the forbearance and disuse of it, hath brought our religion to that passe it is come to. Whether we consider those that live among us without any sense of God, or those that have eminent parts yet want humility; we condemn that opinion of the Church of Rome, that any one man cannot erre; they ascribe to man what is proper to God, and yet in our practise nothing is more common, then to ascribe infallibility to our selves, and others, whom we admire: and thus that pride which we tax in them, we practise our selves.</p>
               <p>So likewise it is usual among great men, They will speak in Gods phrase, and as God saith, I will be gratious to whom I will be gratious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. So they will prefer whom they will prefer; and whereas<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 19.</note> God hath appointed to prefer whom he will without gifts, they will prefer without gifts: and lastly, whereas there are no merits with God, but all is <hi>ex gratia,</hi> out of favour, they will have no merits, but all favour, and so in all things they behave themselves not as men, but Gods: and that comes because our hearts are lifted up, as<note place="margin">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59534:85"/>
1. <hi>Superbia habitus,</hi> pride of apparel. 2. <hi>Superbia habitus,</hi> pride in our table. and 3. <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbia supellectilis,</hi> pride in our furniture.</p>
               <p>In the means of grace which God gives us to beget in us humility and other graces, we shew much pride, as when we take a pride in praying, hearing, &amp;c. and do herein affect the praise and applause of men; but an higher degree is, when men reject those means of grace, especially when they resist the good motions wrought in them, and quench those sparkles which are kindled by the word, when it comes home to their hearts, as if they could have the motions of Gods spirit when they please; whereas they know not whether God will ever offer them the like again, and so this may be the last offer of grace.</p>
               <p>Nay not onely in the means of grace, but even in the graces themselves will pride appeare, and whereas the objects of other sins are base and vile, even the best things and most excellent graces are made the object or matter of pride, <hi>Cineres <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

There is a pride in the crosse, when we are humbled under Gods hand, we may be proud in that we are not proud, or not so proud as other men, or as we have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Thus the greater our gifts are, the more secure we grow, and the lesse jealous and suspicious of our selves, and so are overtaken, as <hi>

Therefore where the greatest gifts are, there is greatest danger, and therefore the greater watch ought to be kept, and where the richest prize is, there the devil will use his greatest power and subtilty to rob us of it. Therefore the more any man hath received, the more ought he to humble himself, and watch that he be not overtaken with pride.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We will adde a little to that we have said, and that shall be concerning the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this sinne.

But (as the wise man speaks) the Lord will destroy the house of the proud, as he did <hi>Pharoah, Haman, Herod,</hi> and many others, who were taken away even when they magnified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves most of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or else God punisheth him by depriving him of the guist, which was the cause of his pride. His tongue shall cleave to the roof of his mouth, or his right hand shall forget her cunning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or when he thinks he hath gotten strength enough, that he is able to leane upon his own staff, God suffers him to fall under every small temptation, because he seeks not to God for supply of his spirit, whereas by humility he might have withstood the greatest assaults. Thus some of great parts, when they will be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, as vnicorns, that will have no match, they break the net of humility, which should bring men unto God, by pride, and so God leaving them to themselves, they become the authors of heresies and errors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Or though it pleaseth God to let the gift remain, whereof they are proud, yet he gives not a blessing to it, but leaves it fruitlesse. Some have been endued with excellent graces, but without fruit, they haue made no returne to God of his Talents, not a soul gained unto him by them, whereas a man of mean endowments joyned with humility hath gained more then the golden tongue of an eloquent Tertullus.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Or Lastly, (which is the greatest punishment) there is in the minde, (as ost times in the body, as towards the end of a mans dayes, a Palsy or an Appoplexy) a certain stupidity or numnesse, so that neither threats can terrifie them, nor perswasions allure them to repentance, but passe out of this world without the fear of God, or sense of his judgements, so that they die and perish like beasts. And God punisheth their pride with this dulnesse, lest they should feel, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, a thorn in the flesh, which, as the best interpreters expound, it was a wrestling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst pride.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Another thing forbidden is forced humility, <hi>coacta humilitas,</hi> And such was that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of <hi>Pharoah.</hi> So long as Gods hand was upon him and his people, and that he was<note place="margin">Exod. 9. 28.</note> sensible of the plagues sent by him, so long he humbled himself, and promised to let the people go: but when he perceived that the plagues ceased, he and his servants
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59534:86"/>
hardened their hearts, and grew to that height, that he said, who is the Lord, that he should let his people go? Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> describeth these kind of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men thus; <hi>vidimus multos humiliates, sed non humiles,</hi> we see many humbled, few humble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Counterfeit or bastard humility, <hi>spuria humilitas,</hi> for in every vertue besides the two extreams, there is that which hath the likelihood of vertue, which they call <hi>spuriam virtutem,</hi> wherewith many are deceived. Thus some are naturally of a low servile disposition, which some take for humility, though it be nor, neither is it true humility to give in Gods cause, and not to be stout in maintaining it; for <hi>detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum veritatis non est ornamentum humilitatis,</hi> that which brings detriment to the truth, can be no ornament of humility. So to deny the gifts or graces of God in our selves is not true humility; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have the Ephes. understand his knowledge in the mysterie of Chist, Ephes. 3. 4. 5. and preferres the Jews, of which himself was one, before the Gentiles, Gal. 2. 15. and all this without pride. In e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one there is somewhat of God, somewhat of nature, somewhat of sinne; now its true, every man may see more sinne and corruption in himselfe then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so may say with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> I am the greatest sinner, 1 Tim. 1. 15. and may see that gift in another, which is not in himself, which he is bound to honour in him: but to prefer the gifts of nature in another before the gifts of grace in our selves; is not true but counterfeit humility. So likewise is that Hypocritical humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which some pretend for worldly ends, as that of <hi>Absolom,</hi> who though he were the kings son, yetbowed himself to every one, and kissed him &amp;c. whereby he stole away the hearts of the people, and rebelled against his father. 2 Sam 15. 5.</p>
               <p>Now the means to humility are these, among many other.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first is the considertion of the vilenesse of the composition of our bodies. Saint <hi>Basile</hi> saith, that mans life is a schoolehouse of humility, and his ground<note place="margin">In Hexameron</note> is upon that of the psalme, where the Prophet comparing his body to the celestiall bodies, falls into admiration, why God did rather choose to put a reasonable soul into<note place="margin">psal. 8. 3. 4.</note> his body rather then into them. What is in man (Lord) that thou art so mindful of him &amp;c. And out of that place in Genesis, where <hi>Abraham</hi> acknowledgeth himself to be but dust and ashes. Our nature is but a heap of dust, mingled with ashes. And the<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 27.</note> Philosopher saith, that we are but a pot of Choler and phlegme. And Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that it would be a prealvent motive to humility, if we would but take notice what manner of stuff passeth through our nose, ears, and other parts of our bodies <hi>nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam tam turpe sterquilinium reperites,</hi> we should see there is no such dunghill as our selves.</item>
                  <item>2. Another means is, the consideration of the estate of our souls. The humble Publican took notice of it, when he said, God be mercifull to me a sinner. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Luc. 18. 13.</note> seems to correct the translation of those words well, by <hi>mihi peccato</hi> to me which am nothing but sinne. For it is many of our cases. We are such sinners, as that<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14. 18.</note> the Apostle saith we are sold as slaves under sinne and in us, that is, in our flesh there dwelleth no good thing, insomuch that of our selves we are not able to think<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> a good thought. And not onely so, but if we consider that we have so multiplied our transgressions, as that they are more in number then the haires of our head, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much<note place="margin">psal. 40. 15. 38. 4.</note> as the burden of them is so intollerable that they are too heavy for us to bear. The consideration of these things will so humble us, that though the devill carry us into our own mountain and shew us any good thing in our selves, to tempt us with, <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note> we shall be able to say with <hi>Jacob,</hi> we are not worthy of the least of Gods mercyes,<note place="margin">Luc. 17. 10.</note> and that if we use the gifts we have never so well, yet to say, we are unprofitable servants, and that there is no gain to be expected from us to him, and with the Prophet O Lord righteousnesse belongeth to thee, but unto us confusion of faces, and<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 7.</note> lastly with King <hi>David.</hi> Not unto us Lord not unto us, but unto thy name give the<note place="margin">psal. 115. 1.</note> praise, for thy loving mercy and truths sake.</item>
                  <item>3. A third is, the consideration of the crosses and afflictions which God either hath or may lay upon us: and this is a sufficient motive to humble even the wicked. This wrought upon king <hi>Ahab</hi> (of whom it is said that he had sold himself to work<note place="margin">1 Kin. 21. 20. 29.</note> evil) a blaze of humility, which was not unrewarded. And certainly this is no small means to work this duty, and so we are to think of it. King <hi>David</hi> said, it is good for me that I have been afflicted. because thereby he learnt Gods statutes; this drives<note place="margin">psal. 119. 71.</note>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59534:86"/>
us to God by prayer, and to the word for comfort, it maks us to enter into the house of mourning, and to exercise discipline over our selves, with other the like effects which it works.</item>
                  <item>4. Lastly, the best and chief motive should be the example of our Saviour (of whom though there were many things worthy our learning and imitation in him) yet he would have us chiefly learn this duty of humility. Learn of me (saith he)<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> for I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And so all his acts upon earth did testifie of him;<note place="margin">John 8. 50. 8. 4.</note> his preaching was humble. he sought not his own glory, hismiracles without pride, see thou tell no man (said he) to the cured Leper, he begins his first sermon with, Blessed are the poor in spirit his behaviour was humble, of which he left an example in washing his disciples feet, <hi>exemplum dedi vobis,</hi> he was humble in his birth, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">John 13. 15.</note> in his life: but his death was a true pattern of humility beyond all presidents; He humbled himself to death, even the death of the Crosse.<note place="margin">phil. 2. 8.</note>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> upon our Saviours speech before mentioned, Mat. 11. 29. saith, <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Verb. Dom</note> 
                  <hi>a me, non mundum fabricare non cuncta visibilia &amp; invisibilia fabricare, non in ipso mundo miracula sacere et mortuos suscitare &amp;c. sed quod mitis sum et humilis corde, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitas magnam constituere fabricam celsitudinis, de fundamento prius cogita humilitatis;</hi> Learn of me, not to create the world, or all visible or invisible things, not to work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in the world, as to raise the dead &amp;c. but to be meek and lowly in heart as I am. Thou conceivest to erect a great fabrick of honour, first bethink thy self of laying the foundation of humility.</p>
               <p>And another Father upon our Saviours first sermon [Blessed are the poor in<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 3.</note> spirit] <hi>Ne contemnerent hominis humilitatem, placuit Deo plura largiri in humilitate sua, quam in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ea facere quae secit Deus,</hi> Lest men should despise humility, it pleased God to bestow more in the time of his humility, then in his Majesty, They therefore that are afraid to humble themselves, fear that which God himself did. And so we come to the signes of true humility.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first signe of true humility appears in our tongue, by ruling that and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to talk of matters above us. Speak not proud things. And not onely so, but<note place="margin">psal. 131. 1. 12. 3</note> not to have them in our thoughts, but to be content to deport our selves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that condition, in which God hath placed us. We must know how to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based and how to abound, else God will mislike us, as he did Baruch, who did <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere</hi>
                  <note place="margin">phil. 4. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>grandia,</hi> seek after great things. And therefore Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, this is a true signe of humility; when a man despiseth those things aswell which he might<note place="margin">De Catech. nud.</note> have, as them he would have.</p>
               <p>The second is, when we set before us for our object <hi>bona aliena et mala nostra illa ut aemulentur hac ut corrigentur,</hi> other mens good parts and our own evill, to follow their's and correct our own. When a man doth with the Prophet, acknowledge<note place="margin">psal. 51. 3.</note> his own sinne, and his own transgressions are ever before him: and not busie himself with other mens faults; whereas the proud mans thoughts are <hi>bona sua, mala aliena</hi> the evil in others, and the good that is in himself.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another signe is, when a man is able to suffer the slander, backbiting and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of ill tongues, and not regard them, as King <hi>David</hi> did. As for me (saith he) I was like a deaf man and heard not, and as one that is dumb and openeth not his<note place="margin">psal. 38. 13. 14.</note> mouth: and in the next verse, I became even as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth is no reproof. Thus he shewed his humil ty, when he bare patiently the railing of <hi>Shimei:</hi> Christ being reviled, reviled not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth, not to do any thing that may be against Gods glory, though it be to a mans own reproach and suffering in this world; when he is willing to suffer any thing himself, rather then any dishonour should red ound to God or his Church, by opening the mouths of the wicked Psal. 69. 6. Let not them that trust in thee be ashamed, O Lord God of hosts, for my cause, let not those that seek thee be confounded through me. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The last is not to rob God of his glory, or to give it to another. How can yee beleeve, saith Christ, that seek glory one of another. The humble man, as the<note place="margin">John. 5. 44.</note> Psalmist saith setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes, Psal. 15. 4. this is <hi>evidentissimum signum appropinguantis gloriae,</hi> for before honour goes humility, as a proud looke before a fall, Pro. 33..</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Spes</hi> Hope.</p>
               <p>AS the knowledge and belief of Gods justice worketh in us fear and humility, of which we have spoken, so from the knowledge and apprehension of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ariseth hope and love. After humility, we come to the valley of Achor for a doore of hope, as the Prophet speaks. When we have been brought to the valley of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Hos. g. 8. 15.</note> and have bin in fear and despaire, then will God open to us a door of hope; so that in stead of the first spirit, the spirit of bondage unto fear we shall receive the<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> spirit of adoption unto hope.</p>
               <p>Now by conferring our strength and performances with the strict rule of Gods justice, we finde it impossible, that we should hope for salvation, but by faith apprehending Gods mercy it may be possible, it may be considered as attainable two wayes 1. either by our selves, 2. or by some other.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Now concerning the former, if we look upon our selves, the effect of faith is fear, inasmuch as the object of it is Gods justce, and so we can have little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our selves, for this shews that it is impossible to us as of our selves, but as it is in the Apostle, every mouth must be stopped, and all the world must<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 19.</note> become guilty before God; ther's little hope that way.</item>
                  <item>2. But we are not left alltogether to despair: for though it be impossible to us of our selves, yet if it be possible by another, if another way may be found, ther's some hope</item>
               </list>
               <p>Faith reasoneth as the Psalmist doth. Hath God made all men for nought or in<note place="margin">psal. 89. 47.</note> vain? If he hath, then why falleth not his wrath at once? And searching further for the cause why we are not consumed, we finde, that his mercy is the cause. It is of the Lords mercy (saith the Prophet) that we are not consumed, for his compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fail not, and that the work of his creation is not in vain. Then consequently<note place="margin">Lam. 322.</note> a remnant there shall be, and God will have a tenth alwayes preserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">Esa. 6. 13.</note> and the holy seed shall be the substance thereof, and as it is in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, there shall be a little flock, and we may hope that of that little flock<note place="margin">Luc 12. 32.</note> we are.</p>
               <p>If the Lord were sparing of his mercy, that might be a great impediment to our<note place="margin">Esa. 30. 18.</note> hope, but when we read that the Lord waiteth to be gracious to us it setteth our hope in a better forwardnesse. Now because that out of the gate of mercy all our hope cometh we are to consider upon whom God vouchsafeth to bestow this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, how they must be qualified.</p>
               <p>The prophet saith, he will thrust his face into the dust (that is he will humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 29.</note> if peradventure he may have hope. And hope is given to them that fear, and are of a contrite spirit, and that tremble at Gods word, <hi>Spes timentibus Deum,</hi> hope<note place="margin">Esa. 66. 2.</note> is a reward to them that fear God. And as fear is requisite, so faith much more. God shews this kindnesse to them that put their trust in him, and all they that put<note place="margin">psal. 17. 7. 34. 21. 90. 14.</note> their trust in him shall not be destitute or forsaken. And when we hear God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self say, <hi>liberabo eum qui sperat in me,</hi> when the act of hope shall have such a reward, ther is good encouragement, and we may surely expect it. Now to hope is to trust<note place="margin">psal. 13. 5.</note> in Gods mercy, and so the psalmist saith. My trust is in thy mercy, for that is <hi>Porta spei</hi> the gate of hope theres no entrance unto God but by this gate, and no issue of good to us but by it, for faith apprehending mercy hopeth, and the rather because there is such plenty of mercy promised to them that hope in God, that it will compasse them round. Who so putteth his trust in the Lord, mercy imbraceth him<note place="margin">32. 11.</note> on every side.</p>
               <p>But it may be demanded how faith can beget both fear and hope, two contraries, or how two contraries can stand in one subject. To this may be answered, first we should not question it, in respect that the holy Ghost hath put them together so often.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59534:87"/>
The Psalmist saith, The Lords delight is in them that fear him, and put their trust in<note place="margin">psal. 147. 11.</note> his mercy. Again, faith breedeth fear in us, in respect of our weaknesse, and it breeds hope in respect of the mercies of God: so that they being contraries, <hi>non secundum idem,</hi> they may well stand together in the soule of a just man.</p>
               <p>For distinction sake. <hi>Fides credit promissis,</hi> faith beleeveth the promise, and <hi>spes expectat credita,</hi> hope looketh for the things we beleeve. Again, a thing may be believed and yet not hoped for; as no true Christian, though he hopes not for hell, yet he believes there is such a place. So the general truth of God, being the object of our faith, and containing many threatnings bringeth forth fear, and the mercy of God in his promises, being likewise an object of our faith, produceth hope. And so we see they are distinguished <hi>ab objecto,</hi> the one having Gods justice, and the other his goodnesse for its object.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Bernard</hi> distinguisheth the three vertues, of Faith, Hope, and Charity, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting<note place="margin">

                  <item>3. Charity saith, <hi>Curro ad illa,</hi> and I so run to them that I may attaine them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And thus out of the faith of the Gospel hope ariseth, as fear doth from the faith of the Law. And therefore hope is called by the Fathers, the <hi>Isaac</hi> of faith.</p>
               <p>This vertue of hope hath two uses.</p>
               <p>The first is, that it is our Anchor: for our life is as a sea, and our faith the ship.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 19.</note> Now when a man sailing in the sea of this life, feels his ship tossed with the waves of a conscience terrified with the justice of God, and is in the Apostles case, when<note place="margin">Acts 27. 29.</note> tackling and masts were spent, then fearing to be cast upon the rock of despair, he casts out this Anchor. And it is called by some of the Fathers our <hi>Interim,</hi> that which stayeth us in the mean time, till God performs that which he hath promised to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second use is, not onely to stay and support us, but also to stay and retain Christ with us, and accordingly the precept is, <hi>Custodispem, custodem Christi.</hi> So the Apostle counselleth us to take fast hold of it, and as when we are in danger of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 23.</note> or falling into a pit, we cast from us whatsoever we hold in our hands, and take fast hold of whatsoever cometh first to hand to stay us, such an use hath hope.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And under this use may be another, that by hope thus holding and keeping Christ here, we have a kinde of possession of heaven in this life, as a man may be <hi>presens absens,</hi> so a thing absent is present by hope; and as it was said of fear, that it wrought humility, by removing all impediments, so it may be said of hope, that it fills the soul by making things absent and future to become present, and in a manner enjoyed here.</p>
               <p>And this is one thing which the Philosophers never knew, that these which they called affections, Hope and Love; are become <hi>virtutes theologicae</hi> to Gods children, and the excellentest vertues in Divinity: the reason is, because they make them good that possesse them. For our nature not being able to be a rule to it self, but directed by an higher and more excellent nature, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that is, which applyeth that rule to us, must needs bring some part of goodnesse to us: which hope partly doth in respect of the promises, and therefore is a vertue to us. This the Heathen man expresseth by <hi>Pandoras</hi> Boxe, at the opening whereof all flew out, and onely Hope remained under the lidde.

               <p>And in the regenerate hope hath the same use, as the Prophet affirmeth; I should<note place="margin">psalm 27. 15.</note> utterly have fainted, but that I trust verily to see the goodnesse of the Lord in the land of the living; and in another place be saith, that his flesh resteth in<note place="margin">16. 10.</note> hope.

               <p>Now to conclude this first affirmative rule, we may say with the Psalmist, O Lord God of hosts, Blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee: which blessing in this life is, the certainty that we shall enter in with the Bridegroom to the<note place="margin">psalm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. 13.</note> fruition of it in the life to come. And thus we have seen the nature, necessity, and end of hope.</p>
               <p>Now for the first rule, concerning what is commanded and forbidden. Our rule<note place="margin">2.</note> for faith and hope is not unlike to that of humility.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As <hi>Nebuchadouozor Daniel</hi> 4. 27. ascribed the building of great Babel to his own power, and made his own glory the end of it; so on the contrary (as we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of humility) we also say of hope, it makes God the Author of all the good it looks for, and makes his glory the end of all. For first it makes us go out of our selves and trust onely in God, and wholly rely upon him, as the sole efficient cause of good, to us, we must wholly depart out of our selves, we must not conceive that there is any sufficiency in our selves, but that all our sufficiency is of God, not so much as to think a good thought, therefore much lesse to have a will to do it; but that it is God that works the <hi>velle,</hi> and consequently the <hi>perficere,</hi> both the will and the deed in us.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> We must not ascribe any part or help to our selves; for our Saviour saith, <hi>Sine me</hi>
                  <note place="margin">phil. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>nihil potestis facere,</hi> without me ye can do nothing. Upon which place <hi>S. Augustine</hi> noteth, it is not <hi>nihil magni,</hi> but <hi>nihil omnino,</hi> not any great thing, but nothing at all,<note place="margin">John 15. 5.</note> and not <hi>nihil perficere,</hi> that we can perfect nothing, but <hi>nihil facere</hi> do nothing at all. And as it makes God the cause and first beginning, so the last end too, by giving the glory of his graces in us to him; and the reason is plain in the Apostle, That no flesh should glory in his presence, but, as it followeth, That he that glorieth should<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 29. 31</note> glory in him.</p>
               <p>In the exercise of hope two things are commonly seen. 1. Grief. 2. Joy. Joy because we hope for that which is good, and grief because the good we hope for is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed. Or rather <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> 1. joy, and then grief. If hope be true, it never suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to be secure, but we shall be in a continual war. The Apostle intimates to us, that we are warriours, when he adviseth us to put on the helmet of hope. And in<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 8.</note> the Psalms King <hi>David</hi> is sometime beaten down, and sometime raised again; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time<note place="margin">prov. 13. 12.</note> hope and joy are victors, sometime fear and grief. And seeing <hi>delatio boni,</hi> must have <hi>rationem mali,</hi> and that hope deferred <hi>affligit animam,</hi> afflicts the soul, it must needs be a great affliction to the soul, that when a man shall see that which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised not onely deferred, but sometimes to happen clean contrary as when he looks for peace, then terrour and anguish to follow; he shall finde not onely wicked men<note place="margin">psalm 115. 2.</note> and enemies upbraiding him and saying, as they to <hi>David, ubi spes vestra,</hi> where is your hope? but even his own reason shall make a probleme with his spirit within him, and tell him it is in vain to hope any longer. Surely this must work upon men, for it worketh even in dumb creatures, though they shall not be partakers of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 22.</note> with us, yet because the deliverance of man is not accomplished, they are said to groan, and desire to be delivered.</p>
               <p>Now the onely remedy for this is the consideration expressed by <hi>S. Augustine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">in Psalm 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Sustine illum, sustinuit te, si sustinuit te dum mutares vitam malam, sustine tu illum dum coronat vitam bonam,</hi> bear with him that hath born with thee; if he have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne thee whilst thou alterest thy ill life, forbear him whiles he crowns a good life. This hath great reason for it, which shall be afterwards shewed when we come to treat of patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Basil</hi> compareth the Gospel to a net, and fear to the lead which makes it sink, and keeps it fast, and hope to the cork, which keeps it alwayes above, without the lead of fear it would be carried hither and thither, and without the cork of hope it would sink down under water: and the Apostle shewes a joy in hope, and therefore wills us to hold fast the profession of our faith, without wavering;<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 12.</note> and he gives a sufficient reason, for he is faithful that hath promised. And so<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 13.</note> all these are necessarily to be observed in this command of hope. Another thing commanded is hope for earthly things. For as our Saviour saith of faith,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59534:88"/>
he that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much. God exerciseth our<note place="margin">Luke 16. 10.</note> faith in heavenly things by a faith in earthly things; so it may be said of hope, If a man can hope for heavenly things, can he not hope for earthly? And he that will not hope in God for the lesse, will not hope for the more. Our Saviour argueth from the greater to the lesse. God having given us a soul, providing food to preserve life,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 25.</note> how much more will he provide food and raiment for our bodies; and if he cause his sun to shine, and the rain to fall upon the wicked and ungodly, will he not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his servants? <hi>Qui pascit contemnents, non pascet colentes?</hi> He that feeds them that despise him, will he not feed them that love him? And our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuteth his argument, that if God provide for the fowls of the air, and the lilies<note place="margin">30.</note> of the field, shall he not do it much more for man, for whose use all things are made<note place="margin">psalm 40. 4.</note> and preserved? Therefore must we cast our selves upon God, and not trust to the<note place="margin">Esay 28. 15.</note> proud, and such as go about with lies.</p>
               <p>The care for temporal things is lawful, so it be restrained within its limits, that is, within the lawful means and wayes which God alloweth. For <hi>terrena bene curantur, nil male agendo contra illa:</hi> so <hi>bene contemnuntur, nil male agendo propter illa;</hi> we are careful enough for the things of this life, if we do not waste them, and carelesse enough of them, if we use no ill means to get them.</p>
               <p>We come now to that which is forbidden. The object of hope is <hi>bonum,</hi> and not every <hi>bonum</hi> neither, but that good which we see not, as the Apostle speaks, it must be <hi>futurum. Spes quae videtur non est spes,</hi> as it is in faith; and besides, that it is <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 25.</note> it must also be <hi>possibile,</hi> and <hi>arduum,</hi> possible to be had, yet not with ease, but with some difficulty, to make us the better to esteem of it; for if we could obtain it presently, we need not hope for it. And out of these two arise two extreams of hope, which are here forbidden. 1. Presumption. 2. Despair.</p>
               <p>Whereas eternal life is propounded as a thing possible, <hi>arduum tamen,</hi> not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without difficulty, there ariseth in our minde an affection, called Presumption, whereby we apprehend it as possible and easy, and so neglect to labour for it, as a thing of difficulty, and thus presumption hopeth without hope. But to avoid this we must know, that the Lords delight is in them that fear him, and hope in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.<note place="margin">psalm 147. 11</note> This hope must be mixed with fear, in regard of the hardness: of attaining, <hi>ne</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 12</note> 
                  <hi>forte reprobi fiamus;</hi> as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he had been taken up into the third heaven, yet feared afterward, lest he should become a cast away.</p>
               <p>So then, as there ought to be hope in regard of the possibility, so in respect of the difficulty we must not presume, we are not to presume of our selves, or of others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not of our selves. For we are to know that of our selves we can do nothing, unlesse there be, <hi>Gratia praeveniens, &amp; subsequens,</hi> preventing and following grace, which is <hi>divinum auxilium,</hi> the divine aid: if these be wanting, our hope is meer presumption and folly. <hi>Sine me nihil potest is facere,</hi> without me ye can do nothing, is sufficient to correct this humour: and <hi>S. Bernard</hi> saith of the first, <hi>Quaerere</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Cant. serm. 8</note> 
                  <hi>Deum non potest anima, nisi praeveniatur ut quaerat.</hi> The soul cannot seek God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this preventing grace. And for the last, the Psalmist saith, Thy loving kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">psalm. 23. 6.</note> and mercy shall follow me all the dayes of my life. So that whatsoever we do, all must be attributed to Gods grace. <hi>Gratiae divinae ascribitur omne quod prospere a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg. in Reg.</note> 
                  <hi>nobis geritur,</hi> saith <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> whatsoever is well done of us is all and wholly ascribed to Gods grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are not to presume upon the help of others, our hope and trust must not be put in man. Put not your trust in Princes (saith the Psalmist) nor in any childe of man, and why? Because there is no help in them. Not in <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Israel,</hi> for they<note place="margin">psalm 146. 3.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Esay 63. 16.</note> know not; nor in Saints or Angels: for they are not clean in his sight. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Job 15. 15.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Solus siduciam praestat homini apud Deum, Deus homo,</hi> it is onely God the man that gives man confidence with God; for he is onely <hi>Clypeus sperantium in eum,</hi> a buckler to all them that trust in him. God hath his ax in his hand<note place="margin">psalm. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 30.</note> ready to strike us, no creature is able to ward off the blow, it is onely this <hi>Deus homo,</hi> Christ Jesus God and man, that is able to bear it off from us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As a man may not presume of himself nor others, so neither may he presume upon God further then his word gives warrant. The word of God begetteth faith, and faith hope, so that there can be no hope without faith, nor faith without a promise in the word whereupon to build. <hi>David</hi> went no further, Remember
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59534:89"/>
the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. And therefore<note place="margin">psalm 119. 49.</note> it were a point of high presumption for a man to continue in sin, in hope of Gods mercies, without repentance and amendment of life, whereas there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God, that unrepentant sinners should finde mercy.</p>
               <p>The other extream is Desperation, which is opposite and flat contrary to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,<note place="margin">2.</note> and hope too; for whereas true hope conceiveth a thing possible, though it be hard, and presumption takes it to be possible, but not hard; Despair thinketh it to be so hard, that it is impossible. Despair is of two sorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first is the Epicurean despair. And it was the Israelites fault. He smote (said they) the stony rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed,<note place="margin">psalm 78. 20.</note> can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? <hi>S. Gregory</hi> giveth us a note. Because the Israelites <hi>ex luxuria</hi> were not fed with Quails, as their<note place="margin">Lib. 3 Moral.</note> lust came upon them, presently <hi>desperaverunt,</hi> they despired of Gods omnipotency, or of his care in protecting them and providing for them. And when a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth, that either the thing promised will be alwayes <hi>futurum,</hi> to come, or if it hath no taste at all with him, or that it is a thing not much to be esteemed, he giveth himself to sensuality, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> said, <hi>Quia non possum habere quae spero,</hi> because I cannot have what I hope for, (at my own will) I will have those things which are <hi>contra spem,</hi> that is, those things which I can have in this life, which being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent cannot be the object of hope, according to the Epicures rule, <hi>Ede, bibe, lude, post mortem nulla voluptas;</hi> eat, drink, play, for there is no pleasure after death to be hoped for.</item>

                     </gap> second is more to be pitied, but no lesse dangerous then the other, which is despair in Gods mercy. The Apostle was afraid lest the incestuous person should<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 7.</note> have been swallowed with this. This errour ariseth upon an imagination that there may proceed such evil from the Creature, as God cannot master; whereas it is most certain, that Gods mercies exceed all sin. And this was <hi>Cains</hi> case and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. My iniquity is greater then can be forgiven. <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> writing upon that place, saith,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Mentiris Cain, Cain</hi> thou lyest; for if it were possible or lawful to think, that any one attribute of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> had larger dimensions then another, it must needs be mercy, that would be most transcendent, because it is an attribute which reacheth unto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, whereas his righteousnesse standeth like the strong mountains, and his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">psalm 36. 5.</note> like the great deep. Therefore the School-men disputing the case of <hi>Judas,</hi> whether his betraying of Christ, or despair of Gods mercy was the greater sin, they resolve that his despair was the greater, because it rejected the medicine of Gods mercy and Christs merits, by which the other sin might have been cured, and so it was simply incureable. Despair not therefore, nor let the Devil perswade thee, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is poor in mercy, and onely can forgive small sins; for his mercy is over all his works.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The means to attain and preserve hope are these. First to consider the end of our<note place="margin">prov. 11. 7.</note> hope, which extends it self beyond this life. The Wise man saith, when a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of unjust men perisheth, but the just hath hope in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The consideration of our end raiseth our hope higher<note place="margin">23. 18.</note> then this life. And in another place he tells us, that surely there will be an end, and our hope shall not be cut off; it ends not with our life; and therefore <hi>S. Peter</hi> (quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">psalm 16. 9.</note> a place in the Psalms) saith, Our heart shall be glad, and our flesh shall rest in<note place="margin">Act. 2. 26.</note> hope. So that death doth not put an end to our hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To consider the examples of others. That the Patriarchs and Fathers lost not the fruit of their hope. Our Fathers (saith the Psalmist) hoped in thee, they trusted<note place="margin">psalm 22. 4, 5.</note> in thee, and thou didst deliver them. They called upon thee and were holpen, they put their trust in thee, and were not confounded. And by these examples we should be quickened in our hope. For it is the Devils policy to lay despair as an engine to entrap us; perswading us, that there were never such sinners as we are, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never were any in the like case with us, But if we look back into the Scriptures, we shall finde him to be but a seducer in this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third is our own experience of Gods strengthening us against former tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of our own former deliverances from sin and danger, which may make us say with <hi>David,</hi> The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 37</note> lyon, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59534:89"/>
Philistine; this is drawn from our experience, then which nothing vseth to be more prevalent with us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the chiefe means is that, which is formerly alledged, the consideration of<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 23.</note> the promise of God, and withall that the promise is sure, because he is faithfull that hath promised. And whatsoever is written concerning these promises aforetime were written for our instruction, that through patience and comfort of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> we might have hope. And this hath been the especial ayme of the holy Ghost, to strengthen our hope, in mentioning it so often in Scripture. And it is onely God whose <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> is <hi>factum est,</hi> whose word and work go together, therefore his promise is so sure, that he speaks of things to come in the preter tense, as if they were already done, <hi>de futuris in preterito.</hi> Therefore <hi>Nathan</hi> said to King <hi>David, transtulit non trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 13.</note> God hath taken away or put away thy sinne, not God will put it away. So Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that he hath (already) raised us and made us sit in heavenly places in Christ<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 6.</note> Jesus; because though it be not yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet is it as certain in respect of the promise, as if it were already come.</p>
               <p>Now seeing God is good and faithfull, we may safely hope in him. There is one thing remarkable and true in the blasphemous speech of <hi>

O put thy trust in God, for he is the health of my countenance and my God.</p>
               <p>There are certain signes whereby we may know, whether our hope be right, for there is fleeting hope, when a man thinks he hopes, but doth not, as a man may think he beleeves, but doth not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is the signe which appeared in Ezechias; in his sicknes saith he, I beseech<note place="margin">2 Kin. 20. 3.</note> thee, O Lord remember now, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart. To have been mindfull of God in prosperity, is a good ground for hope in adversity.</p>

The second is Saint <hi>Johns.</hi> Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">1 John 3. 3.</note> keeps a pure conscience, doth not (as they which presume) make their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science a receptacle of corruption upon hope. For, as the fathers say, <hi>Conscientia bona custos spei</hi> if it be kept clean our hope is true and right.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is <hi>Davids.</hi> Hope in the Lord, and be doing good, it must be<note place="margin">psal. 37. 3.</note> active and doing good. The heathen call labour the husband of hope. There is hope the harlot, and hope the married woman; now hope the wife may be known from the harlot by this, that she is alwayes with her husband, accompanied with labour. <hi>Sacrificate sacrificium justitiae, et sperate in Domino,</hi> offer to God the sacrifice of<note place="margin">psal. 4. 5.</note> righteousnesse, and put your trust in the Lord. There must be travaile and strife to do good in a true hope.</p>

                  </gap> and operations: besides which one grace usually depends so upon another, that one may be called the fruit and effect of another Thus the fruit of faith is hope, and the fruit of hope is prayer, <hi>Speioperatio, oratio,</hi> hope works by prayer. And so the property of hope is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> us up to prayer, and the property of prayer is to be <hi>interpres spei,</hi> that is, to expresse the desires of our hope. In which respect, as the Articles of our faith are <hi>summa credendorum,</hi> the summe of things to be beleeved, and the Law <hi>summa agendorum,</hi> the sum of things to be done, so the Lords prayer is <hi>summa sperandorum,</hi> the summe of things to be hoped. For the soul of man by considering and beleeving the judgements of God, being brought down, dejected, and humbled to the dust, and as it were struck dead, hath some life put into it again, by conceiving hope in his mercy: for which we must repair to God by prayer, and nothing better beseemeth a suitor for it then prayer and supplication.<note place="margin">in Psal. 66.</note> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Precibus non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Therefore that hope may be partaker of its object mercy, we are to know, that mercy is onely to be expected and obtained from God by prayer. And therefore Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>ut descendat miseratio, ascendat oratio,</hi> let prayer as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend that mercy may descend; and so there shall be a blessed entercourse between his mercy and our prayer.</p>
               <p>while we speak of prayer (lest we mistake) we are to conceive, that prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not onely in that which we outwardly make in the congregation, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calls <hi>vitulum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We see the experience of it in <hi>Moses.</hi> The Lord saith to him, why criest thou to me? though there be no mention of any word he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. and this is principally and truely prayer, for without it the prayer of the lips prevaileth not. Our Saviour seemeth to taxe the Scribes with resting in outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And he tells his disciples in the sermon upon the mount, that it is not the ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Lord, Lord that will gain the kingdom of heaven.

               <p n="1">1. Now the main end and scope of prayer is Gods honour and glory. It pleaseth<note place="margin">psal. 123. 2.</note> God by the prophet to account this as an especial honour done to him, that even as the eyes of servants look to the hands of their masters, and the eyes of an handmaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hand of her mistresse, so our eyes wait on the Lord, untill he have mercy upon us, or, as Saint <hi>Augustine Magna est gloria Dei ut nos simus mendici ejus,</hi> It is Gods great<note place="margin">Serm. 5. de. verb.

And this he accounts as an addition to his glory, when we ackowledge, that what we have, we have not

Besides, he takes it as a further honour to him, as an homage we render him, when we thank and glorifie him, either for benefits, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, and to encourage us to this duty, he addes a promise. Call upon me (saith he) in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee (but upon what condition?)<note place="margin">psal 50. 15.</note> and thou shalt glorifie me. But this we may see set down most excellently by the Prophet, where he particularly exacts the dutie from five seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sorts of men in one Psalm, that are there mentioned, as more especially bound to God.<note place="margin">psal. 107.</note>
               </p>

               <p>These several sorts of men, as he there speaketh, when they cry unto the Lord, he delivereth them out of their distresse; and therefore he often reiterates this and saith, Oh that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodnes, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men.</p>
               <p>And this deliverance by prayer hath three effects, whereby God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When an humble minded man upon his prayer finds this deliverance, he is<note place="margin">psal. 34. 2. 15. 13. 107. 42.</note> thankful and glad.</item>

               </list>
               <p>By all these wayes prayer brings glory to God.</p>
               <p>If then prayer bring such glory to God, and that without it God is like to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of a great part of his honour,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It concerns us necessarily to practise it: and that not onely in respect of God, but of our selves too. Our Saviour sheweth this by the parable of the widdow, and the unjust judge where her importunity prevailing with a wicked judge, shewes <hi>a</hi>

                  <hi>majori,</hi> how powerful prayer is with God, a father of tender mercies, and that we ought to pray allwayes, and not faint. And therefore having a care that we should know how to pray, he himself who never did any superfluous act, and who is our advocate and daily intercessor with God. set down a form to our hands, to instruct how to pray daily.<note place="margin">11. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the use whereof, that comes to minde, which <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes in his first book <hi>de orando Deum,</hi> out of Dan. 6. 10. where bodily death being set before Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, if he prayed during thirty dayes, on the other side, <hi>tanquam si,</hi> as if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance for that time would be the death of his soul, he chose rather to hazard his life, then to neglect his daily custome.</p>
               <p>In the Law besides the observation of the Sabbath there was a morning and an evening sacrifice. Which was a type, and is explained by the Psalmist to be prayer,<note place="margin">

The fathers have for the most part written largely<note place="margin">Numb. 28. 3. 8</note> upon the necessity of this duty, and call it <hi>Clavem diei, et seram noctis,</hi> the key to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the day and the bar to shut in the night. Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> calls it <hi>signaculum diei,</hi> the seal of the day, out of the Apostle, who saith, that the creatures are good being sanctified by prayer; else not, and so it is a seal to confirme a blessing of the Creatures<note place="margin">in Tim. 4. 5.</note> for the day following. And in this respect it is said, that our Saviour blessed the loaves, by looking up to heaven, that is, by praying as also the meat at supper by<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 19. 26. 26. 30.</note> blessing it be fore and singing an hymne of thanksgiving after.</p>
               <p>And this is no new thing, but a custome as ancient as <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Jews record, who continue it still: the chief of the family first takes bread, and blesses it by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and then breaks it, and the last thing is to take the cup, and then to give a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond blessing; this being so holy a practise, the whole Church of the Jews to our Saviours time observed it as a thing most necessary: from which custome Christ translated the use of it to his own supper. The Apostle fits all the rest of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 13.</note> armour to some speciall part, as to the head, the breast, the feet, but specifies no

And as God is ready to promise, so is he also to perform; yea so ready is he on<note place="margin">Esay 65. 24.</note> his part, that he saith, before they call I will hear. To testifie this, he erected<note place="margin">Exod. 30. 6.</note> a mercy seat in the Tabernacle: and when the temple was built, he gives it a name<note place="margin">Esay 56. 7.</note> from this duty of prayer, The House of prayer, to shew how ready he would be to hear the prayers there put up; and that not onely by his own people, but even by strangers too; for whom <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed at the consecration of the Temple:<note place="margin">1 King. 8. 41.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezra 7. 23.</note> and this was acknowledged by the Persian King, who calls it, the house of the God of Heaven. Herein was the mercy seat placed, and the first part of the service was<note place="margin">psalm 141. 2.</note> incense, which as we shewed before, is often interpreted to signifie prayer: and<note place="margin">Luke 1. 10.</note> so it is intimated in the Gospel, when we read that the people were without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while the Priest was within at the typical worship, burning of incense.

But as a necessary preparative to this, the Saints have ever used Confession and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of sins. The Prophet in sundry Psalms runneth first over all his sins, sins of omission and commission, of thought, word, and deed, against God, his brethren or himself, by instigation of others, or of his own accord. For <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. He that covereth his sins shal not prosper; that's a dangerous saying: and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 3, 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> dangerous example; till he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his sins, his bones consumed, and his moysture was turned into the drought of summer. So likewise did <hi>Daniel</hi> make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession before he comes to petition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The chief thing to be prayed against, <hi>maxime deprecandum,</hi> is to be kept from falling into sin by temptation. That we may not be winnowed by <hi>Sathan.</hi> Not to wish<note place="margin">Luke 22. 32.</note> as commonly we do, I would I were out of the world, but as our Saviours prayer for his Disciples, I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou<note place="margin">John 17. 15.</note> shouldest keep them from the evil. And we desiring but thus, certainly Gods promise will not be unperformed, for he is faithful who will not suffer us to be tempted above<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> that we are able. And either our strength shall encrease with the strength of our crosse, or, as our strength, so our crosse shall diminish. The enemy shall not be able to do us<note place="margin">Psalm 89. 23.</note> violence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to deprecate temporal dangers, as <hi>Jehosbaphat</hi> did. We know not what to do, <hi>hoc solum restat, ut ad te oculos dirigamus Domine,</hi> Our eyes are upon thee, O<note place="margin">2 Chro. 20. 12</note> God. And then in our trouble and distresse <hi>Nomen Domini</hi> shall be <hi>turris fortissime,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 18. 10.</note> The Name of the Lord will be a strong tower to us. But yet concerning temporal evil, we must stand affected as the three children were, who answer'd K. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 17. 18.</note> our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery fornace; but if not (because the promise and covenant is conditionall) we will not serve thy God &amp;c.<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 39.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus far and no farther went our Saviour when he used deprecation, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if it be possible, let this cup passe from me: neverthelesse not my will, but<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 42.</note> thine be done.</p>
               <p>The second branch of Invocation is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Precation, which is the desiring of<note place="margin">2.</note> some thing that is good. There is no one thing more common in the Psalms then this; as, 1. Give me understanding. So 2. Establish the thing that thou hast<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 73. 125.</note> wrought in us, &amp;c. As the first prayer is to give what we want; so the second is, establish and confirm it in us when we have it. 3. The third is that of the Apostles,<note place="margin">68. 28.</note> to our Saviour, Lord increase our faith in us. We must not keep at a stand in<note place="margin">Luke 17. 5.</note> grace, but desire an increment, that we may grow in grace, as the Apostle coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selleth<note place="margin">2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Concerning this part of prayer, petition of the good we want, It is true, our desires are not alwayes granted; for as Christ answered the sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> ye ask<note place="margin">Matth. 20. 22.</note> ye know not what; so it may be said to us, we often desire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that which is agreeable to our own humours then to Gods will; as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> reports of a Thief, who purposing to continue in his sin, <hi>orabat Deum ut non caperetur, &amp; eo citius ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piebatur,</hi> he prayed that he might not be taken, and was taken so much the sooner, because he so prayed.</p>
               <p>Therefore the rule we must follow, and whereon we must ground our prayer is that promise, <hi>Quicquid secundum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">

                  </gap>, to dwell in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of God all the dayes of his life, to continue in the Church of God all his life, where he might glorifie God, and work out his own salvation. Whatsoever is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to these ends, we may safely ask, and be sure God will grant, and therefore our Saviour tells us, that God grants his Spirit to those that ask him, this is one thing which he will not deny us.</p>
               <p>Now with these, or after these, we may pray for temporal things, that is, we may pray, first, for a competency, not for superfluity. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>S. Augustine</hi> faith, <hi>non indecenter petit, quia hoc petit, &amp; non amplius,</hi> it is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming prayer, because he asks onely so much, and no more. 2. We must desire them with condition, if God see it expedient, submitting to his will; as Christ, If it be possible, and if it be thy will: so did <hi>David</hi> praying for restitution to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 25</note> If I have found favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, &amp;c. if not, here I am, let him do what seemeth good to him. He resignes all to Gods will, and there is no more compendious way to obtain what we need, then to resigne all to Gods pleasure, whatsoever means we use, or however we struggle, nothing will avail without this.</p>
               <p>Now that which was mentioned before, concerning <hi>omnis &amp; omnia,</hi> falls in best to be expounded here. It seems strange that every one that asks shall have, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he asks he shall have, seeing it is certain that many ask and have not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We must remember that of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> that our duty is to pray however; for as he saith, <hi>Jubet ut petas, &amp; si non petis displicet, &amp; non negabit quod petis, &amp; si non petes?</hi> doth God command thee to pray, and is he displeased if thou prayest not, and will he not deny thee what thou prayest for, and yet dost thou not pray?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We must know that the cause why we receive not, is not in his promise, but in<note place="margin">Jac. 4. 3.</note> our asking. Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amisse, saith <hi>S. James.</hi> For it is not a demonstrative signe of Gods favour to us, to have all we desire granted; for we see<note place="margin">psal. 78. 18. 27. 30. 31.</note> that the Israelites desired flesh, and flesh God sent them, but is was with displeasure: for while the meat was yet in their mouthes, the wrath of God came upon them, and flew the mightiest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. And upon the<note place="margin">1 Sam 8. 22.</note> peoples violent desire to have a king, God gave them one, but in displeasure. Nay it<note place="margin">Job 1. &amp; 2.</note> is so far from a favour, that God sometimes grants the Devils (whom he favours not)<note place="margin">Mark 5. 13.</note> their requests; as in the case of <hi>Job</hi> and the Swyne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as this is not an absolute signe of favour, so Gods denying of our requests, is not alwayes a signe of his displeasure. This we may see in <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who obtained not<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 8.</note> that he desired concerning the prick in the flesh. 1. One reason <hi>S. Isidore</hi> and <hi>S. Aug.</hi> give; <hi>Saepc multos Deus non exaudit ad voluntatem, ut exaudiat ad salutem,</hi> God oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<note place="margin">De <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Aug,</hi> God denies not, but only defers to grant, that we might by his deferring them, ask and esteem of them more highly. <hi>Desideria delatione cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt, &amp;cito data vilescunt,</hi> desire encreaseth by delay, and things soon given are of light esteem: and therefore he adds, <hi>Servat tibi Deus quod non vult cito dare, ut &amp; tu</hi>

                     </gap>. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>discas magna magis desiderare,</hi> God keeps for thee, that he will not give thee quickly, that thou mayest learn with more affection to desire great things. 3. A third reason is, that we might the more earnestly ask for them; which our Saviour intimates in two parables to us; one of the unjust judge, and the importunate widow: and the other of<note place="margin">Luke 18. 2.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 11. 8.</note> the friend that called up his neighbor at midnight; by both telling us, how much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity prevails with God. 4. A fourth is; God, though he gives not <hi>quod petimus,</hi> what we ask, yet he will give <hi>quod novit utilius,</hi> what he knows to be more profitable<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 8.</note> for us: as in the case of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> My grace shall be sufficient for thee. 5. Some things we pray for may be hurtful to us, (as knives for children) so as that <hi>non accipiendo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepimus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In <hi>Johan.</hi> 14.</note> we are better by wanting then possessing them. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> calls prayers for such things, childish and aguish prayers; as <hi>S. Aug. male usurus eo quod vnlt accipere, Deo potius miserante non accepit,</hi> God in compassion lets not him receive, that which he meant to use ill. And therefore sometime to misse that which we conceive to be a<note place="margin">In lib. sent.</note> benefit, is a blessing. And therfore we will conclude this point with a saying of <hi>S. Aug.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prosperi.</note> 
                  <hi>fideliter supplicans Deo pro necessitatibus hujus vitae, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> medicus quam aegrotus,</hi> God in mercy hears, and in mercy hears not a faithful suppliant for the necestities of this life; for the Physitian knows what is profitable for the sick man better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. These reasons are from the matter of our prayers, others taken from the manner of our asking may be mentioned hereafter.</p>
               <p>The third part of Invocation is Interpellation or Intercession, which is prayer either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for the prosperity or against the crosses of others. The Fathers seldome quote the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but in this <hi>S. Aug.</hi> cites <hi>S. Ambrose. Frater mi, si pro te rogas tantum, pro te unus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hexam. lib. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>orabit, si autem pro omnibus rogas, omnes pro te rogabunt,</hi> My brother, if thou only pray
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59534:93"/>
for thy self, one shall pray alone for thy self, but if thou pray for all men, all men will<note place="margin">In Moral.</note> pray for thee. And <hi>S. Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Quisquis pro aliis intercedere nititur, sibi potius ex charitate suffragat, &amp; pro semet ipso tanto citius audiri meretur, quanto magis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote pro aliis intercedit,</hi> whosoever prayes for others, doth the rather pray for himself, and by so much the sooner deserves to be heard for himself, by how much the more devoutly he intercedes for others. <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> hath an excellent speech to this purpose. <hi>Pro se orare necessitas cogit, pro aliis charitas fraternitatis</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Matth.</note> 
                  <hi>hortatur: dulcior autem ante Deum est oratio, non quam necessitas transmittit, sed quam charitas fraternitatis commendat:</hi> it is meere necessity that compels a man to pray for himself, but it is a brotherly affection that draws a man to pray for others: and that prayer is more acceptable to God, which is caused by love then necessity.</p>
               <p>This part of invocation hath divers branches. As we are to pray for all men. 1. For<note place="margin">1 John 5. 16.</note> sinners, that have not sinned unto death, and there is a promise that prayer shall be<note place="margin">James 5. 15.</note> heard. In which respect there is a prayer in our Liturgie, first for them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church, for their conversion, as Heathens, Jews, Turks, Hereticks, Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: then for those that are in the Church; which are with us, and yet not of us, but are still in blindnesse and ignorance, or know but practise not. 2. We are to pray for them, that not onely are oppressed with outward afflictions, but inward tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of their sins. 3. For those that stand, that they fall not, but persevere. 4. For them that are our enemies and persecute us. And for this we<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 44.</note> have not onely our Saviours percept, but the practise of holy men. Saint <hi>Gregory Hum.</hi> 27. <hi>in Evang.</hi> upon that place in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 15. 1. where God saith, though <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> stood before me, yet my heart could not be towards this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c. asks the question, why <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> are especially named; and gives this reason, Because the prayers of such are most powerful with God, who having received an injury, can presently pray for those that wronged them. Now such are <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel.</hi> For <hi>Moses</hi> when the people were ready to stone him, presently<note place="margin">Exod. 17. 4.</note> prayeth for them. <hi>Samuel</hi> though the people desired to cast off his government,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 23</note> yet saith, God forbid that I should cease to pray for you. And of these prayers it is said, that they shall return into our own bosome. They are very effectuall,<note place="margin">psalm 35. 13.</note> for in these cases, <hi>Qui pro aliis orat, prose laborat,</hi> he that prayes for others, labours for himself. 5. For Kings and Magistrates, as the Apostle adviseth. 6. Lastly, but<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> most especially for the peace and good of the Church. O pray for the peace of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,<note place="margin">psalm 122. 6. 137. 6.</note> saith the Psalmist, who also wished, that his tongue might cleave to the roof of his mouth, if he forgate to pray for it.</p>
               <p>The fourth branch of Invocation is Thanksgiving. Invocation is for that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> want and desire. Thanksgiving is for that we have received. So that whether we be answered before we call, as the Prophet speaks, when God gives before we ask;<note place="margin">Esay. 65. 24.</note> or whether it be given us when we ask, in both cases we have cause to enter<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 7.</note> into this consideration, <hi>Quid retribuam Domino,</hi> what shall I render unto the Lord<note place="margin">psalm 116. 12</note> for all his benefits. And indeed the chief end of all should be the glory of God. For, for his glory all things that are made were created: the seventh day when he had<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 3.</note> finished his work of creation was instituted for his praise and glory. And for this purpose man was placed in Paradise to praise him, and after his fall mankinde had perished, and all things had been again reduced to nothing, but that God might have<note place="margin">Esa. 24. 13. &amp;c</note> some to glorifie him. Now it is plain that God takes and accepts of thanks as a great part of his glory. And therefore were the thank-offerings among other sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices<note place="margin">2 Chro. 29. 31 33. 16.</note> for Gods service and glory instituted of old; and he that offereth me thanks<note place="margin">psalm 50. 23.</note> (saith God by the Prophet) giveth me glory: and the Apostle, All things are for<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 15.</note> your sakes, that the aboundant grace might, through the thanksgiving of many, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>That which the Heathen said is true, <hi>Gratus animus est meta benignitatis,</hi> gratitude is the end of bounty. And it is the condition of our obligation to God, and of Gods<note place="margin">psalm 50. 15.</note> to us. Call upon me in ime of trouble, and I will hear you, there is Gods, and thou shalt glorifie me, there is ours.</p>
               <p>The Hebrews make Thanksgiving to consist of four parts, according to the four words used by thankful persons in Scripture.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Confession or acknowledgement, <hi>Confitebor,</hi> I will confesse, that we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 7.</note> but that we have received from God. That our help cometh from the hills from<note place="margin">psalm 121. 1.</note>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59534:93"/>
no inferiour creature, from above <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from the Father of lights. Nor must we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal<note place="margin">James 1. 17.</note> what we have received. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that as he <hi>Qui putat se habere quod non habet temerarius est,</hi> he is rash that thinks he hath that he hath not, so he <hi>qui non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> quod habet ingratus est,</hi> that confesseth not what he hath is unthankful. And therefore we must acknowledge them, as <hi>data</hi> not <hi>innata,</hi> as of Gods gift, not of our own acquiring.</item>
                  <item>2. The second is contentment and complacency in Gods gifts by a gratefull accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what it pleaseth God to bestow upon us, <hi>complacui,</hi> I am well pleased. King <hi>David</hi> may be a pattern to us in this point. The Lot is fallen to me in a fair ground, yea<note place="margin">psal. 16. 6.</note> I have a goodly heritage, it liked him well, he desired no more. For as Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> saith <hi>Spiritui gratiae contumeliam facit, qui beneficium dantis grata mente non susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi> The undervaluing of gods blessings by not being content with what he sends<note place="margin">In Eph.</note> us is a reproach to the spirit of grace. And it was the disease of the Israelites four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">In Johan.</note> years together. Of which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>De nulla re magis Deum offendisse</hi>
                     <note place="margin">philip. 4 11</note> 
                     <hi>ille populus Judaicus dicitur, quam contra Deum murmurando,</hi> The Jews offended<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 5.</note> God in nothing more then in murmuring against him. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> learned better that is, to be content in whatsoever estate he was. And his counsel was, be content<note place="margin">psal. 66. 14. 111. 1. 40. 9. 35. 14. 57. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. 16. 40. 9.</note> with that ye have.</item>
                  <item>3. The next is Promulgation or publishing to others the benefits we receive <hi>Anun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiabo,</hi> I will declare. I will tell you (saith the Psalmist) what God hath done to my soul; and in another place he saith, he will not onely tell it in private, but publickly in the congregation, and in <hi>magna congregatione,</hi> in the great congregation: and (that being not enough) to all the people and among all nations. And yet higher, to his seed and posterity, and beyond that, to all generations to come. Which he hath done, we see it. For as Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith well, <hi>Optima beneficiorum custos est ipsa</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hom. 25. in Math.</note> 
                     <hi>memoria beneficiorum, et perpetua confessio gratiarum,</hi> The best preserver of benefits is the memory of them, and perpetual thankfulnesse for them.</item>
                  <item>4. The fourth and last is <hi>Incitatio,</hi> a stirring up or provocation of others to do the<note place="margin">psal. 95. 1. 147. 12. 148. 1</note> like. <hi>Venite,</hi> O come let us sing unto the Lord &amp;c. Saith the Psalmist. And praise the Lord O Jerusalem, praise thy God O Sion. And again praise ye the Lord, Sing unto the. Lord a new song, and his praise in the congregation of Saints. And his last Psalm is all incitation, not onely to men, but to the creatures, to perform this duty.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now as there is Deprecation, or intercession, for others so this duty of thanksgiving is to be performed not onely for our selves, but also for others; in which the first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample we have in Scripture is <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant, after he had found a wife for his masters son, Gen. 2. 27. So did <hi>Daniel</hi> for the secret revealed, Dan. 2. 20. <hi>Moses</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed a song for the deliverance out of Egypt, Exod 15. 1 <hi>Deborab</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> for the victory over <hi>Sisera,</hi> Judg. 5. and so Saint <hi>Paul</hi> usually begins his Epistles with thanksgiving for others, as Rom. 1. 8. 1 Cor. 1. 4. and 2 Cor. 1. Ephes. 1. 3.</p>
               <p>To stir us up to this duty of praise, King <hi>David</hi> hath the commendation above all other of the Patriarches for his exact performance of it, in all the parts above<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13 14.</note> mentioned and in this respect was called a man after Gods own heart, as <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Saul.</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> examining why he was so stiled rather then <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> and the rest, saith, he could finde no other reason for it but this, because (God desires that his name should be exalted and praised above all) he laboured more plenteously in this point then any other, and in that respect deserved that title better then any other. In the 55. Psalm he professeth that he will keep his hours for prayer. In<note place="margin">psal. 55. 17.</note> the Evening and morning and at noon day will I pray. But for praises in the 119<note place="margin">psal. 119. 164. 175.</note> Psalm, Thrice a day shall not serve, but seven times a day do I praise thee. Yea he would praise God at midnight, Psalm 119 62. Psal. 6. 7. and Psal 118. 17. and Psal. 39. 15. And the desire he had to have his life prolonged was, to praise God, O let me live (saith he, and wherefore) and I shall praise thee, and this the rather, because he knew that it was not onely the end of mans creation, but of Angels also<note place="margin">Luc. 2. 14.</note> whom he desired to imitate, who continualy praise God. It was &amp; is their song, Glory be to God on high: and in the Revelation, Blessing, glory, and wisdom, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,<note place="margin">Apoc. 7. 12.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">psal. 108. 1</note> and honour, and power, be unto our God for ever and ever. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it was that <hi>David</hi> accounted his tongue the best member he had and called it his glory because he employed it to the glory and praise of God: which was the end why God created both it and all the other members.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59534:94"/>
And as it was the cause why God created man, so was it also of all the creatures;<note place="margin">psal. 19. 9.</note> and they (as the Psalmist saith) perform their duty herein. The Heavens (saith he) declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy work &amp;c. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we see that he calleth upon the very worms to performe this duty; upon which Saint <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> note is, that they were in worse estate then worms that neglect it.</p>
               <p>But for the Church there it is the most natural duty that can be performed; In thy Temple every man speaketh of thy praise: what is preaching: <hi>predicare,</hi> but to<note place="margin">psal. 29. 9.</note> declare to all the world, his benefits of creation, redemption by Christ, and other benefits we have by him, in publishing whereof we praise and honour God, and therefore the conclusion of all sermons is with a Doxology, To whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp;c. be all honour &amp;c. As was usual with the Fathers. For the Sacraments, that great mystery which is the complement and perfection of all our service on earth, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a thanksgiving; for what is it but a solemne commemoration of that grand mercy and benefit of our redemption by Christs sacrifice upon the crosse, and therefore it ends with <hi>a gloria,</hi> Glory be to God on high &amp;c. and for prayer, we pray, that we may have matter of praise, yea praise for benefits received must be joyned and goe along with our prayers, els they are not acceptable, so that we in all our church exercises tend to this.</p>
               <p>The Psalmist saith of unity, that it is good and pleasant. The Fathers observe<note place="margin">psal. 133. 1.</note> from hence. the excellency of vnity; for that some things are good, but not pleasant, others pleasant, but not good, but this is both. The same may be said of praises, the Psalmist tells us, that it is both good and pleasant, and addes a third thing, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<note place="margin">psal. 147. 1.</note> some thinge may be both good and pleasant, but not comely, he therefore saith, that it is both good and pleasant, and a comely thing to praise the Lord, and to be thankfull.</p>
               <p>Besides this, lets consider, that this is a profitable and an excellent service, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is a great mover, and all excellency without this is contemned. Here is excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy<note place="margin">Act. 20. 35.</note> and honour for <hi>beatius est dare quam accipere,</hi> It is more blessed to give then to receive. Now here we give some thing to God, and there is nothing els we can give or return to him for his benefits, <hi>quid retribuam,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> I will take the cup of salvation &amp;c. that is, offer the sacrifice of praise. that's all I can return. God esteems it an addition to his honour, and therefore it is called magnifying, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and sanctifying of his name, as if we made him hereby more great and glorious and holy then he is. And as the duty is thus excellent, so it is profitable; for we never give praise and thanks, but we receive some thing: <hi>Deus vult nos gratos esse ut capaces simus majorum benificiorum,</hi> by gratitude for benefits received, we are fitted for greater benefits. Ten lepers were cleansed, and onely one returns back to give thanks, who hereby became capable of a greater mercy; Christ tells him, his faith had saved him. Our gratitude is never done <hi>gratis,</hi> but gets a reward; as there is first <hi>ascensus orationis,</hi> the ascent of prayer, and then <hi>descensus gratiae,</hi> a descending of grace.</p>
               <p>So as <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, when there is <hi>recursus gratiarum,</hi> a sending back of thanks, then there is a new <hi>decursus gratiae,</hi> a descending of benefits, and <hi>si <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> recursus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum, cessat decursus gratiae,</hi> if thanks be not returned, there will be noe more return of grace and other benefits: that grace we have received, if it stand still, and be not in <hi>recursu,</hi> in perpetual succession by returns, then like water (to which its oft compared) it stands still, and putrifies: and rots all the gifts and graces bestowed formerly. The same Father on Act. 7. makes a question, why those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and rare examples of grace and vertue, which were so common in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, are not now seen; we have the same beginnings they had, and we admire those that continue, as thy begun in grace, but they not onely continued, but increased, and went forward, and had their gifts increased, which is, as he saith, because Gods hand is not shortned, or his good will altered, but our thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings are scant and thinn sowen, and therefore our harvest must be scanty and thinn too, and therefore he saith <hi>vae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> nostrae propter ingratitudinem,</hi> wo to our age for unthankfulnesse; this is the reason why there is not the same progresse of grace in us as was in them. For as <hi>Prosper</hi> saith, <hi>Gratiae nullum certius est signum quam gratiae,</hi> there is no surer signe of grace then thanksgiving. Nay we see that we
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59534:94"/>
are tied to it, though we should be prohibited from it. it must needs be an excellent duty which must not be omitted, though forbidden by God. Our Saviour when he had healed the leper, inhibited him from telling any body what he had done unto him: yet we see he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it, and it is recorded to us for his great<note place="margin">Luc. 5. 14.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 5. 20.</note> praise, and this was a godly disobedience, for it was onely a commandment of trial, as some think.</p>
               <p>Now there are five rules to direct us that our invocation may be rightly grounded.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It must be <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> it must have life in it. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, upon that<note place="margin">Psal. 40. 15.</note> of the psalm [<hi>Cor meum dereliquit me,</hi>] <hi>nihil in mundo fugacius corde,</hi> ther's nothing more fleeting then the heart. Our extravagant thoughts come so thick upon us in our prayers, that they hinder our prayers from ascending unto God. And it is a common fault, our prayers are <hi>exanimes</hi> without life. And therefore the Psalmist begins and ends a Psalm, praise the Lord, O my soul, and praise the Lord O my<note place="margin">psal. 108. 103. 1. 42. 4. 62. 8.</note> soul, and all that is within me praise his holy name: we must not onely have a tongue but a soul to praise him. I powre out my heart by my self saith he; and so he willeth others, powre out your hearts before him. And the Apostle, I will pray with<note place="margin">1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. 14. 15.</note> the spirit and will pray with understanding also. And indeed ordinary civility should teach us thus much, to do no lesse to God, then to men, to minde that which we speak to him. But the neglect of this is much augmented by an humour of men in our age that are much delighted with long prayers in private, praying beyond the measure of their abi ities. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> speaking of the Monks of Egypt and their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,<note place="margin">Epst. <hi>ad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam.</hi>
                     </note> saith <hi>dicuntur fratres Egypto crebras orationes babere sed eas brevissimas, et raptim quodammodo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> are said to pray often, but their prayers were very short, and ejaculations &amp;c. and his reason was, <hi>ne per productiores moras evanescat atque hebotet intentio,</hi> lest by long continuance their good intentions should vanish and grow dull. These ejaculations were a remedy against dulling of our good intentions, and therefore his advise is, <hi>intentio non est obtundendae si <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> a cogitationibus meis responde pro me,</hi> Lord I suffer violence, answer thou for me. The 119. Psalm is full of these ejaculations, and every one of them is a prayer. The Lord will not take notice of those ascending thoughts, but of our prayers, if they displease us, and if in our drawing neer to God we cannot drive away those fouls from our sacrifices, yet if we have a care to prepare our hearts, short ejaculations will be effectual though we be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> speaks 2 Chron. 30. 18. 19.</item>

               <p>Now because prayer is the means to obtain all other graces, it cannot properly be said to have means to obtain it. Yet are there diverse helps to it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. There is no greater help or spur to prayer, then the consideration of our own wants, and imperfections. by taking a view of our soules, and frequent exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our own hearts, whereby we come to see the evils we are most inclinable to, and the good things wee want. This knowledge and sense of his own wants made <hi>David</hi> thirst after God, and powre out his soule before him, Psalm 42. 1. 2. 4. 5.</item>
                  <item>2. Another help is the remembrance of Gods benefits to us. King <hi>David</hi> was so well versed in this duty that there is not a benefit he received, or that we may, but that there is a Psalm for it psal. 40. 3. He had still <hi>canticum novum</hi> for <hi>beneficium novum,</hi> when he wants any singular benefit, then he reckons up the lesser, which Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> calls, <hi>colligere fragmenta,</hi> the gathering up the fragments, and these he made great account of, and as the woman of Canaan was thankful for the crums, Mat. 15. 27. so was he for the least mercies: when he had no new benefits then he takes up old benefits and makes of them a new song, as Psal. 38. and 70 and rather then faithe remembers to God and gives thanks for his wonderfull forming in his mothers womb Psal. 139. and sometimes enlargeth himself to those benefits that are common to all the world, as psal. 8. 19. 104. yea to the very wild asses quenching their thirst in the wildernes</item>

                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59534:95"/>
3. Another is fasting and alms, which the Fathers call the wings of prayer. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Jejunium orationis robur, oratio vis jejunii,</hi> fasting is the strength<note place="margin">Ep. 121.</note> of prayer, and prayer the like of fasting. And <hi>jejunia &amp; elemosynae orationem juvant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 5.</note> fasting and alms are assistants to prayer. These both are the wings that prayer mounts<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 24.</note> up by. <hi>Illud hanc corroborat, haec illud sanctificat,</hi> as fasting strengthens our prayers, and prayer sanctifies our fast, so alms.</item>
                  <item>4. If our own prayers be weak, then are we to desire the prayers of the Church, according to <hi>S. James'</hi>s direction. <hi>Si oratio tua fulmen sit</hi> (saith one) <hi>ascendat ad coelum</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 5. 15</note> 
                     <hi>sola per se:</hi> otherwise <hi>esto gutta in nube grandinis,</hi> if thy prayer be fervent, or as a thunderbolt, it may ascend to heaven by it self, but if it be as a drop in a cloud, it will need the help of others.</item>
                  <item>5. If none of all these help, yet there is <hi>oratio fidei,</hi> as well as <hi>oratio sensus,</hi> though I cannot have the prayer of feeling, yet I may have the prayer of hope. For spiritual duties are likened to seed, of which harvest comes not presently, but lie in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </list>
               <p>The signes of praying aright, or that our prayers are rightly qualified, and like to prevail, are diverse.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Earnestnesse of the soul, when that sends out sighes and groans unutterable,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>gemitibus non sermonibus, constat hoc negotium,</hi> this businesse consists not in words but groans.</item>
                  <item>2. The second signe is, if a man have a taste of Gods mercy in the remission of his sins. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> being before cast down, presently saith, Verily God hath<note place="margin">psalm 66. 19.</note> heard me, he hath attended to the voice of my prayer. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> asketh how <hi>David</hi> knew this, and answereth himself, <hi>habuit gustum aliquem divinorum,</hi> he had some taste that God had forgiven him his sins.</item>
                  <item>3. The third is, when a man continueth in a patient waiting of Gods leisure, as King <hi>David</hi> did. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </list>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The signes of true thankfulnesse likewise are diverse. The first is, when a man feeleth himself filled with marrow and fatnesse, as rapt with consideration of Gods<note place="margin">63. 6.</note> favours and benefits.</item>
                  <item>2. When a man is jealous of his own ingratitude, that after his cleansing he wallow no more in sin, and lest he make himself uncapable of Gods hearing his prayer for any more mercies.<note place="margin">66. 16.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. When <hi>beneficia</hi> become <hi>veneficia,</hi> when his benefits charm us, and make us<note place="margin">58. 5.</note> withstand strong temptations; as <hi>Joseph</hi> did: though his Mistris tempted him very<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 9.</note> strongly, yet he answered her, My Master hath done this and this for me, how can I then do this great wickednesse, and sin against God? This is a great signe, that a man is truely thankful unto God, that when God hath bestowed his benefits upon him, he is the more careful thereby not to break his law.</item>
                  <item>4. The last signe is, when we defer not our thanks. A type of this was in the law. The<note place="margin">Levit. 7. 15.</note> sacrifice of thanksgiving was to be eaten the same day, not kept longer. No procrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thanks. <hi>Nihil citius senescit gratia,</hi> nothing grows old sooner then thanks.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now concerning the sixth rule, as in the former, we are to procure this duty to be<note place="margin">Rule 6.</note> performed by others.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Saul,</hi> when he should have betaken himself to prayer, thought the enemies<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 19</note> came too fast, and not only layed away the ephod himself, but willed the Priest to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his hand; it is noted by the holy Ghost to <hi>Sauls</hi> infamy. Therefore as we are to avoid all impediments to our selves, so are we not to discourage others with them in <hi>Job.</hi> Who is the Almighty that we should serve him, and what profit should we have<note place="margin">Job 21. 15.</note> if we pray to him? One of the Fathers maketh this answer, <hi>Beneficium projicitur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grato, collocatur grato,</hi> a good turn is cast away upon an unthankful man, but bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Luke 7. 35.</note> upon a thankful person. He is kinde unto the unthankful and evil.</item>
                  <item>2. And as we must not hinder others, so for the affirmative part, the invitation, we have <hi>Davids,</hi> and it is in the beginning of our Liturgie, O come let us sing<note place="margin">psalm 95. 1. 34. 3.</note> unto the Lord.

               </argument>
               <p>THe next duty is Love. The same which the Apostle saith of the Law to have been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> for a time till the promised seed came, may be said concerning the other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and their actions that they were onely till the love of God came, of which the Fathers say, that <hi>occupare amorem,</hi> to have love in us drowneth all other affections. For we have fear first, and being delivered from that we feared, we love, and being heard in what we hope and pray for, we love God, and say with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>dilexi quia audivit, &amp;c.</hi> I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice.<note place="margin">psalm 116. 1.</note> There is a coherence between love and prayer. We have formerly said that to enjoy and have a thing, we are first to know it, and the knowledge of it breeds in us a true estimate of it, and the estimate of a thing makes us love it, so <hi>habere Deum, est scire</hi> to possesse God is to know him, and this knowledge breeds a true estimate of God, whereupon we love him; for according to our estimation our love is more or lesse to that we have.</p>
               <p>These affections of fear and hope are for this end, that when God hath bestowed on us the things we either fear to lose or hope to enjoy, we may the better esteem of them. For as <hi>cito data vilescunt,</hi> we sleight those things which are easily got, when we can but ask and have; so the things we have felt the want of so long, and for which we have been humbled, when they come, we will the better regard them, and love him the better for them.</p>
               <p>The object of love is <hi>bonum,</hi> in which the very natural reason of man hath found two properties: <hi>viz.</hi> that it is 1. Communicative. 2. Attractive.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Every good is desirous to communicate it self to as many as are willing and meet to partake of it. As we see in the Sun and other celestial bodies in the natural elements; so there is in God a quality of desiring to communicate his goodnesse: and indeed it was the cause why he created all things, to have a church, and to shew his glory and mercy on it. So that the minde of man seeing this nature in God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently hath a desire to it, and that desire goeth so far, till it come to a conjunction, and that to an union, <hi>ita conjungi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> uniantur;</hi> because by the union of two good things there will come good to the desirer, which he had not before, and whereby he is made better.</item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, it hath <hi>vim attractivam.</hi> It hath been said, that if inferiour things be coupled and united with things of more excellent nature, they are thereby made more noble. As a potsheard being covered with gold. As on the other side, things which are excellent being joyned with viler, are made more abject: as the minde of man with inferiour creatures. And there can be nothing which can make the minde more transcendent, then the conjunction of it with that which in it self is all good, and containeth all good things, and that for ever, and from hence ariseth this attractive property and force: for in every good there is that force, which allureth. And therefore to shew us this good, it is nececessary that faith and knowledge precede. <hi>Bonum non amatur</hi> (as the School-men say) <hi>quod non cognoscitur,</hi> the good that is not known, cannot be loved. For if it were known (it being the natural desire of all to be better) we should love it, to be the better by it. It is therefore well said, That good things have no greater enemy then ignorance. Knowledge and faith then (as is said) shewing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59534:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us this good, love will be stirred up in us, and then follows <hi>unio affectus</hi> the union of the affection, all that we can have here; and in the life to come, instead of this fruition by faith, fruition by cleer vision.</item>
               </list>
               <p>There are two sorts of love. 1. <hi>Amor mercenarius,</hi> a mercenary love. 2. <hi>Amor gratuitus,</hi> a free love.</p>
               <p>They are distinguished thus: when a man loves his meat and drink, and when he loves his friend or brother; it is certain these loves are not all one: in the one there is a desire to have the thing loved, that he may make use of it for his own benefit, for the present, not caring what becomes of it after; but his love to his friend, is to do him good, for himself, or for his own sake; and it includes in it <hi>bene velle, &amp; bene facere,</hi> to wish him good, and to do him good: in the former á man looks at himself, and his own good onely, in the other at his good whom he loves; the first is, <hi>amor concupiscentiae,</hi> the other <hi>amor amicitiae.</hi> The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher distinguishes them by <hi>Vnde, &amp; Quo,</hi> whence and whither. In the first love the question is made by <hi>Quo,</hi> in the other by <hi>Vnde.</hi> In the first we ask, what good comes to us by it: in the other, what good it hath in it self, though it be no benefit to us. The one hath an eye that looks inward on our selves, the other outward upon others. Yet these two though they may be distinguished, yet are not alwayes divided: for the one oft-times is the beginning of the other, both in our loves to God and man; for those that have been beneficial to us, though we love them at first for the benefits we receive by them, yet afterwards we come to love them for themselves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first ariseth from hope. Because a man being cast down by fear, conceives hope upon Gods promises, then sending forth prayer receiveth fruit, and saith,<note place="margin">psalm 28. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> before <hi>amicitia,</hi> or <hi>benevolentia,</hi> and this is the inchoation of the other. Perfect love is not attained at first; for <hi>nemo repente fit summus;</hi> now <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> wondreth how men can slip themselves out of this love: for if they will love any for his benefits, none bids fairer for this <hi>amor mercenarius</hi> then God; for he offereth for it the kingdom of heaven. The Fathers compare fear to the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, and these two degrees of love to the land of promise; this mercenary love to that part of it, which lay beyond Jordan, and the other to that part upon which Sion and Jerusalem stood. For <hi>amor gratuitus</hi> which looks not at reward, Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, that <hi>Deus nunquam sine praemio diligitur,</hi> our love to God is never unrewarded, though <hi>sine intuitu praemii diligendus est,</hi> he ought to be loved without looking at the reward. The Apostle respected his own commodity so little, that he wished himself accursed, that the glory of God might shine in the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> of Israel. It is lawful to love God for his benefits, for God uses them as motives to stir us up to love him, and the best of Gods servants have so pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised: <hi>Moses</hi> looked at the recompence. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11. but we must not rest there, nor love him onely or chiefly for them, but for himself; otherwise we love not him but our selves: <hi>ratio diligendi est Deus ipse, modus sine modo,</hi> the cause of our love must be God himself, and the measure without measure, saith <hi>S. Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some divide love into <hi>Quoniam, &amp; Tametsi,</hi> Because, and Although.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is that which is called <hi>mercenarius.</hi> I love the Lord, saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, and why? He is my defence. <hi>Psalm</hi> 18. 1. And in another place, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he heard my voice: yet seeing <hi>David</hi> did not love God onely or chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his benefits, his love was not properly mercenary, but true, though not perfect.</p>

                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59534:97"/>
To shew the excellency of love, <hi>S. Paul</hi> hath a whole chapter, wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> it above all other vertues: and saith in effect. If a man for his knowledge and elocution might be compared with Angels, and by his faith were able to remove mountains, and by his liberality had relieved the poor with all his estate, and for his constancy had suffered martyrdome, yet were all these vertues little worth, except they were joyned with the love of God. And in the end of the Chapter after<note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> this general commendation of love, he prefers it in particular above Faith and Hope.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we take the dimension of it, it is greatest both in breadth and length of all other. For whereas Faith and Hope, are restrained within the bounds of mens persons and to singulars, this dilateth it self and extendeth both to God and man in<note place="margin">Lib. confess.</note> general, to our selves, our friends, yea to our enemies. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Beatus qui amat te, &amp; amicum in te, &amp; inimicum propter te,</hi> blessed is he that loves thee, and his friend in thee, and his enemy for thee. And this is the latitude.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In longitude also. For whereas the other are but in us in the nature of a lease, but for terme of life, the gift of love shall be as a free hold, and continue for ever<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 40.</note> in heaven. Our Saviour maketh both the Law and Prophets to consist of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, namely Love. And the Apostle reduceth all to one head, and if there were any other Commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this of love. And it is our Saviours <hi>mandatum novum;</hi> admit that all the old Commandments were cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 9.</note> yet this new commandment ties us to the duties of all. And indeed <hi>S. John</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 13. 34.</note> saith, (commending this duty,) Brethren I write no new commandment unto you, but an old Commandment; for both the old and new are all one. There is both in the<note place="margin">1 John. 2. 7.</note> old and the new a <hi>Diliges,</hi> thou shalt love.</p>
               <p>But that which is beyond all these, and imposeth a necessity upon us to observe it is, that whereasnone of the other vertues are mutual or reciprocal, nor indeed are properly said to be in God at all, as faith, hope, &amp;c. this is: here is <hi>

Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Magnum est vinculum charitatis, quo &amp; ipse Deus se ligari voluit,</hi> the bond of love is great, with which even God himself was content to be bound. And <hi>S. Bernard</hi> saith of it, that <hi>solus triumphat de Deo,</hi> it onely triumphs over God; and addes, <hi>Nescis quid majus dici debeat in laudem tuam, O charitas, deduxit Deum de Coelo, hominem invexit in Coelum, hominem Deo reconciliasti, &amp; Deum homini placasti,</hi> thou knowest not, O love, what may be more said in thy praise; it brought God from heaven, and carried man thither; thou didst reconcile man to God, and pacifiedst God with man. And therefore as on the one side we are to consider how willing God is that his affection should grow in us, so are we to weigh what God on his part hath done to stir us up to it. The heathen could say, <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes amoris amor,</hi> the Loadstone of love is love; nothing is more effectual to attract love then love.

Besides this there is <hi>amor sui,</hi> self love; and this is harder to represse then the other; and it is that wherewith men are wilfully infected, and till a great measure of the spirit poslesse their hearts they will not be able to rid themselves of it. and therefore it is that <hi>Prosper</hi> saith, <hi>Amantes donantur sibi,</hi> these men that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver love themselves are given up to themselves, so that thy loosethe love of God. And this humour hath two degrees 1. when we think better of our selves then we are, and so loue our selves better then we should. 2. when we prefer our selves in our love before God. The first is a degree to the second; for when man have tasted worldly things, though base, then nothing wil have any relish with them but those and so many come to say of God with him in <hi>Plautus, Malo me ista mulier plus amet quam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. The invisible Beauty Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> tells us how to finde. It may be (saith he) that thou lovest a man because he is thy friend, may it not be also that he is an old man? And what lovest thou then in him? His head is white, his body crooked, and his face wrinkled: but thou wilt say, <hi>fidelis homo est,</hi> he is a faithful man; well, saith he, <hi>quibus oculis videtur? fidei. iisdem videtur Deus:</hi> with what eyes is that seen? of faith. Why with the same God is seen. God is seen with the eyes of faith by nothing more.

               <p n="2">2. But the name of friend is of greater propinquity. Our Saviour saith, I call you<note place="margin">John. 15. 15.</note> not servants but friends; and such a friend as (notwithstanding his glorious estate) made him not think scorn to be our friend, and in the pinch of our adversity did most of all shew his love to us. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. The name of brother is yet neerer: yet we see he vouchsafed to call us so. Go tell my brethren &amp;c. And whereas naturally<note place="margin">John 20. 17.</note> if there be many brethren, it qualifieth the affection of Parents, as <hi>Jacob</hi> loved <hi>Joseph</hi> more then all his children; here it is otherwise. Besides, brethren accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 3.</note> to the flesh are a means, that the inheritance continueth not whole. But this brother is so far from withholding any of the inheritance from us as that having two rights, he was content to part with one to entitle us with the same. 3. Besides this he is our father, Deut. 32. 6. and not as a father after the flesh, that begets<note place="margin">Luc. 12. 13</note> them harly to a benefit, it may be to a curse. 4. He is an husband, married to us. Cant. a jealous God. 5. But yet further, there is one propinquity more; he was not neer enough, when the Apostle said, It behoved him in all things to be like us; but<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 17. 16.</note> he took upon him our nature, the seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and that is to be like us indeed in all things, sinne onely excepted, which made us unlike to him; that there might be <hi>perfectus a mor, ubi perfect a similitudo,</hi> a perfect love where there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect likenes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The last motive is benefit. Set up a Crib and put provender in it, and the Oxe<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 31.</note> and the Asse will know you for it; so it is in the case of benefit between man and man: they that have more given or forgiven them are apt to love more. Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth and decreaseth according to benefits received. And this the Heathen man could confesse to be but justice, <hi>Hoc certe justitiae convenit, suam cuique reddere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificio gratiam,</hi> certainly this is consonant to justice, to render thanks for every ones benefit. Now what benefits doth God confer, that we are <hi>facti et refecti</hi> made and renewed, is from his goodnesse; our own tables will instruct us how bountiful<note place="margin">Luc. 7. 47.</note> he is in serving up the creatures for our use; so promotion; riches honour, they come not from men, but from God: <hi>Ipse est qui inclinavit corda eorum,</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever benefit we receive from men, we are accountable to God for all. If then we are to love for every benefit, then are we not tied to love him, that <hi>dedit filium,</hi> gave his Son for a price, <hi>et spiritum,</hi> and his spirit for a pledge, <hi>et servat se tantum in praemium,</hi> and reserved himself onely for a crown or reward of the love we shall afford him. If we know not his crio, let the Oxe and the Asse reach us.</p>
               <p>Now the proper signes of love are patience and obedience, which are also the proper effects of love, of which we shall speak afterwards. Others handle them more particularly, and distinguish them by six several signes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is, if the heart be well affected towards God by often thinking of him for our Saviour tells us where our treasure is (or that which we love) there wil be our hearts also. By our hearts our love will be known; and by the thoughts of our heart<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 21.</note> we may know what we love, what we think of most. We have an example of this in Saint <hi>Mark.</hi> Our Saviour taught his disciples to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees; now because their thoughts ran upon bread which they had forgotten<note place="margin">Mar 8. 14.</note>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59534:99"/>
to take into the ship, they conceived that Christ warned them from bread: for if a mans minde be set upon any thing above other, he thinketh that is meant, when ought is spoken that may be taken that way. So then it is a signe of our love to God, when we think upon him.</p>
               <p>Thoughts are of three sorts: 1. A deep thought. 2. A long thought. 3. A thought often repeated. <hi>Cogitatio profunda, continuata, crebra.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Profunda cogitatio.</hi> This deep thought was especially in those saints of God, when it was so deep, that in recounting the mercies of God, (the matter of their love) they seemed to be in an extasie.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Continuata cogitatio.</hi> As in secular matters, old age is continually thinking upon<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31.</note> wealth, youth upon pastime, and the like: so if our thoughts be continued upon God, though they be not deep, yet they are a good signe of love.</item>
                  <item>3. When a man hath neither long nor deep thoughts, yet if his thoughts be <hi>crebrae,</hi> often though they be not extaticall nor continual, but with some intermission; they signifie that the love of God hath taken root in us.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. A second signe is, if we esteem well of the pledges of that party to whom we seem to bear affection, if we account of those earnests which he hath left us, as King <hi>David;</hi> I love thy Law. When a man loves the very pledges that he leaves;<note place="margin">psalm 119. 97</note> as the Word, Sacraments, and prayer: as it is on the contrary an ill token to neglect them. It was accounted a great pledge of Gods favour to have <hi>primo-genituram;</hi> and<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Esau</hi> is called by the Apostle a profane person, or one that loved not God, for setting<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 30.</note> his love so upon his brothers pottage, to love his belly so much as to neglect the pledge of birthright and sell it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we earnestly desire the presence of him we love; for, as the Heathen said, <hi>ubi amor, ibi oculus,</hi> where the heart is, there will the eye be, and if we cannot see the party, yet if we have his picture, our eye will not be of it. Now because we walk here by faith, and not by sight, it is a sign of our love to God to desire his presence, and to behold him in his Ordinances, the Word and Sacraments, to behold his picture, as in all the creatures so especially in his servants, in whom his image is renewed. <hi>Davids</hi> delight was in those that excel'd in vertue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where there is love, we will readily forgo what is dear to us, to enjoy what we desire. Thus <hi>Esau</hi> did part with his right of primogeniture, the best thing he had, the pledge of Gods favour, for <hi>Jacobs</hi> pottage, <hi>Genesis</hi> 25. 30. so well did he love his belly. If we then can accept of any condition be it never so hard, which may set or keep us in Gods favour, it is a good signe we love him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth signe (as the former) falls into <hi>desiderium,</hi> which is a grief for Gods absence from us: for the desire of that we love not being accomplished turns to grief, and makes us break out into passion with the Prophet, When shall I come to<note place="margin">psalm 42. 2.</note> appear before the presence of God? Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, it is <hi>inauditus amor,</hi> a love unheard of, for a man to love one, and not to desire his company. So that he which desireth to live here and not to be dissolved (with the Apostle) hath<note place="margin">phil. 2. 23.</note> no love. These are signes of that part of love which is called <hi>desiderium,</hi> desire, now follow the signes of that part of love which is, <hi>gaudium,</hi> joy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is <hi>alacritas</hi> cheerfulnesse, in doing or suffering for the party we love, an especial signe of love; when a man hath gladnesse in his heart, no lesse joy for<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> encrease of spirituall things, then the worldly man hath of a good harvest.<note place="margin">psalm 4. 8.</note> When <hi>Jacob</hi> had served <hi>Laban</hi> seven yeers for <hi>Rachel,</hi> they seemed but a few dayes,<note place="margin">Gen. 29. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> for the love he had to her. If we can do thus in the service of God, it is a signe we love him. But if a man count Gods service a burden, and be weary of it, thinking one hour three which is spent in it, surely he hath no joy nor delight in God, and by consequence no love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the affection of love is truely setled; the Philosopher saith, <hi>Quod cupis habere, times perdere, cuicunque cupis conjungi, ab eo times separari,</hi> thou art afraid to lose that thou desirest to have, and art afraid to be severed from him that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest to be joyned with.</p>
               <p>Now if a mans heart bear him witnesse, that he is fearful of sin as that which may separate him from God, it is a good signe of love. On the other side,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59534:100"/>
when with <hi>Pilate</hi> we have a good minde to save Christ, but fearing the disfavour of <hi>Caesar</hi> for so doing, he did it not, it is a signe of his want of true love to Christ. <hi>Timor occupat omnes affectiones,</hi> fear runs through all the affections; <hi>Pilates</hi> fear of offendig <hi>Caesar,</hi> shewed he loved his favour before Christs; for all the affections<note place="margin">Acts 19. 27.</note> discover love. <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-smith was afraid, that the craft he loved, for the benefit he reaped by it, should be put down, he raised a sedition, and so preferred his gain before the safety of the state, thereby discovering what he loved best.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is much you would think that grief should be another signe of joy; but so it is in the case of Gods love, as fear of loosing his favour, so grief when we have lost the sense of it. If we be grieved when we perceive sensibly a defect of our former comfort and vigor of spirit in the love of God, it is a sign that we loved him. The young man in the Gospel, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 23. was grieved to part with his possessions for Christ, which shewed that he loved them before Christ, though he professed to love Christ.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The next signe is a care and anxiety to recover it when we have lost it; not to give sleep to our eyes, nor slumber to our eye-lids, nor the temples of our heads to<note place="margin">Psalm 132. 4.</note> take any rest, until we be in <hi>statu quo:</hi> so did the spouse in the <hi>Canticles;</hi> the like care is in worldly men to obtain what they love, as in <hi>Balaam, Numbers</hi> 23. who loved the wages of unrighteousnesse, though God bid him not go, and himself said, <hi>verse</hi> 19. that God is not as man that he should repent, yet he would go and try again, whether God would let him curse Israel; so careful was he to get a reward.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, when a man resolves, though all the world forsake God, yet he will<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 126, 127.</note> adhere to him, his liking is constant, goeth not with other mens. The Psalmist saith, and complaineth that men forsake Gods law, (but what followeth) Therefore I love thy commandments above gold and silver; whatsoever other men esteemed of it, yet his love was constant and firm.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If we can love him <hi>cum cruce.</hi> If our love be true, water cannot quench it. True<note place="margin">Cant. 8. 7.</note> love will abide tryal, the fire cannot consume it. It is not like false love, of which the Heathen man said, <hi>Falsus amor inde fugit, unde probatur,</hi> false love flyes from<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 4.</note> tryal. But the other will endure the losse of all. Love suffereth long, saith the Apostle, even to death. And as our Saviour saith, Greater love then this<note place="margin">John 15. 13.</note> hath no man.</p>
               <p>And now a little for the sixth rule, as in the former. As we must love God our selves, so must we also be desirous to draw others to this love; and in this there is a difference between <hi>amor mercenarius</hi> and <hi>gratuitus:</hi> for in the first a man is loth that another should love that he loveth, lest he be restrained in his liberty of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and hence proceeds jealousie; but in the other, we wish not our own good onely, but the good of him we love. In the one, <hi>quo quis vult bonum suum,</hi> whereby a man seeks his own good, the fewer that partake, the better he thinks it is; but in the other, <hi>quo quis vult bonum alterius,</hi> whereby he seeks the good of another, the more that partake, the better it is: for <hi>Deus omnibus communis, cuique totus,</hi> God, who is common to all, is wholly possessed of every one. Therefore the Prophet was<note place="margin">psalm 31. 23. 139. 21. 94. 16.</note> of this minde, and was desirous to draw all to the love of God: and on the other side, his zeal was so great, that he hated all them that hated God, and that with a perfect hatred: and in another place, who will rise with me against the wicked, or who will take my part against the evil doers? This argued the perfection of his love to God, as he would rise against them himself, so he laboured that others would joyn with him.</p>

               <head>Of Obedience.</head>
               <p>THe two principal signes and proper effects of love, are (as we said before) Obedience, and Patience.</p>
               <p>There is a saying of <hi>S. Gregory, Probatio dilectionis, exhibitio operis,</hi> we shew our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> love by its work; and it is a true signe indeed of love, when it is operative, when it worketh. For the will being enflamed with love, and having predominance over all the powers and parts of body and minde, necessary it is that wheresoever desire taketh hold in the will, it must <hi>elicere motum,</hi> produce some action. As if a man be given to love wine, his love kindleth a desire in him to have it, and desire doth <hi>elicere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> that he may work and earn so much money as will obtain it. So is it in love. Our Saviour saith, if you love me keep my commandments. And <hi>S. John</hi> saith, that<note place="margin">John 14. 15.</note> if a man obey not, he is so far from the love, that he hath not the knowledge of God,<note place="margin">1 John 2. 2. 4.</note> if <hi>S. Peter</hi> love, Christ he must feed his sheep.</p>
               <p>We must know, that where the parties are equal between whom love and mutual affection is, there love is called <hi>amicitia:</hi> but where one party is superiour, then they are not properly called friends, but this love in the inferiour is called <hi>observantia,</hi> the natural act whereof is obedience; for though a Prince will in speech or writing vouchsafe to call his inferiours, friends; yet are they but subjects. And so though<note place="margin">John 15. 15.</note> our Saviour was pleased to stile his Disciples and Apostles friends, yea and by neerest<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 49.</note> names of consanguinity, brethren, &amp;c. yet <hi>S.

                  <note place="margin">2 pet. 1. 1.</note> not upon these titles, but acknowledged this <hi>observantia,</hi> and in the beginning of<note place="margin">Jude 1.</note> their epistles and writings stiled themselves servants of Jesus Christ. And <hi>S. Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 1. 1.</note> shewing that this is infallible, saith, Know ye not to whom ye yield your selves ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> to obey, his servants ye are whom ye obey?</p>
               <p>In the first petition of the Lords prayer we desire that Gods name may be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. God being a King and bearing rule over us, how can this kingdome and rule be established better then by fulfulfilling his commands, and obeying him as the Angels do in heaven? For in regard of the glory which God hath by our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Gods name is hallowed or glorified. And therefore from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Paradise God commanded obedience to <hi>Adam</hi> in that estate, that he<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> should not eat of the tree of knowledge; that in obedience to that precept his glory might be shewed.</p>
               <p>Now by our obedience we bring glory to God two wayes. 1. Directly by our selves, as <hi>Psalm</hi> 50. 15. Call upon me in the time of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorifie me. 2. When we give occasion to stir up others to glorifie him; therefore God is not content with the former, but saith further, Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven. <hi>Matthew</hi> 5. 16. Thus God is glorified by our saith, whereupon follows our first justification before God, but then there must be a second justification also, <hi>viz.</hi> before men and the world, by our good works, whereby God is glorified by others; and so God will have glory of us, both imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by our selves, and mediately by others. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing makes men good or evil, but good or evill love, and that <hi>Amor male in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slammans, &amp; timor male humilians,</hi> that love which inflames, but not aright; and that fear which humbles but not aright, are the causes of all evill in the world. And our love is never true, but <hi>inter similes,</hi> among men of like
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59534:101"/>
conditions: therefore there must be between God and us recipocally, <hi>idem velle, &amp; idem nolle,</hi> to will and nill the same. And this is true obedience, when our will is moved by his, and when we yield to his will, as the principal mover; for where there are two wills the inferiour must be proportioned to the superiour, or both to a third: now there is no reason that Gods will should be proportioned to ours, or to any others (he having none above him) and a straight line must not be subjected to a crooked piece of timber; now our wills are crooked, but Gods is straight.</p>
               <p>Now the excellency and necessity of obedience is seen by this. That whereas God had ordained sacrifice as an especial part of religion, yet he prefers obedience before it. To obey is better then sacrifice, saith <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> and that in these respects.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 22</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He that desires to offer an acceptable thing, must offer that which is his own rather then anothers, because it is dearer to him. And in obedience we offer <hi>propriam voluntatem,</hi> our own will, and in sacrifice <hi>carnem alienam,</hi> the flesh of beasts, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, the better the thing is which is offered, the better it is accepted; but that which is offered in obedience, is better then that in sacrifice, because in the first a living thing is offered, and the beast cannot be offered till it be dead; besides in sacrifice it is but a brute beast which is offered, but in obedience a reasonable soul, and therefore<note place="margin">1 pet. 2. 1. 2.</note> the more acceptable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The more we offer the more acceptable is the offering, and nothing can be added to the offering of obedience. In sacrifice part of our fruit is offered, but by obedience we offer both fruit and tree and all, we give our selves. One well saith, <hi>Obedientia non potest plus dare quam dedit: dedit enim se,</hi> obedience can give no more then it hath given, for it hath given a mans self.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, the longer of continuance that which is offered is, the better it is; but a sacrifice is but an hours work, while the fire is kindled, and the beast consumed to ashes; now when by obedience we offer our selves unto God, it is a continual sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a perpetual mortifying of our will, our reason, and all our members. <hi>Obedientia est juge sacrificium,</hi> obedience is a continuall sacrifice. Therefore it is plain, that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is better then sacrifice, not that sacrifice should be neglected or contemned, for contemned it is not when a better is preferred. God saith to the Prophet, I spake not to your Fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of Egypt concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices. But this thing I commanded them, saying, Obey my voice. That is, I denied not the one, but preferred the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Jer. 7. 22, 23.</note> it was better.</p>
               <p>The excellency of obedience appeareth further in this: that whereas things in themselves may be neither good nor bad, yet obedience hath power to make evil good, and good evil, either by observation or contempt. For had not God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Adam</hi> to eat the fruit, the eating of it in it self had been neither good nor bad: but we see his disobedience made it evil. Another example we have in Scripture. A Prophet comes to his neighbour in the word of the Lord, and said, Smite me, and<note place="margin">1 Kin. 20. 35, 36.</note> the man refused to smite him, knowing it was unlawsul. Then said the Prophet to him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the Lord, Behold, assoon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee; and assoon as he was departed from him, a lion found him and slew him for his disobedience.</p>
               <p>The great necessity of obedience is in the example of our Saviour, in his dilemma, O my Father, if it be possible [let me not obey] but let this cup passe from me, [if it<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 39.</note> be not possible] neverthelesse, not as I will, but as thou wilt. And one of these must needs be done, either <hi>mori,</hi> or <hi>non obedire,</hi> to die or not to obey, and <hi>elegit potius mori quam non obedire,</hi> he chose rather to die then not to obey, whereby he intimated, that obedience is more necessarie then life it self: and this his obedience recovered the world from eternal destruction, as the obedience of the saints preserves it from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; for it is the small number of obedient persons that are <hi>columne mundi,</hi> the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the world, which otherwise would not stand.</p>
               <p>And here then by the second rule, obedience is commanded in general, not as it is the execution of every particular command, but as it respects the intent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander: all the commandments are the <hi>materiale,</hi> or matter of our obedience, but <hi>intuitus voluntatis divinae,</hi> the looking up to Gods will as the motive, is the <hi>formale,</hi> or form of this vertue, which distinguishes it from other vertues and duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59534:101"/>
when a man hath an earnest endeavour and will to satisfie and fulfil whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is prescribed. And it is 1. unperfect <hi>inchoata:</hi> or 2. perfect, <hi>perfecta.</hi> The first ariseth from fear of punishment onely, as in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 15. 24. the other from filial fear, as in <hi>Abrahams, Genesis</hi> 22. 12.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Obedience is a compound of <hi>ob,</hi> and <hi>audio,</hi> and imports to hear and obey, and that before all others; and in <hi>compositis et copulativis oportet vtrumque fiere, non suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit alterum,</hi> in compounds one will not serve, we must have both. We will take the simple first, <hi>audire,</hi> to heare, and then the compound, <hi>obaudire.</hi> First, <hi>audire</hi> for <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire</hi> and <hi>sequi</hi> to heare and follow, are Gods words for obedience. The Fathers in the Greek Church call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Latines <hi>obaudire,</hi> both imply hearing and following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For hearing it is good reason to heare God, if it be but in this respect onely, <hi>Quia nos audit,</hi> because he heares us, when we cry <hi>de prosundis;</hi> but there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason, and that is, because we can have no better guide to follow or counsellor to heare. It is safe to follow <hi>Lot</hi> out of Sodom, and <hi>Noah</hi> into the Ark. If we follow not them that can can lead and direct us we shall be punished with false guides and counsellors; there was never any heretick but had some followers. <hi>Qui xoluns regi a pastore incidunt in lupos.</hi> They that will not follow the shepherd to the pasture, either are a prey to the wolfe, or shall be led by the butcher to the shambles.</p>
               <p>Many are loth to heare, because they would not follow, they will devise and invent new wayes, and be leaders themselves, that they may be heard and followed; but <hi>malus assecla ratio pejor voluntas,</hi> our own reason is an ill lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey, our will a worse; our reason is blinde, and our will a tyrant, before it be subdued by grace; therefore we must be content to be led, and to receive rules from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as we must heare with the eare, so with the heart too. <hi>Auditus est sensus disciplinae:</hi> we are perhaps content to heare, but that is not all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Quod cor non facit, non fit.</hi> The eares without the heart are but like Idoll ears, that heare nothing, <hi>aures aequivocae.</hi> There is <hi>praeputium,</hi> and this foreskin must be taken away, else we have but uncircumcised eares, Jer. 6. 10.</p>
               <p>We use to say, that such an one will not heare good counsel, that is, will not follow it: for though he will not stop his eares, yet if his heart be not bent to follow it, his hearing is to no purpose; for as the heathen man said, <hi>mens videt non oculus,</hi> it is not the eye, but the minde that seeth; so its not the eare, but the heart that heareth. To shew the truth of this, lest men should think obedience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists onely in hearing, God used to put an <hi>et,</hi> a copulative after it, as <hi>audiant, et custolient, et ambulent, et faciant &amp;c.</hi> they shall heare and keep, hear and walk, hear and do &amp;c. There is an apt similitude of a fishhook, <hi>cum capit ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur, et tum capitur, cum attrahitur,</hi> when it taketh, it is taken, and it is taken, when it is drawn to us; and it is a signe that our hearing stick to us, when we hear to obey.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As we must <hi>audire,</hi> so also <hi>obandire,</hi> heare and follow him before and against all others, this is implyed in the preposition [ob.] As there is a saying, <hi>loqui,</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loqui</hi> a gainsaying; so there is an hearing, and a hearing against, <hi>audire</hi> and <hi>obedire.</hi> There is never a hearing of God, but even when he speaketh there will be an <hi>obloquu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> one that speaks against what he speaks.</p>
               <list>
                  <head>There are three speakers</head>
                  <item>Deus.</item>
                  <item>Homo.</item>
                  <item>Mundus.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Deus.</hi> God is a speaker, by his word, and his works. 1. By his word. O that God would speak, saith <hi>Zophar</hi> to <hi>Job.</hi> And speak Lord, for thy servant hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, saith <hi>Samuel.</hi> Hear O my people (saith God himself) and I will speak. They<note place="margin">Job. 11. 5.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 9.</note> that will not heare him (to obey) when he speaketh in mercy, shall heare him<note place="margin">psal. 50. 7. 2. 5.</note> speak in his wrath. And he continually speaks to us now by the Church and her pastors, as he did in former ages by his Prophets and Apostles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By his works every man may see and behold them; And therefore <hi>Elihu</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job. 36. 24. 37. 14.</note> bids <hi>Job</hi> stand still, and consider the wonderous works of God. Theres none of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59534:102"/>
them but are as so many speakers to us. The Heavens declare the glory of God,<note place="margin">psal. 19. 1. 2. 3.</note> and the firmament sheweth his handy work. One day telleth another, and one night certifieth another. There is neither speech nor language but their voices are heard among them. No nation but may understand that God speaks to them by these works.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other two speakers which gainsay what God speaks, are the world, and our selves; here we must <hi>obaudire</hi> to what God sayes, contrary to what the world sayes to us, and to what we speak to our selves. 1. For the world it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">John 15. 18.</note> Christ, and so it is like to speak no good of him, or his wayes: now as<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, so must wee; for God and the world cannot walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Can two go together, saith the Prophet, unlesse they be agreed? The world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin">Amos 3. 3.</note> walk with Christ, because it hateth him: <hi>Enoch</hi> therefore forsook the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the world, and chose to walk with God alone, and so was translated, so must we, whatsoever evil counsel we heare, whether from prophane men, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if they be gain-sayers, if they do <hi>obloqui,</hi> we must <hi>obaudire,</hi> heare God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. The King had a <hi>Michaiah</hi> to speak the truth to him from God, so had<note place="margin">1 King 22. 12.</note> he a <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who spake against it: so when we preach the truth, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which preach <hi>placentia,</hi> that will tell men <hi>id quod volunt sanctum est,</hi> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they like is the best, that will loose, let others binde as fast as they can; these we must take heed of hearkening to, we must not frame ourselves to the world,<note place="margin">Jer. 44. 17.</note> whether to the old world, as they that would burne incense to the Queen of heaven, because they and their fathers had done so before; or to this present world, as the people who would needs have a king, before Gods time, because they would be<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 20.</note> like other nations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other speaker, that doth <hi>obloqui,</hi> speak against what God sayes, is our selves, for we are at as great odds with God as the world is. The wisdom of<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> the flesh is enmity with God; there is in us a desire to follow our own spirit and,<note place="margin">Ezech. 13. 3</note> as the wise man saith, every way of a man is right in his own eyes: and this way<note place="margin">prov. 21. 2.</note> we are not to follow, but God speaks cleane contrary to this, <hi>Revertatur quis que a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 18. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>via sua;</hi> return ye every man from his own way, for thats a wrong way: we have<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> Gods own testimony, that mans thoughts are naught, and exceeding naught, and therefore we are like to finde little good by this <hi>oblocutor.</hi> These thoughts and lusts do <hi>militari</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> war against the soul; and above all, it is a great punishment from<note place="margin">1 pet. 2. 11.</note> God to give men up to follow their own lusts. The Isralites lusted for quailes which God gave them, but withal his wrath fell upon them, and when they refused to heare<note place="margin">psal. 78. 9.</note> his voice, in his anger he gave them up to their own desires. This is the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">psal. 81. 12.</note> for the greatest offenders. The Heathen Idolaters were punisht by being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to follow their own lusts. It is a great punishment to be delivered over to Sathan, yet this may be for ones good, that the soul may be saved, as 1 Cor. 5. 5.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24</note> but to be deli ered up to the desires of our own hearts is far greater, 2 Cor. 2. 8. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> when God appointed him an office very plausible and desireable by men, to be a Magistrate, he being suspicious of himself, left his heart, which did not <hi>obloqui,</hi> should beguile him, denied it fower times. and would not take it upon him, till God was very angry; for true obedience hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>de suo,</hi> of its own, but <hi>totum de alieno,</hi> all from another, it is a continual gainsayer of it self.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some will joyn these two together; they will heare God and then call a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and heare what flesh and blood can say, and they will sit judges between both. This was not Saint <hi>Paules</hi> practise, when God called him to preach, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> not with flesh and blood. Our affections are like lyme, hottest when they should be coldest, as in water, and <hi>e contra,</hi> we are suspicious and wary, when we come to hear God, though we ought to be then most secure, as if he were <hi>persona mala fidei,</hi> one not to be trusted; we fear most, when we need not fear, we are afraid in hearing the minister of God, and marvellous carefull in examining all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, when they exhort to any thing that agrees not with our worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, lest haply we should be seduced: but in hearing the world, and our own hearts, where most peril is, we are most secure and carelesse. Hence it is that we yeeld partial obedience to God, onely in what we like, or in what crosses not our carnal
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59534:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ends and desires, which <hi>Bernard</hi> calls <hi>deliratam obedientiam,</hi> a nice obedience. To sit an hour and heare a sermon, and receive the sacrament, and such outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, we see no harm in them, but in those things which the world or our own hearts do <hi>obloqui</hi> speak against, we are ready to yeeld and hearken to them, and to say with <hi>Cushai,</hi> though he had been <hi>David</hi> servant and subject before, yet now whomsoever this people shall choose, his will I be, and him will I serve; we will hearken to God for a time, but so as we will follow the world and our desires, when they contradict what God requires; this we must specially take heed of, we must so obey God, as to gainsay his gainsayers; our obedience must be sincere without mixture, we cannot serve God and Mammon.</p>
               <p>The last thing commanded is the measure and quality of this obedience. It must be ready and willing, a, Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, though <hi>contra voluntatem,</hi> yet <hi>ex vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate,</hi> cheerefully. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commends the Romanes, that they obeyed from<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17.</note> the heart: and therefore Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Obedientia non servili metu sed chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mor. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>affecta servanda est non timore poenae, sed amore dei,</hi> obedience is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not with servile feare, but the affection of love, not for feare of punishment, but for the love of God: for there is <hi>Obedientia coacta,</hi> a constrained obedience.<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 33. &amp;c.</note> The people were content to be obedient, yet grumbled at the Burden of the Lord. But what saith God? For this obedience he would forsake them, he would punish them, and the Burden of the Lord should be no more in their mouthes: for <hi>Amor erubescit nomine difficultatis,</hi> love blushes at the name of difficulty. And Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith in Gods case, <hi>non attendit verus obediens quale sit quod praecipieur</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Praecepto et Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</note> 
                  <hi>hoe solo contentus quia praecipitur,</hi> A true obedient man regards not what kinde of thing is commanded, being content with this onely, that it is commanded. The disciples upon Christs preaching upon the Sacrament said, <hi>Durus est hic sermo,</hi> this<note place="margin">John. 6. 60.</note> is a hard saying. There is an obedience in the Devils, they came out of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,<note place="margin">Math. 8. 29.</note> but with great reluctancy and grudging. So they that obey not cheerefully, shew what that kinde of obedience is like. That which is <hi>durus sermo</hi> to others, and a burden, the Psalmist counted sweeter then the honey combe, Psalm 119. Now Gods ayme and scope in this point is, that we performe our obedience to his commands, though they be hard, it must not be like that of <hi>Sauls,</hi> we must not spare it in the great, and performe it in the least; if we do, our sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 21.</note> will not be accepted: for he spared the best and fattest of the cattell, and offered the worst in sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The thing forbidden, as opposite to obedience, is disobedience; the nature of which sinne we may conceive, if we consider what it is compared to, and behold it in the effects which it produces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is compared to the sinne of witchcraft, or the sinne of divination, as it is in the Hebrew; and to the abomination of the Teraphim, as it is in the Hebrew; or iniquity and idolatrie, as we read it. 1. To witchcraft or the sinne of divination, because as men forsake God, when they seek to witches and diviners, so men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce God by disobedience, and hearken to Sathans instruments, the world, and their own corrupt hearts: and likewise as witches do not alwayes give true and certain answers, but often deceive those that trust to them; so disobedience to God deceives men in their hopes of worldly things, which they think to gain by not hearkening to God, as in this example of <hi>Saul,</hi> he disobeyed God out of feare of the people, lest they should have deprived him of his kingdom, which he thought to establish by pleasing the people, when as his disobedience like a witch deceived him, for thereby he lost his kingdom: because thou hast cast away the word of the Lord, therefore the Lord hath cast off thee from being king, saith <hi>Samuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To the abomination of the Teraphim, which were images or idols, like the <hi>dii Penates,</hi> the houshold Gods of the Romans. These they set up in the secret<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 30.</note> corners of their houses, and worshipped in private, though in the temple they pretended to worship none but God; so men prosesse Obedience to God in the Church in the sight of men, but in their domestick and worldly affaires, they obey mammon, and follow their own hearts, disobeying God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider it in the effects, which are all the curses of God denounced against the disobedient. His curse whose <hi>maledicere</hi> is <hi>malefacere,</hi> as his <hi>benedicere</hi> is <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facere</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:59534:103"/>
(for his curse and his blessing are effectuall and operative) is due especially to the sinne of disobedience: for it is a thing most reprochful to God, for any to account his commandments hard and unjust, as all disobedient persons do, as the<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 24.</note> evil servant, that said of his Master. I knew thou wast a hard man, reaping where thou sowest not. A signe of Gods curse is the Rainbow, which not onely minds us of the covenant, but also of the general deluge, whereby God punished the disobedience<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> of the old world; but especially death, that passeth upon all, is properly ascribed by the Apostle to this sinne of disobedience. And as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> observes our daily experience tells us as much, for <hi>Quotidie experimur, quotidie enim morimur,</hi> we finde it true every day, because we die daily. Besides, as God observes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in his punishments, so here in this sinne; by that wherein we sinne, by that<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20. 7. 23.</note> we are punished: for as we withdraw our obedience from God so the creatures withdraw their obedience from us; neither are we punished onely by disobedience without us for this sinne, but also by disobedience with in us: the two Laws of the members, and of the minde, are opposite, our affections will not be subject to reason, because we disobey our Creator. Thus we see the nature of disobedience in general.</p>
               <p>Now for the kinds in particular, we know, that disobedience is compared to a<note place="margin">psal. 119. 32.</note> path in which we are to walk, not turning to the right hand, or to the left, so that<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 32.</note> there is a right hand way, and a way to the left hand. The heart of a wiseman is<note place="margin">Eccles. 10. 2.</note> on his right hand, but the heart of a fool is on his left hand. From which places the Fathers make two kindes of disobedience, by turning to the right hand and to the left, which they expound thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>Probabilis inobedientia,</hi> a disobedience not without some probable pretence, as was <hi>Sauls</hi> sinne at Gilgal, his answer seemed reasonable, but that we must not make our own reason but Gods revealed will the rule of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>This is turning to the right, and to this kinde belong those opposites, of which we spoke, when we hearken to the voice of our own hearts, or of the world, or would mix them and joyne them with God, All these lead <hi>ad dextram</hi> to the right hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a lest hand way, whereto they turn, that have no probability of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or colour for their sinne, such as the Apostle calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, wicked and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 2.</note> and unreasonable men, whose course of life is without any excuse, who sinne willfully and presumptuously against the cleare will of God, and dictate of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. And as disobedience is here forbidden, so when men obey, but not readily, not without murmurings and disputings. Murmuring was alwayes the fault of the<note place="margin">phil. 2. 14.</note> Israelits, they would make dialogues with God and and ask the reason of every thing why this rather then that, and why now rather then at another time; such men <hi>Luther</hi> calls the sect of the <hi>Queristae,</hi> they will go with a why in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This also must be avoyded; to which we may adde the fault of those that excuse their disobedience, Luc. 14. 18. The Angels yeeld no reasons why they should not<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 5.</note> obey, do not murmur, or excuse but obey readily.</p>
               <p>Now for the degrees of Disobedience.</p>
               <p>Disobedience hath two degrees. 1. Neglect. 2 Contempt.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Neglect is defined to be <hi>animae torpor, quo quis minus diligens est in exequendo</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hugo</note> 
                     <hi>quod exequi debet,</hi> a dulnes of the minde, which makes a man lesse diligent in doing that he should; and this was the fault of him that came without his wedding garment.<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 12.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Contempt is the extremity of disobedience. And this God threatens with a severe punishment. If you shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Levit. 26. 15. 16.</note> &amp;c. I will appoint over you terrour, consumption, &amp;c. and I will set my face against you, saith God. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith of both these, <hi>Neglectus ubique culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis, contemptus ubique damnabilis,</hi> neglect is blameable, but contempt damnable.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The means to compasse this vertue, or rather the motives to stir us up to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are diverse.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is, the obedience that hath been exhibited to God from time to time<note place="margin">Gen. 39.</note> by his Saints. As <hi>Moses</hi> had fair proffers and liklyhoods of preferment, yet rather chose to suffer affliction, then to disobey God. <hi>Joseph</hi> in the eye of the world might
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59534:103"/>
be thought to have risen to great preferment by obeying his Mistris voice, but you see what rocks he was willing to cast himself upon, rather then to disobey his God,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 51.</note> or hearken to the <hi>oblocutor.</hi> Our Saviour though he were the Son of God, yet was subject to his parents, and not onely so, but became obedient to God even to death.<note place="margin">Phll. 2. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Bernard</hi> asks the question, Who were they that the Son of God should be subject to them? <hi>Faber &amp; foemina,</hi> a Carpenter and a woman; and he though God, or rather as Christ, God and man, was subject. I hough he were the Son of God, yet he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience by his sufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8. and indeed by the obedience of the crosse, he recovered the world. And if any shall except and say, they cannot imitate the Son of God or the Saints, let him consider in the next place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The example of al the creatures, in whom there would be no disorder, were it<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 27.</note> not for man. The windes and sea obeyed Christ: the sun standing still at the prayer of<note place="margin">Josh. 10. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Joshua:</hi> the fire not consuming the three children: and the lyons not devouring <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> all go against their natures, to yeeld obedience to God. So that they are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>audientes,</hi> attentive, but <hi>obedientes verbo divino,</hi> obedient to Gods word: which is true and perfect obedience, to obey even contrary to our own nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Another motive, is if we consider how obedient our nature is to the contraries of what God commands, and follow that: natural reason saith, where there is one duty there are two extreams at the least. And therefore the obedience we shew to sin is <hi>multiplicior</hi> then that we exhibit to God. It is truely said of the Heathen, that <hi>negligentia plus laborat quam diligentia,</hi> idlenesse is more toilsome then imployment. And so we may say of the adulterer, he laboureth more then the chast, and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous more then the contented man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, the reward may be a means to stirr us up to obedience. We know nothing is more prevalent then it. Its true there is such equity in Gods commands, that we should obey them without reward; yet there is such reward annexed to our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that if there were lesse equity and more difficulty in them, yet they ought to<note place="margin">Cass.</note> be kept in regard of the reward. One saith, <hi>nutriunt praemiorum exempla virtutes,</hi> examples of rewards cherish vertue. If a thing commanded were not equal, yet we stick not at that, so a reward be proposed. And we see that <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience had a great reward; I am, saith God, thy exceeding great reward: <hi>Merces magna nimis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 1.</note> as some Fathers say; so great is the reward of obedience, that one of the Fathers saith, that the Saints seeing how great it is repent, that they had performed no greater obedience on earth, and wish themselves on earth again, that they might perform more exact obedience.</p>
               <p>The signes of well hearing and obeying are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>audire.</hi> The joy we have in profiting, and the grief of not benefitting at our hearing; as also our care to resort where we should hear, and to apply what we hear to our selves in particular, are signes of our good or ill disposition to this duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>obedire.</hi> If we not onely obey that part of Gods law, to the observance whereof 1. we are tyed by the Princes law, but those also which the Princes law takes no hold of, though we observe them not: where there is onely <hi>vis directiva,</hi> not <hi>correctiva,</hi> a directive, but no coercive power: or when Gods laws and mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur not, if we obey as well as when they concur, then is our obedience free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary out of conscience, not by constraint. This is a good signe of obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And secondly, when Gods commands and the desires of our own nature stand in competition, as when God commands <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his son, and nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade him. As also in the world, when it and the fashion take one side, and Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments another. If in these cases God have the victory, and the world and the flesh go down, it is another good signe, that we are in a true way of obedience. The tryal is best found upon the parting, as when two walk together, you cannot know whose the spaniel is till they part, but when they part, we know who was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and whom he followed before they parted.</p>
               <p>The sixth rule for procuring obedience in others is, done <hi>per edificationem,</hi> as the<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 19. 13.</note> Apostle speaks, by edifying one another, and by avoyding that which they call <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum,</hi> let no man put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall in his brothers way.</p>

                  <p>Of patience. How it arises from Love of God. The necessity and excellency of patience. Afflictions are either corrections, or tryals. Reasons of patience in both. Of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit patience in Hereticks and others. Stupidity no true patience. Cause thereof. Of fainting under the crosse. Means of patience. Signes of patience. Of working patience in others.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe second principal signe or property of Love is Patience, and it might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under obedience; for they use to call it, <hi>obedientiam crucis.</hi> It is a fruit<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 4.</note> of Love, <hi>charitas patiens est,</hi> saith the Apostle: for if it be active, it produces obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, if passive patience. The Heathen man hath a strange speech to this purpose: <hi>Non amo quenquam, nisi offendat,</hi> I love no man, but he that offends me; the reason is, because bearing and sorbearing is an argument of love, he that loveth will bear much, if not, he loveth not. <hi>Qui desinit sustinere desinit amare,</hi> saith <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> leave of to forbear, and leave of to love: and <hi>S. Gregory, Patientia vera ipsum amat, quem portat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In <hi>Ezek hom.</hi> 7</note> true patience loves him who is a burden to him.</p>
               <p>In respect of our selves being natural, nothing can be trulier said, then <hi>durum pati,</hi> It goeth against flesh and blood to suffer; and the object of patience is evil. But the spiritual man glories in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and why? because patience worketh experience, and that hope. So that patience never<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 3, 4, 5.</note> bears evil <hi>propter se, sed propter mag is bonum,</hi> for it self, but for a greater good. The evil we suffer by it will be recompensed with the greater good. Labour is <hi>durum,</hi> a hard thing, and ease good, but if a better thing (as learning) may be attained by the privation of that good, we will take pains and endure labour. So the suffering of want, trouble, and the like, conducing to a greater good, puts a will into us to endure them. <hi>Ardor desideriorum,</hi> saith <hi>S. Gregory, facit tolerantiam laborum,</hi> the earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our desires causeth us to endure labor. This greater good is the glory of God; and that as we said of obedience, both directly by our selves, when we glorifie him, by our sufferings, and also by others, who take occasion by our patience in suffering to glorify God. Though the Devil afflicted <hi>Job</hi> with sundry crosses, yet he continued firm and endured them patiently, and by his servants patience was God glorified even over the Devil: God triumphs over the Devil by the patience of <hi>Job.</hi>

                  </gap> thou not, saith<note place="margin">Job 2.</note> God, my servant <hi>Job,</hi> that there is none like him in the earth, &amp;c. <hi>Beatus Job quot voces patientiae in laudem Dei percussus reddidit, quasi tot in adversarii pectore jacula intorsit, et acriora multa quam sustinuit, inflixit,</hi> blessed <hi>Job</hi> by his often expressions of patience to the honour of God in his afflictions, castas it were so many darts into the bosome of his adversary, and inflicted much more upon him, then he endured himself.</p>
               <p>The Author to the Hebrews tells us, that we need this vertue, and our Saviour<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 36.</note> gives us the reason. We cannot possesse our souls without it. How? Thus; if any crosse befall us, either it is too great for us to bear, and so we fall into exceeding great world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow, which worketh death, as it hapned with <hi>Achitophel,</hi> a wise man: or else<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> without this gift of patience we set our selves against that partie in passion, that we<note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 23.</note> conceive did offer us the injury, and so fall to hatred, and then to injurious dealing, or if it be from Gods hand, to murmuring and impatient reoining, and so loose your souls. But if with patience we bear the afflictions of this life, and thereby overcome the last enemy which is death, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 15. 26. then we are sure to save our souls. In consideration whereof, as we said, that in the Christian structure faith was <hi>fundamentum</hi> the foundation of all vertues, so patience is <hi>tectum</hi> the roof or covering of all vertues to keep and defend them from the storms of afflictions; without which storms would beat, and rain would descend into the building and rot it.</p>
               <p>And this may well be warranted by that of our Saviour in the Gospel, where he saith (describing the spirituall harvest) that they brought forth fruit with<note place="margin">Luke 8 15.</note> patience. The fruit is after the bud and blossome, the fruit must come through both. But more plainly in the Apostle; that therefore patience must have her<note place="margin">Jac. 1. 4.</note> perfect work, that we may be perfect and want nothing, and the building
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59534:104"/>
be consummate. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> joyns faith the foundation, and patience the roof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.<note place="margin">phil. 1. 29.</note> To you it is given not onely to believe, but also to suffer; and in another<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 12.</note> place, <hi>in side &amp; patientia,</hi> by faith and patience we inherit the promise, the first and last, the beginning and the ending. So that when we have this vertue, and the roof be covered, we may have good cause to rejoyce, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> did. He rejoyced in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 10.</note> in suffering infirmities, reproaches, necessities, persecutions, distresses, for Christs sake. And patience working experience, he then had <hi>spem solidiorem</hi> more<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 4.</note> solid hope, and thence grew so valiant, as to throw down gantlet, and chalenge any<note place="margin">8. 35.</note> thing that could separate him from the love of God, and beginneth with the least<note place="margin">38.</note> first, as tribulations, ascending to the most potent, as death, Angels, principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Patience is distinguished according to the object, which is affliction, and that is of two sorts: for it is either for punishment, called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or for tryal called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; there must be patience in both: and the reason is, for that in every Law there is a directive and a corrective force, if one misse, the other will take hold. <hi>Aut faciendum quod oportet, aut patiendum quod oportet,</hi> either we must do, or suffer what we should; we must be either active or passive.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We submit our selves to the corrective force in respect of our deserts, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">1. pet. 4. 19.</note> the Law to be just, for two reasons, both which are mentioned by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> It is the will of God; of his secret will we cannot enquire the cause, but when he hath revealed the reasons, we may be bold to take notice of them for confirmation of our faith. 1. The first is, He will have all the world know, that sin shall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished. This is plain. The waters of Meribah cost <hi>Moses</hi> his life, his wavering, because the waters came not at the first, was his forfeiture of entring into the land of promise, <hi>Numbers</hi> 20. 12. Many more instances might be brought, but they are all obscured by Christs punishment for our sins, which may inform us how highly sin displeases God. And although the main punishment fell on the Son of God, and this <hi>Passio Christi,</hi> this suffering of Christ was the greatest signe of the love of God to us, yet he loves us not so as to exempt us from all punishment, there must be a visitation for his Church. It is a great part of that league and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made long since, that though his mercy shall not be withdrawn from us, yet if we forsake his Law, he will visit our trespasses with the rod, &amp;c. this is a signe of his love too, as well as his punishing the Son for us; therefore we must still be subject to his fatherly correction, though his children and servants. Judgement must begin at the house of God, saith <hi>S. Peter.</hi> But he will punish the<note place="margin">1. pet. 4. 17.</note> wicked more grievously; for as our Saviour speaks, If this be done in me that<note place="margin">Luke 23. 31.</note> am a green tree, what shall become of the dry? If I bring evil upon mine own<note place="margin">Jer. 25. 29.</note> city, where my Name is called upon, (saith God) shall you go unpunished? And<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> it is certain, that the Lord chasteneth and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth, and as many as he loveth he rebuketh and chasteneth. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Si huc non tibi magis malum videtur exhaeredari, quam non castigari, hoc elige,</hi> If to be disinherited seem not to thee to be a greater evil then not to be chastised, choose that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the first was a reason of the declaration of Gods justice, so this second is<note place="margin">Esay 28. 19.</note> for our own benefit. <hi>Vexatio dat intellectum,</hi> trouble brings understanding. It was good for <hi>David</hi> that he had been afflicted, many men cannot be without it. <hi>S. Aug.</hi> saith, that when he followed this world by pleasures with a full stream, a pain in his<note place="margin">psal. 119. 71.</note> breast, <hi>pectoris dolor,</hi> was the first means of his recalling. <hi>S. Pauls</hi> unhorsing and<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> smiting blinde was his initiation to God. <hi>Sepiam vias tuas,</hi> saith God, I will hedge<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 6.</note> up thy wayes with thorns; If thou wilt go out of the way the thorns shall prick thee, and keep thee in. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> reporteth of <hi>S. Basil,</hi> that being subject to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and sicknesse, he petitioned God for recovery of his health, and when he had obtained it, he remembred that he had left out a condition, that lest he should grow proud, God would by afflictions put him in minde by sicknesse again, which he did as the same Father reports. Thus in these two respects its necessary we bear cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection with patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The tryal is of two sorts. 1. There is either, <hi>Delatio boni</hi> a defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of good, touched before in hope, which ever hath <hi>rationem mali,</hi> a shew of evill. Hope deferred maketh the heart sicke; the bearing of it is called,<note place="margin">prov. 13. 12.</note>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, longanimity; though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, saith the Prophet. Wait patiently for the Lord will come, saith the Psalmist. This is the<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 3.</note> onely patience which is in God, who waits <hi>ut misereatur nostri,</hi> that he may have<note place="margin">Psalm 37. 7.</note> mercy on us; for as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Dominus patitur neglectus, patitur contemptus, patitur negatus;</hi> the Lord, though we neglect, despise, deny him, yet still bears with us; with what patience then should we wait upon him, and not to make this conclusion by infidelity, Because that we wait for is long in coming, therefore it will never come: or to say with them in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Where is the promise of his<note place="margin">2 pet. 3. 4.</note> coming?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second tryal indeed is the bearing of some real affliction, not for sin, as in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but for righteousnesse sake. To whom more is given, of him more shall be required. The Devil shall have a larger liberty to tempt him. The Philosopher saith<note place="margin">Luke 12. 48.</note> very well, <hi>Deus non habet amorem maternum erga filios, sed paternum,</hi> that is, he will not dandle his children in his lap, and rock them as a mother, but put them to tryal as a father. And he tryes them by this, if they will rather <hi>pati malum, quam facere,</hi> suffer evil then do evil; or as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>utrum velint malum non patiendo facere,</hi> or <hi>non faciendo pati,</hi> whether they will rather do evil without suffering, or suffer evil without doing any. And this is as <hi>S. Peter</hi> saith, That the tryal of<note place="margin">1 pet. 1. 7.</note> our faith may be more precious in the sight of God then gold. And the reasons are four.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because we commonly see, that <hi>res prosperae</hi> are <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> the dead sea,<note place="margin">Pet.

And <hi>Seneca, Ipsa foelicitas nisi temperetur premit,</hi> felicity it self, if it be not qualified, is a pressure. We settle upon our lees, if we be not poured out from vessel to vessel; standing water putrifies; armour not used contracts rust; a full body ill humours; unfallowed ground brings forth weeds; but by exercise our graces grow bright, the stirring them up makes them burn, which else would die in us.</item>
                  <item>2. The second is, that as the Apostle saith, there may be a conformity between Christ and us, <hi>Romans</hi> 8. 29. Christ hath his inheritance in heaven by two rights; one as he is the first begotten son of God, and the other by his obedience. Ye see he saith of himself, Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to have<note place="margin">Luke 24. 26.</note> entred into heaven? Now in respect of the first we can have no conformity with<note place="margin">Acts 14. 28.</note> him, but the right we must claim by is the other, which is suffering; and if we claim the inheritance by Christ, we must have it by his title, <hi>viz.</hi> by suffering. In mans Law it is a principle, that inheritance which descends from one to another, must be held by no other title, then by that, which he that was formerly possessed of it, held it by. And therfore the Apostle pleads, that through much tribulat on we must enter into<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 12.</note> the kingdom of God. This is the tenure, and lest any should think himself exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he tells us, All that will live Godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution; none excepted. And for this cause, whereas the Church militant hath six resemblances. 1. To a Camp, 2. to a ship, 3. to a building, 4. to com, 5. to wine, 6. to a flock.

               </list>
               <p>Now for the manner of suffering; There were in the Primitive Church a sort of heretiques called <hi>Circumcilliones,</hi> who (hearing patience so much commended) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of it, as the stoickes, to bean <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> a want of passions, and therefore whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped themselves, and acquainted themselves so much with hardship, that they could beare any thing. But we are to understand, that as Christian religion is far from Epicurisme, so it allowes not the doctrine of the stoicks: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted against both Epicures and Stoickes. Christian patience is no stoicall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for <hi>Job, David,</hi> Christ, they were patient, yet had some notable signes of passions, that they felt what they suffered. Nor is patience a Monothelite, to have a will onely to be punished. Our Saviour had a will to be rid of the cup, as well as a submission<note place="margin">Luc. 22. 42.</note> to Gods will. It was a suffering according to the will of God, as the Apostle<note place="margin">1 pet. 4, 19.</note> speaks, to which he conformed himself. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth the difference<note place="margin">c. 7. de patientia</note> between the Heathens, and heretiks patience, and that which is true patience. The first was not in a good cause, or for a right end, but possibly they vsed themselves to suffer, and felt it not: but in true patience, a man feels the crosse, and would be rid of it, yet submits to the good pleasure of God. And therefore he saith, it was <hi>stupor morbi</hi> (being accustomed to ill) <hi>potius quam robur sanitatis,</hi> A stupefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disease, rather then the strength of health, and <hi>admiranda duritia, quae magna est sed neganda patientia, que nulla est,</hi> their hardnes was to be admired, for it was great, but their patitence to be denied, for they had none.<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 5.</note>

                  </gap> the two extreames of true patience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> noteth upon Exodus 9. 28. that in the wicked there is but <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanea cura,</hi> not no regard at all, but a momentary regard of Gods afflictions: as it was in <hi>Pharoah</hi> concerning the plagues of Egypt; and it was no other in <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 13. 6.</note> there was in him a humiliation for the present, till his hand was restored one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That effect which judgement works upon the wicked, is onely <hi>pannicus timor,</hi> a panick fear for the present, till the danger be over, and therefore such patience is called <hi>Pannica patientia,</hi> a pannick patience: like to that in bears and wolves at the sound of the drum, they are afraid while that is beaten and no longer. Or as they which not being used to the sea are sick, while the ship is tossed, but assoon as they set footing on the land are well again. And by this men came to that which the Ancients call <hi>Stupor morbi, non robur sanitatis,</hi> a numnesse and hardnes of soul, not proceeding from strength of health: and thy call it <hi>animi</hi>

The wiseman speaking of a person given to excesse of meat and drink, saith, They<note place="margin">prov. 23. 35.</note> have stricken me (shalt thou say) and I was not sick, they have beaten me and I felt it not. He shews that some by custome in sinne, contract a senselessenesse in sin. Their life is like to them that sleep in the top mast, whose sleep is broken and yet continues, and so they come to a kinde of drunkennesse. <hi>Ebrii sunt, non vino,</hi> as<note place="margin">Esa. 51. 21.</note> the Prophet speaks, they are drunk, but not with wine; and so it falls out in other vices, when a man is bewitcht with a sin, he is smitten but feeleth not, because he is drunk with it.</item>

2. The other is such as we read <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets were: who, when their God<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 28</note> would not hear them, cut themselves with knives and lancers, and thereby might seem patient; and this is not <hi>stupor contractus,</hi> but <hi>emissus</hi> a stupidity infused by Sathan, whether he possesse men spiritually onely in their souls, or corporally too. The Devil taught a man to breake his chaines and cut his flesh with stones; and such<note place="margin">Mar. 5. 5.</note> was that of the <hi>Circumeelliones, Manichees</hi> and <hi>Donatists &amp;c.</hi> it was but <hi>pati ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, ut facerent malum,</hi> as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks, they suffered evil, that they might do the more evil.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This <hi>stupor contractus</hi> comes two wayes. 1. <hi>Ex ignorantia causae,</hi> not considering the cause whence afflictions come. or 2. <hi>Ex ignorantia finis,</hi> not considering the end whereto they tend.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the afflicted consider not the cause from whence their affliction come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">Jer. 5. 3.</note> Thou hast stricken them O Lord, and they are not grieved (saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction, they have made their faces harder then a rock &amp;c. And God himself by the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<note place="margin">2. 30.</note> In vain have I smitten your children, they received no correction. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esay,</hi> why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more &amp;c.<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 5.</note> No doubt but there are some such among us, whom God calleth before him, and arresteth with these his Serieants, but are no whit amended. Such are usually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Simon</hi> the Cyrenian, who was violently laid hold on, and forced to carry<note place="margin">Luc. 23. 26.</note> the crosle, but are not crucified on it themselves, a crosse they beare, but profit not. And the reason is, because they ascribe it to other causes, besides God inflicting, and their sins deserving. <hi>Divines</hi> call this <hi>coecum termentum,</hi> or <hi>coecum dolorem,</hi> a blinde grief, a grief they have on the sudden, but are not able to say, for this or this cause is it come upon me: they ascribe it <hi>humori naturae</hi> not <hi>rori gratiae,</hi> and like purblinde men they cannot looke up to the hand that strikes them; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently they get them <hi>terrenas consolatiunculas</hi> earthly petty comforts; (as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) pleasure and friends, and so drive it away: and if it comes from without then many times they do <hi>insurgere in instrumentum et omittere percussorem,</hi> rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the weapon, and leave the striker, which comes by not observing the two concurrents, <hi>viz.</hi> God and his instrument, and that the affliction is just with God, though unjust in the instrument, as the calamities of <hi>Job,</hi> were just in God, <hi>cui nil nisi justum placet,</hi> who delights in nothing but what's just; and our Saviour saith, Math 5. 11. we shall be blessed by God when we are injured by men, the<note place="margin">1 Sam. 22.</note> not distinguishing of these two breeds desire of revenge. King <hi>David</hi> could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish<note place="margin">psal. 7. 3.</note> better. In the case of <hi>Savl</hi> and <hi>Doeg,</hi> the instruments; O Lord my God, if<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.</note> I have done any such thing &amp;c. He ascribed it to God, and yet knew he was wronged by them: and in the case of <hi>Shimei,</hi> he conceived that he was but Gods instrument to afflict and punish him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we look not high enough, that is the first, the second is, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not aright of the end: for tribulation is of <hi>tribulus</hi> a bramble; and Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> saith, <hi>Ideo mittitur, aut ut detineat, aut ut revocet,</hi> it is sent therefore, either to restrain, or to call back. And <hi>Intelligat bomo Deum esse medicum, et tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem medicamentum esse ad salutem, non poenam ad damnationem,</hi> Man should know, that God is a physitian, and tribulation a medicine for health, not a punishment to condemne. And Saint <hi>Gregory. Adversitas quae bonis viris obiicitur, probatio virtutis est, non indicium reprobationis,</hi> Tribulation that comes upon good men is a trial of their goodnes, not a token of reprobation. When men then mistake Gods aime, in the end they fall into a numnes of soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second extreame of Patience is the fainting under Gods correction. The cause most commonly comes, when men cannot distinguish between <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> between being shaken, and cast down; but imagine, that God afflicts them<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 8.</note> in wrath, and aymes at their destruction: whereas the Apostle could say, we are troubl d on every side, yet not distressed, we are perplexed, but not in despair. And when a man cannot distinguish between these, then a heavines seizeth on him that begetteth death. The Psalmist maketh a dialogue between his soul and himself.<note place="margin">psal. 42. 6.</note> Why art thou so cast down O my soul? but then comes in the other part, put thy trust in God for the help of his countenance. When men begin to be perplexed, then either they feel their courage die, the spirit is cast down, and A wounded
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59534:106"/>
spirit cannot be born: the spirit of a man will beare other infirmities and crosses,<note place="margin">Prov. 18. 14.</note> and so the heathen have shewed great patience, but when the spirit or conscience it self is wounded, who can beare it? Or else they fall a murmuring against Gods<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 13.</note> justice, and say with <hi>Cain,</hi> Their punishment is greater then they can bear, or have deserved; and so mistaking Gods Justice fall away by despair, and not considering<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 8.</note> Gods mercy, they come to be of <hi>Sauls</hi> minde, If God will neither answer him by Prophets, dreames, nor voice, he will go to the witch: and if this succeeds not, then he takes another course, and so falls into the other extreame, and lies flat on the ground with a brutish kinde of patience. And all this is by misconstruing Gods justice or mercy, that because he correcteth as a father, he will condemne us as a Judge.</p>
               <p>The general means to get Patience are these.<note place="margin">Meahs of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is truly said by Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> that <hi>quot sunt causae,</hi> as many causes as God hath <hi>ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> to punish, there are so many for us <hi>ad patiendum</hi> to suffer with patience. There are many examples of patience among the Heathen as of <hi>Scaevola, Rutilius, Regulus,</hi> &amp;c. these had a shew of patience, and their reason was, <hi>Sis asinus, quemcnnque asinum sors prospera fecit.</hi> But there ought to be in Christians a more heroique courage, seeing they know the causes from whence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction comes, and whereto it tends, as was shewed before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They say that it is <hi>Tenuis patientia, quicquid corrigere est nefas,</hi> a small pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when a man cannot help it then to beare: since we cannot help it, were bestt o make a vertue of necessity. It is hard to kick against the pricks.<note place="margin">Act. 9. 5.</note> A necessity being laid upon us, let us do it willingly, and so it will become a commendable vertue, and let us not be like them that have no hope.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is that which the heathen man confessed, <hi>Quantum mercator pro lucro, quantum venator pro ludo, tantum ego non passus sum provirtute,</hi> I have not suffered so much for vertue, as the merchant for gain, or the hunter for sport: this he spake out of ambition, that he had not suffered so much for his honour. But let us adde, <hi>Quantum ethnicus pro ambitione, tantum ego non passus sum pro Christo meo,</hi> I have not endured so much for my Christ, as the Heathen for his ambition. On the other side considering as we are Christians, and afflicted either <hi>ad correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem</hi> or <hi>ad probationem,</hi> for our amendment or tryal, these should be to make us patient: of which two let us spake more particularly.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In respect that afflictions come upon us justly for our sinnes. The lesse dishonest thief could blame his fellow for murmuring, and his reason was,<note place="margin">Lue. 23. 41.</note> seeing we suffer justly; all we suffer is justly deserved, yea lesse then we deserve.</item>
                  <item>2. The Psalmist saith, that God in faithfullnesse had afflicted him. That as the<note place="margin">psal. 119. 75.</note> punishment is just in the first place, so if we are afflicted, we should ascribe it to God of very faithfulnesse. Though he visit our offences with rods, or our sinnes<note place="margin">89. 32 33.</note> with scourges, yet his mercy shall not utterly be taken from us, nor his truth fail. This affliction being sent in mercy, either to retain us, or to recall us, either for prevention or for cure, and we apprehending it so, is a speciall means to procure patience in us. For being strengthened by his promise, we shall make use of his punishment, and know that all things worke together for good to them that love<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> God. And to this we may apply the speech of the Heathen man, <hi>Patior ne patiar</hi> I suffer now, that I may not suffer hereafter. That <hi>Abraham</hi> make not that argument against us which he did to the rich man; Son remember that thou in thy life time<note place="margin">Luc. 16. 25.</note> receivedst thy good things, therefore now thou sufferest pains; but <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who suffered pain, shall for his patience have his reward. That this conclusion may not be, here we must suffer those pains that may be ended, mitigated, endured with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and have hope of an end, that we may not hereafter suffer those pains, in which there is no patience in bearing, no hope to be delivered no mitigation to be expected, but the end will be without end. And indeed this <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">psal. 73. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>cursus temporalium,</hi> to have no misfortune or trouble, nor to be plagued as other men, is a dangerous signe of Gods disfavour to us. And these for the corrective part.</item>

1. To consider before hand what troubles and crosses are incident to a Christian life. Our Saviour upon this hath two comparisons, of a builder, and a king going to war, both whom it behoveth to cast their accounts before hand what charge they may be at. For the want of forecast of them that intend to live a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, what troubles, what temptations they must go through, makes them unprepared and unresolved when the crosse cometh, and so they give over.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apostle (though it may be equally applied to other vertues) tells us, that whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope: that is, in<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> this point of patience we may see in scriptures what the Saints of God have endured, and by considering their afflictions and sufferings, what it cost them, and what they suffered we may see what it will cost us, and what we must endure, and so we may be the better armed against the like; and especially if we consider our<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 10.</note> Captain, as the Apostle calls him, and what he suffered. <hi>Recogitate illum,</hi> consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied<note place="margin">12. 3.</note> and faint in your minds, This is a good preparative to patience. <hi>Si paessio Christi,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Gregory) in memoriam revocetur, nihil tam arduum quod non aequo animo</hi>

                     </gap> flamma esse possumus, si in anima patientiam retineamus,</hi> we may be martyrs without fire, if we endure Gods crosse with patience. And to endure them we shall be enabled by Gods own promise, in the words of the Apostle; God is faithfull who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> with the temptation will also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to beare it. He will not trie us above our patience, but either give us sufficient strength to suffer great afflictions, or lesson our trials, as our patience shall decrease. And the consideration of this is also a great motive to continue in this vertue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, The hope of the reward laid up for those that suffer in this world, is a principal means to stir us to this duty. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, I reckon not the<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> sufferings of this present time worthy to be compared with the glory which<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> shall be revealed in us. And he gives the reason in another place. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal weight of glory.</p>
               <p>Here is a gradation of so many steps, that a man cannot reach to the top of it.</p>
               <p>The glory great, the affliction light, the glory exceeding, the affliction for a moment, nay the glory far more exceeding with an eternal weight added to it. Here is Hyperbole upon Hyperbole, and yet no Hyperbole can fully expresse it, The Apostle could not expresse it. and we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
               <p>So much of the means.</p>
               <p>The signes of patience are these.<note place="margin">Signes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Tolerantia Crucis.</hi> When a man findes upon examination, that he is able and willing according to the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to abide under the crosse, it is a good signe. When a man is so affected to the Crosse, that if it please God to take away his sinne, (the cause of punishment) he is willing to beare the punishment. Let me onely be assured of forgivenesse and let the Crosse lie on me still.</item>
                  <item>2. The second is when we can <hi>Tolerare et amare,</hi> beare and love too. When our suffering turns not to murmuring or disobedience, but so affecteth us, that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our chastisment) we can love God with his chastisment, and for it say with <hi>Job,</hi> Blessed be the name of the Lord. When it is <hi>Benedictus Dominus in</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>donis suis,</hi> blessed be God in his gifts, <hi>Jobs</hi> wife can say grace aswell as he; but when it cometh <hi>in ablationibus suis,</hi> blessed be God, who takes away, a true note ariseth of difference between true and counterfeit patience. It is in this as in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59534:107"/>
the affections, when they arise from contrary objects, they are true and not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit; as when justice, which properly stirs up fear, works love in us, and when we can fear him for his mercy which properly stirs up love. Wicked men may fear God for his justice, and love him for his mercy; but the true note of difference is, if we love him for his justice, and can say with <hi>David,</hi> There is mercy with thee that thou mayest be feared. So that when a man can love God, as we count it, <hi>post inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> this is true love, and is a signe of true patience. The Heathen man said, thats true love, <hi>cum amare possis post injuriam,</hi> when one can love him that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him.</item>
                  <item>3. The third is, when we finde our selves humble in our sufferings, which is a distinction between true Christian patience and heretical. The Fathers in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church had much to do to make the people observe the difference of patience between a true Christian and a Donatist; and were forced to use these two notes of distinction.</item>
               </list>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That in the suffering of a Donatist (which is to be observed in our dayes) they should finde a spirit of pride and vanity, whereas true patience is humble. And this humility appeared in the Martyrs sufferings, which was without disputation with God about the cause, or murmuring at the torments: <hi>tolerabunt &amp; non gemue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt;</hi> or else <hi>respondent pro Deo,</hi> they either bear them, and mourn in silence, or if they reply, it is on Gods behalf, like <hi>Job,</hi> of whom the Holy Ghost saith, In all this<note place="margin">Job 1. 22. 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. And, In all this did not <hi>Job</hi> sin with his lips. He did nothing to bewray impatience. True patience is humble, and saith with <hi>David, Tacui Domine, quia tu fecisti,</hi> I kept silence, O Lord, because it is thy doing.</item>
                  <item>2. The other note is Alacrity. It was observed by the Fathers, that the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celliones</hi> in their sufferings had no alacrity, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, without passion, it is true, they were not moved, but they suffered not cheerfully. They bore them, but they rejoyced not; they did <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, overcome, as those that in some diseases, cure without pain, or using Narcotick medicines do overcome the pain, but Christian patience doth more, In all these, saith the Apostle, <hi>Romans,</hi> 8. 37. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we do more then overcome. It doth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, overcome, and more then so, for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth too. So the Apostles after they had been scourged, departed, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to suffer for the Name of Christ; whereas the suffering of<note place="margin">Acts 5. 41.</note> Hereticks, though it discovered no fear or grief, yet it wanted this rejoycing, it had no alacrity in it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now concerning the sixth Rule (as is in the former.) It is not enough for a man to say to his own soul, Why art thou so impatient? but we must say to others,<note place="margin">Psalm 27. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Sustine Dominum</hi> (as the Psalmist) wait (and that patiently) on the Lord. We do what we can by our comforts and exhortations to make them patient. On the other side, if there be any provocation to impatiency in others, as <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, we must answer them with him. And this is the knowledge that every one should have, and it is folly in them that have it not. For <hi>Doctrina viri per patientiam noscitur,</hi> the discretion of a man deferreth anger, saith <hi>Solomon, Proverbs</hi> 19. 11. and as <hi>S. Gregory</hi> addes, <hi>Tanto minus quis<expan>

               <argument>
                  <p>The second thing required in the first Commandment, To have the true God for our God. Reasons hereof. Of true Religion. This is the true pearl to be sought. Three rules in seeking. The extreams of Religion. 1. Idolatry, 2. superstition, 3. Prophanenesse, 4. novelty, of which three degrees. 1. Schisme. 2. Heresy. 3. Apostacy. The means of true Religion. The signes of procuring it in others.</p>
               </argument>
               <head>The second Proposition.</head>
               <p>THere remain two propositions more in this Commandment.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Thou shalt have me the true God, for thy God; and this includes the vertue of religion, <hi>viz.</hi> true religion, which is the having the true God for our God. All other religions are the extreams forbidden.</item>
                  <item>2. The second is, Thou shalt have no other Gods but me, that is, thou shalt have one God alone, and thou shalt have me alone, and this includes the vertue of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is opposite to all mixtures of true religion with any other.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Besides these propositions drawn out of the whole precept, there are two other vertues included in the first and last words of this Commandment. 1. Upon the last words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>coram facie mea,</hi> before my face, is grounded, the vertue of integrity or uprightnesse, opposed to hypocrisie; and upon the first words, <hi>Non erunt tibi,</hi> [thou shalt not] the vertue of perseverance. For the words are in the future tense, and extend to the whole course of our life. and these are the particulars that remain to be handled in this commandment.</p>
               <p>The second proposition then, is, Thou shalt have me for thy God. For it is not<note place="margin">2.</note> enough to have a God, unlesse he be the true God. And this is true religion. Naturally our affections are bent, and chiefly bestowed on some one thing above the rest, and to this all our actions refer, and this whatsoever it be is our God. As some upon an Idol, or false god, which, as the Apostle speaks, is nothing. Or some upon the god of this<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 4.</note> world (that is, the Devil.) Some have their belly for their god, that is, the flesh.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note> Some idolize their money and wealth, the love where of is idolatry, as the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 5.</note> Thus as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>unusquis<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> comeditur ab aliquo zelo,</hi> every man is zealous for some thing or other. And concerning all such the Prophet makes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that there is a generation of men that turn the glory of the true God into dishonour, that are not careful to render God his true honour, and their religion is,<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 2.</note> as the Apostle saith of knowledge, <hi>scientia falsi nominis,</hi> religion falsly so called. For<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 20.</note> they follow vanity and lies, and therefore eat the fruit of lies, as the Prophet speaks,<note place="margin">Hos. 10. 13.</note> that is, grief of minde, smart of body, and confusion of soul. That which <hi>Plato</hi> saith of this is true, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. Every soul if it hath not the truth, it is not because it wants desire of the truth, and if it finde it not out, it is against the will of it, unlesse it degenerate from its nature. When <hi>Abraham</hi> had told <hi>Abimelech</hi> that<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Sarah</hi> was his sister, not his wife, he (though a Heathen) could tell <hi>Abraham</hi> that he<note place="margin">Job. 8. 44.</note> had done that he ought not to have done. And that which is more strange, the Devil,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 2.</note> (though the father of lies) could say to the woman, Yea is it true indeed? Hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? He was desirous that <hi>Eve</hi> should give him a true answer. So we see the force of truth, that howsoever it is not practised, yet in judgment, not only the good but the wicked, even the Heathen, and the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self would not willingly be beguiled with falshood.</p>
               <p>One reason why God, though he commands onely true religion, yet permits the<note place="margin">1 pet. 1. 7.</note> false, is, in respect of that which was named before, the tryal of our faith, which is more precious with God then all the riches of the world. This tryal hath been the cause, why God hath permitted and doth permit so many errours, heresies, and false worships, we may allude to it by comparison: that albeit God hath abundance of all things to make all men rich, and so could have done; yet for tryal of a liberall<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 11.</note> and compassionate minde in the rich, he saith, The poor shall never cease out of the land: So it may be said in the case of truth, It had been an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie matter for God to have taken order, that every man should enjoy the true
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59534:108"/>
profession but on ly for this tryal. <hi>Ideo oportet haereses esse inter vos,</hi> therefore there<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> must be heresies among you, and why? because they which are approved may be<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> made manifest among you. He that said, <hi>Fiat lux,</hi> let there be light and it was made, could have as easily said, <hi>Sit veritas,</hi> let there be truth, let there be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of truth, and it should have been so, but he hath given the reason why he suffereth errour, that they may be tryed, that seek after the truth.</p>
               <p>Another reason of this is, that forasmuch as God hath magnified his word, and truth above all things, and that it is the chiefest thing, and that he maketh most<note place="margin">Psal. 138. 2.</note> account of, he would therefore have it diligently to be sought by us, that we should shew our conformity to him in the estimation of it, and magnifie it above all things.</p>
               <p>For the necessity of it much need not be spoken, it hath been partly handled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but because truth and true religion is a way, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> calls it, and that way<note place="margin">2 pet. 2. 2.</note> must bring us to the right end, then it follows, that of necessity we are to finde it.<note place="margin">John 16. 13.</note> The spirit of truth is to guide us, and therefore it is requisite we finde him. If we finde it not, we cannot come to our end. <hi>Eunti in via aliquis trit terminus,</hi> but <hi>error immensus est,</hi> if a man keep the way he shall at length come to an end of his journey, but errour hath no end; therefore the way must be found.</p>
               <p>The thing commanded is Religion, and true Religion, <hi>veri nominis Religio,</hi> which<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 45.</note> our Saviour under the name of the kingdom of heaven compareth to a pearl, and him that sought after it, to Merchant, that seeking after many, found one pearl of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable price and value, and when he had found it, sold all that he had, and bought it. In which we may consider his desire which is branched out into three acts. 1. <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivit.</hi> 2. <hi>Invenit.</hi> 3. <hi>Emit.</hi> He sought, found, and bought.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the manifold errours and falshoods in the world, Investigation is most necessary; that is, an earnest study and applying of the minde, to finde out truth among many errours, contrary to the custome of this age, where no man desires to seek, but in that Religion wherein a man is born, in that he will grow up, and in that he will dye, and imagine that he hath found the pearl without seeking, and so when our studies ripen, we onely stick to some mens institutions. <hi>Moses</hi> seemeth to<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 32.</note> be of another minde, and not onely exhorteth, but commandeth the Israelites to enquire into all antiquities, and in all parts and ends of the world, whether there were any Religion so true as theirs. No man then ought to suppose he hath found the truth, before he hath sought it; and a promise there is of finding if we seek. The<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 7.</note> promise of the calling of the Gentiles, that God would be found of them that sought him not, is no rule for us in this case: but as we must enquire, so we must examine all truths. There are many counterfeit pearls; a man must be able to distinguish, before he sell all to buy a pearl.</p>
               <p>Hereditary Religion, Religion upon offence taken, Religion upon a sudden, these three at this time possesse the most of mankinde.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Either because they will be of the minde of <hi>Auxentius, In hac fide natus sum, in hac item moriar,</hi> and in this case Religion findeth us, and not we it.</item>
                  <item>2. Or, because I have received some indignity in one Religion, I will be of another: or because we have sustained some losse, or had some crosse by our Religion, therefore we will go over seas, and there we will seck and finde the pearl, and are able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it to be so.</item>
                  <item>3. There is <hi>religio repentina</hi> a sudden religion. This is a stumbling upon Religion<note place="margin">Esay 65. 1.</note> without study, by some that seek to revelations, and prefer fancies before ordinary<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 21.</note> means: whereas God hath given ordinary means, we must have time, and study, and means to finde it; for in other cases and without these there's no promise nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from God, that we shall light upon it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But if any shall say we have found it before we sought it, as God saith of a people, I was found of them that sought me not, we must adde, with the Apostle, <hi>Omnia probate,</hi> there is an examination answerable to seeking: they that have it must either seek it or examine it, and not make examination of the truth in Religion a matter of death, as the Turks do.</p>
               <p>Seek therefore we must, and in seeking the Fathers give many rules, but especially two rules must be observed.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first our Saviour gives, <hi>quaerite primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> It must be sought before all other things,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 33.</note>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:59534:109"/>
and in the first place, because the seeking of it will it all things else Seek the Lord (saith the Prophet) while he may be found, and call upon him while<note place="margin">Esay 55. 6.</note> he is neer. <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, All seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christs.<note place="margin">phil. 2. 21.</note> But if we give <hi>primum</hi> to our own, and not when we seek for Christs God will not be neer, but leaves us.</item>
                  <item>2. The second is given by <hi>Moses.</hi> If thou seek the Lord thy God with all thy<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 29.</note> heart, and with all thy soul, thou shalt finde him. God saith by the Prophet, Ye shall<note place="margin">Jerem. 29. 13.</note> seek me and finde me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. We must seek with tears, as <hi>Mary</hi> did the body of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 20. 15. we must seek for the truth, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith men must do for wisdom, how is that? as men seek for silver or<note place="margin">prov. 2. 4.</note> hid treasures; and, as the Prophet, if ye will enquire, enquire; that is, enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.<note place="margin">Jerem. 45. 5.</note> But if either we <hi>primum quaerere grandia,</hi> if we first seek great things for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </hi> seeking his fathers asses, and the woman seeking her groat will prove to be with more care then ours for religion: such seekers will never finde.</item>
                  <item>3. The third is. As we must seek for the truth, if we have it not, and when we<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 3.</note> have it examine it, so when we have it, we must <hi>acquiescere</hi> we must rest in it. The<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 14.</note> use of religion serves us instead of a girdle to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <item>2. Another extream is <hi>parum,</hi> the defect, when we do not give honour <hi>cui opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet,</hi> to whom it is due, or not <hi>quantum oportet,</hi> not so much as is due. The first is called prophanenesse, which usually ends in Atheisme, the other is non-acquiescence, or not resting in religion, when men seek out novelties, and receive the truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> in part: and this divides it self into two branches. 1. Schisme. 2. Heresse: which ends in Apostacy.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>cui non oportet,</hi> is Idolatry, whether it be by giving divine honour and worship, or ascribing any part of Gods office to any creature, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> speaks: within which comes dealing and covenanting with the Devil, or trusting to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, Sorcerers, Charmers, Dreamers, and other Inchanters. So if a man yeeld any of the former affections and vertues, as love, fear, &amp;c. to the Devil, if he fear the stars, or attribute any thing to dreams, inchantments, ligatures, lots, characters, &amp;c. it is comprehended within this. God telleth us by the Prophet, that none can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew<note place="margin">Deu. 18. 10, 11</note> things to come, but himself, (not meaning things known by natural causes) but where there is <hi>causa libera</hi> a free cause. Therefore if divine honour be attribute: to any of these, a part of Gods peculiar offices, is taken from him, and the most of them are reckoned up by <hi>Moses,</hi> and God threatens to punish them.

                  <hi>him onely,</hi> but it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by our Saviour, and all comes from the same spirit. The reasons were touched before, yet we will mention some of them again.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is, because it trencheth upon Gods honour and glory to have a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that men should worship other gods. The Apostles end their <hi>

               <p n="3">3. The third was touched before, To joyne any with him, who is below him (and whosoever he is, he must be below him) is to abase him: if we could joyn any that were equal or his match, it were otherwise. If we joyn worse with better, it disgraces it. wine with water is the weaker.

               <p>The thing forbidden and opposite to sincerity is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mixture in religion, and that both in respect of the matter of it, and of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59534:110"/>
1. For the matter. Our Saviour saith. No man putteth new and old cloth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether<note place="margin">Luc. 5. 36.</note> in a garment, or new wine into old vessells. This mixture of religion cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth it: as that of the Turks is a religion compounded of all: and the Pagans worship diverse gods. The whore of Babylon is said to have a mixt cup, Rev. 18. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For the mixture of affections. As our religion ought to be sincere, so our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A mixture of hot and cold maks lukewarm, which temper is lothsome to<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 16.</note> Christ. The religion of such is for their ends, not for Gods glory: as they which sought Christ for the loaves. They are <hi>duplici corde,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> calls them.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 26.</note> There is no worse fault then to be lukewarm; therefore we must be resolved to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 8.</note> hot or cold.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other extreame forbidden, is the defect, as that of mixture in excesse, that is, when men will so reforme and purifie religion, that they destroy it. Pro. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 23. The wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood <hi>qui mungit nimium, sanguinem elicit,</hi> he that will make his nose too cleare, makes it bleed; so when men will cleanse the church too much, instead of purifying it from mixtures in composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they give it a bloody nose, as sectaries and hereticks usually do, who alwayes pretend reformation, when they rend the church, and make it bleed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to death.</p>
               <p>The means of sincerity in religion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no better, then that which is implied in that wish of Christ, I would thou wert cold or hot: we must avoyd lukewarmnes, which causes wavering in religion, and come to a resolution; we must resolve to be what we professe, and to stick to the truth: then we shall be <hi>mel sincerum,</hi> pure hony <hi>sine cera,</hi> purified from all mixture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we are resolved to adhere to the truth, then we must come to the price, and value aright. It is true, that <hi>Job</hi> saith. Man knoweth not the price of it.<note place="margin">Job 28. 13.</note> Though we would give our selves and all we have for it, yet we cannot give a full price for it, and therefore must not for any price part with it. Merchants use to set a mark upon their clothes or other wares of the lowest price they will sell them at: now the truth is of such a value, that we cannot set any price whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to part with it. How high soever our price be, if we part with it, God may say to us, as the Prophet doth in the person of Christ, when they weighed for his<note place="margin">Zach. 11. 12.</note> price thirty pieces of silver, a goodly price it is that I was valued at by them; a price more fit to buy potsheards, and therefore he casts it to the potter. Surely God sets no such price on us, or valued us at so small a rate, however we value Christ or his truth<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Empti estis pretio,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> we are bought with a price, more then thirty pices of filver not with corruptable things, as gold and silver, but with the blood of Christ, as of a lamb withour spot: a lesser price would not serve to redeeme us, for if it would, all should have gone rather then he; therefore as he prized us, so must we prize him, and his truth, aboue all corruptible things in the world.</p>
               <p>The signes of sincere or true religion have been handled before: we shall touch onely a few.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. True religion ascribes all good to God alone, and gives no part of his honour to any creature.</item>
                  <item>2. It favours not man in his corrupt desires, its no doctrine of liberty, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines all carnal liberty; it teaches us to despise father and mother, friends, yea a mans self and all for God.</item>
                  <item>3. It is free from those mixtures which have been the decay of religion, which were 1. mingling it with errours of vain Philosophy, which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calls<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>rationes philosophorum, obtusae, acutae</hi> the acute and yet obtuse or blunt reasons of Philosophers. Thus <hi>Clemenes Alex.</hi> and <hi>Origan</hi> by <hi>Platos</hi>

religion enflames the heart and affections with love of God, and makes us prize him aboue all worldly things, that we can say with <hi>David,</hi> whom have I in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee &amp;c.

               <p>The sixth rule is, for procuring sincerity in others; especially we must exhort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the Apostle doth <hi>Timothy,</hi> and all those that succeed him in the like office of a Bishop in the church, to keep the commandment, that is, the doctrine and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on left &amp;commanded by Christ, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Coram me,</hi> Before me.</head>
                  <p>This is the last part of this Commandment. And this <hi>Coram me,</hi> saith saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> hath a great Emphasis in it, even so much as makes a distinction between this and the three other Commandments of the first Table: and it is to be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the third rule of Extent before specified, <hi>viz.</hi> that is spiritual and extends to the heart. <hi>Coram me,</hi> Not in my sight. That is, thou shall not have any other God not so much as in the secret corner of thy heart: for God is <hi>scrutator cordis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 27.</note> a searcher of the heart. This implies the vertue of integrity. The law is spiritual,<note place="margin">7. 14.</note> saith the Apostle, and therefore the duties here commanded, are to be, not onely <hi>coram facie humana et coram luce,</hi> in the sight of men and in the light, which reach only to the exteriour act of Gods worship, but this <hi>coram tenebris et coram facie Dei,</hi> in<note place="margin">Esa. 45. 7.</note> the darknesse, and in Gods sight, reaches to the thoughts, the inward parts of the<note place="margin">psal. 139. 11. 93. 9.</note> soul, which belong properly to the sight of God. It is God that formed the light, and created the darknes. And therefore, as the Psalmist saith, the darknes and light are both to him alike. And he that made the eye shall he not see? He sees not onely what the eve seeth, but also because he formes the spirit of man, Zach. 12. 1. He seeth what the eye seeth not, but onely the spirit of a man beholds, and that, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, whether the Candle burne, or is put out; and which is more<note place="margin">1 John. 3. 20.</note> then all this, he seeth further then the spirit of man can see; for though our heart condemnes us not, yet he can, for he is greater then our heart, and knows more then our heart or spirit.</p>
                  <p>Again this [<hi>Coram me</hi>] distinguishes true obedience from a bare appearance: for <hi>bonum apparens,</hi> good in shew, may be <hi>Coram homine</hi> before man; but <hi>bonum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> is onely <hi>Coram me,</hi> before God. For <hi>Coram homine</hi> before man, or any other <hi>Coram,</hi> argues nothing to be other then in appearance: but <hi>Coram Deo</hi> makes it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Ephes. 3. 16. Divides every man into an inward, and an outward man and the same words are use byd <hi>Plato</hi> before him, whence some gather he had read <hi>Plato;</hi> there is <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an inward and an outward man, and which of these two pleaseth God best, himself sheweth in <hi>Eliab,</hi> and <hi>David. Samuel</hi> had a<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 7.</note> liking to <hi>Eliabs</hi> countenance, but God said, look not on it, for I have refused him<note place="margin">psal. 51. 6.</note> God saw more into him then <hi>Samuel</hi> could. God looketh into the heart, and<note place="margin">Luke 17. 11.</note> therefore requireth truth in the inward parts. For there God rules especially. The kingdom of God is within you, as our Saviour said to the Pharisees. There it must begin, and there he delighteth to be most, if our heart he right, from thence
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59534:111"/>
he expects his worship. For in the heart is the principal seat of Christs scepter, there be rules, subduing our wills to God. There is in all men a corrupt desire of appearing outwardly to men, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we affect to seem something, as <hi>Saul,</hi> when he spake to <hi>Samuel,</hi> who had told him that God had rejected him, yet saith<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 30</note> he, Honour me, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel: such is our nature to appear outwardly to men; but this appearance commends us not to God, for he delights most in the truth and sincerity of the heart, for, as the common saying is, every man is chiefly delighted with that, wherein he is singular and exceeds others; and because that God alone can search the heart, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he delights in it, and requires our obedience to be <hi>coram facie mea,</hi> as in his sight. Therefore it is that the Wise man counselleth a man to keep his heart with all<note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> diligence. He gives a double reason, for it is the principal member, and therefore gives God the chief glory; and further it is the fountain of all our actions by none of which is God honoured, if they come from a corrupt fountain; nay they are so far from being accepted that they are abominable, and therefore according to the disposition of the heart, life or death proceeds: if we worship God with a right heart, then we shall reap life; if that be unsound, death eternall follows. And therefore <hi>necessitas incumbit,</hi> we had need to keep that member right. For all those glorious duties before spoken of, if they want integrity, or a good heart, they are so far from Gods acceptation, that they become abomination. For if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> our faith must come from the heart; if we love it must be not in word, but<note place="margin">1 John 3. 18.</note> in truth, which comes from the heart. Our obedience also must proceed from the<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3. 23.</note> heart. To conclude this, whatsoever we do, we must do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men.</p>
                  <p>That which is here commanded is called, <hi>virtus integritatis</hi> by the Fathers, inward soundnesse against hollownesse, and sincerity against mixture. And they ground it upon Gods charge to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he made the covenant of Circumcision,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Ambula coram me,</hi> what that is, God explained in the next words, &amp; <hi> esto integer,</hi> walk before me, and be upright or perfect without hypocrisie. It is commonly joyned in Scripture with another word, <hi>Job</hi> was an upright and just man, the words<note place="margin">Job. 1. 1. 8. 6.</note> signifie properly, straight and sound, upright and pure in another place; and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 15.</note> and good heart in another. The nature of the word <hi>integer</hi> is taken from timber, it must be straight without, and sound within; straight that it be not crooked, <hi>coram facie humana,</hi> and sound that it be not hollow <hi>coram facie divina,</hi> before God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 11. 37. 2.</note> the Ark was overlaid with gold, without and within, and in this respect it was that the Psalmist distinguished the Church (the Kings daughter) from other Kings<note place="margin">psalm 45. 14.</note> daughters, her outward beauty might be parraleld, but she was all glorious within. It is the inward beauty which is required chiefly.</p>
                  <p>That which is forbidden is hypocrisie. Our Saviour taxed it in the Pharisees, by telling them they had a care to make clean the outside of the cup and platter, but had<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 25.</note> no regard to that which was <hi>intus,</hi> within. This is the sin of seven woes, more then we read that any other sin had. Of which <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>Pharisaeorum justitia erat in ostentatione operis, non in rectitudine intentionis,</hi> the righteousnesse of the Pharisees consisted in ostentation of their works, not in the uprightnesse of their<note place="margin">Hos. 7. 11.</note> intents. The other extream is that the Prophet taxes in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> whom he calld a<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 16.</note> silly dove without heart: this is simplicity without wisdom, when there is as our Saviour intimates, <hi>Columba sine serpente,</hi> the dove without the serpent. Of such speaks <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he saith, that a fool uttereth all his minde, he poures out his spirit without any manner of wisdom and discretion, before every man: our integrity therefore must be preserved with wisdom.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The way to keep our selves in this integrity. First, <hi>Seneca's</hi> councel to <hi>Lucillus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The means.</note> (who desired this vertue) was, when he took any thing in hand, to imagine that <hi>Cato, Scipio,</hi> or some other of the ancient Romans, renowned for vertue, stood before him. But it is a better way for us to do as the Psalmist did, to set God alwayes<note place="margin">psalm 16. 9.</note> before our eyes, conceiving, (and that truely) that whatsoever we do is in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. If that will not work with us, then to set God not absolutely, but as he will sit, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, at the day of judgment. The day<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note> (as the Apostle speaks) when God shall judge the secrets of all men: for (as the Preacher<note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 14.</note> saith) God shall bring every work into judgement, with every secret thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59534:112"/>
2. Another motive, and that a forceable one, to perswade us will be, that God requires an exact and sincere service of us to himself, because he commandeth<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 5.</note> singlenesse of heart from servants to their Masters even with fear and trembling. If this; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, eye-service will not be allowed by God, as current towards men, much lesse will he allow it to himself.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lastly, if we consider the integrity of Christs heart to us, of whom we read, that it was pierced, and that he spent his very heart blood for us: if we consider that, it will stir us up to have a reciprocal heart to him, and say with <hi>S. Bernard, juste cor nostrum vindicat, qui cor suum pro nostro dedit,</hi> he may justly challenge our hearts, that gave his for ours. When he had offered his hands, feet, and other members for us, yet thought it not sufficient, but gave his heart for us also. It is not our tongue, hands, or feet, that can requite it; our hearts will be too little, if we give them also up to him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And we shall know whether our hearts be upright or no, first, by the Heathen<note place="margin">Signes of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse.</note> mans rule, 
<q>
                        <l>Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa</l>
                        <l> — hic murns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A sound heart is like a wall of brasse, and is so full of courage that it can say, with the Apostle, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> perminimum est, ut a vobis judicer,</hi> it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you. It is the soundnesse of the heart that will make it bold, if<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 3.</note> we be not <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> mali</hi> to our selves, that we know no evil in our selves. This made <hi>John Baptists</hi> heart to be above King <hi>Herodes</hi> power; the want of it made <hi>Peter</hi> afraid<note place="margin">Mark 6. 8. 14. 66. 69.</note> at a silly Damsels speech, charging him to be of Christs company.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another mark like to this, is, if we be firm and upright under the crosse. If affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions alter us not: for troubles and crosses will dishonour the integrity of our hearts. Look how we stand affected in them, if firm, then no doubt but we are right. If we can say with King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in<note place="margin">2 King. 20. 3.</note> truth, and with a perfect heart: this upheld him when he was sick even unto death; but <hi>e contra,</hi> if the heart be not sound, then in any crosse, it melts within us like wax, as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>Psalm</hi> 22. 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we derest sin in our selves, and punish it no lesse in our selves then others. <hi>Judah</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen 38. 24.</note> at the first in the case of <hi>Thamar,</hi> cried, Bring her away, let her be burnt; but upon<note place="margin">26.</note> further consideration, when it came to be his own case, there was a sudden alteration, she was more righteous then I. This is much like that the Heathen man said of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> and his fellow, that they did <hi>odisse tyrannum,</hi> but not <hi>tyrannidem,</hi> they hated the tyrant, but not the tyranny: whereas a sound heart hates sin most of all in it self, even the least sin as we see in the Apostle when he cried out, O wretched man that I<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The last is somewhat hard. If we can with confidence say those two last verses of the pialmist, Search me, O Lord, and know my heart, try me, and know my<note place="margin">psal. 139. 23, 24.</note> thoughts, and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead mein the way everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If any dare take this upon him, and can speak it truely not deceiving himself, his heart is upright in him: but a gentler tryal then this is, if a man can say in four particular cases, as he in another place, if there be any wickednesse in my hands, &amp;c. let the enemy persecute my soul, &amp;c. And when we with communing with our own hearts privately, can say, as my heart hath been upright with thee,<note place="margin">7. 3.</note> so I desire in my last gasp to be comforted by thee, O Lord, and to be holpen in my<note place="margin">5.</note> greatest need. In these cases a man may perceive whether his heart be sound,<note place="margin">4. 4.</note> or not.</p>
                  <p>And this according to the sixth rule stayeth not in our selves, but desires to have it in others also, with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who prayed for the Philippians, that they might be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 10.</note> And so did the friends of <hi>Job,</hi> though they took a wrong course in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, yet they were right in this, that they had a desire to make <hi>Jobs</hi> heart upright. Thus far of integrity.</p>
                  <p>One point more rests to be handled within the last general Proposition, and<note place="margin">Perseverance.</note> that is, <hi>Non habebis,</hi> Thou shalt not have. The observation is, that it is set down in the future tense, which implies perseverance; and this is the knitting up of all. It standeth first in the text, <hi>non habebis,</hi> and <hi>non erunt,</hi> thou shalt not have, and there shall not be, but in order of handling it hath the last place, because it is the shutting up of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:59534:112"/>
The words, <hi>Non habebis</hi> must not be answered with <hi>non habeo,</hi> or <hi>non habui,</hi> but with <hi>non habebo,</hi> I will have no other gods; and this is perseverance. This is a greater matter then many do imagine: <hi>fui, sum,</hi> and <hi>ero</hi> are distinctions of the three times.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. For <hi>fui;</hi> it is certain, that whosoever shall consider what he hath been, will be brought into a melancholick and sad passion. <hi>S. Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>Recordare praeterita, &amp; erubesce,</hi> it will confound a man to remember what he hath done.</item>
                     <item>2. For <hi>sum.</hi> Peradventure there my be some comfort, inregard that we endeavour and strive to obtain.</item>
                     <item>3. But howsoever it stands with us for the present, our comfort depends chiefly upon <hi>ero,</hi> what we shall be; and if we persevere not in good, <hi>ero</hi> must needs be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: for a man to consider in what case he may be hereafter, and <hi>considerare novissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> to think upon his end: whether God may not forsake him, if he be not careful to persevere on his part, as he hath done others, that have been for the present in as good and peradventure better case then he is, but were not careful to endeavour, and to use the means required on their part, to persevere, and therefore were left of God, and returned with the dog to their vomit: therefore <hi>non habebis</hi> is a sharp and strict command, and to be looked to.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In the common conveyances at Law, there is, <hi>Habendum &amp; tenendum</hi> to have and to hold; we have formerly seen <hi>Quid habendum,</hi> what we were to have, now we are to see <hi>Quid tenendum,</hi> what we must hold and keep. It falls naturally into the last place by due order. 1. First because (as the Heathen say) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, wisdom or knowledge is the beginning of vertue: but constancy and<note place="margin">In Epist.</note> perseverance, is <hi>virtutis apex,</hi> the pitch and perfection of vertue, and as <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Perseverantia est unica filia summi Reg is, finis virtutum, earumque consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio,</hi> perseverance is the onely daughter of the great King, the end and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all vertues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, because all other vertues are preserved by this, or (to use the Apostles<note place="margin">Col. 4. 6.</note> phrase) seasoned with this salt. As God set <hi>David</hi> over Israel by a covenant of salt, that is, by an everlasting covenant, and no sacrifice was under the Law without salt, to shew, that as the covenant is perpetual on Gods part, so ought the condition to be on ours, by perseverance, and thereby is known the truth of our obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which an hypocrite may go for a true Christian. <hi>S. Bernard</hi> calleth it, <hi>totius boni repositorium &amp; virtus,</hi> the place where all good is preserved and kept; and the strength and vertue of all other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because as there is in every vertue a resemblance or conformity in us to some attribute of God, as in our knowledge to his wisdom, in our belief to his truth, in our fear to his justice, in our love to his mercy, in our integrity to his ubiquity, so in this of perseverance to his eternity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because God is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end, which is his book of perseverance. So must we persevere according to our <hi>quandiu,</hi> that is, till we die, <hi>usque ad mortem,</hi> and not onely to natural but even to violent death. The Apostle hath another <hi>usque, us<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> ad sanguinem,</hi> unto blood, and so his own resolution was, (not onely <hi>usque advincula</hi>) not to be bound onely, but <hi>usque ad mortem,</hi> to die for the Name<note place="margin">Acts 21. 13.</note> of the Lord Jesus. This must be our <hi>Omega.</hi> Wheresoever our <hi>Alpha</hi> is placed, this must be our <hi>Omega,</hi> our eternity. Otherwise as <hi>S. Bern.</hi> saith, <hi>Quid levitate cum aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate?</hi> there is no fellowship between God and man, without perseverance. Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy hath no congruity with eternity.</p>
                  <p>On the other side backsliding is condemned. Our nature is so corrupt, that, as in the last affection we spake of [Sincerity] we have a desire to seem rather then to be, because it is easier, and we naturally love ease: so here we have a desire of falling away, or starting back like a bow, like a deceitful bow, to which the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles<note place="margin">Psalm 78. 57.</note> the Israelites. We are naturally like a bow, which being almost bent, and let go never so little, starts back. Or, as the Apostle no lesse excellently, we are apt<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 9.</note>

It is God by the Prophet that saith, when a righteous man<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 24.</note> turneth from his righteousnesse, &amp;c. all the righteousnesse that he hath done shall not be mentioned.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Again, as it is with faith, our first covenant is, <hi>nisi credideritis non stabiliemini,</hi> if ye will not beleeve, ye shall not be established: so in this, if thou continue not,<note place="margin">Esay 7. 9.</note> thou shalt be cut off.

As in a building, a house is not said to be finished, until the last stone be laid and the building covered.</p>
                  <p>That which is here commanded is perseverance, set down in <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. 13. and<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 42. 25. 5. 25. 43.</note> in many other places: metaphorically it is called watching till the Bridegroom come, and so the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> falling away, or defection, is called sleeping in the parable of the Virgins, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Perseverance is distinguished from patience thus: the object of patience being <hi>tristitia crucis,</hi> the sorrow of the crosse, and of the other <hi>taedium diurnitatis,</hi> the wearinesse of continuance. It is called perseverance in regard of the length of time, and the tediousnesse which accompanieth it, which must be overcome. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in regard of the necessity of it, we are to take the Apostles caveat, Take heed<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 12, 13</note> lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily, while it is called to day. And this <hi>hodie S.

                  <p>And these are of two sorts; for either they fall quite away at once, without any signe of returning; or else in the second place they are such as may be compared<note place="margin">Exod. 6 &amp;c.</note> to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> from the 7. of Exodus to the 11. of whom we read, that he had many beginnings, and many interruptions: come a shower of rain or hail, or any new plague, he crieth, the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are sinners, and then pray for me, that this plague may be taken from the land, and I will let you go. So there are some, that have many beginnings. every day a beginning, and never go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. It is fitly called <hi>Religio lateritia,</hi> a religion of bricks, or that cometh by fits, and continues not, Such are like that beast in the Revelation, that had 7. heads many<note place="margin">Revel. 12. 3.</note> beginnings, but never go on to bring any thing to perfection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second sort are such as set themselves out of malice to oppose the truth which they formerly professed, with a resolution never to returne again which is high Apostacy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Forasmuch as patience is joyned with perseverance; one of the best means to<note place="margin">Means of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance.</note> attain this duty is, to cast before hand, to foresee what troubles may and will befall us, that we may be armed against them, and how long the time may be. It may be the Lord may come in the first watch, it may be not till the second, nay, not till the third: though sooner, or later, yet we must not be found a sleep, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever<note place="margin">Luke 12. 38.</note> he comes. God commanded <hi>joshua,</hi> and reiterates it often, to provide and<note place="margin">Josh. 1. 6, 7, 8, 9,</note> strengthen himself against all crosses which should happen to him before he came to the land of promise. <hi>Esto fortis,</hi> be strong, faint not. And it is the Apostles counsel, be strong in the Lord. So that this fore-arming our selves against the assaults of<note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 10,</note> our enemies is a very good means to make us hold out in times dangerous or difficult.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we consider with our selves, what our own judgement is, when it is not our own case, what account we make of things that continue not. A Christian is compared to a tree, that brings fruit in season, whose leaf doth not wither &amp;c. Now what account do we make of fruit thats nipt or bitten in the blossom, or thats wind shaken, or that is rotten or wormeaten, that cannot last till the gathering, or keep if it be gathered. What account doth the husbandman make of a morning cloud, that vanisheth, and promiseth no showres, or of the seed that falls among stones, which may grow up for a time, but when the sun ariseth, is parched, and withereth, and never comes to perfection, the reaper filleth not his hand, nor the mower his bosom. Such fruit is all our obedience, if we persevere not, like a morning cloud Hos. 6. 4. Or like seed sown upon stony ground. In all other things we prefer that which is permenant: vessels of wood or pewter, before glasses or earthen ware, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So that by our own practise we condemne our selves, if we be not carefull to persevere and hold out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unlesse we persevere, all that Christ did for us, and all that we do for him, or our selves is in vain: now no man desires to do any thing in vain, to beat the winde. This vanity of all may be seen in two respects.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In respect of Christ, we make all that he did in vain. How intollerable is it, that so great a person as the Son of God should come down from heaven, be born and live amongst us, and die so base and ignominious a death, and al in vain: yet we frustrate al, if we continue not in grace to the end. He persevered to the end, went through all the work required for our salvation: The cup was not suffered to passe from him, but he drank it up clear, even to the dregs of it. This was the price of his labours, our perseverance in that estate he obtained for us; wherein if we continue not, this is more grief to him, then it was to suffer; <hi>Labor irritus supra omnem laborem,</hi> to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain is more to him, then all the torments he suffered, though they wrought so upon him, that he cryed out, <hi>Eli, Eli, &amp;c.</hi> My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me. This should move us to persevere.</item>
                     <item>2. In respect of our selves: all we have done or suffered will be in vain, if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe not if after we have escaped the pollution of the world, we be intangled again,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59534:114"/>
we are like to the dog that returnes to his vomit and to the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire, our former washing was in vain. Under the law, if any<note place="margin">2 pet. 2. 20. 22.</note> Nazarites did separate themselves by a vow, and devote themselves more specially<note place="margin">Numb 6. 6.</note> to Gods service, if they did touch any dead body, though it were upon the last day of their separation, they were to begin all their dayes anew; for all that was done before was counted as nothing. This was a figure, the truth whereof we read in Ezekiel. If the righteous man forsake his righteousnes, and commit the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the wicked &amp;c. Look whensoever he gives over his righteousnesse then, even then at that hour, all he hath done formerly, shall be forgotten, it shall be, as if he had not done a righteous deed. Therefore if we will not lose the fruit of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer labours, we must look to our perseverance. Nay further, not onely Christ and we shall lose our pains, but a worse thing will happen to us; for when the evil spirit is cast out, if he come again, and finde the house swept and garnished, but empty, he will not onely enter again, but he will bring with him seven spirits more worse then himself, and then the end of that man will be worse then the beginning, hisestate is much worse, even in a manner without hope of recovery.</item>

                     </gap> seed; the mortal seed may move a hearer for the present, but the immortal seed continues with him, and works perseverance in him. Thus a man may judge whether he feare God, or onely the judgement, when he is humbled under a judgement, if he feare God for himself, the fear will continue, if it be onely for the judgement, it will vanish when the judgement is over, as we see in <hi>Pharoah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though we have no certain notes of perseverance, yet there are some proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble marks and signes, whereby we may judge of the likelyhood of our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is, if we feel a desire in our selves with the Apostle, to presse toward the mark not looking back but going forward; if we consider not how long we<note place="margin">phil. 3. 14.</note> have already continued, nor slatter our selves of our lives past, but bend our whole study and endeavour how we may go on, and hold out; for as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, sufficit, defecisti,</hi> if we once say, we have done enough, we are then fallen back. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> observes upon that of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, that the Angels ascended<note place="margin">In Gen. 28. 12</note> and descended, but none stood still; which he applies to the life of a christian, who mustnever stand still, and gives this reason. <hi>Quando desinis esse melior, incipis esse deterior.</hi> when we leave being better, we begin to be worse. For our nature is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59534:114"/>
like a bow, which if you bende it not forward till the string take hold, it will start back of its own accord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A second and a better, is, if we finde our selves more fruitfull in good works, when more years have taken hold of us. It was the mark of the Chuch of Thyatira,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 19.</note> that her last works were more then her first. When we abound more and moer as<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 9.</note> the Apostle speaks, The Psalmist saith, they that be planted in the house of the Lord<note place="margin">Psal. 92. 13. 14. 84. 7.</note> shall still bring forth fruit in their age, and go from strength to strength.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The last is, if we persevere in time of trouble and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, if we flie not when the wolfe comes, if with <hi>Eliiah</hi> we be not afraid of the fiery horses, nor of the fiery charet. If persecutions and crosses make us not waver, then we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade<note place="margin">2 king 2. 11.</note> our selves, that our case is like to <hi>Jobs,</hi> of whom God said to Sathan, he holdeth fast his integrity though thou movedst me against him without a cause to destroy him; and that God will say the same of us.</p>
                  <p>The last or sixth rule is, to procure it in others. And herein we must follow the<note place="margin">Job. 2. 3.</note> Apostles counsel, strengthen those that are weake. Lift up the hands which hang down<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 12.</note> and the feeble knees. It is set down from an act of piety in <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Act. 11. 23. 13. 43.. 14. 22.</note> the people, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord; and of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who perswaded the religious Jews, to continue in the<note place="margin">Ezech. 34. 4.</note> grace of God; and in another place, they confirmed the disciples, and exhorted<note place="margin">9. 4.</note> them to continue in the faith &amp;c. As on the other side it is sett down by the holy Ghost, as a mark of an evil shepheard, and of bad sheep, not to strengthen the weake nor to binde up that which was broken, nor to reduce those that stray. As the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of vineger was Christs <hi>consummatum est,</hi> so is perseverance the <hi>consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The general parts of this Commandment. 1. The precept. 2 The sanction. The precept is negative, forbids Idolatry, and implies the affirmative. 1. That God must be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped as he requires. 2. That reverence must be shewed in the performance. Reasons why this and the fourth Commandment are larger then the rest. Reasons for the affirmative and negative part. Addition 13. That the making of images was absolutely forbidden the Jews, and in that respect the precept was positive and reached onely unto them. Addition 14. Whether all voluntary or free worship be forbidden under the name of will-worship.</p>
               </argument>
               <head>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THe Commandments of the first Table concern the worship of God Inward, and outward; of which, the first commandment containeth the inward duties, and the three last the outward. The outward are either continual, or to be performed on a set or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time or day: or are either private or publike. That which is for a set day, and publike is required in the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The other which are continual and private, concerne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the outward gesture in <hi>honore,</hi> (for, <hi>reverentia exhibetur per gestus,</hi> the gesture dicovereth our reverence) contained in this second Commandment: or <hi>in Laude,</hi> in praise, which is exhibited by the tongue or speech, in the Third. Or else they concern either the manner of worship, in this second: or the end of it in the Third.</p>
               <p>This Commandment which concernes the manner of our outward worship, and how we are to behave our selves in it conteines, 1. A precept, set down by way of a prohibition. 2, A Sanction or Penalty annexed. Or (if you will) a Charge, and a Penalty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prohibition, in these words <hi>Non facies tibi sculptile,</hi> not to make images, to worship them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The sanction, which is brought in by way of reason, in these, <hi>Ego enim Deus tuus sum zelotypus,</hi> for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God. It is in this, as in the laws of Princes, after they have signified their command, what they would have done, or not done, there is added. <hi>Quisecus faxit punietur,</hi> he that shall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseagainst this law, shall be punished. So here he that breaks this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God will visite &amp;c. which is the penalty, or <hi>sanctio precepti,</hi> that part of the precept, that containeth the corrective, shewing how they shall be corrected, that will not be directed by this law.</p>
               <p>This Commandment, as it prohibiteth Idolatry directly, so implicitly it enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">1.</note> the true worship of God, prescribing the manner how that worship is to be performed. May we not worship or serve false Gods? then there is a true God to be served and worshiped, we are not masterlesse men, we are under the authority of another (as this Centurion) we have a master, there is a God (certainly) to be<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 8.</note> served.</p>
               <p>Concerning the performance of this worship, two things are commanded. first, God will have <hi>modum a se praescriptum,</hi> our service must be done in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59534:115"/>
himself prescribes. 2. And secondly, <hi>Reverentiam exhibitam.</hi> He requires at our hands, a reverend behaviour in the performance of it.</p>
               <p>If we mark the other eight Commandments well, we shall finde them far short in words of this and the fourth. So that these two may fitly be called <hi>Precepta copiosa,</hi> Commandments fully expressed. Statutes at large. And this was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause, there was good reason they should be so. For unlesse it were these two of the first Table, and the last of the second concerning Concupiscence, there was none of the Commandments unknown to the Heathen. The outward worship of God, and the day set apart for his worship, they had corrupted most of all, these Laws were most obliterated among them. They took some order for the inward worship of God, as <hi>Solon. Ad Deos caste adeunto,</hi> let men come to God with pure mindes. And the keeping of Oaths was severely exacted among them. Of these two Laws they took notice. So in this point of the inward worship of God we agree in many things with Turks and Pagans; but the outward service of God is it, which makes the difference between us, and will ever distinguish the true Church from the faise, Christs Church from Satans Synagogue. And thus we see the Reason, why God did so enlarge these two Commandments, because they were in most danger to be neglected. We will now come to the opening of the Commandment.</p>
               <p>It is said before, that the Commandments make use of Synechdoche, that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one fault include many, that are <hi>homogenea</hi> of the same kinde. So that in each Commandment the principal or general sin is named, and the rest implied; for if every particular sin should be mentioned which were within the compasse of the prohibition, the Commandment would be infinite. Now that which is forbidden principally in this, is not meerly the making of Images; for Images, or pictures are not absolutely prohibited, either here, or in any other place of Scripture: for painting and graving are warrantable and profitable Arts, and the gifts of God. We see <hi>Beza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leel</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 31. 2.</note> commended by God himself for his wisdom and understanding in them:<note place="margin">35. 30, 31.</note> and the reason is, because these Arts conduce to the preservation of the memory of things past, as also for the delight of the minde. <hi>Non Simulacrum, non Imago dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Amos 5. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>sed non facies tibi,</hi> saith <hi>S. Jerome.</hi> An image or the likenesse of a thing is not condemned, but the Emphasis or Energie of the Commandment is in, <hi>Non facies tibi bi,</hi> thou shalt not make to thy self <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Invented and will-worship, devised by<note place="margin">Col. 2. 23.</note> man, not agreeable to the general rules prescribed by God, but contrary to what is by God prescribed. Like to that of <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was commanded to destroy the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 21.</note> and spared the king, &amp;c. his excuse was, The people took of the spoil to sacrifice to the Lord. They would have a worship of their own with a direct breach of Gods command. Whereas God had formerly told them, Whatsoever thing I command you, observe to do it, thou shalt not adde thereto, nor diminish from it, and in that<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 10.</note> particular had commanded them to spare nothing of Amalek, but to destroy all.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the judgement of this learned Author, whith whom many expositors<note place="margin">Addition 11.</note> agree, it is the opinion of divers learned men, both Protestants and others, that the very<note place="margin">Of forbidding the making of Images.</note> making or having of any graven image of any living creature was forbidden the Jews in this Commandment, and that therefore this precept as well as the fourth, is partly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive obliging onely the Jews, and not wholly moral or perpetual. The prohibition is general, not onely for worshipping, but for making any. <hi>Deut. 4. 16.</hi> for the general opinion of the Heathen was, that some divine power was included in their images, after they were consecrated by some magical superstitious rites, as appears in Tertul. <hi>de idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, Minutius Faelix, Cyprian de Idolorum vanitate,</hi> and others, as also by the Jewish writers, <hi>Aben-Esra, Maimonides, Kimchi, &amp;c.</hi> and hence are those strange relations of what was done by those images mentioned in Heathen writers, as that divers of them did speak, as <hi>Memnons</hi> statue in Egypt, the Images of <hi>Juno, Moreta, Fortuna, Silvanus, &amp;c.</hi> mentioned by <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> and others by <hi>Trismeg. in Dialogo,</hi> and to this that place of <hi>Zach, 10. 2.</hi> may infer. God therefore, that his people might not come neer the corrupt customes of the Heathen, and to prevent the danger of Idolatry the more, as also that they might the better conceive the invisible and spiritual nature of God, forbade, not onely the worshipping, but even the making of such images of living creatures, as also of the starres (because they also have their motion) as most dangerous to induce men to Idolatry in those times, and so the custome (which is
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59534:116"/>
the best expositor of laws) among the Jews was against all use of such represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as appears in <hi>Josephus, in Decal. explic. &amp; Hist. Antiq. lib. 17.</hi> Maimonides, Tacitus, Leo, Modena, and others: yet though this were prohibited the people, God might make exceptions in this, as he did in other precepts which were positive, as in erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the brazen serpent, and in placing the cherubims upon the ark, and in the Holy of Holies, before which it was lawful to worship God, without Gods special appointment had not been warrantable: and that <hi>Solomon</hi> had the like warrant for the lions and oxen that upheld the brazen Laver is probable, or else that this was a step to those sins which he fell into afterward, as <hi>Josephus</hi> and other Jewish writers think. As for pictures, or such representations by painting, (they being not so apt to nourish the opinion of an inherent diety in them, as in statues, or <hi>imagines extantes</hi> were) the making or using them (if no divine honour were given them) was not absolutely prohibited, and therefore we finde them used among the Jews, as appears by their banners and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, wherein were the representations of diverse creatures; yet in other places, (though not here) they seem to be forbidden, if they were used by Idolaters about their false worship. <hi>Levit. 26. 1. &amp; Numb. 33. 25.</hi> See <hi>Scal. in posthumis ex Cosmogr. Arab. &amp; Grot. in explic. Decal. p. 33, 34 &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as God forbade the Jews the making of Images, and commanded them to break them in pieces, if any were made, <hi>Exod. 34. 13. Numb. 33. 52. Deuter. 7. 5.</hi> so if they came into any strange countrey, where they had no power to demolish them, he forbids not onely their religious worship, which is intrinsecally evill, but even all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verentiall gesture of the body before an image, by bowing, kneeling, &amp;c. though it were with no intent to honour the image; for (to bow to them and worship them) is all one, with (to bow or worship before them) as the Jewish Doctors expound, and may appear by collation of <hi>Matth. 4. 9.</hi> with <hi>Luke 4. 7.</hi> in the Greek, and <hi>Jer. 22. 9.</hi> with 2. <hi>Chronicles 25. 14.</hi> and <hi>Leviticus 26. 1.</hi> in the Hebrew; not that it is simply evil to bow or kneel before them, when it is with no relation to them, but because God would prevent all occasions and shews of complying with the Heathen, and therefore forbade his people many things, not evil in themselves, because they were practised by the Heathen. So much then of this precept as forbids things morally evil, or forbidden by any law of Christ, obliges us as well as the Jews: but what was purely positive, and not continued by Christ, obliged them onely.</p>
               <p>This invented or will-worship, <hi>Cultus arbitrarius,</hi> hath two specious things in it, as the Apostle saith.<note place="margin">Col. 2. 23.</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first is a kinde of wisdom, and carrieth with it a trim shew thereof: when a man shall be thought so wise, as that he is able to devise and invent a worship for God, especially when men consider not what God hath already prescribed, whereby their rites prove contrary to what he hath appointed, and so they will be wiser then God.</item>
                  <item>2. The second is, a shew of humility: when a man will be so humble, as not onely to prostrate himself before God, but to bow down to an Image, Saint, Angel, or the like. But these howsoever they carry a shew of wisdom, and humility, yet are they no wayes for us to use: if we entend to be exempt from the penalty, of this Commandment.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Although, all will-worship, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59534:116"/>
hath been to prescribe and order severall things in Gods Worship, which no peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and holy men ever found fault with, provided, that they were agreable to those general rules of morall worship required by God, and no wayes repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to those rites by him appointed, but rather subservient to them, and contained nothing either impious and forbidden, or vain and ridiculous; nor the observance of them preferred before the commandments of God, or made equal to them; but a difference observed between things of immediate divine institution, and those of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical institution: to adde to Gods institution any thing as from God is forbidden, Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy <hi>12. 10.</hi> but to adde something for the more decent and orderly performance of what God hath apointed, and to observe the same as an ecclesiastical institution, is no where forbidden, but rather commanded in al those texts, that require us to hear the Church, and to give obedience to her; and to observe this is also to obey God, who hath given his Church power to ordain such things: and that that place in <hi>Colos. 2. 23.</hi> condemns not all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary or free worship, no more then it doth humility, and chastening or keeping under the body which are joyned therewith, but rather that it makes for it, hath been lately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by juditious and learned Divines; and by one in a full tract upon this subject of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship; for the Apostle there condemning certain Jewish and Pythagorean observances about touching, tasting, &amp;c. saith <hi>ver. 23.</hi> that they had a shew of wisdom, if due cautions were observed, <hi>viz</hi> if they were freely and voluntarily undertaken, not as necessary to salvation, and without rejecting what God had made, and if they were used in humility or modesty not condemning others which used them not, and if they sought thereby onely to keep under the flesh. The contrary to all which those Pythagoreans and Jews practised. By which exposition, which I take to be the most true, it is plain, that the Apostle is so far from condemning all voluntary or will-worship, that he rather approves and commends it, and condemns their forbearance of meats, and other things, because it was not freely or voluntarily undertaken, but as a thing necessary to salvation, &amp;c, See <hi>Grotius in</hi> Colos. 2. 23. <hi>Et votum pro pace. p. 100. 101. 102. 103.

               <p>The affirmative part of this Commandment included in the prohibition, <hi>S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 7. 44.</note> in the Acts, and the Authour to the Hebrews after him citeth out of the Law;<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 5.</note> where <hi>Moses</hi> receiving order how to build the Tabernacle, was admonished by<note place="margin">Exod. 25 40.</note> God, to make it according to the pattern precisely, as it was shewed him in the Mount.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because God (after the delivery of the moral law) declared to him the particulars<note place="margin">Vers. 40.</note> concerning the outward worship.</p>

therefore take heed that they attempted not to make any likenesse of any thing as you may read there at large, for if God had bin willing they should have made any, certailny he would have represented himself to them in some forme or shape, when he came unto the mount. Let us take heed therefore, that we take not upon us, to frame to our selves any representation of God, and to make Images to his dishonour. It is the nature of faith, to beleeve things not visible; and therefore to make invisible things become visible in religion is the next way to dishonour God, and to overthrow faith, and consequently religion it self. Our Saviour tells<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> the woman of Samaria, that the time was coming, when the true worshippers<note place="margin">John 4. 21.</note> should worship God in spirit, and truth, and in Images there is no truth, but <hi>

                  <item>2. The second was, in <hi>memoriam defunctorum</hi> to preserve the memory of their deceased friends.

               <p>Now after, in the pacee of the church, there fell out two other causes</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. First wealth. When the Christians, after the persecution, began to grow rich, they were desirous that their churches should be as rich as themselves. To this purpose,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> there is extant an Epistle in the second counsel of Nice. of a noble man of Syria to one <hi>Nilus.</hi> This great man had built a Church for the Christians, and not content, that it should remain onely with white walls, determined to have all Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures painted upon them, and acquainting <hi>Nilus</hi> with his intent, was perswaded by him to content himself with the simplenesse of the Christian Churches in other places: but if he would needs have it painted, I think (saith he) it were best to paint the story of the Bible, for that will be more seemly, and better then the pictures of birds and beasts, &amp;c. So that one occasion was, that in those times, by reason of their wealth they desired to please their eyes.</item>
                  <item>2. The other cause may be, the idlenesse, absence, or ignorance of their Pastors, (as it is said in the same place of <hi>Paulinus</hi> Bishop of Nola in Campania, who having occasion to travail into Syria and Egypt, and having none to preach to his people, till his return, he thought good (because he would have something to teach them in his absence) to paint the whole story of the Bible on the walls of his Church; so that their preachers were none other but painted walls. But this is no way to be commended in him, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> proved accordingly. For it fell out, that forwant of better teachers, the people became ignorant: and because their Pastors became but
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59534:119"/>
dumb Images, therefore dumb Images became their Pastors. And thus much for the four occasions of introducing Images.</item>

               <p>This Commandment was divided in the beginning into 1. a Charge, 2. and a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. The charge was two fold, 1. <hi>Non facies,</hi> thou shalt not make.

Or secondly, to remove all occasion of quarrelling, God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his meaning, by the word or common name <hi>Temunah,</hi> or <hi>Col-temunah,</hi> all likenesse, or similitude whatsoever, which condemneth the Metaphysicall notions abstracted from all matter, and in the matter, all kinde of similitudes, either Images, Idols true or phantasticall, are comprehended under the word <hi>Temunah,</hi> as <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> and <hi>Pagnine</hi> testifie. And for further exposition of this, there was added, the glosse of <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ, one out of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and the other<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 12.</note> out of Saint <hi>John,</hi> concerning the general restraint of this with diverse other<note place="margin">John 4. 2. &amp;c.</note> reasons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the Exemplar or pattern, we shewed, that the prohibition was necessary, because theres nothing but the brain of man had abused it, to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God: as appeared in diverse things, which men worshipped in Heaven, in Earth, and in the Waters.</p>
               <p>Thence we came to the particular question about Images, wherein we handled three points, 1. what might be alledged out of the Scripture for them, 2. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what reasons there were for them, 3. and lastly, by what means, and upon what occasions, they were brought into the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the first. In the Rhemish Testament, they can finde no one place in the New Testament for them, but one, and that in the Hebrews; that over the Ark<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 5.</note> were the Cherubims, and that is taken out of the Old Testament. So that they<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 18.</note> must needs confesse, there be none in the New. And in the Old, this of the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,<note place="margin">Numb. 21. 8.</note> and that of the fiery Serpent, is all they can shew for it. Unto both which our answer may be as before, and especially that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath, that this is general, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thou shalt not make any similitude. They are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and prerogatives which belong onely to God, which we may do, as well as the Israelites, if we have the like command with them. <hi>Generi per speciem non derogatur,</hi> the species can derogate nothing from the genus. If they can shew any prescript, or command for worshipping of Images, let them worship them.</p>
               <p>Again the ends of both those examples, were otherwise then theirs: for the end of the Cherubim, was not to represent God, but onely to be in a place of<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 22.</note> the Tabernacle, from whence God would give all his answers. And the Brazen Serpent, the end of it was to heal those, which were stung with fiery ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents: therefore these two places make nothing for the worshipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Besides we see, that when the brazen serpent began to be abused, how <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> dealt with it, He brake in pieces the brazen serpent, which <hi>Moses</hi> had<note place="margin">2 Kings 18. 4.</note> made, saith the text: which sheweth plainly, what little affinity it had with the Commandement. And so had the Cherubims been used, if they had been abused by the people: but God had taken order for that, for none could come unto them but the High Priest, and he but once a year.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Reasons, they were said to be 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the affection of sense,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 18.</note> which was not onely in the Israelites, but in the Apostles, and in <hi>Moses</hi> himself: I beseech thee (saith he to God) shew me thy glory: but he obtained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the sight of his back parts: But this carnality is condemned<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 3.</note> by the Apostle, not onely in respect of the people of God, whom this affection caused to draw all thinges to Idolatry, but even of the Heathen also.<note place="margin">De Civ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59534:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by bringing in of Images, and his reason was, <hi>Deos facile posse in simulachrorum stoliditate contemni;</hi> the gods might soon grow into contempt, by the foolishnesse of Images.</p>
               <p>We Likewise shewed, that <hi>nimium,</hi> too much, was a broad way to superstition, and that it was a vain assertion of theirs, that there can be no <hi>nimium in religione,</hi> no superfluity in religion. Against which opinion, <hi>S.

               <p n="3">3. The last was, by what means and occasions, when, and by whom Images were<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> introduced into the Church.

               <p>The occasions were four. 1. The policy of the Hereticks, to make the Heathen more favourable and inclinable to them. 2. Extraordinary grief for friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. 3. The wealth of the Church. 4. The idlenesse of the Ministers. These were said to be the causes of Images. So much for the recapitulation.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOw, for the more full handling of this Question, let us see what can be said further for Images, out of the ancient Fathers and Councils. Their Fathers are either true, or counterfeit. Their true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, <hi>S. Basile</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> only. And that saying of <hi>Basile</hi> which deceived <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">Basil.</note> is this, That the honor due to the Abstract, redoundeth to the Pattern: and this speech <hi>Aquinas</hi> urgeth for honour to be done to Images. But he speaketh there of this Conclusion, that Christ is to be worshipped equally with the Father, out of the Hebrews, where Christ is called, <hi>Character substantiae Patris,</hi> the expresse Image of the Father; and such an Image we acknowledge must be honoured; and<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> if they can shew us such another Image among theirs, as Christ was of the Father, we will accept of it, and worship it.</p>
               <p>The second that is urged, is <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <note place="margin">Addition 13. Of S. Chrysost. Liturgy.</note> 
                  <hi>as all the other ancient Liturgies have been altered since their first composing, but to deny the substance of it to be</hi> Chrysostomes, <hi>is contrary to the testimony and practise of all the Greek Church, and therefore was never intended by this learned Author, who was a great honourer of Antiquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have but one Council for them: which is the second Nicene Council, the gatherer whereof, was <hi>Irene</hi> the Empresse. She was a heathen borne, daughter to an Emperour of Tartary, nouzled up in Paganisme from her birth, and afterwards matching with <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth, Father to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour, she was converted, and after the Emperour <hi>Leo's</hi> death, in the minority of her son, ruled with him, and called this Council. <hi>Constantine</hi> at the first seemed not to oppose her, but after, when he came to some understanding, he refused to admit of Images, but she being too potent for him, cast him in prison, and put out both his eyes; whereby you may see, that she was a woman without natural<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 31.</note> affection.</p>
               <p>The chief men at this Council, were <hi>Tarasius</hi> Patriarch of Constantinople, and <hi>John Legate</hi> of the East Churches. The first had bin a Lay man and a Courtier, all his life, till a year before the Council cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and (as he confest of himself) never intended matter of religion till a yeer before: and sor <hi>John,</hi> we need no other witnesse for him, but the testimony of the Patriarch of Antioch, who sent him
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59534:120"/>
to the Council, which was, that he was a good devout man, but of no great learning. The like may be said of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and <hi>Constantine,</hi> who ruled the Council: and it may be truely averred, that in any one Council, there were never such a sort of simple men, in respect of their gifts, nor more evil disposed in regard of their boldnesse, and attempts, presuming above their gifts. There is not in all <hi>Durands rationale scripturae</hi> worse alledged, nor more fabulous narrations in the Legend, then in this second Council of Nice. There may be gathered out of it, ten absurd conclusions: and that which maketh up all, there were in it such errours, as they themselves could not defend. In the fifth Action there is this conclusion, That Angels have bodily substances: and in another, that Christ was born in the five thousand and first year of the world: in another, that <hi>Honorius</hi> the Pope was a Monothelite, and therefore an <hi>Anathema</hi> denounced against him; for which the Romanists cry out, that the Council was corrupt in all those places. Lastly, the Council is ranker on their side, and sayes more then they would. <hi>Non sunt duae adorationes, sed una &amp; eadem: adoratur prototypus &amp; Idolum,</hi> the adorations of Idols and prototypes are not two but one adoration. And a worse then this, <hi>Idem Imaginibus honor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur, qui &amp; beatae Trinitati,</hi> the same honour is due to Images, as is to the bles. sed Trinity.</p>
               <p>It is true the words of the Council are so recited <hi>in capitulam Caroli magni, lib. 3.<note place="margin">Addition 14. Of the second Council of Nice.</note> cap. 17.</hi> and that the Synods of Frankford and Paris, thereupon condemned that opinion, and that justly, if they had held it: but it is as true, that they were deceived by a false translation of the Acts of the second Nicene Council into Latine, wherein the words were so rendred, when as indeed the words are, as appears in the Greek, <hi>Actione tertia Synodi: suscipiens &amp;cum honore amplectans sanctas &amp; venerabiles imagines: adorationem vero latriae, soli superstantiali ac vivificae Trinitati defero,</hi> which words are directly contrary to what was charged upon them by those Synods.</p>
               <p>Now what may be said on our parts, is this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, <hi>Aelius Lampridius,</hi> a Heathen Historian, reports; that the Emperour <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> in his affection to the Christians, built a Temple for them, (according to the manner of the Romane Temples) which was bare, without ornaments, having a roof to defend them from the injury of the weather onely, which notwithstanding was afterward denyed to them by the Senate, and grew into such contempt among the Heathen, that thereof arose a proverb among them, that if any of the Gentiles<note place="margin">in vita Adriani</note> built a bare Temple, it was called <hi>Templum Adriani, Adrians</hi> Temple, because it was inornate.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The five Rules of extent for expounding this Commandment. Of the affirmative part of it. In Gods outward worship are two things: 1. the substance: 2. the ceremony. The first consists of 1. Preaching. Addition 15. How preaching is a part of Gods worship. 2. Prayer. 3. Sacraments. Addition 16. The Eucharist considered as a Sacrament and a Sacrifice 4. Discipline.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe first rule is, That not onely that which is here expressed is forbidden, but all <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, things of the same nature, and kinde also; as our own inventions, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting<note place="margin">In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 5.</note> what God commands, or being contrary thereto. <hi>S. Jerome</hi> saith, God saith well, <hi>Quae fecerunt sibi, non quae fecit Deus,</hi> that which they themselves, and not God made. They received them not of God, but they were forgers of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And the rule of the Fathers is, <hi>Idola Ethnicorum exceperunt hereses Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anorum,</hi> the heresies of Christians, which changed and innovated the outward worship of God, succeeded or came in upon the Idols of the Pagans, meaning the external worship of the Hereticks.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:59534:121"/>
2. The second rule reaches <hi>vsque ad cor,</hi> looke to the fountain the heart, that that be not infected. The fancy must be restrained, the conceits that rise in the brain, concerning Gods substance, unreverently attributing to it, a bodily shape, as <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> the Monk did. <hi>Reliquorum praeceptorum concupiscentiae sistendae in Corde, hujus vero secundi in cerebro,</hi> the lusts that breake the other Commandments, are to be stopt and supprest in the heart, but these in the brain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third rule is, that the means which bring in false worship are here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and they are four, whereof we have spoken formerly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth rule is about the signes, for if it be true, as the Apostle hath it,<note place="margin">Jude 23.</note> that we must hate even the garments that are spotted by idols, no question but we must do the like to the pillers, whereon they stand which are defiled as well as the<note place="margin">Deut. 16. 22.</note> garment, for God commanded that there be not so much as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the piller, basis or<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 25.</note> statue raised for them. And in another place God protesteth, that the silver and gold, the materialls whereof they are made, are abomination to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">16. 21.</note> commandeth them, to burn them, lest they be snared with them. Nor must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groves be planted whereby they might have occasion to set them up, for not onely they, but even the high places, whereon they were planted, were abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. and therefore it is, that through the story of the kings, it is laid as an imputation to them, that they digged not down the high places, though they had taken away the Idols. So that these things which seem good of themselves, are condemned, because they had some semblance or shew of symbolizing with the Heathen Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. Therefore are we to have no conceites of our own tending that way, and<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 6. 15. 21.</note> though there might be a good intent in saving the best sheep and oxen, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it came within the compasse of <hi>facis tibi,</hi> when God had expresly forbidden it, therefore God abhorres it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are not onely commanded not to use images to the dishonour of God our selves, but to do our best to hinder others too; not to steale them as <hi>Rachel</hi> did (for that means is not commendable) but to deprive others of them by all lawful<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 19.</note> means as <hi>Jacob</hi> did with the idols among his own houshold which he took and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under an oak. Gen. 34. 4. Had not the altar which the two Tribes and a half erected, bin onely for a Testimonie and remembrance to the Lord, but for sacrifice,<note place="margin">Jer. 22. 26. 27.</note> the other Tribes would have demolished it, or else much blood would have bin shed about it. And thus much for the Negative part of the Commandment what we are prohibited. Now for the Affirmative part of Gods outward worship what we are Commanded.</p>
               <p>Of the affirmative part of this Commandment.<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this is in few words set down by the Apostle. All things must be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Num. 12. 7.</note> to the patterne shewed in the Mount in Gods outward worship. Now as <hi>Moses</hi> had this commendation from God himselfe, that he was faithful in every<note place="margin">Heb 3. 2.</note> point to follow his pattern, so hath Christ also the like commendation. Christ is said<note place="margin">Act. 3. 22. 7. 37.</note> to be, as faithfull as <hi>Moses,</hi> and therefore his Pattern is to be as precisely followed by us. Saint <hi>

Luke 10.</p>
               <p>In the external worship of God, we are to consider two things. 1. The Substance, 2. The Ceremony.<note place="margin">1 pet. 3. 19. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The substance consists of four parts. 1. Preaching. 2. Prayer. 3. Sacraments. 4. Discipline.<note place="margin">Addition 15.</note>

               <p n="1">1. For preaching. It is a substantial and essential part of Gods worship.<note place="margin">whether preaching be properly part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Preaching is a duty of perpetual necessity under the gospel, and may in a general sense be styled a part of Gods worship, as reading the Scriptures, catechizing, and other wayes of instruction may, because by publick declaring Gods will, and setting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

his excellent nature, with his great works and benefits to us, as motives of obedience, some publike honour redounds to God, and therefore the Casuists refer preaching to the duty of publike praising, or lauding God, which is properly a part of Gods worship; as <hi>Reginald. prax. lib. 18. tract. 2. cap. 19.</hi> So <hi>Fileucius</hi> and others; but in a strict and proper sense, it is not part of Gods worship, as Prayer, and Praises are, for the immediate object of these is God, and their immediate end is Gods honour; but the immediate object of preaching are the men to whom we preach, and their instruction how to worship and serve God, is the immediate and proper end of Preaching; and so these differ, as the means and the end.</p>
               <p>Preaching is of great Antiquity. He preached to the spirits that are in prison. 1. Before the Law. <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher. 2. Under the Law. <hi>Moses</hi> enjoyned the Priests<note place="margin">Deut. 31. 13.</note> to gather the people together, men and women, to hear and learn, &amp;c. And<note place="margin">Act. 15. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>S. James</hi> tells us, that <hi>Moses</hi> had in every City them that preached every Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. And the Priests office was, to teach, to burn incense, and to offer sacrifice.<note place="margin">Deut. 33. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the time of the Prophets, Esay speaketh of preaching good tidings, and<note place="margin">Esa. 61. 1.</note> the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> was sent to preach to Ninive. And the prophet <hi>David</hi> professed,<note place="margin">Jon. 3. 2.</note> that he had preached the righteousnes of God in the great congregation. His Son<note place="margin">psal. 40. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> also was entituled by the name Preacher.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This continued to the time of the second Temple. <hi>Ezra</hi> stood upon a pulpit of<note place="margin">Neh. 8. 4.</note> wood, and preached to the people. 5. In Christs time, he not only preached himself,<note place="margin">Luc. 16. 20.</note> but gave a Commission to his disciples to preach to all the world, which they did, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very<note place="margin">Mar. 16. 15. 20.</note> where, as it is in the end of Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Gospel. Saint <hi>Philip</hi> preached to the Eunuch. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> not onely preached, as you may see in divers places, but<note place="margin">Act. 8. 35. 20. 9.</note> makes it an ordinance of God, to save them that beleeve. So that this we see, hath bin a substantial part of Gods external worship in all ages.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For prayer, or invocation, which the Prophet calls <hi>vitulos labiorum,</hi> the calves<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21.</note> of our lipps, it consists of two parts. 1.

               <list>
                  <item>1. That they be not over many, and that those which be enjoyned, be necessary, according to the time and place wherin we live, according to the Apostles example, who enjoyned few things to those believing Gentiles. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28, 29.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Ceremonies enjoyned be for edification, and not destructive to that which the substance builds, and sets up. And this is the Apostles counsel. Let<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 18.</note> all things be done to edifying. For a destroyer (according to this rule) is a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressour.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 4.</note> And in this respect it is, that the same Apostle prohibits prayer in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue.</item>
                  <item>3. That they be such, as conduce to order: to which all things must be squared<note place="margin">4c.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> according to order, (as the same Apostle) else there will be confusion in the<note place="margin">33.</note> Church, and God is not the Author of Confusion.</item>
                  <item>4. Lastly, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that they be for decency. They must be such as make for the decent service of God. And therefore it is, that the Apostle inveighed against cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 4.</note> of the head and face in religious exercises.

Physitians say, that <hi>Aegros sanis immiscere initio morbi est,</hi> it is the way to breed diseases to mingle the sick with the sound. Therefore, that form of outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is to be kept, which hath no repugnancy with Gods word, and hath that decency in it (which <hi>S.

               <p>The signes of true worship are evident, When that which is injoyned concerning<note place="margin">The signes.</note> it, is either grounded upon <hi>Dictum Jehovae,</hi> as the Prophets usually pronounced their injunctions, The word of the Lord: or as Christ proved the resurrection by a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme,<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 32</note> or inference out of Scripture: or <hi>Quod accepi a Domino,</hi> what I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> of the Lord (as the Apostle,) or lastly, by authority of the Church in things indifferent tending to decency and not repugnant to the Word.</p>

Neither of these ought to be done to an Idol, to rob God of the least part of his glory, and honour.

There must be no bowing down to them, 2. no manner of worshipping or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, of purpose to exclude all distinctions. The first bowing, was the usual manner in old time of worshipping. <hi>Abraham</hi> ran to meet the 3 men from the tent<note place="margin">Ger. 18. 2.</note> door, and bowed himself toward the ground: then from the <hi>species, Adorabis,</hi> he rises to the general, <hi>coles,</hi> or <hi>servies,</hi> to keep out all manner of worship whatsoever, for fear we might be apt to say, No, we wil not bow down to them, yet we may worship them though, with some kinde of worship or other, if not with <hi>latria,</hi> yet with <hi>dulia,</hi> at least: therefore both these are added here, not onely <hi>non adorabis,</hi> but <hi>non coles</hi> too: for we know that a man may <hi>colere,</hi> or serve that, to which he will not bow down; and therefore <hi>adorabis,</hi> the chief worship being forbidden first, he addes <hi>coles</hi> too, and forbids that also which may be a great deal lesse then the other: for though the word <hi>gnoved pesel</hi> in the psalm, be <hi>colere,</hi> to worship, or serve graven<note place="margin">psal. 97. 7.</note> images, so in another place, the word is used to serve man, as twelve years they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Chedorlaomer;</hi> and else where to till the ground; and in <hi>Esay, gnoved pishtim</hi> is<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 4. 3. 23. 2. 15.</note> a trimmer, or dresser of flax.

               <p>So that the Papists hold an erroneous opinion, that think the holy Ghost ascendeth from a word of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, or serve them, nor do after their works.</p>
               <p>We see then that the Commandement is double, the prohibition is against making and serving Images: and though they of the Church of Rome bring an Example for the making, as that of the Cherubims, yet they shew none for the worshipping of them, we must have a warrant for both, or else they defend not themselves.</p>
               <p>Now for bowing down, you shall understand, that in their defence, they are constrained to desert the originall words; for as in the former, they went from <hi>Pesel</hi> and <hi>Temunah,</hi> to <hi>Idolum</hi> and <hi>Icon,</hi> so here, from <hi>Tishtacaveh</hi> and <hi>Tagnabod,</hi> they betake themselves to <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And this word is often used in the Scriptures, but not alwayes for the service of God, as in the Epistle to the Hebrews. The reason why the Septuagint used the<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 5.</note> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>But it was the ignorance in the Hebrew tongue, that brought in all these absurd conclusions, (for the thing it self, the nature of the word is contrary to them, and the use also: nor hath it any agreement with the Hebrew) insomuch that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> did determine, that the picture of Christ, and every part of the crosse,<note place="margin">Part. 3. sum. q. 25.</note> is to be worshipped <hi>adoratione</hi> (not <hi>duliae,</hi> as their distinction was before, but) <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae</hi> too, which they confessed was alone due to God, and not to any Creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. Therefore the learneder sort among them, having studied the tongues better, seeing the absurdity of these conclusions, found out another shift, and say, that they neither do <hi>adorare,</hi> nor <hi>colere imagines,</hi> neither bow down to, nor worship the images themselves, but Christ, and the Saints, by the Images.</p>
               <p>This distinction doth little avail them; the records of Antiquity can tell them, that this was the shift of the Heathen Idolaters of old, even in the Primitive Church. <hi>Lactantius</hi> taxeth those of his time for it, <hi>Quae igitur amentia est, &amp;c.</hi> what<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de orig. error. cap. 2.</note> madnesse is it, saith he, to answer, that you worship not the Idol, <hi>sed Numen ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod, cui Idolum fabricatur?</hi> but some God to which the Idol was was made? and<note place="margin">Hom. 18. in Ephes.</note>

4. The last evasion of theirs is, that by Images, we remember, or are put in minde of the Angels and Saints. To this in breif may be answered, that Saints are<note place="margin">Apoc. 22. 9.</note> no better then Angels: and seeing that an Angel would not suffer <hi>John</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>VVE are now to take a view of the affirmative part of this precept that is, how we are to behave our selves in the external worship of God. The worship enjoyned in the first Commandment (as hath bin said) is internal; this in the second, is outward or external honour or worship. Honour being a testimony<note place="margin">Honor signi et <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> of excellency given by outward signe or deed, and praise by word. The honour of the signe, is expressed by the word <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> in bowing down, and of the deed by the word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in serving. For the first, as the negative was, thou shalt not bow down to them, the affirmative is, thou shalt bow down to me. And for the other as in the Negative, thou shalt not worship or serve them, the affirmative is, thou shalt serve me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the outward worship first in general. Christ tells us, that a candle is not<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 15.</note> lighted to be put under a bushel: upon which, the fathers have raised this note or Maxime, that <hi>Bono debetur manifestatio,</hi> our good must be made manifest, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, candles that have <hi>bonum lucis,</hi> the goodnesse of light, must not be thrust <hi>sub <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> tenebrarum,</hi> under the evil of darknesse. So then, if the candle of light be in our soules, that is, if we inwardly worship God, we must set it upon a candlestick: our inward religion, must apear in our outward worship, and it must not be onely in a Chamber, as our private Religion, a close godlinesse that cannot be seen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next reason for this point, the Apostle gives. Ye are bought with a price,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> therefore glorifie God in your body and spirit, glory being nothing else, but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of conspicucu nesse, the fair spreading and enlarging of honour and praise: and therefore containeth honour in it. Now in conjunctions copulative, the rule is <hi>In copulativis non sufficit alterum,</hi> In things that are coupled, one is not sufficient, but <hi>vtrumque faciendum,</hi> both are to be performed. And the Apostles conjunction [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and] [in body and spirit] sheweth, that this honour must be done in both. The devil knoweth this, that God requireth both, and therefore asked of our Saviour but<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 9.</note> one, a little glorifying of him, but the bowing of the body, because he knew that if
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59534:126"/>
God have not the copulative, body and spirit both, he will have neither, God will have all or none.</p>
               <p>The third thing is, that seeing God every where almost through the Scripture,<note place="margin">Exo. 3. 5.</note> hath put a distinction and difference between his house and private houses, as being in more special manner there, then in other places, and that as the psalmist speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth holines becometh Gods house for ever, therefore he will not onely have a manifestation of our worship towards him, and that to be in body as well as Spirit, but he assignes his house for the place, where he will have this honour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to him. You shall keep my sabbaths (saith God) and reverence my sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.<note place="margin">Levit. 19. 30, 26. 2</note> And therefore it is, that the preacher gives us this rule when thou goest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 1.</note> the house of God, <hi>observa pedem vtrunque.</hi> Look to thy foot. and if God have a care how we serve him in our inferior members in that place, no question but he hath much more, how we imploy our eyes, ears, and hearts there, our exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal worship must be apparent, and it must not be by halves, and it must be in the house of God, in themidst of the congregation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The outward worship of God (according to the former division) consists<note place="margin">Honor signi.</note> 1. In Signe 2. In deed. And this <hi>Honor signi</hi> is twofold, which the Apostle setts down in the example of Christ 1. <hi>Exinanivit se.</hi> He emptied himself, or made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self<note place="margin">phil. 2. 7. 8.</note> of no reputation. 2. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> se.</hi> He humbled himself.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The empting of ones self is that, which is called <hi>deponere magnificentiam,</hi> to lay a side all titles ofhonour, which holy <hi>Job</hi> expounds, and calls <hi>spoliavit me ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore</hi> a stripping one of glory, it is that, which the Elders did, cast down their crowns<note place="margin">Job 19. 9.</note> before God. King <hi>David</hi> laid aside his robes, and made himself vile before the<note place="margin">Kev 4. 10.</note> Lord, in his service. The Apostle tels us, there must be <hi>Nudatio capitis,</hi> our heads<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 22.</note>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 4.</note> must be uncovered. The wearing of a cap, <hi>pileo donari,</hi> among the Romans, was peculiar to free men onely, and an Hieroglyphick of honour, for once if a man <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisset pileum,</hi> he was free, and when he laid aside his cap, he was said <hi>deponere mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificentiam,</hi> to lay aside his honour and priviledge, whereby he was distinguished from a servant. So then, as servants are to be uncovered in their masters service, so are we to be in Gods: and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (in the place before cited) tells<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 4.</note> us, that it is a shame for a man to have his head covered at that time. That's the first signe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other signe is <hi>humiliare nosmetipsos</hi> to humble our selves, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but to make a man neerer the ground, to bow himself as low as he can: and this was it, which the devill required of Christ: and it is a posture which God<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 9.</note> expects at our hands and was vsed from the beginning. We may see it, by that which God said to <hi>Elias.</hi> I have yet left me 7000. in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to <hi>Baal,</hi> by which he signified, that bowing was a signe of them, that<note place="margin">1 Kin. 19. 18.</note> worshipped him aright: and it was his quarrel against them, that bowed themselves<note place="margin">Esa. 2. 9.</note> to Idols for which he would not forgive them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But <hi>Honor signi</hi> is not enough, there must be <hi>Honor facti</hi> too. The first was<note place="margin">Honer facti.</note> Reverence, this is service and worship, which we call properly devotion, or the devoutnes and readines of the will to serve God. And this <hi>Honor exhibitus facto,</hi> hath also two parts. 1. To come and go at Gods command. 2. To do his worke.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Both of these we have in the Centurions servant, approved by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 9.</note> 1. In going and coming when he is bidden. I say go and he goeth, come and he cometh. 2. In doing his Masters will or service. Do this and he doeth it. And in these two respects it is that Christ will say to some <hi>Nescio vos,</hi> I know you not. 1. Either for not comming at all to his house, so that he cannot take notice of them for his servants. 2. or for coming unwillingly, with an ill will to do his work, and so they do not perform service to him, and in this respect are not known to him neither.</p>
               <p>We see that Gods servants did both. <hi>Abraham</hi> was no sooner spoken to by God<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 1.</note> but he was presently at his call and answered, <hi>Ecce ego,</hi> behold, here I am. The<note place="margin">psal. 84. 2. 40. 9.</note> kingly Prophet before he was called, had a longing desire to go into Gods house<note place="margin">prov. 1. 24.</note> but when he was called, he presently answered, Lo I come. It is Gods threat-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Esa. 65. 12.</note> I called and ye refused &amp;c. I will laugh at your calamity. And in the Gospel,<note place="margin">Luc. 14. 24.</note> they which were invited to the Supper and came not, were thought unworthy;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59534:127"/>
none of them shall tast of it. And as we are to come, so in our coming two things are required to make us welcome. 1. The first is, we must come <hi>mature</hi> betimes they that seek me early shall finde me, and secondly we must come <hi>quotidie</hi> daily<note place="margin">pro. 8. 17. 34.</note> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates. We must wait and be desirous to be called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Act. [Service,] to do his will. It is the property of a good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to do his masters work, and to preferr it before his own. We see the practize<note place="margin">Luk 17. 28.</note> of it, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant; he refused to eat before his masters work was done and here<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 33.</note> falls under this, the commandment of the great service, the service of the altar which that we may think it no dishonour to be Gods servants we finde that he chose the Tribe of Levi, to serve him at the altar, so that this service is the service of choice and howsoever some account but lightly of it, yet it was the greatest honour, to<note place="margin">Deut. 11. 5.</note> be chosen to perform this service.</p>
               <p>Now to apply these things to the point in hand. There is in the 95. Psalm, which is vsed as an antipsalm or Introduction (as it were) to the service of God by our Church.<note place="margin">psal. 95. 6.</note> 1. A coming, 2. A worshipping. 3. A falling down and 4. a kneeling before the Lord, whereby we may see, that in the precept of worship, in the substantial parts of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God prayer, preaching, the Sacraments, and discipline) especially in the former) there is a due gesture and behaviour required. And in this we are to follow the rule prescribed by Saint <hi>James</hi> which is, to take the Patriarchs and prophts for our<note place="margin">Ja. 5. 10.</note> guides and directors, and it is Saint <hi>Peters</hi> rule too for women, to follow the steps of holy women of old. So that laying this for our ground, and withal taking the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved<note place="margin">1 pet. 3. 5.</note> practise of the Church with it, we cannot go amisse. Now we shall finde (in this outward worship of God) that they never came together to serve the Lord nor departed from it, without exhibiting some reverend external worship, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, both <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>In accessu,</hi> in their coming together, it is plaine, <hi>Solomon</hi> in the consecration of<note place="margin">2 Chr. 6. 13.</note> his Temple, at the beginning, before his prayer kneeled upon his knees. And in <hi>recessu,</hi> we see, that when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his people had ended their service, they<note place="margin">29. 29.</note> bowed their heads and worshipped. We have seen what our gesture must be in <hi>accessu</hi> and <hi>recessu.</hi> Let us now see, what it must be while we are present at Gods service, in the particulars of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First for our outward gesture in prayer, which is either publick or private. And in both these, since we are to remember, that they are to proceed partly<note place="margin">Behaviour in Prayer.</note> from Humility, partly from hope, our external signes must be answerable to both these.</p>

And <hi>S. Paul</hi> in<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 14.</note> his private devotions, bowed his knees, as he sayes of himself. In private devotions liberty and freedome of gesture may be used, so it be reverent and humble, which sitting at prayer cannot be: <hi>Balaam</hi> willed <hi>Balak</hi> to stand by his burnt-offering, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 15. and being set he bids him rise up.</item>

And these are to be used in that part of prayer, which is called Petition, (for in deprecation the Publicans posture is fittest, which is, <hi>oculis dejectis,</hi> with eyes cast down) for the other we finde King<note place="margin">Luke 18. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> lifting up his eyes. And in <hi>S. Johns</hi> gospel it appears, that our Saviour did<note place="margin">psalm 123. 1. 121. 1.</note> the like. For the other, the lifting up of hands, we see that in the battail with the<note place="margin">John 11. 41. 17. 1.</note> Amalekites, <hi>Moses</hi> practised it. <hi>Ezra</hi> (in the place before cited) spread out his hands to God.

                  <hi>oculus elevatus expectat,</hi> the eye lifted up expects, so <hi>manus extensa petit,</hi> the stretched out hand begs and asketh.</p>
               <p>But in this point corruption is crept into our Church. Instead of humbling our selves by prostration and kneeling, we are pleased to sit at our ease, and that in a proud manner: instead of the <hi>depositio magnificentiae, &amp; nudatio capitis,</hi> kneeling and uncovering our heads, we sit, and with our heads covered too; this is not to enquire, at least not to imitate, the dayes of old. <hi>Balaam</hi> would not suffer <hi>Balac,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 23. 15 18.</note> though a King, to sit down, but to stand at his burnt-offering, and when he was set, he bade him arise. This sedentary prayer, and proud fashion of covering the head, cannot be warranted by any text in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the outward gesture at the word preached, or read in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was usually sitting, as we may see in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> They sit before thee,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31</note> and they hear thee, &amp;c. saith the Lord by the Prophet. And so in the new, The<note place="margin">Mark 3. 32.</note> multitude sate about our Saviour, while he was preaching: and the Pharisees, and<note place="margin">Luke 5. 17. 10. 39.</note> Doctors of the Law sate by him, as he was teaching. So <hi>Mary</hi> sate at Jesus feet, and heard his word. <hi>Eutychus</hi> also sate to hear <hi>S. Paul</hi> preach. Sometime the word<note place="margin">Acts 20. 9.</note> preached was heard standing: as when <hi>Ezra</hi> opened the book, standing in a pulpit<note place="margin">Nehe. 8. 4, 5.</note> of wood, all the people stood up. And these two gestures have ever been indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permitted and used.</p>
               <p>In the administration and receiving the Sacraments, the nature and dignity of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> them, with the prayer for the preservation both of our bodies and soul unto eternal life (to say no more) may easily direct us, with what exteriour reverend behaviour we are to carry our selves, <hi>viz.</hi> that the gesture of kneeling and humble adoration is most fit, and that such a gesture, as doth not signifie our humble reverence, as sitting, is utterly unlawful.</p>
               <p>In point of discipline the gesture is evident, the Judge sits, and the party accused, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that hath any cause depending before him stands.</p>
               <p>So that the end of all this is. 1. That God may be glorified, as well by the body, which<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> is the external worship, as by the soul and spirit, which is for the internal. 2. That our outward gesture may stir up our souls to their duty, as clothes increase the heat of the body, though they receive their heat at first from the body. Lastly, as to stir up our selves, so to stir up others by our example, that they seeing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend<note place="margin">14. 23. 25.</note> behaviour, may fall down with us, and be moved to do that which they see<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 10.</note> us do, and to glorifie God on our behalf.</p>

               </list>
               <p>But in the manner of doing Gods work and his will, in his service and publique Liturgy, there are five things required of us: of which though something hath been formerly spoken, yet considering the great neglect and contempt of this work by many, more is here to be said of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is, Unanimity and uniformity, to come together at the same time,<note place="margin">Vnanimitas.</note> and to joyn together in the same worship, that there be no disagreement in our beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior in Gods service, one to do one thing, and another to do another, some come into the Church at prayer, some not till the sermon begin. But, as the Apostle enjoyns, tarry<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 33.</note> one for another: that is, all praise God together. Inward unanimity, and outward uniformity being a delight to God. It was <hi>Davids</hi> joy, I was glad when they said to me, Let us go into the house of the Lord: and soon after he addeth, Jerusalem is as<note place="margin">psalm 122. 1. 3.</note> a City, that is compact together, or (as some translation) at unity in it self. And this spiritual union, is without question, a great strengthening to the Church, for when, either one comes after another, or if in time of Gods service, some sing not, nor pray with the other, this must needs make a breach in the fabrick of it. <hi>In Discordia</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine) nemo benedicit Dominum,</hi> God is never truely or well<note place="margin">In Ps. psalm 34 3.</note> served, where there is discord or separation. The Prophets earnest desire is, O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together: And therefore it is, that the holy Ghost mentioneth so often this unanimity to be in the infancy of the Church, as being one of the chief causes of the growth and enlarging of it. The<note place="margin">Acts 2. 1.</note> Spirit came upon them when they were all together with one accord in one place, as if the whole Church were one person, and had but one tongue, and one lip. And in prayer it is said, They lift up their voice with one accord. And they heard<note place="margin">4. 24.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">8. 6.</note> so too. The people with one accord gave heed to the things which <hi>Philip</hi> spake. So in the point of uniformity; we see, that he was punished, that was not like the<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 12.</note> rest of the guests, that had not a wedding garment. And as the separation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of tongues was a curse, that the earth was no more <hi>unius labii,</hi> of one speech or language, so it is a great part of the blessednesse of the heavenly Jerusalem, that the Elders sing with one voice unto the Lord. The Fathers beat much upon this:<note place="margin">Apo. 4. 10. 11.</note> and Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> extolleth it highly, and saith, that it falleth upon God like a showre of hailstones: and Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, of singing of prayses, that it sounds in Gods eares, <hi>tanquam resonantia maris,</hi> as the voice of many waters, which he seemeth to take from that place in the Revelation.<note place="margin">14. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is fear, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in all fear, saith <hi>S. Peter;</hi> with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, saith S. <hi>Paul;</hi> for if the service of men (according to the rule of <hi>S. Paul</hi> and<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 6.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) must be so, much more the service of God. But in our exteriour<note place="margin">1 pet. 2. 18.</note> service of God, there is commonly so little fear, or rather such want of fear, that commonly we sleep in it, like the Apostles, who could not hold open their eyes, being <hi>in horto,</hi> in the garden with their Master, they could not watch one hour, and therefore that judgement befell them, that they all forsook Christ and fled. And there is little fear in sleep. When <hi>Jacob</hi> was afraid of his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> he slept not all that night. The Example
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59534:128"/>
of the Christians in the Primitive Church, is left upon record for our observation, That they heard <hi>S. Paul</hi> preaching till midnight. Upon which place <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Ad hoc commemoravit eos, qui media nocte vigilabant, ut pudeat eos, qui media die dormiunt,</hi> the Evangelist recordeth those that watch till midnight to this end, that they may be ashamed, that sleep at mid-day.</p>
               <p>Now because the actions of a natural man, are eating, drinking, and sleeping, the same reason which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the using of the two former in the Church, must<note place="margin">1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </note> needs be of force to condemn sleeping too. Have ye not houses to eat and drink in, saith the Apostle; thereby condemning those that used to eat and drink in the Church. So if he could have supposed that the Corinthians would have slept there, he would have asked the same question concerning sleeping.</p>
               <p>And as he reasons from the place, so we may reason from the time, out of another place of the same Apostle, <hi>Vigilate, nam qui dormiunt, nocte dormiunt,</hi> watch, for they that sleep, sleep in the night. But with us, we may say, They that sleep, sleep<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 7.</note> in the day. And so, whereas the place of sleeping should be our houses, and the time of sleeping the night; we, (because we will be crosse) in the day-time sleep at Church.</p>
               <p>Natural reason tells us, that <hi>Actio vestita indebitis circumstantiis illicita est,</hi> every action cloathed with undue circumstances, is unlawful. The Prophet (as his manner is) after he had denounced a curse upon a carelesse people, falleth to blessing the Church of God; in which he saith, <hi>Non dormiet quisquam, neque dormitabit,</hi> none<note place="margin">Esay 5. 26.</note> shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nor sleep among them. And our Saviour gives this caveat; Beware, that the Lord when he cometh, find you not sleeping, which though it have a spiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, yet there follows a temporal punishment.<note place="margin">Mark 13. 27.</note>
               </p>

                  <hi>In prima poena est estimatio peccati,</hi> we may consider of the sin, by the first pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; and so we may weigh every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in prima poena.</hi> God usually punisheth sin in its own kinde. We see it from the beginning, <hi>Cains</hi> murder God threatneth with blood. Sodoms heat of lust punished with fire, &amp;c. <hi>Eutychus</hi> sleep (in this case)<note place="margin">Acts 20. 9.</note> with a dead sleep. This carelesnesse in Gods service, is the onely way to bring us, first to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and then to Apostacy, and no religion at all. We finde it punished in the Church, she slept and awoke, but found not her beloved. And this judgement followed the Apostles themselves; because they could not watch one hour, they all<note place="margin">Cant. 3. 1.</note> forsook our Saviour, and <hi>Peter</hi> forsware him.<note place="margin">Matth. 36. 40.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But howsoever it stands in respect of Gods punishments or mercies, yet the former reasons condemn it: and we may adde, that the heart truely and rightly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in Gods service, is <hi>ardens cor,</hi> (as the Disciples were that talked with our Saviour going to Emaus, their heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and a Father saith, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible<note place="margin">Luke 24 32.</note> to have <hi>cor ardens sub oculo gravi,</hi> a burning heart, and a heavy eye, are not compatible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There must be with these, <hi>Cordis praesentia,</hi> our heart must be present, and watchful too: for though we watch outwardly, yet there may be such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and wandering thoughts in the heart, that we may be said to be <hi>praesentes absentes,</hi> absent, though present. And where the heart is absent, the other members will discover it. The note of <hi>Cor fatui,</hi> a fools heart, is to be <hi>in domo laetitiae,</hi> it turneth that way, where the sport lyeth, whereas <hi>cor prudens,</hi> the heart of him<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 4.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">prov. 15. 14.</note> that hath understanding, <hi>quaerit scientiam,</hi> seeketh to get knowledge.

               </p>
               <p>And these are testified by some signes. A fools eye is in all places, but the eyes of the wise are (as theirs were that heard Christ in the Synagogue) fastned<note place="margin">prov. 17. 24.</note> on the Preacher.

It is the extremity of Gods wrath, and a heavy curse, and so to be accompted, to be given up to this spiritual judgement: and we are to take heed, that by our own care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse it be not laid upon us. If it be true which the Heathen said, that <hi>pietas non est vultu laedenda, sive serio sive simulato,</hi> then surely we ought to have a special care of our looks and gesture, when this part of piety, Gods worship is performed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is <hi>silentium,</hi> silence: we must not talk while we are in the service of God. The Preachers counsel is against it, for talking is flatly opposite to hearing the Word. Be more ready to hear (saith he) then to give the Sacrifice of fools, whose<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 1.</note> heart (as he saith in another place) proclaims folly, they cannot be silent. <hi>Job</hi> reckoned<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 23.</note> it as one of the honours done unto him, while he was in prosperity, That men gave<note place="margin">Job 29. 21.</note> ear to him, and kept silence. If a man should turn from us, and talk with another, while we are speaking to him, we would think he little regards us, or what<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 10.</note> we speak. The Prophets command was. The Lord is in his holy Temple, let all the<note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 7.</note> earth keep silence before him. And, Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord, that is, when the Lord speaketh: and he speaketh when his Messenger speaks. <hi>Qui vos audit, me audit,</hi> saith Christ, he that heareth you, heareth me. In the Primitive<note place="margin">Luke 10. 16.</note> Church the first word, was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p n="5">5. The last is, <hi>constantia in cultu divino,</hi> we must tarry while Gods service is done, and not depart till it be ended. It was <hi>Joshuahs</hi> commendation, that he departed not<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 11.</note> out of the Tabernacle. The offending herein is that which the Prophet calls, <hi>disce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere</hi>
                  <note place="margin">psal. 119. 118</note> 
                  <hi>a lege,</hi> which relates, to depart out of the Congregation, while the Law was reading. For as by preaching, God speaks to us, so by Prayer we speak to God: and it is but <hi>lex Talionis,</hi> the law is equal. As we deal with God, so will God deal with us. If we stay to hear him, he will stay to hear us: and when we say, <hi>Quare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliquisti me, Domine?</hi> Lord, why hast thou left me? he will answer, <hi>Quare dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquisti me, serve?</hi> Servant, why hast thou left me? And that speech of his at the last day, <hi>Discedite a me,</hi> depart from me, will be a just punishment for them, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part<note place="margin">Matth 25. 41.</note> from him here in this kingdom of grace.</p>
               <p>In the Primitive Church, from the first words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, let the people depart, none might go out from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation upon pain of Excommunication, as appears by the fourth Council of<note place="margin">Canon 24.</note> Carthage. If we would well consider this, this fault would not be so common among us.</p>
               <p>Now the means to perform this outward worship are these. 1. If we follow the<note place="margin">The means.</note> Preachers counsel in taking heed to our feet, when we go into Gods house. 2. If we<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 1.</note> consider, that it is a more fearful thing to come to the Church, then it was to touch<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 22. 25.</note> the Mount, and in respect of Gods presence, we must not refuse him that speaketh. 3. That the Angels are present among us, though we see them not, and that the<note place="margin">1 pet. 1. 12.</note> doctrine of the new Testament is such, <hi>in quam desiderant Angeli prospicere,</hi> which<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 10.</note> the Angels desire to behold, therefore if they shall see any not to esteem that, which they make such accompt of, shall not they be Ministers of Gods wrath? 4. That the end of our Creation is to glorifie God; now glorification comes from instruction, and instruction from hearing; so then as our hearing is, our doing shall be. <hi>Vt audies it a facies,</hi> if you hear not well, you can never do well; a carelesse hearing ever begets a carelesse doing, it cannot go <hi>ultra speciem.</hi> 5. If we put to it, <hi>ut audies, ita audie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> as you hear, so shall you be heard of God, and men. If we be carelesse of him, he will be carelesse of us likewise, and more then that, our very Prayers shall be an<note place="margin">prov. 28. 9.</note> abomination to him. He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be an abomination, saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> And this may be a punishment upon some Preachers, who have had dull ears themselves, that they shall speak to a dull people, that will not hear.</p>

               <p>If as <hi>David</hi> was to <hi>Saul,</hi> we be to God, be careful, that we be not missing from his house, for else as <hi>Jonathan</hi> said to <hi>David,</hi> To morrow is the feast, and you will be<note place="margin">1.

So will God look for us, and if he finde us not at his service, he will be angry too, unlesse we have just cause of absence.

               <list>
                  <item>1. The first is sicknesse. <hi>Michol</hi> excused <hi>David</hi> from coming to <hi>Saul,</hi> by saying that he was sick, and it had been barbarous in <hi>Saul</hi> to urge a sick man to<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19. 14.</note> come.</item>
                  <item>2. Secondly. Sacrificing our selves, is a sufficient cause. <hi>Jonathan</hi> excused <hi>David</hi>
                     <note place="margin">20. 29.</note> likewise, from coming to <hi>Sauls</hi> sacrifice, because he was gone to Bethlem, to offer sacrifice for himself.</item>

               <p n="3">3. The third is.

               <list>
                  <item>1. Because a publick sinne is to be openly punished and the punishment by Gods<note place="margin">Dut. 25. 2.</note> law, is to be proportionable to the offence. Now the sinne against the first comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is secret in our hearts, it is a bosom sinne, which God alone can see and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Act. 17. 30.</note> the punishment of it is left to God himself who is content (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) somtimes and on some reason as himself pleaseth to wink at it, not to see it: but this, because it comes into the light of the sun, and is obvious to every eye, and the rule of <hi>Justice</hi> being <hi>ut malum ubi contingit, ibi moriatur</hi> that if the fault be open, it be publickly punished, therefore God hath appointed and decreed a visible pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for it, for the reason and end, set down by the Apostle, that others may fear.</item>
                  <item>2. Whereas it is the property of punishment, <hi>cohibere impetus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

And that either for proffit or honour, or for fear of such edicts as were made by <hi>Nabuchadnezzar, Darius</hi> and the rulers of<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 6. 6. 8.</note> the Jews, which mav touch the life, any worship is likely to be embraced by us. For<note place="margin">Act. 4. 18.</note> as Satan told God skin for skin, yea all that a man hath, will he give for his life not onely to save his skin, but to save the fleece also, to enjoy outward peace<note place="margin">Job. 2. 4.</note> wealth and honour, men will violate the commandments of God. Therefore to bridle these <hi>impetus,</hi> and to meet with those edicts ofPrinces, and men in authority, God frames his Commandment as strong as Princes do theirs and threatens a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment greater then they can inflict, <hi>Qui secus faxit.</hi> He that doth otherwise, shall be subject to this, and this punishment. And these are the reasons, why this is a penallstatute.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This sanction or ratification containeth two things. 1. A Commination visiting sinne to the third and fourth generation. 2. A promise, shewing mercy to them that love me &amp;c. before both which there is a preface, I the Lord &amp;c.</p>

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, I am jealous over you, with a Godly jealousie for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chast vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> to Christ. And the Psalmist, <hi>zelus domus tuae devoravit me,</hi> The zeal of thine<note place="margin">psal. 69. 6.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">John 2. 17.</note> house hath even devoured me, which the Disciples applied to Christ. It is such an affection, as must take up the whole man, such a regard hath God to his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worship.</p>
               <p>This affection in it self is good, else God would not have taken order, that he that<note place="margin">Num. 5. 14.</note> was led by the spirit of jealousy, might make proof of his suspected wife: but upon some occasions it many times falleth out to be mingled with other affections, as in the case, which Saint <hi>James</hi> calles <hi>zelum amarum,</hi> a bitter zeal <hi>ex laesa concupiscentia</hi> from an offended concupiscence, which brings not onely greef, but stirreth us up, <hi>ad</hi>

Now, if this affection fall where there is power<note place="margin">pro. 6. 34.</note> as with God, it will not onely smoke, but it will kindle, and burn like fire, as the<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 20</note> psalmist hath it and that not like a spark in a stack ofstraw, which flameth, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth<note place="margin">psal. 79. 5.</note> a way but like fire in a barrel of gunpouder, bearing all before it.

Secondly, <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that these things though they are affirmed of God and man, <hi>Eodem verbo,</hi> expressed in the same words, yet are they not <hi>eodem modo,</hi> performed by the same manner. For 1. Jealousy in man, oftentimes ariseth out of error, either out of a false or light cause, but in God is no errour, he doth all out of judgement. 2. Mans jealousy is suddenly provoked: but Gods cometh, <hi>lente &amp; longanimiter,</hi> slowly and after much and long suffering. 3. Mans is <hi>immodice, &amp; sine fine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">psal. 18. 38.</note> immoderate, raging, and endlesse, but Gods is, <hi>Sedate</hi> temperatly, it is <hi>Tranquilla justitia,</hi> a peaceable, and quiet justice.</item>
                  <item>3.

                  <item>4.

               <p>The vse of all is that, which the Apostle maketh.

For if we would <hi>redire ad corda,</hi> enter into our own hearts, and consider, first, what God is, and then what vile creatures we are, we should wonder at the excesse of Gods love to usward, that he should be any way jealous of us, and not rather let us take our own courses, to our own ruine, and take no further regard of us. But chiefly, that we should rather so love him, as to be jealous of his anger, and the losse of his love, lest he should bestow it somewhere else. And so much of the Preface of the Sanction.</p>

1. If love be a means to make us keep the Commandments, then it is hatred that makes us break them. But is there any man that can hate God? Certainly his Essence is good, even goodnesse it self, which cannot be the object of hatred. Again, there are sundry effects of his goodnesse, and love, and such as the wicked themselves cannot but love them, and him for them, as that he bestoweth on all men. and so on them, their being, moving, and life, sense, &amp;c. But there are another sort of effects, which proceed also from his love, by which he would have us preserved, which are his Commandments, yet because they restrain us of our liberty, and will not suffer our inordinate affections to bear the sway, therefore (preferring our own wills before his) we hate him; so when a man is linkt to his own will, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with zeal of himself, he hates the Commandments of God, because they are<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 2, 3.</note> contrary to his will and affections, and so men come to hate God, by too much love of themselves.</p>
               <p>I loved <hi>Jacob</hi> (saith God by the Prophet) and hated <hi>Esau,</hi> which the Apostle<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> sheweth to be nothing else, but that he chose not him, but preferred <hi>Jacob</hi> before him; and in this respect we are said to hate God, when in a case between his will and ours, we choose not his, but prefer our own: <hi>Hoc est odisse Deum, non eligere,</hi> we hate God, when we choose him not. For God loving us so exceedingly, it is his will, that we should love him alone: which love, is <hi>vinculum conjugale,</hi> a marriage<note place="margin">Matth. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2 The second thing in the Censure is, that God calls this sin, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Gnavon,</hi> Iniquity or perversenesse, and peevishnesse. And this is to meet with the opinion of men, who think it perversenesse, if men will not do as they would have them, by yeelding to<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 14.</note> false worship, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> thought of the three children, It is of purpose, O <hi>Shadrach, &amp;c.</hi> they were called perverse and disordered fellows, for not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing this commandment; and so God to meet with them sheweth, that the breakers of this Commandment, are in truth the disordered and perverse persons, therefore we must not do evil, either <hi>cum magnis, aut multis,</hi> with the great ones, or<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 2.</note> the multitude, lest we fall into this sin of perversenesse.</p>
               <p>But the vote of the world is clean contrary, and the fathers resemble it, to a pond full of Crabs (the Hieroglyphique of frowardnesse) into which, if you put fish of another kinde, it will be charged to swim out of course, because it swimmeth not backward, as the Crabs do.

               </p>
               <p>After the Censure of the sin, comes the Punishment. And though it be true, that if there were no other punishment to man, it were enough to be found among the haters of God, that were sufficient, Yet Gods addes further, that he will have a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation. What the meaning of this word is, we may gather out of the book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> where it is said of him, that he went yearly in circuit to such and such places,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7. 16.</note> and judged Israel; and it is like that which we call, the Judges Circuit: as also out of the Acts, where the Apostles went from City to City, to visit the brethren, which s<note place="margin">Acts 15. 36. 41.</note> like to the B shops visitation, which presupposeth an absence before. So God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth his judgements for a time; and though some stick not to say, that he is long in coming, and others, that he will not come at all, that God will never visit, He hideth<note place="margin">psalm 10. 14.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 11.</note> his face and will never see it; becaufe (as the Wise man speaketh) sentence is not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">2 pet. 3. 4.</note> against an evil work speedily: and therefore they cry out, where is the promise of<note place="margin">Esay 26. 10.</note> his coming? yet (as the Prophet) Behold the Lord cometh to punish the inhabitants<note place="margin">Abak. 2. 3.</note> of the earth for their iniquity. And he will surely come, he will return, and give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence<note place="margin">Luke 19. 44.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 12.</note> on those that know not the time of their visitation. And let not the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive<note place="margin">psalm 69. 25.</note> themselves, for as our Judges, though they are part of the year away, yet they<note place="margin">Haggai 1. 6.</note> surely come at the time of Assises, so much surer is God in his visiting. For behold<note place="margin">Levit. 26. 16.</note> (saith he) I come quickly. And his judgements will not onely be upon their goods, but<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 14</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 21. 43</note> upon their bodies, and upon their children, as this is. And which is worse, he will bereave them of spiritual blessings: lastly, (which is worst) in saying as in another case,

                  <hi>persequatur adhuc,</hi> he that hates me, let him hate me still. <hi>Quando poena odii est odium,</hi> when he punishes one sin with another, this sin of hatred with further hatred, this is the greatest judgement and heaviest visitation of all.</p>
               <p>The Devil plaid the Sooth-sayer, when he caused <hi>Peter</hi> to say to Christ, <hi>Parce tibi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The sins of the fathers upon the children.</note> 
                  <hi>Domine,</hi> let none of this befall thee: he thought by this to save himself: But here you see, that though the fathers scape themselves, yet they shall be punished in their Children: so that God tells them, as neither they, so neither their sons, nor their sons sons, nor their sons Nephews, shall escape. So that the threat of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment extends not onely to the party offending, but to his posterity. 1. For<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 10.</note> himself, He repayeth them that hate him to their face. 2. Gods jealousy is compared by the Psalmist to a fire burning for ever; which leaveth not with the party himself, that hates God, but takes hold of his children, and burns to the third and fourth generation. So that when men think they have best provided for their children, by saving their estates, with the breach of this Commandment, they shall finde, they have brought a curse upon their children, and that they have brought evil upon them by that whereby they thought to avoid it.</p>
               <p>The measure of every punishment is known by these three signes. 1. <hi>Gravitas,</hi> the grievonsnesse of it. 2. <hi>Multiplicitas,</hi> the variety. 3. <hi>Prolixitas,</hi> the continuance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The grievousnesse of it, is seen in this, that it is said to be, upon the children, (though the Parents escape) who are dear to their Parents, as we see in <hi>Jairus</hi> that fell<note place="margin">Luke 8. 42. 9. 38.</note> down at our Saviours feet, and besought him for his sick daughter: so did another, for his son that was possessed. But we may gather more fully out of <hi>S. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 15. 22.</note> how dear a childe is to the Parent, in the story of the woman of Canaan, that came to Christ for the cure of her daughter: she saith not, Have mercy upon my daughter, but have mercy on me, O Lord, for my daughter is grievously vexed with a Devil, she accounted her daughter as her self. So King <hi>David,</hi> hearing of the death of his<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 33</note> son <hi>Absolom</hi> (though a rebellious childe) falls into a bitter passion, and cryes, Would God I had dyed for thee, O <hi>Absalom,</hi> my son, my son: he could have been content to die for his son.</p>
               <p>These examples shew, that children are most dear and pretious to Parents. We account it a heavy losse, when ought of our substance is taken from us, <hi>Abraham</hi> reproved <hi>Abimelech,</hi> because of a well of water taken from him by his servants.<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 25. 2. 23.</note> The losse of a wife (as being bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh) is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous: but when the losse of children comes, it strikes deeply, and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are both bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, and the principal part of our substance, the seed: as though a man were but chaffe, after a childe borne. The Wise man saith, Childrens children, are the crown of old men; their crown<note place="margin">prov. 17. 6.</note> while they live; and as the Heathen man said, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, their image or remembrance when they are dead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The multiplicity or variety of it, may be illustrated by that in the Gospel, as there is a distinction of few, and many stripes: and so here to have the punishment<note place="margin">Luke 12. 47.</note> extend to many generations, sheweth, that they will be many stripes, and therefore aggravates it a degree further.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Continuance of it. As our Saviour said of the Scribes, that they devoured widows houses, sub <hi>specie prolixae orationis,</hi> under pretence of long Prayers: and<note place="margin">Mark 12. 40.</note> therefore <hi>prolixum erit eis judicium,</hi> they shall receive the longer judgement, or greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>: so is the punishment here, even during the whole memory of man for four generations.</p>
               <p>The execution of this commination we see in <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who for his disobedience to this Commandment was punished in this kinde. It is said, That it became sin to the<note place="margin">1 Reg. 13. 34.</note> house of <hi>jeroboam.</hi> In <hi>David</hi> by the losse of his childe.

And therefore we may well conclude with the Apostle, It is a fearful thing to fall<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 31.</note> into the hands of the living God. And this the godly took notice of, choosing rather to suffer a temporal death, martyrdom, then to transgresse this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.<note place="margin">psal. 44. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But here may arise a question, concerning the justice of this visitation, how this may stand with Gods own determination upon that Proverbe, [The

fathers have eaten sower grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge] which<note place="margin">20.</note> God said should not be spoken any more, nor heard among his people. For, The son shall not bear the iniquiry of his father. And we see, that this was practised by <hi>Amaziah</hi> in punishing his fathers murtherers, and not their children, quoting<note place="margin">2 Reg. 14. 6.</note> Gods own law for it. According to that which is written in the book of the law of<note place="margin">Deut. 24. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses,</hi> wherein the Lord commanded saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers. And this seemeth to be the opinion of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he saith, Every man shall bear his own burden: and<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 5.</note> at the last judgement, every one must receive according to what he hath done in his body, &amp;c.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To this the School-men answer: as to that place in <hi>Esay,</hi> where the Prophet willeth <hi>Hezekiah</hi> [to put his house in order, for he should die and not live] he said not, <hi>Quid futurum esset, sed quid dispositione naturae futurum esset,</hi> not that he should then certainly die, but that according to the course of nature he could not live, and<note place="margin">Esay 28. 1.</note> therefore should die, if by Gods special power he were not preserved. So here, God speaketh not (say they) <hi>quid faciet, sed quid dispositione meriti nostri faceret,</hi> not what he will do, but what he might do in respect of our desert: but this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is dangerous, as tending to an encouragement, to the breach of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
               <p>But to answer it more fully, we say, that Punishment may be inflicted three several wayes. 1. By way of satisfaction. 2. Of medicine. 3. Of Correction. And we may safely hold, that by these, one may be justly punished, though no offence be committed by him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of satisfaction, as in point of suretyship. When one man is a principal Debtor, and a friend taketh the debt upon him, is it injustice in this case, to punish the surety with the payment of the debt? God forbid we should think so. For then, that which Christ hath satisfied for us, might be accounted unlawful, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of no effect. So that voluntarily one may fatisfie for another, and yet no violence offered to justice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of medicine, or cure. If the eye be ill affected, or the head ake, the arm may well bleed to cure them, otherwise the whole body may be in danger: and in this case it is not onely just, but necessary: so then, if the punishment of another man, be <hi>propter medicinam,</hi> for cure, and the evil inflicted be lesse then the evil prevented; as to wound the finger to save the eye, and the like, this is not unjust, and so when the temporal punishment of the son, is to cure and redeem the father from eternal, then punishment may be inflicted by God, without any impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his justice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By way of correction. In which there is respect to be had in repairing equality broken: A man should require no more then suits with the will of God, but we see daily he doth, and therefore breaketh equality, and is to make amends for it: and therefore <hi>nimis</hi> must be punished with <hi>nimis,</hi> which must be either in the father or the childe, and if equality be not broken in them, there is no injustice.</p>
               <p>The Fathers say, <hi>frustra requirit debitum, qui non rependit indebitum,</hi> to require a debt, and not to pay that which is due is no justice: as God saith, Do ye thus requite<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 6.</note> the Lord, O foolish people and unwise, is not he thy father that bought thee? and <hi>Qui contristat patrem suum, juste contristatur a filio,</hi> he that brings sorrow upon his father, shall have the like brought on him by his son, and that justly too. Again, in regard the covenant of blessing was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, God will<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7.</note> be the God of our seed: therefore when the father breaketh the Covenant, he may justly be punished in his seed. They knew it well, that said, His blood be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and our children.<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus we see it is not unjust in respect of the father, now that it is not unjust in respect of the son, appears. 1. Children may be temporally punished, because <hi>filius est res patris,</hi> part of the fathers possessions and substance.</p>
               <p>Again, in regard that the son may be guilty by nature. The Church in the <hi>Cant.</hi> finds<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 15.</note> a nest of young soxes, that as yet have destroyed no vineyards, nor worried any lambs, but if they grow up, they will do both; The question is, whether the church may say, Take us those little foxes. And so because there is a poysonous nature in the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions<note place="margin">Esay 59. 5.</note> or Cockatrices egge, we may tread them under feet: and it stands with justice.<note place="margin">psalm 51. 9.</note>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:59534:133"/>
The summe of all is, God never punishes one for the sin of another, but he may <hi>ex jure Dominii,</hi> as absolute Lord, inflict any temporal evil on the son for the fathers sin, without any injustice, for it is onely an affliction to the son, which God can turn to his good, but a punishment it is to the Father, who is punisht in his son.</p>
               <p>To these we may adde two considerations more. 1. The first is <hi>jus meriti,</hi> for commonly education follows propagation; Men usually bring up their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<note place="margin">John 4. 20.</note> like themselves. Children have traditions from their fathers, As our fathers worshipped, so will we, and having kept our Religion so many years, let us keep it still. Sin propagates like to <hi>Gehezies</hi> leprosy, if it take hold of the father, it cleaves to his posterity commonly. And therefore, this punishment may come upon them, <hi>ex jure meriti,</hi> and that justly, because they follow their fathers sin. And herein God when he punishes the son, <hi>exequitur chirographo suo, non paterno,</hi> it is for his own debt, not for his fathers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is <hi>jus beneficii,</hi> and this is the court of mercy, God may shew mercies to whom he will, the son cannot claim any thing at Gods hands for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sake, Gods covenant is free, we can challenge nothing as due, but all from grace. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> said well, that godly fathers have wicked children, <hi>ne virtus videretur haereditaria,</hi> lest vertue should be thought to be hereditary. Again, wicked men have good children, and why? <hi>ne malitia serpat in infinitum;</hi> lest there should be no end of wickednesse. But first, this is certain, there is no punishment for the grapes that are in the fathers mouthes, they remain in his own mouth onely. 2. And secondly this punishment is in respect of his justice onely: yet <hi>miseretur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>misereri,</hi> he will shew mercy on whom he will shew mercy. His mercy may exempt whom in justice he might punish, and besides, his justice takes hold onely on those that follow their fathers sins, and so the threatning is conditional. <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> imitatur, gravatur;</hi> he that follows his fathers example, shall feel the burden of it. God saith by the Prophet, At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it, if that nation shall turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil I thought<note place="margin">Jer 18. 7, 8.</note> to do unto them. And when a son shall turn from his fathers evil wayes, he shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and not die. His threatnings are of justice, his exemptions of mercy. <hi>Jonas</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 28.</note> saith from God, that Nineveh shall be destroyed; but by a new decree, the former<note place="margin">Jonah. 3. 4. 10.</note> sentence was reversed. These come from several courts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1.

                  <p>The third part of the sanction, a promise of mercy. Gods rewards proceed from mercy, which is the fountain of all our happinesse.

Under this promise of mercy, are contained all the benefits and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of God; all other promises are included in this, this is the fountain of all the

rest, if we partake of his mercy, we shall want nothing thats good for us. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 18.</note> was like the smoking upon mount Sinai, terrible, and dreadfull, this like the<note place="margin">Psal. 133. 3.</note> dew descending upon mount Sion, brings blessing and everlasting life, blessed and comfortable.</p>
               <p>This promise is mercy, for under this name he propoundeth the reward. Now God hath a reward for evilas well as for good. For the first, <hi>Samuel</hi> tells <hi>Saul,</hi> Because<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 26.</note> thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, therefore the Lord hath rejected thee. There was his reward for evill. And for the last, a cup of cold water, given out of<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 10.</note> a pious and charitable intent, hath also its reward. A reward of good.</p>
               <p>And it is well worth the noting, under what word, and by what name this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is promised, which is under the name of mercy, for without it, we were in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>It is Gods mercy then, and in this one thing are comprehended all rewards priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and positive. His mercy is great towards us, in delivering our soules from the<note place="margin">psal. 86. 13.</note> nethermost hell. And it is of his mercy, that we are not consumed. All rivers flow<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 22.</note> from this. It is <hi>fundatrix nostra,</hi> it layes our foundation of happines, in blessings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting,<note place="margin">psal. 21. 3.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">23. 6.</note> as also in blessings following. And it is <hi>Coronatrix nostra,</hi> for he crowneth<note place="margin">103. 4.</note> us with loving kindnes, and tender mercies.</p>
               <p>He could have said in this, as in the Commination, <hi>visitans,</hi> visiting, the Prophet <hi>David</hi> prayed for no more. Behold and visit this vine. And old <hi>Zachary</hi> took it for<note place="margin">psal. 80. 14.</note> a great blessing, that God had visited his people. But God is so good to us, that he<note place="margin">Luc. 1. 68.</note> thinks it not enough. It is justice onely, that is a visitation, an act intermitted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His mercy is a continual work, to shew, that theres no intermission in his work of mercy, but he continues every day doing good to us, which is the first degree of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second degree of it is, that the stripes of his justice are but 3. or 4. (which in it self is mercy) his justice is restrained to the fourth generation; but his mercy is a thousand fold, it is extended to the thousandth generation, so that the proportion of his mercy, exceeds that of his justice 250. times, to shew, that his delight is more in exercising the works of mercy, then of justice, his mercy rejoyceth or triumpheth<note place="margin">Ja. 2. 13.</note> over judgement. The one being <hi>Opus proprium,</hi> his own work, the other <hi>Opus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienum</hi> a worke that is strange to him. He wil save Sodome, if but ten righteous men<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 32.</note> may be found in it: and Jerusalem, for one <hi>Davids</hi> sake. Nay he bids them run<note place="margin">Esa. 37. 35.</note> through that City and if they can finde but one just man in it, he will save it.<note place="margin">Jer. 5. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But to whom is this mercy promised? even to them that love God, and to none other. And this love must have some proportion with Gods love. It must be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by his. Now the manner of Gods love is set forth to us under the name of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy. And he makes it no little part of punishment, when he withdraws his jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy<note place="margin">Ezec. 16. 42.</note> from a people. Therefore this mercy is promised to them, that are jealous for him. He is jealous for us, we should be jealous for him.

                  </hi> to be called after their grand-father <hi>Jacobs</hi> name, so is it an honor to a woman to have her husbands name. It was all the ambition of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (in the Prophet) that desired one husband, to be called by his name. And we see still, that in marriage the woman taketh her husbands name, and it is such a glory to<note place="margin">Esa. 4. 1.</note> her, that she is content to loose her own name for his. And it is our own glory, that<note place="margin">Esa. 43. 7.</note> from Gentiles we are called Christians. Of which Esay in sundry places foretold.<note place="margin">62. 2.</note> Every one shalbe called by my name (saith God) for I have created him for my glory.<note place="margin">65. 15.</note> And, Thou shalt be called by a new name. And again, And shall call his servants by another name. All which was fulfilled in the primitive Church, when the Disciples<note place="margin">Act. 11. 26.</note> were first called Christians. The glory of Christ was taken up by Christians, when they were called by his name.</p>
               <p>Now being Gods servants, and servants taken up his banner or badg, the duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is, that we must like good servants do all to his glory, as the Apostle speaks.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> God can receive no profit by us, but glory we may give him, and therefore all our<note place="margin">Gen. 11. 4.</note> actions must refer to it. We must not be so ambitious, as they were in the dayes of <hi>Peleg,</hi> that sought by building Babels tower, to get themselves a name: for that is <hi>Gigantomachia,</hi> which is, <hi>bellare cum Deo,</hi> to fight with God.

               <p>Nor must we set a face or false colour upon our own evil acts, under pretence of Gods glory: as did <hi>Absalom.</hi> If the Lord will bring me again to Jerusalem, I will<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 8.</note> serve him: here was a fair pretence, when treason lay hid in heart against his own<note place="margin">1.

               <p n="1">1. Having taken this name upon us, we must not be ashamed of it, nor afraid<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 33.</note> to confesse it. Judah of whom came the name to the Jews, was so called (the word signifying praise) because his mother said, she would confesse or praise God: so must we wear our name of Christians, and Gods servants, to the glory of God and Christ, and not be ashamed of it. The reason Christ himself giveth, Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my father. And though the Church of Philadelphia was but of small strength, and its works were not great, yet<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 8.</note> because it had not denyed his name, Christ promiseth to set open a door for it, and<note place="margin">4. 9, 10.</note> other things, as you may read. But any that shall receive the name and mark of the beast (wear any others livery) he shall drink of the wrath of God, and shall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with fire and brimstone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another degree, beyond that of not denying his Masters name, which every good servant is bound to, and which his master expects from him, that is, standing for his name, when it is blasphemed, consessing and defending it to the death, as the Martyrs have done. Because there was none that offered to defend<note place="margin">Esa. 59. 16, 17</note> Gods name, when judgement was turned backward, and justice stood afarr of, truth was fallen in the streets, and equity could not enter, therefore he thereatens terrible judgement, he puts on the garments of vengeance, saith the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">3. His name must be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, reverend and venerable. We must speak reverently of Gods name, not make it common, as if we did account of it no better then a<note place="margin">Col. 3. 17.</note> stone in the street, and of his service, as that of a common person. Ye shall not<note place="margin">psal. 124.</note> prophane my holy name, saith God, that is, not use it commonly; for to the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his name is opposite the prophaning of it, or making it common. Thus when men speak of Gods nature, of his decrees and judgements, and of the great mysteries of Religion, without fear and rerevence, as if they were discoursing of ordinary matters, they do not reverence his name: much lesse when it is abused and prophaned, as Witches do in sorcery and evil arts: or as blasphemers, that use it irreverently or by way of execration, when men ascribe to God what is contrary to his nature, as to make him unjust, cruel, the author of sin, &amp;c. Besides these, there is another way of applying Gods name to our actions, and that both to our own and other mens. 1. To our own, for this we have a precept. Whatsoever ye do, saith<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. 10. 8.</note> the Apostle, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord: and how is that? by calling upon his name for a blessing; when we say with the Psalmist, our help stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the name of the Lord. 2. To others, thus God commanded the Levites to put his name upon the people, and blesse them. How that is, the Psalmist sheweth, by wishing them good luck in the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The contrary to this is to curse; when with the same tongue, as <hi>S. James</hi> saith,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59534:138"/>
we blesse God the Father, and curse men. This is a terrible abuse, to use the name of God as a curse to our selves or others, which is given for a blessing onely, (as when men wish that God would confound them) and so as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>faciunt Deum carnificem suum,</hi> they make God their own executioner, whereas God hath given his name for a strong tower of defence.<note place="margin">James 3. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for sanctifying his name in our words, now for our actions. We must<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> make his name glorious in our actions, which is, 1. when our actions are such, that<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> men seeing our good works, may glorify our father which is in heaven. Therefore the Apostles precept is, Let every one that calleth upon the name of the Lord, depart from iniquity. Gods name is polluted and prophaned by the wickednesse of them that professe it. The wickednesse of the childe pollutes the father. The Law saith, If the daughter of a Priest commit fornication, she polluteth her father. Now God is our Father when we take his name upon us; and if we do not glorifie him in our actions, nor depart from iniquity, we do what we can to make him polluted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God threatens those that take his law into their mouths, and yet hate to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,<note place="margin">Levi. 21. 9.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">psal. 50.</note> that he will set their sins in order before them, such do wound the name of<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 24.</note> God by their evil coversation, and cause others to sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We make his name glorious by free and voluntary vows, made and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; so the Psalmist, Accept I beseech thee, the free-offerings of my mouth, and<note place="margin">psal. 119. 108.</note> teach me thy judgements: and what he practised himself, he exhorts others to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,<note place="margin">psal. 76. 11.</note> Vow and pay unto the Lord. Seeing God doth freely bestow so many things<note place="margin">psal 78. 34.</note> upon us, we should glorifie him not onely in the duties commanded, but in vowing, and making frec-will offerings of something in our power. The contrary to this, when men will give nothing to God, but what necessity of law, or eminent danger sorces from them. Like those in the psalm, that when God slew them they sought<note place="margin">Jon. 1. 5.</note> him: and like the marriners in <hi>Jonas,</hi> they prayed and made vows, but it was not till they were in a storm.</p>
               <p>The third thing in the prohibition is what it is to take Gods name in vain.</p>
               <p>In every action three things are considerable. The end. The Agent. The work.</p>
               <p>These three duly weighed, we shall soon see, what it is to take Gods name in vain.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <p>1. That which hath no end proposed, or is done to no end, may truly be said to be done in vain As the sowing of seed without reaping the fruit, the planting a vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard without a vintage, or feeding a flock without eating the milk of it,</p>
                     <p>These are labours in vain. So he that taketh the name of God to no end. neither to Gods glory, nor the private or publick good, taketh it in vain. <hi>Cui bono?</hi> is a good question in all undertakings. If to no good, as good and better not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken at all, it is to no end, it is in vain. If a man have well fashioned legs, and they be lame, <hi>frustra pulchras <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p>God is willing to impart all his blessings to us and requires nothing of us again, but Glory; which if we returne not, he may say, as <hi>David</hi> did of <hi>Nabal.</hi> for whom he had done many good turns, in securing his shepherds and slocks &amp;c. And when he desired nothing but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> meat for the young men, he denied it, All that I have done for this fellow is in vain, in vain have I kept all he hath. So God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done so much for us, and expecting nothing but the glory of his name, if we be defective herein, he may well say, all that he hath done for us is in vain.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Next to Gods glory, is the good of our selves and others, and so to take God name without reference to this end, if we neither promote our own good, nor the good of others it is in vain, <hi>ex privatione finis,</hi> because it wants a right end; therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced, having by his preaching laboured the saving of souls, I rejoyce saith he, that I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. In the Agent, the heart and soul is to be considered, which in the person acting is the chief mover. If the soul be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note place="margin">psal. 75. 7.</note> Gods name without due advise and reverence, though we propound a right end, yet we take his name in vain: therefore the Wise man advises, <hi>not to be rash with our mouth;</hi> and the Psalmist professeth, <hi>that his heart was fixed when he praised God:</hi> the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59534:138"/>
heart ought to be fixed and stablisht, by a due consideration of Gods greatnesse, when we speak of him. This is opposed to rashnesse, inconstancy, and lightnesse, such as are in chasse and smoak, which are apt to be carried away with every blast, and such as are so qualified, do take Gods name in vain.</p>

               <p>1. Falshood. 2. Injustice.</p>

               <p>VVE said before, that the word which we translate, <hi>taking the name of God,</hi> signified in the original, to take up, and that in a double use. 1. <hi>In gloriosis,</hi> as a banner, with which we have now done. The other use is, <hi>in necessariis,</hi> as a burden: of which now.</p>
               <p>If there be any thing which we stand in need of for the use, though it be heavy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and weighty, yet we will take it up. So did <hi>Jacob</hi> the great stone before the well, when upon the coming together of the flock, necessity urged him to it. Now as the first use <hi>in gloriosis,</hi> was solely to the glory and praise of God, by taking up his name, as a standard or banner by praise; so this <hi>in necessariis,</hi> the taking his name up, as <hi>onus</hi> a burden, by lawful swearing or taking an oath, looks also at mans bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to end controversies; for <hi>an oath for confirmation to men is an end of all strife.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 16.</note> And although God be not so much glorified in this, as in the other, yet in regard of our necessary use of an oath, this hath in a manner taken up the whole Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there being little mention of the other.</p>
               <p>Concerning which we must shew, first the nature of the duty, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the former rules given, for expounding the several command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

1. For the first. It is expedient and necessary, that all strises and controversies<note place="margin">The necessity of an oath.</note> should have an end, and not be continued; which cannot be, unlesse the one part of<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 16.</note> the matter in controversie be confirmed above the other. And therefore we finde, that before God would proceed to judgement against Sodom, he would go down<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 21.</note> first, <hi>ut certo cognoscat,</hi> that he may know the certainty, and proceed upon a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ground. Now the best way of proceeding to finde out the truth, is by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and reasons, where they may be had; which course <hi>Joseph</hi> took to know<note place="margin">42. 20.</note> the truth, whether his brethren were spies or no, by bringing with them their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Benjamin,</hi> when they returned, for thereby it would certainly appear, that they were no spies. But when Arguments or reasons are wanting, then are we to come to the second cause, which is by witnesses: a way approved by God himself, who appointed, that in the mouths of two or three witnesses every truth should be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.<note place="margin">Deut. 19. 15.</note> And because that many times not onely proof by arguments, but by witnesses also is wanting: there is a necessity of calling God to witnesse, which is by an oath. So God appointed that in case of jealousie or suspition of a womans honestie by her husband, though she were not taken in the deed, nor the act could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">Num. 5. 13. 19</note> yet she should clear her self by oath, and swear she had not defiled her self.</p>
               <p>Now this necessity of appealing to God by an oath, as it is sometimes in regard of the action which is hid from others, so likewise it is needful in two other cases; as when assurance or certainty is to be had, <hi>De occultis cordium,</hi> of the secret thoughts and purposes of the heart, which canot be known by external proof; for who knows the heart, saith the Prophet, save God alone, who is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the searcher<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. 17. 9.</note> of the heart: and secondly, when it is to be concerning things to come; for, as the Wise man saith, who knoweth what shall be? No man is omniscient, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know the heart, nor foresee future contingents. In these cases therefore, when the fact is hidden, or not evident, or when the intention of the heart must be made appear, or a thing future must be ascertained, there can be no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation but by oath, other proofs do here fail and come short.</p>
               <p>And here, if the matter of the oath be <hi>de facte,</hi> or relate to what is past, it is called <hi>Juramentum assertorium,</hi> an oath of Assertion: if it be <hi>de futuro,</hi> of something to come, it is called <hi>Juramentum promissorium,</hi> an oath promissory or of promise. And in both these, when other arguments or testimonies fail, there is no other way but to fly to God, to make him a witnes, and not onely a witnes, but a judge and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger also, if we call him to witnes an untruth; for an oath is nothing else, but a calling of God to witnes the truth of what we say, and to be avenged on us, if we speak an untruth, or perform not what we say.</p>
               <p>And here in the next place comes to be considered the two parts of an oath, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to these two For first 1. God is called as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whether the thing be true<note place="margin">The parts of an Oath.</note> and 2. he is called forth as an avenger, if the thing be false.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is <hi>sub Deo teste,</hi> a contestation or taking God to witnes, vsed by<note place="margin">Num. 14. 21.</note> God himself, As I live, saith the Lord, and by the fathers and holy men in the<note place="margin">Judg. 8. 10.</note> old testament, who used to say, <hi>vivit Dominus,</hi> As the Lord liveth, I will do this or that &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is, <hi>sub Deo vindice,</hi> which is called execration, that is, the call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a curse upon themselves, if it be not true which they speak. And what these curses are we may read in <hi>Levit</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. Where there are whole catalogues of threatenings of revenge. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> therefore was in the old testament, <hi>Sic faciat mihi dominus et addat,</hi> God do so to me and more also, if this be not truth &amp;c. Let God adde to the first plague the second also. This form was vsed by <hi>Eli</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> God do so to thee and more, if thou hide any thing from me.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now when one is brought to this, that he hath called God to witnes the truth of what he speaks, and to be an avenger, if he have called him to witnes an untruth then according to to the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> an oath, which properly signifies a hedge or inclosure, he hath hedged in and inclosed himself with Gods truth and justice to performe it, and so he that swears is holden and bound <hi>persistere in dicto, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And as an cath is an hedge to him that sweares, so to him to whom the oath is made or given, it is a satisfying or satisfaction: according to the Hebrew

word <gap reason="foreign">

And thus an oath coms to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> an end of controversy.</p>
               <p>And thus we see the causes which make an oath necessary in respect of men: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> because our necessity is not enough to make it an act good and lawful, unlesse God<note place="margin">How an oath brings glory to God.</note> have glory by it; therfore we must know in the next place, that an oath duely made, brings much glory to God.</p>

When we hereby account of it,<note place="margin">prov. 18. 10.</note> as the wiseman saying, The name of the Lord is a strong tower of defence, the righteous run to it, and are exalted. The very Heathen could say, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> wherein we take sanctuary, when all other people fail.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An oath proceeds from faith, it argues a great faith in God, which is the ground of all honour given to any, for in the former part of an oath, which is contestation, a calling God to witnes, we professe with our tongues, that God is every where present, that we beleeve he is omniscient, that he seeth even the secrets of the heart, and will lighten all things that are done in secret; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the second part, calling God to avenge, we professe, that we beleeve that he is a just avenger, that he will not suffer sinne to go unpunished, that he may say. <hi>mihi vindicta &amp; ego retribuam,</hi> vengeance is mine, and I will repay. Thus we beleeve that he hath power to punish, and to execute vengeance, which is a part of his glory: and thus we see that an oath brings glory to God, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard God is content to lend us his name to swear by, thereby to make an end of all our controversies.</p>
               <p>Thus we see the nature of an oath, with the meaning, the parts and end thereof. Now according to former method, we are to see what is commanded, and what is forbidden, which is the first rule of of extention formerly mentioned and withall the <hi>Homogenea</hi> of the same, according to the second rule.</p>
               <p>The Affirmative part is, that we take up his name to end our quarrels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, his name must be a sanctuary to flie to, by which we must be acquitted,<note place="margin">The Affirmative part.</note> or condemned, that whereby we do enclose and hedge in our selves, and satisfie the adverse party.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Herein the first thing commanded is, <hi>

It is set close to that, which was the affirmative part of the second Commandment, Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and searve him, and swear<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 13.</note> by his name. But more effectully and vehemently it is required in <hi>Esay,</hi> I live and<note place="margin">Esa. 45. 23.</note> have sworne by my self, that every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall swear by me. therefore God hath not onely taken order, that an oath should passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween parties at variance, and that upon the oath of the party accused, he shal be acquit, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 22 11. which some call <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>For example, the Psalmist saith, <hi>

               <p>In these two cases already mentioned, of Gods glory, and mans necessity, we have diverse examples.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First for Gods glory.

It being as most necessary to purge the Civil Body from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil persons, as the Natural from evil and peccant humours. God himself held this course in his Common-wealth. It is often repeated by him in the Old Law, <hi>Sic tolletis malum de medio Israelis,</hi> so shall ye take away evil in Israel. And S. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule also to the Corinthians in the case of Incest was, <hi>Vos autem auferetis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume</hi>

               <p>If the evil must be removed, it must be known. Physitians cure not the disease<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 13.</note> they know not. And if it must be known before it be cured, surely the guilty will not by their good wills be the parties that shall discover it; hide it as much as they can they will. We see it plainly in the first offenders. They were more carefull by farre how to conceal, then how to avoid committing their fault. And the like course take all Offenders ever since. Besides we
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59534:140"/>
know that some transgressions especially are <hi>opera tenebrarum,</hi> works of darknesse: few or none come to the knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>If then sin be to be removed, and that cannot be done if not known, and not to be discovered, but from the Delinquents, in respect of the secrecy, and they not willing to discover them: and that, though some may take notice of them, yet they will be loth to accuse, because it is accounted to be an odious office, to be <hi>accusator</hi>

                  <hi>fratrum,</hi> an accuser of the brethren; what course then remains to finde out evil, that it may be removed, but the Magistrates power, who are Gods Delegates to enquire.</p>
               <p>Now God himself hath set them a pattern how this enquiry should be made; who<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 24.</note> though nothing be hid from his all-seeing eyes, and that he knoweth all things without any set form of Inquisition, yet to prescribe us a form, hath taken this course.</p>
               <p>In the case of <hi>Adam,</hi> upon suspition, because of his fleeing into a Thicket. And<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 8. 12.</note> of <hi>Eve,</hi> who upon <hi>Adams</hi> examination was found to be <hi>particeps criminis,</hi> accessory by way of detection, without accusation, God thought fit to enquire of both. In the case of <hi>Abels</hi> murther, which was evident, enquiry was made by God upon<note place="margin">4. 6.</note> presumption, because <hi>Cain</hi> had borne malice to <hi>Abel,</hi> and being examined, his<note place="margin">10.</note> countenance bewrayed him.</p>
               <p>In that of the Sodomites upon a fame. <hi>Clamor est multus,</hi> the crye is great, God<note place="margin">18. 20, 21</note> will go down and enquire.</p>
               <p>And this is warranted by God, not onely by his own example and practise, but by his command too: in two places of the Law. If thou shalt hear, and, If<note place="margin">Deut. 13. 13,</note> it shall be told thee of such and such a fault, then thou shalt enquire, and make<note place="margin">14.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">17. 4.</note> search, and ask diligently, &amp;c. the proceedings must be <hi>perscrutando &amp; interrogando,</hi> by interrogatories ministred to the party upon whom the fame went.</p>
               <p>Under the Gospel also in the case of incest. The Apostle layeth for his ground, It is reported commonly among you. So that if there be no accuser, yet the Judge by Gods<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 1.</note> example and commandment, and the practise of the Church, is <hi>ex officio</hi> of duty, to search out offences, upon some or any of these grounds mentioned.</p>
               <p>The next question is, how shall the Judge interrogate, whether upon the bare word of the party, or whether may he lawfully minister an oath, to finde out evil, that it may be taken away.</p>
               <p>In a sin against the seventh Commandment, in the case of a woman suspected to<note place="margin">Num. 5. 14. 19</note> deal falsly with her husband, and that upon no other ground but her husbands jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, the Judge was authorized to examine her upon oath, and to make her abjure it by execration.</p>
               <p>In a case against the eighth commandment, between man and man. If the one were<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 11</note> perswaded that the other had falsified his trust, he might convent him before the Judge, who (at the Plantiffs instance) was to put the Defendant to his oath.

               <p n="1">1. We must not swear by them that are no gods.

               <p n="2">2. And for the second, to swear by any creature (though such oaths being made do binde, because of the relation to God) yet they ought not to be; for if any swear by that which is not God, it is an abomination.</p>
               <p>The reason why we should not joyn any other thing in an oath with Gods name, is in respect of a threefold injury that will arise by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To God himself, who requireth this honour to be exhibited to him alone, and<note place="margin">psalm 138. 2.</note> being his prerogative, is not to be communicated to others. He hath magnified his name above all things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To our selves; for he that sweareth, sweareth by him that is greater then<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 16.</note> himself. Now he that sweareth by the Creature, preferreth it before himself.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the Creature that is content with that place, that honour which God hath<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 11, 12.</note> placed it in, and if it could would be avenged of us, for giving to it the honour due to its Creator.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing comanded, may be gathered from the next words, (In vain)<note place="margin">Of swearing in a right manner.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that we ought to swear in a right manner; otherwise we take Gods name in vain, though we swear onely by the name of God. And this dutie of swearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, with due qualifications in an oath, is gathered by <hi>S. Jerome</hi> out of <hi>Jeremy</hi> 4. 2. and after him by other expositors, where the Prophet saith, of a people that should swear aright, They should swear, <hi>in veritate, judicio, &amp; justitia,</hi> in truth in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">In Jerem. c. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> and in righteousnesse. <hi>Animadvertendum</hi> (saith he) <hi>quod jusjurandum hos habet comites, veritatem, judicium, atque justitiam: si ista defuerint, nequaquam erit jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, sed perjurium;</hi> we are to observe that an oath hath these Concomitants, Truth, Judgement, and Righteousnesse: if these be wanting, we cannot any way call it an oath, but perjury.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Against transgressing the first, you may see Gods absolute Prohibition. Ye<note place="margin">In Truth, Lev. 19. 12.</note> shall not swear by my name falsly: and <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, that he that sweareth falsly, seemeth to be a man, but indeed is no better then a beast; yea, <hi>detestanda <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> a beast to be detested. <hi>Diodor. Siculus,</hi> (the Heathen Historian) saith <hi>Perjuri poena capitis plectuntur?</hi> doth he swear falsly? let him loose his head. And the<note place="margin">Ecclus. 23. 11</note> Wise man saith, If a man swear in vain [falsly] he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of plagues. And God himself commanding, that he that sweareth,<note place="margin">Esay 65. 16.</note> should swear by the God of truth, seemeth to intimate, that we are not to swear, but in truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may swear falsly, either <hi>in juramento assertorio,</hi> or <hi>promissorio.</hi> 1. In as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, when either <hi>in re cognita,</hi> upon our certain knowledge we testifie a falshood; or <hi>in re dubia,</hi> when we doubt the matter will fall out otherwise then we swear, yet<note place="margin">De verbis Jac. Apost. Nolite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> serm. 24</note> we will affirm it upon oath, for we may think that to be true which is false, and then we swear rashly and in vain. Or we may know or think that to be false, which is so, and swear it for true, and swear wickedly in vain. And these two perjuries <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For in the first case, though it be perjury, yet it is not wiful. As if I sell a horse, and swear (as I think) he is sound, yet proves lame. In the other, it is flat perjury. As if I sell a jewel for true and right, and swear it to be so, though I know it to be a counterfeit stone. Such was <hi>juramentum Petri, S. Peters</hi> oath, swearing that he knew not Christ; a fearful thing, it cost many tears, before he recovered himself. And there is a third perjury, when we swear that to be true, which we think false, yet proves true. As, I ask a man, whether a third person were at such a place, at such a time: he (though he thinks he were not, yet for some end) swears he was, and that proves true which he swears; yet is he perjured. For in the like case, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> gives the reason, <hi>Interest quemadmodum verbum procedat ex animo: ream <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <p n="2">2. And as in the oath of assertion, so in that of promise a man may swear falsly too. Either when we promise and binde that by oath, which we mean not to perform. As, I borrow money, and binde my self by oath to repay such a day, and fail, because I never meant or intended it. Or when we do the like by oath, and fail sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. As, I borrow money, and see as well a possibility how I may repay it, as a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in my self to perform: and thereupon swear to repay at a set time: in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,</hi> before the day comes, such losses befall me, that I cannot do that I promised and intended. The first of these is, <hi>perjurium simplex &amp; absolutum.</hi> The other <hi>per accidens,</hi> and not so bad as the former. But if one have power to perform his oaths, and for self respects, upon the change of times, and circumstances refuse to perform it, as <hi>Saul</hi> did to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> violating the oath which <hi>Joshua</hi> and the people of Israel had made to them; this is wicked and odious to God, as we see in the punishment of <hi>Sauls</hi> posterity, though the text saith, he did it out of zeal for the house of Israel. <hi>Nay to swear absolutely to do that which is not in our power, is unlawful; it is a sin to take such an oath, it is a rash oath and if it be taken, it bindes to no more then is in</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Therefore our care must be to swear truly. <hi>Ne eloquaris mihi nisi veritatem in nomine Domini,</hi> saith king <hi>Abab</hi> to <hi>Michaiah.</hi> Tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord. And we must imitate Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the place before<note place="margin">1 Kin. 22. 16.</note> quoted, I speak the truth in Christ, my conscience bearing me witnes in the holy Ghost, we must swear <hi>sine dolo malo,</hi> and not seek to delude an oath by any sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 1.</note> practise.

Murder. 2. Superstition Into superstition, when he thinks it is not to be broken, and into murder, if he keep it.

sins are committed which are not thought to be sins. And in another place he saith, it is because of the slipperinesse of the member, because <hi>in udo posita est lingua,</hi> it is in a most slippery place; and therefore <hi>S.

Wherefore his counsel is,<note place="margin">Tom. 10. ser. 10 de verbo Apost. paulo post medium.</note>

And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself, he saith, <hi>Juravimus &amp; nos passim, cadimus in istam deterrimam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudinem; sed ex quo Deo servire incepimus, timuimus vehementer, &amp; veternosam consuetudinem timore excussimus.</hi> I have been a swearer my self, &amp;c. but after I began to serve God, &amp;c. to see the greatnesse of the sin, I feared greatly, and so shook off that evil custome, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then for these last voluntary oaths privately taken up, and not imposed upon us, it may be questioned, whether they be lawful in some cases; which doubt the same Father resolves thus. <hi>Quantum ad me attinet, non juro, sed quantum mihi videtur magna necessitate compulsus, cum videam nisi sic faciam, mihi non credi, &amp; ei qui cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret magnum, &amp; ei qui non crederet incommodum, &amp;c.</hi> and then he addes, <hi>hac per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensa ratione, &amp;consideratione librata, cum magno timore &amp; reverentia coram Deo dico, &amp; novit Christus quod hoc est in animo meo;</hi> for my own part I swear not, except com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by necessity, as when I see, that I shall not otherwise be believed, and that it will be profitable to him that believes me, and prejudicial if I be not believed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this reason and consideration duely weighed, with great fear and reverence, I use this form, I speak before God, or Christ knows that I speak from my heart. And after he saith, <hi>quod meum est, est, est, quod amplius est, praeter est, non est ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis, sed non credentis,</hi> for my own part I would never say, but yea, yea; nay nay; whatever is more, is not from me, but from the incredulity of him to whom I swear.</p>
               <p>The third rule for exposition of the Law. <hi>viz.</hi> that it is spiritual, takes place in an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> oath. The Psalmist saith, of a good man, <hi>non juratus est dolose proximo suo,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We must not say with him, <hi>Juravi lingua, mentem injuratam gero,</hi> I swear with my tongue, but my heart never meant it; Gods name must not be used in guile, but we must speak the truth from the heart:<note place="margin">psalm 15. 2.</note> the Heathen saw that this law was spiritual, and that the heart must go along with the tongue: for as <hi>Isidore</hi> saith truely, God will take and understand the oath, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deceitful intentions of him that swears, but according to his minde to whom he swears; <hi>non ut ille qui juraverit, sed ut is cui juratus est;</hi> this will be Gods rule in expounding our oaths, whatsoever other rules we follow.</p>
               <p>The fourth rule, is concerning the means to keep us from unlawful swearing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We must <hi>obstare principiis,</hi> beware of the first degrees of this sin; for <hi>ex facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vain swearing.</note> 
                  <hi>nascitur consuetudo, &amp; ex consuetudine perjurium, ex perjurio blasphemia;</hi> out of this facility and easinesse to swear, a custom is bred, out of custom perjury, out of perjury blasphemy: when men make no scruple of lying, or speaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths,<note place="margin">Lib. contr. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacium.</note> they come by degrees to perjury by swearing untruths, and after that to blasphemy, a sin so horrible that in heaven it wants a name, and therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expresses it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Berech,</hi> blessing, as in <hi>Job</hi> 2. where <hi>Jobs</hi> wife saith, Blesse God and die, that is, blaspheme; or as we render it, Curse God and die. And if any can go higher, they come to that fearful sin, the sin against the Holy Ghost, therefore we must take heed to the first beginnings of this sin. These are the chains and links of an oath,<note place="margin">In Matth.</note> and <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>non est qui frequenter jurat, quin aliquando non perjurat,</hi> there is none that swears often, but is perjur'd sometimes: and with him agrees <hi>Philo, ex frequenti jurejurando perjurium nascitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, as he there saith, we must beware of such asseverations, which, though they be not perfect oaths, yet are the way to oaths, as to say, <hi>per fidem meam, per salutem meam,</hi> by my faith, or by my salvation, or the like: for he that swears by either of these, bindes either to that he swears to; and this amounts to an execration,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59534:143"/>
which is a part of an oath, as was shewed before; for as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, when a<note place="margin">De verb. Apost.</note> man saith, <hi>per fidem meam,</hi> by my faith, <hi>obligat se per fidem suam Deo,</hi> and <hi>cum dicit quisque per meam salutem, salutem suam Deo obligat;</hi> he that saith, by my faith, or salvation binds or pawns his faith or salvation unto God. If that be not true he swears to, he desires to be deprived of his faith or salvation, and God if he please (in the very article of time he makes this execration) may confirm it. Our Saviour taught us, that in our ordinary converse, we should use yea and nay: and therefore we are to go no further.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the next place, we must dispossesse our souls of impatience and anger, as also of vain glory. Anger is a principal passion which makes men subject and prone to swearing. The same Father saith, the first sin is anger, and the second swearing, if a man be of an angry spirit, he is seldom free from vain swearing, for in an angry mans mouth nothing is so ready as an oath. Nay, it is (as one saith) <hi>incentivum ad blasphemandum:</hi> when a man is in fury (as anger is a short madnesse) he spares<note place="margin">Hieron ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metriad.</note> none, not so much as God himself; <hi>dum irascitur insanire creditur,</hi> saith <hi>S. Jerome.</hi> Therefore fo low the Apostles counsel, Be angry but sin not; that is, watch over<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 26.</note> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> passion, that it break not out into swearing. And <hi>S. James,</hi> Be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to wrath,<note place="margin">James 1. 19.</note> for it will cause thee to offend this precept.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Vain glory is another disordered passion of the minde, as <hi>S. Jerome</hi> calls it. By it a man is violently carried away with a vain desire, to have every word he speaks beleeved as the word of God, received as an Oracle, to be as true as the Gospel; and therefore to establish their credit, they confirm their words by oaths: for, as one saith, There is nothing that men desire so much, as that they make so light of, to wit, their faith and credit; for they make shipwrack of it at every blow, by frequent oaths. They swear that their credit may not be lightly accompted of, when as by this means it comes to be lightly accompted of; <hi>Ideo leviter aestimant, ne leviter aesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentur, &amp; leviter aestimando, leviter aestimantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And because an ill habit in any thing is hard to be left, and Custom being a second nature, and that as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Peccata quamvis magna &amp; horrenda, cum in consuetudinem venerint, aut parva esse, aut nulla creduntur;</hi> sins though great and fearful (as this sin of swearing is) when they grow into custom, are reputed little or none at all. We must strive to nip them in the bud, not onely in our selves, but in our children: for it is with them as with a vessel, <hi>Quo semel est imbuta recens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. We should have ever in our remembrance, and set before our eyes the great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments and judgements (which are so many visible sermons from God himself, none so many and remarkable for the breach of any other precept) which have been<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19. 6.</note> inflicted in all ages, for the breach of this one Commandment: as <hi>Saul</hi> for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to kill <hi>David</hi> contrary to his oath, was slain himself. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> for breaking his<note place="margin">2 Chro. 36. 15.</note> oath of fealty to the King of Babel, had his eyes puld out, lost his kingdom, and<note place="margin">Zach. 5. 4.</note> was made a captive. The Prophet tells us, that the flying roul twenty cubits long, and ten cubits broad, written full of curses, shal enter into the house of the swearer, &amp;c. and shall consume it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fifth rule is concerning the signes of keeping this Commandment. And these may be taken from the consideration of the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>massah,</hi> here used to take up as a burden or heavy thing. If the name of God be to us as a burden or a heavy thing, and so taken up, it is a signe we are careful to keep this Commander. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every man will adde no more to a burden then he can bear, he will make it no<note place="margin">Acts 15. 28.</note> heavier then needs must, nor take more burden upon him then necessity requires; so if we take up the name of God as a burden, we will use it no oftner then we must of necessity, we will come unwillingly to it as to a burden.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When one takes up a burden, he goes to it with all his strength, <hi>ut bene feratur</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 15. 15</note>

                     </gap>,</hi> that he may the better bear it, so in an oath they swear with all their heart, and all their soul, &amp;c. all the parts and faculties of the soul are occupied and taken up; the understanding with a due estimation of the greatnes of him by whom we swear; the heart and affections with a due fear and reverence of his Majestie, &amp;c. thus the whole man is employed and taken up.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Those that are loaden with a burden, desire to be eased and to be unladen, to be

               <p n="6">6. The sixt rule is, concerning the drawing of others to keep this Commandment.<note place="margin">Of drawing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to keep this law.</note> As we must not take the name of God in vain ourselves, so we must not draw others to it. As 1. <hi>Irritando,</hi> by provoking others to swear. The Psalmist speaks of some that do <hi>irritare nomen Dei,</hi> as the vulgar Latine reads it, provoke the name of God, that is provoke others to blaspheme it. When we know persons vain glorious, or heady and impatient, and apt to swear, if we provoke and stir them up, we do <hi>irritare nomen Dei,</hi> we seem to consent to their sin. 2. By per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading others not to keep their oaths when they are taken, by giving false and fraudulent interpretations, as they did, who after an oath and covenant with <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> would have rebelled against him, and sent for help from Egypt; who are threatned for violating their oath, though it were unjustly imposed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted<note place="margin">Ezek. 17. 12. 17.</note> by an usurper: shall he escape? saith the Prophet, &amp;c.

               <p>NExt to an oath, comes to be considered a vow, which in regard of the affinity with an oath, aptly follows after it: for a vow is somewhat like to <hi>juramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum promissorium,</hi> a promissory oath: for the same conditions are annexed to the one, as to the other; the differences being, that an oath is <hi>necessarium,</hi> not to be used but in case of necessity, as you have seen; and a vow is <hi>spontaneum,</hi> voluntarily made of our own accord. And an oath is between man and man, and a vow between God and man.

And that when upon good ground and particular considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our gifts and abilities from God, we do not onely purpose, but also by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, either inwardly conceived in the heart, or outwardly expressed, binde our selves to some particular act pleasing or acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>A vow is nothing else but a deliberate promise made to God, of something ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him. So <hi>Cajetan in Thom.</hi> agreeable to what the other School-men<note place="margin">Annot. 20.</note> and Casuists teach, <hi>in Thom. secunda secundae, q. 88. &amp; in Sent. Col. 3.

               <p>A bare purpose without a promise is not enough to make a vow, though some of the ancient Canonists have so affirmed, the contrary is the general tenet both of Moderne Divines and Canonists, as apèars in <hi>Azor.

Though the principal matter of a vow be, something not expressely commanded, but left to our liberty, yet even things commanded may be the matter of a vow, a man may vow to avoid such and such a sin; or to perform some duty, wherein he findes himself remisse, thereby to quicken his own diligence by a double obligation. So <hi>Suarez</hi> proves at large. <hi>Tract. de voto. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>

               <p>This binding our selves by a vow may be performed many wayes, they may be reduced to these two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By limitation of some general Commandment to some particulars: as, To give<note place="margin">The use of vows</note> alms being a general precept, to restrain it to this or that person, or to give this or that quantity of my goods to good uses yearly, or weekly. This we know falleth not under any Commandment specially, and therefore these particular restraints fall under a vow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By restraining our selves in the use of some lawful or indiffent thing, which Christian liberty allows to all, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> we fall into something unlawful: this we formerly mentioned, and called it <hi>sepes mandati,</hi> the enclosure or fence of the Precept. Or by forbearing or abstaining from some lawful and indifferent thing, by the use whereof we finde our selves lesse able, and fit for Gods service, and the sanctification of his name, and therefore in this regard we enter into a vow to abstain from such<note place="margin">Jer. 35. 6.</note> and such things. And such seemed to be the vow of the Rechabites, and of the<note place="margin">Numb. 6.</note> Nazarites.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The necessity and use of vows is. 1. In respect of God: thereby we honour<note place="margin">The necessity of vows.</note> him, and testifie our thankfulnesse to him for benefits received; for though it be true, that King <hi>David</hi> saith to God, when the people had paid their vows in their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<note place="margin">1 Chro. 29. 14</note> to the temple, What we have received of thine own hand, that have we given thee. It was a true confession and acknowledgement, that they had given nothing to him, but that which they had received from him before. Upon which a Father saith, <hi>Dedit sua Dominus, ut reciperet sua, &amp; recipiendo sua daret se,</hi> the Lord gave his own, that he might receive his own again, and by receiving his own, might give himself, and with himself all that he hath; a greater gift then we can possesse in this life, yet God accounts it an honour, when we freely vow and give unto him what he hath first given us. Therefore he requires as a part of our thankfulnesse to God, <hi>vovete &amp; redd ite,</hi> vow and pay, or perform your vows to the Lord. It is some signe<note place="margin">psalm. 76. 11.</note> of thankfulnes, to vow to God, though the bare promise be but a blastof winde out of a golden pair of bellows: but the great thankfulnesse is by performance: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both these must be joyned, <hi>vovete &amp; reddite,</hi> vow and pay; promise and performe: for as we by our vows binde our selves to God, so God by our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is bound to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In respect of our selves, vows are necessary: because mans heart, as it is <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Dei,</hi> so it is <hi>cera Diaboli,</hi> the Daevils wax, fit for any impression of the Devil, and apter to receive any stamp of evil from him, then of good from God: and as our will is apt to turn from good to evil, so in perseverance in evil, <hi>mala volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> is <hi>plus quam voluntas,</hi> more then a will: and in doing good, <hi>bona voluntas</hi> is <hi>minus quam voluntas,</hi> lesse then a will, it deserves not to be called a will; it is a <hi>volo, nolo,</hi> I will, and I will not, therefore it is expedient, yea necessary to make vows thereby to settle and stablish our wills from starting back, to strengthen our hearts in good, and to confirm them against evil. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> confutes those that think a man ought to do any thing upon a vow, because a thing vowed becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, whereby the person vowing is bound to perform, and so the thing deserves lesse thanks; but he answers it well. It is true indeed, if it were an outward neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity imposed by others, and not assumed by our selves, it were something they said, but concerning such a necessity as this, he saith, <hi>foelix necessitas, quae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>ad meliora,</hi> it is a happy necessity which compells a man to the best things: and this necessity we impose upon our selves, either <hi>voto simplici,</hi> by a bare and solemne vow, between God and our selves, or <hi>voto solenni,</hi> by a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59534:145"/>
solemn vow before others, as the resolution and stiffenesse of the sinner in evil, makes his sin greater; so our resolution in good, binding our selves by vows not to go back, makes our good deeds the better.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As vows do strengthen and establish us in good, so they make our deeds the more acceptable to God; for what we do by a vow is become a sacrifice, in pledging it to God; and not onely so, but besides the vow it self, which is acceptable to God, and the act or thing we vow, which though it be of common or of civil use in it self, yet by vowing it becomes sacred to God: besides this, there is a sacrifice made to God of our freedom and liberty too; yea, of our very power, which rests not any more in a mans self, so as to do those acts which he pleases; for he hath made over his liberty and power to God, binding himself by his vow. It is certain, that before a man vows, he hath freedom and liberty, as appears in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 23. 22. so that if he do not vow he sinneth not, but after he hath vowed, he hath bound himself, so that he sins, if he perform it not. And this is the property of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to limit themselves, for <hi>pauciora licent illis, quam ullis, quibus licent omnia;</hi> their liberty is lesse then any other mens, that have liberty to do as they list: therefore the servants of God, where they are let loose or at liberty, therein they restrain themselves; and this, being in Gods service, and for their own good, is judged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty. And this is done in vows which are not to be imposed on us by others, for that were contrary to the nature of a vow, but to be freely assumed by our selves. And therefore, if any think, that because it is a matter of liberty to be free from vows, that therefore Christians are now exempted from them, he is cleerly confuted by these placcs, in <hi>Esay</hi> 19. 21. and <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. 15. where it is foretold, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Esay 19. 21.</note> of God shall perform their vows unto the Lord; which places are applied by the<note place="margin">Nahum 1. 15.</note> Apostle to the times of the Gospel. <hi>Romans</hi> 10. 15. We finde likewise that in the<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 15.</note> Apostles times, the consecrating of their possessions to common uses, and laying the money in common at the Apostles feet, which was nothing but the performing of a common vow. Thus far for the necessity of vows.</p>
               <p>Having seen the use of a vow, let us likewise see what things God best accepts in a vow. And here we finde by the examples of Gods servants recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that a man may vow, 1. <hi>se,</hi> himself, 2. <hi>suos,</hi> his children, 3. <hi>sua,</hi> his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or things in his power. And first the servants of God did vow themselves to God in two cases.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For humiliation after sin committed, we make a vow and a binding oath to<note place="margin">Numb. 30 13.</note> afflict the soul. It is called humbling of the soul, by vowing some temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or penance for sin committed. I humbled my soul with fasting, and I cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened<note place="margin">Psalm 35. 13. 69. 10. 6. 6. 102. 9.</note> my soul with fasting, saith <hi>David,</hi> and so for weeping. Every night (saith he) wash I my bed, and water my couch with tears, and I mingled my drink with weeping.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For preparation, and fitting the soul for Gods service; or to enter upon a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial calling or businesse, as the Nazarites did keep themselves to a more strict rule<note place="margin">Numb. 6.</note> of life, before they devoted themselves to Gods service, whence diverse fathers conclude, that it grew to be afterward a holy and a solemn thing for any one, before he gave himself to study, and to enter into the Schools of the Prophets to separate himself by the vow of a Nazarite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We finde a man may vow, not onely <hi>se,</hi> but <hi>suos,</hi> not himselself onely, as in the former instances, but his children to God also, as <hi>Hannah</hi> vowed <hi>Samuel</hi> to<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 28.</note> God; of such special vows for persons to the Lord, we read what Laws were made<note place="margin">Levit. 27. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 2. These are personal vows.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is <hi>votum reale,</hi> when a man vows <hi>sua,</hi> his goods or estate, or what is his; so we may vow things real, which are either 1. <hi>Fractus labiorum</hi> the fruit of the lips, as <hi>David</hi> did, when he sung praises to the name of God, that he might daily perform his vows. He saith the vows of God were upon him, that is, he had enjoyned<note place="margin">psalm 61. 8.</note> himself a task concerning prayer and thanksgiving, which he was daily to perform by vertue of his vow. Or 2. <hi>Substantialia,</hi> things out of our substance: as King <hi>David</hi>
                  <note place="margin">psalm 132. 2.</note> made a vow to build a Temple to God out of his means. <hi>Jacob</hi> (that made the first<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 22.</note> vow we read of) vowed tithes to God of his goods. We may vow houses, lands,<note place="margin">Levit. 27. 14. 16.</note> and offerings, either for the erecting or maintenance of Colledges, or Hospitals;<note place="margin">Exod. 36. 3.</note> for Seminaries of religion. So we read of offerings, and free-gifts, <hi>Exod</hi> 36. 3.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59534:145"/>
And as we may vow our substance, so a part of our time, so many hours or dayes to Gods service: so the Jewes, besides their sabbaths commanded, they had also <hi>diesvotivos,</hi> dayes consecrated to the service of God. These are the chief heads, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Levit. 3. 38.</note> some of which all or most vows may be referred.</p>
               <p>Thus we see what it is to vow; but now as we vow, so we must <hi>reddere,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our vows. Nothing is more easie then to vow, but its not so easie to perform;<note place="margin">Of performing our vows.</note> if a man be not master of his tongue. yet he will be of his purse, as the proverb is; and therefore though men vow readily, yet they performe at leysure. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> tells his hearers <hi>quia audivisti, reddite, non vis vovere, modo voluisti vovere,</hi> all the while we talked of promising, you would vow, but now we speak of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, you will not vow. But as it is no sinne not to vow, but onely <hi>diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio perfectionis,</hi> alesse degree of perfection; so on the other side, if one vow and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms it not, he sinnes grievously: and therefore the wiseman saith, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter never to vow, then to vow and not to perform. It is a grosse deluding and scoffing at the divine Majestie, not to keep promise with him. Therefore he tells<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 4.</note> us, that to devoure holy things, is destruction, and after vows to make enquirie. <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of those courtiers about him, who would have had him to convert to other vses those great treasurs which <hi>David</hi> had vowed and laid up for the building of the Temple. Therefore for a man to vow any thing to God, and not to perform his promise, but to convert to other vses what was vo wed to God will proue a snare to him, to choke and strangle his soul.</p>
               <p>To our vows then must be added performances, and because the purpose of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance<note place="margin">The conditions required in a vow.</note> is but one of the conditions required in a vow, therefore we will adde the rest, which are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the person that vows, he must be <hi>sui juris,</hi> a person free in that he vows from the authority of another, one that hath power in himself to make and perform a vow. A child under the power of a father, a servant under the power of a master,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 2.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1.</note> the woman under the power of the husband, are not capable of making a vow<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 4.</note> without the consent of them under whom they are: and therfore under the Law, the father might make voyd the vow of his daughter, and the husband of the wife,<note place="margin">Numb. 30. 5. 8</note> made without their consent, either expresse or implicite. Nor have the man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in some cases power to make a vow without mutual consent. <hi>Continen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Ep. 45.</note> the rashnes must be corrected, rather then the promise fulfilled. It is dangerous to promise that which is in another mans power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The vow it self must be <hi>possibile,</hi> possible to be performed. As was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a promissory oath, so in regard of the affinity we may say of a vow, for the matter of it, it must be <hi>possibilie</hi> and <hi>licitum,</hi> 1. possible for us, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our power. Now what is <hi>possibile,</hi> and what <hi>impossibile,</hi> may make a hard matter to define. And hence some disallow the vows made in former ages, as not possible to be kept, as to vow single life, of which we may say, that to say all may do it, is dangerous; so to say that none may do it, is no lesse dangerous. We must therefore take heed, that the Heathen man rise not up in judgement against us, who said, that <hi>Nolle in causa est, cum non posse pretenditur,</hi> the true cause is, we will not, when we pretend we cannot; we say, we have not the gift, when as indeed we want another gift, the gift of abstinence in meats and drinks, which they had in former ages, and thence came a general possibility for them to vow. But now in our dayes <hi>Tertullians</hi> saying may be verified, that <hi>multivorantia &amp; multinubentia</hi> must go together: because there are many feastings and drinkings there must be many marriages. The Heathen man said, that <hi>libido est spuma ingluviei,</hi> lust is the froth of gluttony. Therefore men must learn to abstain, and then they cannot say they are unable to make this vow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, the thing we vow must be <hi>licitum,</hi> an unlawful thing is not to be<note place="margin">Judges 17. 3.</note> vowed. such as was the vow of <hi>Michas</hi> mother, of 1100. pieces of silver, for a<note place="margin">1 Sami. 5. 7.</note> graven and molten image. And <hi>Absoloms</hi> vow at Hebron, to colour his treason

               <p n="4">4. It must also be <hi>Deo dignum,</hi> a thing worthy of Gods acceptance. It must be no frivolous thing that we vow, but such as may tend to his honour, and our own good. We must promise <hi>rem gratam,</hi> a thing acceptable to God, els he will not vouchsafe to looke upon it, no such frivolous thing, as he that vowed the<note place="margin">Amos 5. 22.</note> shaving of his head, or he that eat the kernels and vowed to offer the shells to <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. For the time of vowing, it may be either in trouble or affliction, or in <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillo,</hi> before deliverance, or after; before deliverance, thereby the better to obtain it, after, to shew our thankfulnes for what we have received; examples we have of both, approved by God; of the first in <hi>David,</hi> I will pay my vows, which I<note place="margin">psal. 66. 12.</note> spake when I was in trouble. And of the Israelites in their distresse. And this kinde<note place="margin">Numb. 21. 2.</note> of vow we see is allowable: for God delivered <hi>David</hi> out of all his trouble; and it is said in the text concerning the Israelites, that the Lord heard the voice of Israel, allowed of their vow. Of the other, a vow of thankfullnes, we have in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, who after the storm was over, offered sacrifices, and vowed vows: so that in a storm, and in a calm both in prosperity and adversity, vows may be made the one is a kind of prayer, obtaining help, the other a part of thankfullnes for help ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

The flesh of the<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 3.</note> peace offering must be eaten the same day that it is offered, nothing must be left till the morrow: and in the Nazarites vow, if any were defiled during the time of his separation, the priest must offer a sinne offering and a peace offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he must hallow his head the same day. It is better thou shouldest not vow, then that thou shouldest vow and not pay it. The reason he gives is, for God delighteth not in the sacrifice of fooles, pay therefore that thou hast vowed. You see still, it is a payment, not a gift; and it is such a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to pay, as a mounts to a grosse abuse of Gods name, and a scoffing at his most blessed and sacred majesty.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of glorifying Gods name from the heart. The means of glorifying it. The signes. Of causing others to glorifie it. The second part of this precept, the Commination. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why such a threatening is here denounced. Gods punishing the breach of this Commandment by visible judgements. God is jealous of his name.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE come now from the things commanded and forbidden in this precept, and the Homogeneall duties, which are included in the first and second rule of expounding the Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the other rules, which here also take place.</p>
               <p>For the third rule, that the Law is spiritually to be understood, so this Law of hallowing Gods name must be expounded, we must do all from the heart. Though the name be the object of speech, yet all our vsing of Gods name, by swearing, vowing, praising, or speaking of it, must come from the heart; otherwise we are all in the number of those that draw neer to God with their lips, but their hearts are far off; by this means perverting the order in Gods worship. where the heart must come first, and the lips attend it. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his confessions saith <hi>Flete mecum fratres, &amp; flete pro me,</hi> weep with me, brethren, and weep for me. Now what was it for which he desires them to weep? in the same place he declares, that in singing Psalms in the Church, <hi>Animus magis erat ad cantum, quam adid quod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> his minde was more upon the tune, then upon the matter; which he confesleth to be a great sinne. For holy exercises performed to God with the mouth, and without the heart, when there is nothing but a noise, are but as the crackling of thorns under a pot, which make a noise; but heat little: neverthelesse he approved not this infirmity in himself; for as he saith further, <hi>it a saepe facio non sentiens, sed postquam feci sentio,</hi> I do so often, and perceive it not, but after I have done it, I perceive and feel it. And it were to be wished, that we could have the like feeling and sence of our failings in this kinde; this would be a good step to amendment,</p>
               <p>According to the fourth rule, the means are to be considered of glorifying<note place="margin">The means of glorifying Gods name.</note> the name of God, whether by praying God, swearing by him, or vowing to him. The means or motives to make us glorify his name, are 1. To consider how God hath magnified our names, by registring them in the book of life; and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this to make our names glorious in the life to come, but even in this world, we are called by his name, and he by ours, we are his, and he is ours. He is not a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be called <hi>Deus noster,</hi> our God, to take our name upon him, that we should not be ashamed of his name: thus he exalts and honours our name, therefore we should exalt and honour his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second means is to keep a catalogue of the famous acts of God, both of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and mercies whereby we may be stirred up to glorifie his name. Those that were done before our times, we either doubt of them, or think they belong not to us, or that God had glory and praise enough in those dayes, and that they are of little use to us. Therefore the counsel of devout men hath been, that is, the men of God of old, <hi>Nathan, Gad,</hi> and other children of the Prophets, every one had their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>verba dierum,</hi> their Chronicles or Annals, or Diaries from the beginning of their times, wherein for their own remembrance, they kept catalogues of the visible judgements of God upon his enemies, and of his mercies towards his children; that so they might the morereverence him: so should we keep memorials of the remarkable passages of his providence to our selves and others, of his judgments and mercies, thereby to stir us up to glorifie his name the better; and that by comparing one with another, one shall not be an impediment to another, neither those that were before us shall seem incredible, when we see the like done in our dayes; nor those in our dayes seem strange, because the like was done before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third is, to use thatart and dexterity which was in Christ and his servants, whereby they invred themselves to take occasion from every action or creature they saw, to raise matter of glory to God; that nothing could be done, or spoken;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59534:147"/>
or heard of but they would make use of it, thereby to return glory to God: a Christ, upon occasion of the brightnes of the Sun, when he was early in the Temple, took occasion to fall into a discourse of the spiritual light of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the natural darknes of man; and upon enquirie of his followers, how<note place="margin">John 8. 12.</note> he came to the other side of the sea and upon his answer, that they sought him rather for his loaves, for another dinner, then for the miracle they saw; and upon<note place="margin">John 6. 26.</note> mentioning of Manna, he takes occasion to enter into that large and excellent sermon of the Eucharist, and the bread of life. But most notably in the fourteenth of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> where at one dinner, he takes occasion, 1. from the striving of the guests for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places. 2. From their inviting rich men rather then the poor. 3. From one at the table that said, blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdom of God; he takes occasion, I say, to enter into three very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> exhortations and admonitions tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much to the glory of God. So the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> going down to the vineyards, <hi>Jeremie</hi> going into the potters shop, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> from the altar at Athens set up to the unknown God; they take occasion, the Prophets to convince the Jews, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to convert the Gentiles. Thus when we shall studie to atain to this art, by daily practise we may come to that aptnes, that nothing can be offered, but some wholsome meditation may be drawn from it, whereby God may be daily glorified.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth means to glorifie his name, is a reverend vsage not onely of his name, but of his word, which he hath given us as a means to glorifie his name, for therefore is his word called his name, as when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is said to carry the name of Christ before the Gentiles, that is, in the judgement of the best expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors,<note place="margin">Act. 9. 15.</note> his word, and the Prophet saith, They shall walk up and down in the name<note place="margin">Zach. 10. 12.</note> of the Lord, that is, in his word. His word is the special means to magnifie his name his name is in a special manner printed upon it. Therefore that abominable and cursed practise of sundry ungracious persons, of applying sundry sentences of his holy word to prophane libells and jests, is condemned and anathematized by all the sacred coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells in former times, yea, even by the councel of Trent it self. What shall we say saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> but that these men put themselves in a way, by disesteeming Gods word, to have a sleight esteeme of his name, and by abasing and prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his word, to come to abuse and blaspheme his name.</p>
               <p>According to the fifth rule, the signes of glorifying Gods name, come in the next<note place="margin">The fift rule.</note> place; which may be taken from the consideration of what it is compared to.<note place="margin">The signes.</note> We shewed before, that to take his name was vsed in a double sence, either as a burden, or as a standard or a glorious thing: to take it as a burden <hi>in necessariis;</hi> in case of necessity, by an oath, but when our necessity is not urged but Gods glory, then we take it up as a Banner or standard; and so by the behaviour of men towards that, we may know, whether we stand rightly affected towards Gods name.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Host, they followed the standard, they stood still when it stood, and moved when it moved: so here, if we make Gods name and glory our standard, we stand affected, in our actions, meditations, and enterprises, to go so far as Gods glory calls, and no further; to be lead by it, to go when it goes, and to stand when it stands; and this when flesh and blood, and worldly powers and reasons would allure us to the contrary. If his glory commands all our actions, its a good signe we ayme at the glory of his name, whereas many, when Gods glory bids stand, they go and when that calls back, go further; and when it calls on them to go, they sit still.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was a part of the Roman and Graecian discipline among the souldiers, when they entered into the camp, they sware, <hi>Pugnabo &amp; solus, et cum aliis,</hi> they would fight for their banner alone, and with company: now this applied shews, that the greatest part of the world doth not seek his glory, for it is <hi>cum aliis,</hi> that gets God the glory, <hi>a solis</hi> he shall have little. If the rest shrink away, there are few that will keep that part of the oath to stand <hi>soil</hi> by the standard, when the Realm shall run to Apostacie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly whosoever belonged to our standard, and had once professed himself of that band, it was present death, if he had either in his mouth <hi>hostile symbolum,</hi> or about him <hi>hostilem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> if he had either the enemies watch-word or the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59534:147"/>
badg, it was death. Now if we apply this, we may see there are many among us, that in their outwad carriage professe to fight under Christs banner, yet their actions, their apparel &amp;c. are <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> badges of the enemie, and their speeches are the right watch-word of the Devil, worldly speeches, and worldly signs, which we daily wear, do prove, that we do <hi>carni et sanguini militari,</hi> fight for flesh and blood, and not for Gods glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth signe is the perishing of a righteous man in his righteousnes to die for the name of God. It was the manner of the Lacedemonians at the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the standard to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> either bring this home, or be brought home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. So when Gods gives us his name, we must fight for it, and either bring it home, or be brought home upon it; we must confesse the name of Christ, and either bring this shield of faith sound to God, or die for it, rather then lose it, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was resolved, who said, <hi>he was ready not onely to be bound at Ierusalem, but to die for the name of Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sixt rule requires, that not onely we gloryfie his name our selves, but that we procure others to do it, our speech must be such, <hi>as may minister grace to the hearers,</hi> such for which they may glorifie God, and not our speech onely, but our works too as our Saviour exhorts, <hi>that when men see our good works, they may glorify our father which is in heaven,</hi> otherwise if our lives be unreformed, <hi>we cause the name of God to be evil spoken of and blasphemed,</hi> we open the mouthes of wicked men, and make them say, the words we professe hath no power, our religion is a doctrine of licentiousnes, in which the power of Godlines doth not appear. And thus much for the first part of this commandment, The Prohibition.</p>
               <p>The second part of this precept is the Commination, or penalty threatened, <hi>God will not hold him guiltlesse &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here in the last place comes the penalty, or commination, for breach of this<note place="margin">For the Lord will not hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c.</note> Comma ndment. In the first place it is worth the observing, that God useth the Idiome or stile of a court of Assise in this commination, and well may he do it, for he ever keeps an assise, and delinquents of all sorts are arraigned continually, and amongst them, those that take his name in vain: and that before him (the judge) their consciences, and the devil accusing them at the bar of his justice; where the evidence will be so cleare against them, as he cannot but pronounce them guilty.</p>
               <p>As in the second commandment God addes a threatening to the children as well as to the parents, to the third and fourth generation, to meet with that argument which some men might have for falling down before an Idol, when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by authority, they will rather change their religion, then run a hazzard of undoing themselves and their children, and bringing them to beggery, God meets with them, and tells them, neither they nor their children shall save any thing that way, but fare the worse, for I will visit saith he, this sinne upon the third and fourth generation: so here inthis commandment he annexes a penalty to meet with the sinne, because some men may think they may get some great gain, or profit somtimes by swearing falsly, therefore God sets a great penalty upon this sinne, to let them know, they shall gain nothing by the bargain. Here is a <hi>Frustra quod non erit frustra,</hi> a taking of Gods name in vain, which will not prove in vain, for he will come in judgement against them, when men think to save themselves from some danger by taking Gods name in vain, they shall finde, that that shall be their destruction, which they thought would preserve them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again <hi>vbi lapsus est in proclivi,</hi> where one is apt to fall, as here because the tongue, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> est in vdo,</hi> is placed in a glib or slippery place, therefore God sets a lock upon our lips, to keep the door of our mouth,<note place="margin">psalm 141. 3.</note> which lock is this threatening, <hi>Thou shalt not be held guiltlesse,</hi> If we take his name in vain, that is, If we take upon us the name of Christians, and have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bare profession, we frustrate Gods name, for <hi>every one that calls upon the name</hi> of <hi>Christ, must depart from iniquity;</hi> otherwise it may be said to us, as the Psalmist speaks <hi>I said unto the fools deal not so madly, and to the ungodly set not up your horns on high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:59534:148"/>
If you take upon you any other name; if you defend not his word, or defend any thing opposite to it; if in disputations you maintain false doctrine; if in your speech you bury the name of God, not making mention of it; or if you talk of it foolishly and vainly without fear and reverence; if in your talk you forget God, or speak evil of his name, by murmuring at his judgements on your selves, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying his mercies upon others; if when you should blesse his name, you take it and apply it to witchcraft and sorceries, or to prophane jesting and scoffing; if when you should blesse others, you make use of it to curse them by it; if in swearing you take it in vain; if you vow to him and perform not; if by any of these wayes you pollute his name; Consider what follows, <hi>God will not hold you guiltlesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And it is he or none that must punish this sin, God will not hold you guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, for the world will hold you guiltlesse, little or no punishment is inflicted by men for taking Gods name. If any impair another mans name, he may have better remedie for it, then if the name of God be blasphemed; therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Gods name is not so much regarded by mans Law, God himself pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for it, you shall not go scot-free, if you abuse my name. The Lord will take the matter into his own hands, because men regard it so little.</p>
               <p>Not to be held guiltlesse is the threatning. But who is he there that shall not fall into intollerable and endlesse trouble, if God hold him not guiltlesse, for every man is guilty before God: but wheras for sins of infirmity and ignorance, though a man be guilty, and contract a guilt upon him, yet God holds him not guilty, but pardons it upon a general repentance; for this sin of taking Gods name in vain, he will not remit the guilt, but he will hold him guilty; for other sins the guilt is more easily taken away: <hi>hic est totus fructus, ut auferatur peccatum, this is all the fruit, the taking away of sin;</hi> as the Prophet speaks, else we were of all men most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable; but by this sinne there is a special guilt contracted which is not easily taken off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God will not hold him guiltlesse,</hi> he will punish him both in this life, and in the<note place="margin">Judgements for the breach of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> life to come: for Gods threatnings extend to both, and there is no precept given by God, for breach whereof so many threatnings are denounced, and so many fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgements executed in all ages.</p>

               <p>And the reason that God is so severe an Avenger of the breach of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is the jealousie of his name. For if a private man be careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59534:148"/>
his good name and reputation, God is much more, because his name is a more glorious name, then any mans can be. We use to say, what is a man but his good name? <hi>Crudelis est sibi homo qui famam negligit, vel inultam sinit,</hi> He is cruel to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that is negligent of his good name, or will not vindicate it. <hi>Solius laesae famae duellum est permittendum, quia pari passu ambulat cum vitae,</hi> duels may be permitted (say some Casuists) for the vindication of ones name, because when a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is lost, he is as good as dead.

               <argument>
                  <p>The excellent order of the Commandments. Why God himself appointed a set time for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship. Why this Commandment is larger then the rest. Six special things to be observed in this Commandment, which are not in the rest. The general parts of it. 1. The precept. 2. The reasons. In the precept. 1. The affirmative part what is meant by Sabbath: what by sanctifying? How things sanctifyed differ from other things. God sanctified it not for himself, but for us. We must sanctifie it. 1. In our estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. 2. In our use of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS Gods order in all his works is most excellent (for he is the God of<note place="margin">The order of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> order) so in the placing of these Commandments, it is most admirable. For, in the First, he commands us to beleeve in a God, setleth Religion in us, and shews that he, and no other is that God, and how he is to be worshipped, <hi>Intus,</hi> within. 2. In the Second he prescribeth, how we are to behave our selves towards him in our exteriour worship, and how to expresse and manifest our inward affections towards him by our outward gesture. 3. In the Third, how his glorious name ought to be magnified, by our outward expression in our words, when we converse with others. These three first Commandments contain our general and perpetual duties towards God.</p>
               <p>Now in this fourth Precept (because men should not be left at liberty, when or at what time to perform these duties) God hath taken order for a set and certain<note place="margin">Lev. 23. 3.</note> time to that purpose, appointing a day, whereon to do it, and that more solemnly<note place="margin">Exod. 5. 3.</note> in a general, or publick meeting, or Assembly, which he elsewhere calleth an <hi>Holy Assembly;</hi> or <hi>Holy Convocation:</hi> that all men together may set forth, and make publick professions of their worship of him in fear, and give him honour,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59534:149"/>
praise and glory. As also to learn and be instructed in what hath past in former times, and how to behave themselves for the time to come, by laying the foundations of Religion: and lastly, to acknowledge as well the great goodnesse of God, and his benefits to us, as our duty and service to him.</p>
               <p>It is true which we usually say, and which the Heathen man did well see, that <hi>Publicorum cura minor,</hi> the care of publick matters is the least of all other: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, that which ought to be regarded by all, is regarded by few or none. And so no doubt men would have dealt with God for publick worship, had he not provided a particular day for himself, and setled it by a special Commandment; as we see in those that talk of a perpetual Sabbath, who come at length to keep no day at all. And therefore (God knowing our innate negligence in his service, which of right ought to be every ones care) did (by enacting this law) provide for a particular, and set time for it.</p>
               <p>This Commandment being of as large, or larger extent, and more copcious in words then the second, should work in us no lesse regard, and consideration of this,<note place="margin">Why this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is so large.</note> then of that. Nor is it in vain that God hath so enlarged it. Wee see that four duties of the second Table are ended in a word as it were. <hi>Non occides, Thou shalt not kill. Non moechaberis, Thou shalt not commit adultery. Non furaberis, Thou shalt not steal. Non falsum testimonium feres, Thou shalt not bear false witnesse.</hi> And the reason is, because civil honesty, and the writings of Heathen Philosophers, (who were chiefly guided by the light of Nature) and civil Laws urge the observing of them: and our Bars, and judgement seats condemn sins therein forbidden: but the fifth Commandment (because God foresaw our stiffenecked humours, that we would not willingly, or easily be brought under subjection) God thought it necessary to fence it with a reason. So likewise in the tenth there is great particularity used, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men are apt to conceive that their thoughts are free, and that they shall not come to judgement for using their liberty in them.</p>
               <p>In the first Table, every Commandment hath its particular reason; but this fourth Precept hath more then any. It hath six particular respects, not to be found in any<note place="margin">Six special things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in this Commandment.</note> of the other.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Whereas the rest run either barely in the affirmative, as the fifth, or barely in the negative, as the other: in this both parts are expressed. The affirmative in these words, <hi>Remember thou keep holy, &amp;c.</hi> and the negative in these, <hi>Thou shalt do no manner of work, &amp;c.</hi> so that a mans inclination to the breach of this Commandment, is both wayes met withall.</item>
                  <item>2. In this, This precept is not onely given to our selves, but to all others that belong to us, God proceeds here to a wonderful kinde of particularity, by a particular enumeration, comprehendeth all that with us, and by us may be violaters of this Commandment, naming all which he doth not in any of the other.</item>
                  <item>3. The other Commandments are imperative onely, and run in a peremptory way of command: whereas the word here used, though it be of the Imperative mood, yet it rather intreats then commands, <hi>Remember:</hi> and may serve as a note of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the other. <hi>Imperat &amp; suadet,</hi> it both commands and intreats.</item>
                  <item>4. And whereas the reasons of the former Commandments are terrible, fearful, and threatning; in this they are easy and reasonable; the main reason of this being, that no more is required to be done by us, then was done by God himself, we ought to do it, because God hath done it.</item>
                  <item>5. Whereas none of the rest have above one reason, to perswade and move us to the duty, this hath, besides one principal, <hi>tria statumina,</hi> three other props or reasons, so that it exceeds them all, in the multitude of reasons to perswade us to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it.</item>
                  <item>6. Lastly, to move and stir up our regard to this Commandment, in a more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, and that it might not be thought a light matter, either to break or keep it, as we are apt to think, God hath in the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The Commandment hath two parts. 1. A Precept. 2. The Aetimologie, that is,<note place="margin">The parts of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the Reasons, or the perswasions to keep it.</p>
               <p>The Precept contains in it, an affirmative part and a negative. The affirmative in<note place="margin">1 The Precept.</note>

               </p>
               <p>For the first, that we may understand it the better, we must know, what is meant by sabbath, and what by sanctifying. 1. Sabbath in the original signifieth rest, and such a rest which some labour hath gone before, a rest after labour <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> a ceasing, or intermission from labour. Such a rest is described in the law. When<note place="margin">Lev. 25. 3. 4.</note> the land had been laboured, and tilled six years before God gave the people charge, that it should lie fallow and rest the seaventh year, and this was a politick law. So after the labour of six dayes, God requireth here a cessation from work the seventh day, let that be a day set apart, rest on that day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The word [Sanctifie] is twice used in this commandment, in the beginning, and in the end, and is applied to two. 1. To God in the end (verse 11.) <hi>The Lord</hi>
                  <note place="margin">what is meant by sanctifying.</note> 
                  <hi>blessed and sanctified it.</hi> 2. To man (vers. 8.) <hi>remember the sabbath to sanctifie it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is a rule in divinity, that when any word is given to God, and man both, it is to be applied in a different respect, and so here this word ascribed to God, is to be understood, <hi>sub modo destinandi</hi> by way of appointing it so to be: and to man <hi>sub <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> by way of applying it to that it was appointed. So when God appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing to an holy vse, he is said to sanctifie it, and when man applieth it to the use to which God hath so appointed it, he is said also to sanctifie it.</p>
               <p>As it is sure, that by nature all men are alike before God, and differ not by nature,<note place="margin">How things sanctified differ from others Lev. 20. 26.</note> so may it be said of bread, water, wine, dayes &amp;c. by nature all are alike, and one is not more holy then another. Yet in the law, saith God, concerning the Israelites, <hi>I have separated you from other people, that you should be mine.</hi> When God setteth man a part that he should be his, either as a minister in the Church, or as a Magistrate in the commonwealth, then this his separation, or putting a part, is the beginning of his sanctifying.</p>
               <p>So water, which is separated from common uses, and destinated to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Creatures of Bread and wine, in the administration of the Lords supper, there is naturally no more in them, then in the other of the like kinde, till they be so separated and set apart from the other, and appropriated to God, and holy vses. So may we likewise say of dayes; naturally there is no more holines in one then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: onely Gods ordinance, by separating one day from another for himself, makes it to be more holy then the rest.</p>
               <p>Now it is the nature of such things, whether it be man or beast, so separated from common vse, and thereby sanctified to the Lord, that they must continue so, and be<note place="margin">Lev. 27. 28. 26</note> neither bought nor sold, nor other wayes alienated, Therefore we finde, that under the Law, <hi>the Tabernacle</hi> and whatsoever was vsed in it about the <hi>service of God,</hi> must be put to no other use, the <hi>fire-pans, flesh-hooks, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> made for the sacrifice,</hi> yea the basest instruments to stir the fire, and the meat in the caldron, whereof a <hi>libamen</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 28. 29. 30.</note> or offering was to be, should not be put into any other; nor <hi>the pots on no other fire</hi> nor <hi>the snuffers</hi> to any other <hi>lamp</hi> but to these in the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> So this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a thing sanctified, and it therein differeth from other things, that what is sanctified or separate for God, must not be converted or applied to any other use, and so for dayes, such as are sanctified or set apart for God, must be applied to no other use, unlesse God himself or his church by authority from him and that upon grounds warranted by God, dispence therein in some special cases. Other things may bedone in part upon other dayes, but not upon this. The Psalmist (as before) saith, <hi>he will meditate every day and night; and every day he wil praise God and give thanks</hi>
                  <note place="margin">psal. 1. 2. 145. 2. 55. 18. 119. 164.</note> 
                  <hi>to him:</hi> and <hi>in the evening, morning and at noon day, (thrice a day) he will pray.</hi> Nay <hi>seven times a day he will praise God:</hi> yet all these are but on part of the day for in the six dayes other things may be joyntly done, with those holy exercises, and may lawfully take up a part of the day: but this day being a most holy day, as sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to Gods use and service, must be sanctified, not in part, or joyntly with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployments, but must solely be kept to his service and use.</p>
               <p>Now a question may arise, whether God sanctified this day to himself, or to<note place="margin">God sanctified, this day for us. Tit. 1. 15.</note> us? Certainly the Apostle tells us, that <hi>omnia munda mundis, all things are cleane to the clean:</hi> and God is most pure and holy, and therefore needs nothing to be sanctified to him therefore this sanctifying must needs be for us. And the same Apostle<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>this is the will of God even your</hi> (not his) <hi>sanctification, for without holines</hi>

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:59534:150"/>
                  <hi>none shall see God:</hi> and therefore to the end that we might be holy, did he sanctifie this day, his word and other things &amp;c. And so by the second part of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9.</note> by annexing a blessing to this day, <hi>he blessed it</hi> and made it holy, as in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Eucharist <hi>he blessed the bread</hi> (and his <hi>dicere</hi>) is <hi>facere</hi> he gave it pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to increase holines in us. And as to the bread there, so to this day here, he hath annexed a special blessing, whereby it is sanctified to us, and that in a twofold respect. 1. <hi>Relative,</hi> as applied to the means of holines, prayer, word, &amp;c. As a thing may be said to be holy, as the place where <hi>Moses</hi> stood, as also, all that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 26.</note> to the Tabernacle, because they were applied to the means of holines. 2. <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 3. 5.</note> in regard of the fruit of holines, which is wrought in us on that day, and practized in our selves, <hi>Sanctificamini et sancti estote.</hi> Be sanctified and be holy.</p>
               <p>So that all which hath bin said, amounteth to thus much. God hath set apart or sanctified this day, to the end that it may be applied wholly, either to the means of sanctification, as hearing the word, prayer, meditation, and other religious duties; or to the practize of sanctification, by these means wrought in us. And he sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it or gave it a blessing, that what means we use this day of sanctification, shall be two fold blessed, and of more effect and force to us, then what we do upon another day, not sanctified and set apart as this is.</p>
               <p>Now seeing God hath so sanctified it, it is our duties, that as he hath sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, with is blessing, we must do the like, and sanctifie it too, which consists in two things. 1. In our estimation and accompt of it, which is for our judgement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly in the use of it, which is for our Practize.<note place="margin">We must sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it.</note>

               <p>NOw here are two things, and both commanded, but not alike or equally, but the one for the other. 1.

               <p>To make it plain. The heathen by the light of nature could see, that every thing is then best ordered, when it hath but one Office, and is ordained to do but one thing at once, for whatsoever would be throughly done would be done alone: the reason is, because we are <hi>res <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59534:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at once, and together, one will be done imperfectly, because our thoughts will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted between both, for part of our thoughts will be taken of, when they are set upon several objects. so that we cannot wholly intend two things at once. It was <hi>Adams</hi> case in the state of Inno cency: for he having a natural soul and finite, was not able to intend the dressing of the garden commanded him, and the sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 15.</note> of the sabbath together, and therefore God would have him imploy six dayes upon the first, and <hi>blessed the seventh day</hi> to be bestowed in his worship. And this<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 3.</note> was the end why God instituted, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against distraction, especially in the solemne worship of God, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to take up the whole man, and ought to be without all distractions and therefore permitteth none to be intent to any other thing during the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it.</p>
               <p>Now if <hi>Adam</hi> in that estate could not be free from distraction, much more have we need of remedy against it. And therefore is this rest and ceasing from servile work commanded, to free us from it, and to further our sanctification: and thus cometh in this rest, because this total sanctification cannot be performed without ceasing from labour and doing our own works: for without rest we cannot sanctifie: and if our rest should hinder our sanctification it ought to be taken away and omitted.</p>
               <p>And indeed our Saviour Christ acknowledgeth, that <hi>man was not made for</hi>

               <p>The scope of this reverend Author, is not here to prove, that the command of the<note place="margin">Addit. 21.

               <p>And although his opinion seems to be, that the Lords day which we observe, instead of the sabbath, is <hi>jure divino,</hi> (in which point learned men do differ, and of which we shall speak something hereafter) yet, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But we have a more sure ground then all these. The Lords day hath testimony in Scripture: I insist upon that that Easter day must needs be as ancient as it. For how came it to be the Lords day, but that as it is in the <hi>Psalm, The Lord made it?</hi> And why made he it? but because <hi>the<note place="margin">psal. 118. 24. Aug.

Where he plainly affirmes, the Lords day to be so made, by the Lord himself and that because Christ rose upon that day.</p>
               <p>Now for the other point, that the jews sabbath was ceremonial, and abrogated by Christs death, is proved at large by his speech in star-chamber against Trask, published <hi>inter opera posthuma,</hi> where among other things he speaks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Apostle (<hi>inter alia</hi>) reckoning up diverse others concludes with the sabbath,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59534:151"/>
and immediately upon it addes; <hi>Which all are but shadows of things to come,</hi> (Sabbath and all) <hi>but the body is Christ.</hi> The body had, the shadow to vanish; that which was to come, when it is come, to what end any figure of it? it ceaseth too. That to hold the shadow of the Sabbath is to continue, is to hold Christ the bodie is not yet come.</p>
               <p>It hath been ever the Churches doctrine, That Christ made an end of all Sabbaths by his Sabbath in the grave. That Sabbath was the last of them, and that the Lords day came presently in place of it. <hi>Dominicus dies Christi resurrectione declaratus est Christianis, &amp; ex illo caepit habere festivitatem suam,</hi> saith Augustine, <hi>The Lords</hi>

                  <hi>day was by the resurrection of Christ declared to be the Christians day, and from that very time (of Christs resurrection) it began to be celebrated as the Christian mans festival.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Sabbath had reference to the old creation, <hi>but in Christ we are a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> a new creation by him, and so to have a new Sabbath, and <hi>vetera transierunt,</hi> no<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7.</note> reference to the old, We.</p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59534:151"/>
for his vertue, for his labour, and for his sufferings, but above all, great for his Creed. <hi>Tertullian</hi> had written a book <hi>de cibis Judaicis,</hi> (which we have) so another <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now as in the other of meats, so in this will I end with censure. It is of the Councel of Laodicea (more ancient then the first of Nice) and of so special account, as we finde it cited by S. <hi>Basil:</hi> nay, as we finde four of the Canons made in this Council, taken out of it, and transferd and made four of the Canons of the great Council of Nice, such was the Authority it was had in.

                  </gap>, let them be <hi>Anathema a Deo &amp;christo,</hi> to God and Christ both. Thus far this learned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; by which discourse made and penned in his latter years, it appears fully what his opinion was in this point of the Sabbath, and how his meaning is to be expounded in this point of the morality of the day. See more of this subject in the third Chapter, <hi>per totum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is here besides in the Commandment another word [<hi>Remember</hi>] which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is properly of a thing past, it referreth us to some time or place before: and there is no mention of the sabbath but in two places before: the one of them is in <hi>Exodus,</hi> but that is not the place here meant: for God in the end of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adding [<hi>God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> it, &amp;c.</hi>] referreth us to that other place where those words are; namely to, <hi>Genesis</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>And by this occasion falleth in that first question about the morality of the day: many think the sabbath is meerly a ceremony, and are perswaded that it is so, and therefore hold, that men are not bound to sanctifie it since Christs time, it being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated by him. In answer whereto we are to follow our Saviours rule, who in the case of Polygamie, bids us inquire how it was <hi>ab initio,</hi> from the beginning, to call it to the first institution: for the first institution is that which will inform our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments best, and the first end which appears by the institution is the true end.</p>
               <p>A thing is not said to be meerly ceremonial, if a ceremonial use or end be annexed to it, for then scarce any of the ten Commandments but should be ceremonial, for they have many of them some ceremony annexed to them.</p>
               <p>But that is to be accounted ceremonial whose first and principal end is to be a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to type out something, which this day of rest cannot be said to do. The reason is, because Paradise and mans perfection cannot consist with ceremonies, a ceremony cannot agree to the state of mans innocency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is to be understood of such Ceremonies as had reference to Christ as a Redeemer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Annot. 23. of Ceremonies.</note> 
                  <hi>and so the ensuing words expound these, for otherwise ceremonies which have a moral signification, or were instituted for other ends might stand with mans estate in Paradise, for what was the tree of life but a ceremony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reason of that is, because that before there was a Saviour, there could not be a type of a Saviour, as ceremonies were; and before there was sin, there needed no Saviour: and so consequently needing no Saviour, there needed no ceremony, and needing no Saviour, nor ceremony, it could not be ceremonial.</p>
               <p>But this was it, that <hi>Adam</hi> (having in the six dayes a natural use in his body of the creatures) should for the glory of God on the seventh day have a spiritual use and consideration of them in a more special manner. And although there might be a worship performed to God on other dayes, yet that it might be more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, publick, and universal, and the heart of man more free from distraction, and wordly avocations, God therefore would have a speciall day dedicated to his honour and service, wherein the Creature should solemnly performe his homage to the Creator, and this was the first generall end, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends were after added: as in <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> it pleased God to adde this reason, that the People should remember their Delivery out of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59534:152"/>
Egypt, but this was but <hi>finis posterior,</hi> a particular and after end, and accessory. And it were well if we might adde to our dayes of rest the memory of benefits received. And in <hi>Exodus</hi> God yieldeth a reason taken from a politick end, that our family and cattel may rest, and return more fresh to their labour.</p>
               <p>And if any will say, that besides these ends, there was prefigured by this rest, that rest we shall have from sin; Its true, but yet that is but an accessory end. As in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Circumcision and Passeover, besides the general ends of their institution, which were to seal and signify Gods preventing and following grace, there were other ends typical and accessory: as that of Circumcision did signifie the Circumcision of the heart, and the Passover the sacrifice of Christ offered upon the cross. In which respects, though those two Sacraments are abolisht, yet the Sacrament of initiation, and another of our confirmation in grace are still continued, to wit, Baptism and the Lords supper, according to the general ends of the two former Sacraments, which ends do still remain. So though the Sabbath or seventh day from the Creation be ceased, yet there is another day still remaining, because the end of keeping a day is immutable from the beginning, to wit, that God might be honoured by a solemne and publick worship.</p>
               <p>This reason of it self is so forcible and plain, that without bringing in a manifest absurdity it cannot be denyed and avoided. When they see these ends carry us to the Institution, and that in Paradise where no type or Ceremony was, they seek to avoid it by saying, Its true, <hi>that God sanctified it in Paradise,</hi> but <hi>Adam</hi> never kept it, neither was it kept till immediately before the Law was given: which may seem to be a very absurd thing, that God should sanctifie a thing two thousand years before it was to be put in practise. This is like to that assertion of those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, that held, the <hi>materia prima</hi> to be made by God many years before the world it self, and that it abode by him, till the world was made. But they are confuted by the Fathers thus, That no wise man will make any thing to be many years by him, before he shall have occasion to put it to any use. And therefore much lesse would God bless this day before there should be any use of it: to make <hi>rem ante usum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We must understand, that God in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> seemeth to make a distinction between Ceremonies and the Moral Law, <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 4. 13, 14. as, that the one proceeded from himself immediately: the other by the ministery of <hi>Moses,</hi> so also <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> 5. 31.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again it breeds confusion, and breaks order (a thing which God misliketh) if any thing meerly ceremonial and not in some sort moral should be placed among the ten Commandments. One of the Fathers upon the words [<hi>Nunquid &amp; Saul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> inter Prophetas? Is Saul also among the Prophets?</hi>] saith, that <hi>Saul</hi> being no Prophet by profession, <hi>est heterogeneus,</hi> of another kinde, and an irregular person among the Prophets: so it will fall out to be against order, for a meer ceremonial Precept, to stand in the midst of moral Commandments. For every ceremony or type of the Law, is as it was a foretelling of something in the Gospel; so it must be referred to the Gospel, as the shadow to the body. And indeed no typical ceremonies are in their own nature, for the type or ceremony is to cease when the substance comes, as the shadow when the body appears. But this Commandment for the substance of it, continues in the time of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, this being a principle, that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> (expressed in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue) is nothing but the Law of nature revived, and the Law of nature being a resemblance of Gods image. If we say this precept is in its substance ceremonial, then we must also say, that in the image of God something is ceremonial, not to abide, but for a time onely: but all things in him, and in his image are eternal according to his Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the Law of grace, Christ delivering the sum of the ten Commandments to the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> theres no question, but that it is the sum of the Decalogue, and therefore therein is included the religious observation of the Sabbath, and so it will be for the substance moral, as the love of God is, in which it is contained, or else our Saviour had delivered an imperfect sum.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, it is dangerous to hold, that any precept in the Decalogue is ceremonial: for by this the Papists (as <hi>Parisius</hi> and <hi>Politianus</hi>) will bring another of them to be so, and will say, that the second Commandment concerning images is ceremonial, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59534:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then why not three as well as two, and so four and five, and all. The best way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to hold the duties eternall, and to keep them without blemish is to deny that any of these ten precepts is ceremonial in the substance or nature of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that they are plainly moral.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To come to the time of the Gospel. We hold that all typical ceremonies of the law are ended and abrogated by Christs death. Then if the day of rest be not abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by his death, it is not a meer Ceremony or ceremonial. And that it is not, is plain by our Saviour himself for his denouncing the destruction of Jerusalem bids them pray that their calamity fall not in the winter, nor on the Sabbath day: Now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed many years after Christs death, when all ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were ended. Therefore if Christ knew that the Sabbath as a ceremony should be wholly abrogated by his death, his counsel might well have bin spared, that they should pray that their flight might not be on the Sabbath day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. which if it had been quite abolished, should have been no day.</p>
               <p>Again in things meerly ceremonia', there is not <hi>commutatio,</hi> a change, but <hi>abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> an abrogating of them wholly: but we see in this matter of the Sabbath, there is <hi>commutatio,</hi> not <hi>abrogatio,</hi> the Lords day is appointed instead of the Sabbath; but no total abrogation of the Sabbath. Thus the seals of the Covenant though they had something typical, yet being in their general nature moral, therefore they are changed, but not quite abrogated, whereas in things meerly typical, theres no maner of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but they are clean taken away: for Christ having broken down the partition wall, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 14, 15. hath wholly taken away the law of ordinances, &amp;c. But it is manifest, that instead of the Jews seventh day, another seventh day was ordained in the Apostles dayes; therefore as the ministery and seals of the Covenant, and the chief place of it, to wit the Temple, were not abolished but changed, as having a moral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in them; so also was the day of the Covenant; for we read. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Disciples came together on the first day of the week, to hear the word, and to break bread, and in 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 16. 2. the Apostle wills them in their meetings on the first day of the week to lay aside for the poor, and <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 10. it is plainly called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Lords day.</p>
               <p>So that we see in the whole time of the Apostles it was not taken away, but changed by them, and therefore cannot be a meere ceremonie, nor of the nature of the types of the Law. But when the old Covenant ceased, then ceased the Ministery thereof: the Priesthood of <hi>Levi</hi> was changed, and given to choice men of all Tribes, and instead of it is our Ministery. And as the seals of the Covenant ceased as of Circumcision and the Paschal lamb, and in place thereof came our Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords supper: so the day of the old Covenant is taken away, and instead thereof is put the Lords day, none of them in the first end being ceremonial, but having a continual use, and to last as long as the Church militant.</p>
               <p>The reasons which might seem to have moved the Apostles to change this day may be fitly taken from the Institution of the Sabbath in the time of the law. For as then nothing was more memorable then the day of the creation: so when it pleased God that old things should cease, and that there should be a new creation, and that there was a benefit, that did overshadow the former, the benefit of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; therefore when that was accomplished by Christs resurrection, from that day we celebrate the memorial of it on the first day of the week, and whereas that other great work of the sending the holy Ghost, which was fifty dayes after, concurd on the same day, whereby that inestimable benefit of sanctification and speaking with strange tongues was conferred upon the Church, and because the memory of the benefit of the creation may also be kept on the first day of the week, as well as on the last. Hence we may see upon what great reasons this day is establisht, wherein do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the three special works and benefits of the three persons to be for ever thankfully remembred, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Creation by the Father, Redemption by the Son, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification by the holy Ghost. And so much for the clearing of that point.</p>

                     </gap> by School-men, Canonists, and reasons. 2. Certain that the law of nature doth not dictate the proportion of seven or any other in particular. 3. It is most probable that the seventh day was appointed by God from the beginning, as a day of publick worship in memory of the creation, and did oblige all mankinde: though the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical or typical rest afterwards was enjoyned to the Jews onely: this proved from Scripture, Fathers, Jewish Doctors, late Divines, reasons, &amp;c. How the Fathers are to be understood that deny Sabbatizing before the Mosaical Law. 4. The Lords day is of divine institution, proved by Scripture, Fathers, publick declarations of the Church, Edicts of Princes, Canonists some School-men, late Divines. 5 The fourth Commandment is in force: for the moral equity, that at least a seventh part be given to God; literally it requires onely the seventh day from the creation, not a seventh day. The day altered by the Apostles by special authority. 6. The rest of the Jewish sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath partly moral, which continues still: partly symbolical, which is expir'd. How the rest of the Lords day differs from the rest of Iewish sabbath, rest from ordinary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours forbidden by God, but the special determination left to the Church. How the Lords day succeeds the sabbath. 7. The sabbath kept with the Lords day by the Primitive Christians till the Council of Laodicea was not in a Jewish manner.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is certain that some time ought to be set apart for publick worship, and that this is required by the law of nature, which dictates to every one, that as<note place="margin">vide Scholast in Sent. 3. d.</note> God ought to be worshipped, so some special time must be set apart for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:<note place="margin">37. et in 4. d.</note> and therefore as when God created the world, he is said to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created time with it, so when he commands a publick worship, he commands<note place="margin">27. et. 38. et in Tho. 2. 2. q.</note> withall some time for that use, without which it cannot be performed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">112.

It is moral, that every man depute some time for religious duties; and with him joyntly agree all the rest of the Schoolmen, modern divines and<note place="margin">13. et 15. Sot. l. 2. de Just. &amp;. iure. Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stas in Cap. 1. de Feriis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. polit. p. 378.</note> others. The very law of nature, saith our learned Hooker, requires no lesse the sanctification of times, then of places, persons, and things; for which cause it hath plased God heretofore, as of the rest, so of times likewise to exact some part by way of perpetual homage. And so we finde the Heathen, which had no other then the law of nature to direct them, had their solemne feasts and set dayes appointed for the worship of their supposed deities. This therefore I lay down as certain because questionedby none,</p>
               <p n="2">2. I conceive it to be likewise certain, that the law of nature doth not in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular dictate, what day or time ought to be set apart for publick worship, but that the determination of the time or dayes in special, is from positive laws, either of God or men, and therefore that the limitation of a seventh day, or the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day from the creation, or any other particular proportion cannot be deduced necessarily from any natural principle, but must be referrd to some positive law either divine or humane.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59534:153"/>
This appears in that there can no natural reason be given, why one day more then another, or why a seventh rather then a sixth, or eighth, should necessarily be consecrated to God, all dayes being in themselves alike, and none in themselves more excellent then others, those things which are natural, and simply or purely moral, are evident to all by the light of nature, or may by necessary consequence be deduced from some principle which is evident, such laws concern things good or evil in themselves; and therefore do immutably binde all persons in all places alike: but the limitation of a special day is not, it is neither a principle evident in it self, nor can by necessary consequence be derived from any such principle, and therefore cannot be referred to any natural law or dictate of reason. Therefore not only the schoolmen generally (<hi>nemine contradicente</hi>) with the Casuists and Canonists, but the most modern divines, some few excepted, do generally agree in this, as well as in the former conclusion; and though some make the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords day under the Gospel to be unchangable, and so in some sort mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as the sabbath was under the law; yet this they ground not upon any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural law, but upon positive divine Law: and those that seem to make it a dictate<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 15. &amp; 24. 18.</note> of nature, mean nothing else, but that there is a congruity in reason, and that this time being fixt by Christ is unalterable by any humane power. The reason given by some, why a <hi>memento</hi> is prefixed before the fourth Commmandement, and none else, is because that Nature doth not dictate any particular day, and therefore men need to be put in minde of the day appointed by God. <hi>Filencius tract.</hi> 27. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 4. <hi>Ex Thom.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 100. <hi>a.</hi> 7. &amp; 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 122. <hi>a.</hi> 4. <hi>ad.</hi> 3. <hi>Bonavent.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is probable that the seventh day was appointed by positive divine law, from the begining, as the day for publick worship to praise God for the creation of the world, &amp;c. and so did oblige all mankinde; though as a Sabbath or day of symbolical rest, it was afterward particularly given to the Jews by <hi>Moses.</hi> For it is the opinion not only of some Jewish Doctors, but of learned men among our selves, that in the 4<hi rend="sup">h</hi> Commandment, the sanctifying of the seventh day, and the rest then commanded, are several distinct things, and that the first refer to the creation of the world, as the cause; the other to the Egyptian bondage out of which they were delivered, and that therefore the one belonged to all men, the other onely to the Jews, for which cause the Sabbath is said to be a signe between God and them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. of which opinion seem to be <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. and <hi>Euseb. hist.</hi> 1. <hi>cap</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>And thus that of <hi>Genesis</hi> 2. of <hi>Gods blessing and sanctifying the seventh day,</hi> may be expounded cleerly and litterally without any forced interpretation, that God did then sanctifie and appoint that day to be kept holy by a joyful remembrance of the creation, and by other holy duties solemnly to be performed to him as Creator of all, that being the birth day of the world, <note n="†" place="margin">Phil. de mund <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Brerewood, <hi>Bp</hi> White. <hi>Dr</hi> Dowe, and others.</note>, both ancient and modern do otherwise<note place="margin">l. 19. c. 1.</note> expound the words, either of Gods sanctifying the day in himself, by a rest or cessation from those emanations of his power and goodnesse, or by destinating the day to be observed afterwards, or that the words are spoken by anticipation, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> writing that history after the Sabbath was given, saith that Gods resting on the seventh day, was the cause why afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Law was given, he sanctified that day; yet the other exposition seems to be more cleer and genuine, that the sanctification by holy duties was commanded then, and that the rest from all labours was one of the ceremonies given afterwards to the Jews. And to this those words of <hi>Moses, Deuter.</hi> 5. 12. seem to relate: when after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of sanctifying the Sabbath day, he addes, <hi>As the Lord thy God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee,</hi> to wit, long before from the beginning of the world, and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10

                  <hi>for joy?</hi> that upon the seventh day when the world was finisht, the Angels, who who are stiled the sons of God kept the sabbath. And though I will not peremptorily affirme that the Angels kept it, yet I take it to be very probable, that the people of God, the Patriarches and other holy men as they had publick sacrifices and forms of worship, so they had some set times for the ordinary performance thereof, which is most likely to have been on this day, it is hardly credible that in the time of <hi>Enoch</hi> men should separate themselves from the sons of <hi>Cain,</hi> by calling upon the name of the Lord (that is by some publick worship, and as learned <hi>Drusius</hi> thinks by some publick forms or liturgies) without some set and solemn time for<note place="margin">Deus amit. in Gen. 4. 26.</note> the performance thereof.

And therefore<note place="margin">Hookers po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. l. 5. n. 17.</note> though there be no expresse mention of any such dayes, yet I make no question but they observed some, and if any, then surely this day. Besides, the ceasing of the<note place="margin">Exod-16.</note> manna to fall upon the seventh day, for some time before the Law was given, is an argument that the sabbath was known before as a day sacred to God, though it begun then first to be kept as a day of rest, which was afterwards prescribed by a law.

               <p n="4">4. The fourth conclusion, which I shall propound likewise as probable at least is, that the Lords day which the Christian Church observes instead of the sabbath is of divine institution, that as the seventh day from the Creation was instituted by God himself, by a positive law obliging all the world, so the Lords day is by positive Law obliging all Christians to the end of all the world, instituted by authority from Christ, who changed the day by his resurrection from the seventh to the first day
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59534:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the week, and that the Apostles published and ordained it, not as ordinary rulers and gouernours of the Church, but as speciall extraordinary legates of Christ, by order from him; and therefore the Church now hath no power to alter this day. This assertion follows upon the former; for if the sabbath was instituted by God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, and did oblige all mankinde, as we have shewed already for the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part of it, as a day of publick worship and praise to the honour of the Creator and that the ceremonial and symbolical part by a typicall rest from labour was that' which properly concerned the Jews, then it wil necessarily follow, that the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath onely in this latter respect expired at the death of Christ; and that the other part, which was the observation of the seventh day as a day of publick praise in honour of the Creatour of all, having no reference to Christ, (for wherein did the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a certain day for divine worship typifie Christ or his benefits?) but being grounded upon moral reasons, and not given onely to the Jews, ought to continue still, unlesse it were altered by the same authority, to wit, divine: and therefore the day being altered <hi>de facto,</hi> as appears by the perpetual practise of the Christian Church, to the first day of the week, it will clearly follow, that this could be done by no lesse then divine authority, and so the observation of the Lords day may be truely said to be <hi>Jure divino,</hi> as enjoyned by him who is Lord of the sabbath, and therefore had power to alter the day; which he did by his Apostles. Neither is it needful (which some vrge) that a cleere precept of Christ should be brought for this out of the new testament. It is sufficient, if by necessary consequence it can be deduced from scripture: and though in matters of faith, which are of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity to salvation for all to know, it may be granted, that they are all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in scripture; yet for other matters that concern the discipline, order and government, of the Church, it was not necessary to have them expressed in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (though many of them be occasionally mentioned) it was sufficient, that they might be known by the daily practise of the Church, wherein every one might read them written in large and Capital letters: which universal practise and traditio of<note place="margin">vide Hug.</note> the Church in these matters he that shall denie or question, may by the like reason<note place="margin">Grot. votum pro pace.</note> question the authors and number of the books of Canonical scripture, and whether they were written by men divinely inspired, and so by consequence may question the<note place="margin">p. 140. 141. &amp; discuss. apol.</note> authority of the scripture it self, which is conveyed to us no otherwise, then by<note place="margin">Revit. p. 173. 174. &amp;c.</note> the universal and Catholick tradition of the Church. Besides how dangerous it is, that the publick exercise of Christian religion, should depend upon so week a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as authority humane, wch may alter its own constitutions, &amp; is subject to manifold errours, I leave to the prudent and judicious Christian to consider. The Lords day then I conceive to be grounded upon divine authority, not onely in regard that all authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is from God, and so divine; for so all humane laws might be said to be by divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:<note place="margin">Treatise of the Sabbath.</note> for it is true which learned <hi>Breerewood</hi> saith, there may be divine authority for humane decrees: and as <hi>Molina</hi> saith well, <hi>Licet quae a regia &amp; aliis legitimis inferiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>

But I mean by divine authority, that which is immediately divine in regard of the subject, God, or Christ himself, who ordained and appointed this day, though it were publisht to the world by the Apostles, as the messengers of Christ, as they publisht the Gospel, and those things for which they had commission from Christ. It is true that the Apostles instituted other things as ordinary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the Church, which are in themselves changeable, as cannot be denied, as their orders about widows, saluting with a holy kisse. and the like, which are now antiquated. But that the Lords day was not of this latter sort, but of the former, besides the former reasons, which are stronger then any I have seen to the contrary, may be likewise evinced by the testimony of the Church, and of the most learned and eminent Doctors of it in several ages, whose testimony in matters of fact and

Now to these reasons and testimonies, if we adde, How Christ honoured that day with his resurrection, his apparitions to his Disciples after: and sending the Holy Ghost on that day: the practise of the Apostles and the first Christians, having their religious meetings on that day, the title of <hi>the Lords day,</hi> which it had given in S. <hi>Johns</hi> time, together with those high titles and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums of the day, given by <hi>Ignatius, Chrysostome, Athanasius, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="5">5. Fiftly, concerning the fourth Commandment, whether it be in force, or what we are tied to, by vertue of the fourth Commandment, I answer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is certain, there is a moral equity in the fourth Commandment, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to us under the Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi> that some time be set apart for publick worship, and that not lesse then a seventh part; for if God thought it fit in his wisdom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a seventh part before Christs coming, in all reason, we that live now after his coming, ought to give him as much at least, we having received greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits then they that lived before Christ by Christ now exhibited; and having better and clearer promises with a greater measure of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. now ordinarily given, so that a greater measure of mortification to the world is now required, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought as little, or rather far lesse then they to minde worldly affairs, and to have our thoughts more raised up to heavenly things. In regard of which moral equity, this precept extends to all times and persons, and is therefore put among the other Commandements which are purely moral, and so retaines its power of obligation, and therefore the Church hath just cause to retain it in the Liturgie, and by that usuall <hi>Antiphona</hi> at the end of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as of the rest; to pray, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and encline our hearts to keep this Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, in regard of the particular day litterally enjoyned by this Commandment: it is certain it doth not oblige any since Christ, for the special day here required, is the seventh from the Creation, not a seventh day in general, (as some without any ground affirme) but that seventh day in special which was then observed, which was no other then the seventh from the Creation, for though the first part of the Commandement specifies not the day, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires onely to sanctifie the Sabbath, yet the reason added doth plainly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the day to the seventh day from the Creation, and cannot be extended to the Lords day without manifest absurdity, for who would not think this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ridiculous, God made heaven and earth in six dayes, and rested on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, therefore we ought, in imitation of him, to rest on the first day when he began to work, besides that the text saith expressely, that the Lord bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the seventh day and hallowed it, that is, not a seventh day, but that seventh day, <hi>viz.</hi> the seventh from the Creation. And therefore those who would ground the Lords day upon the letter of the fourth Commandment, must of necessity fall into Judaisme, and observe the Saturday Sabbath, which was the errour of <hi>Brabourn</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

and were learnedly confuted by two learned Bishops, of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Eli,</hi> the one in a speech in Star-Chamber, now extant; the other in a full tract of this subject.</p>
               <p>But though the day be altered from the last to the first day of the week, yet I do not therefore say, that the seventh day from the Creation was ceremonial, or expired as a ceremony at Christs death, as is commonly said by some Divines, for wherein could the keeping of a seventh day typifie Christ or his benefits, but it was observed as a positive Law, yet of divine institution; and being no natural Law, but depending upon Gods will and pleasure, might therefore by the same authority, when the new creation was finished by Christs resurrection, (which overshadowed the first creation) be altered to another day in memory of that greater benefit, and so accordingly it was.</p>

               <p>Now for the rest required of us on the Lords day, it is not the same with that of the Iews, but differs. 1. Because rest is now required onely in reference to the holy duties, which cannot otherwise be performed, not for it self, as if it were pleasing to God, or the works of mens callings unlawfull, but that they might give way to works of a higher nature, to sacred duties, which if they be not performed, the rest is a meere mockery, <hi>Sabbatum asinorum:</hi> whereas the rest of the Iewish<note place="margin">Col. 2. 16.</note> Sabbath was required for it self, they were to <hi>rest</hi> in their <hi>rest;</hi> and hence it was, that the Iewish sabbath is reckoned by S. <hi>Paul</hi> among the shadows that vanisht at Christs coming, and the Fathers generally make the Commandment of the sabbath ceremonial, which if any should now observe, he should thereby revive Judaisme, and in effect deny, that Christ the body is come; as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the place alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Aug. de spir. &amp; lit. cap. 14.</note> and elsewhere. <hi>Quisquis diem illum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Now if any shall ask what labours and works we must abstain from, and how long seeing to rest onely in the time of publick worship may seem to be enough in reference to the performance of holy duties. I conceive it the most probable answer, that herein we must be directed in particular, by the Laws, Canons, and Customes of the Church wherein we live, and that by divine Law, as the sanctifying of the day is required in general, so the resting from our ordinary labours in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that end, is onely required in general by the Law of God, but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular determination, of what works, and how long, and in what manner with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59534:156"/>
Bishops and Pastors of the Church, for as God hath commanded publique worship, by prayer, and praises, &amp;c in general, but the modification of it, for form, order, time and manner of performance, hath been left to the Church, who hath alwayes ordered these things, and altered them as there was occasion: so for the abstinence from labours, what rest may be necessary not onely in the time of publick duties, but before and after, as preparatives thereto, and means of better profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, by meditations and other exercises; and for the more solemnity of the day, for these, and the like, I do not finde that Christ hath given any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rules, but that every one is herein to submit to the Canons, and orders of the Church, and to conform himself thereto, and that this conformity in obedience to God, who requires us to hear the Church, and obey our Pastors, is acceptable to God: and therefore those that will not rest herein, but look for particular directions out of Scripture for every thing, which indeed they cannot finde, by writing what ever they finde about the Sabbath, and applying it to the Lords day, do unawares sall into Judaisme, and perplex mens consciences into inextricable Laborynths; as daily experience shews; whereas the constant practise of the Church of Christ in all ages shews, that in these things she did use that authority which Christ hath given her, as appears by the several constitutions both Ecclesiastical and Civil; sometimes enlarging, and sometimes restraining the liberty of people in these matters.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that though the Fathers usually say, that all the glory of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is transferred to the Lords day; and though it be commonly said, that the Lords day succeeds the Sabbath, yet the truth is, that it succeeds not properly, as the Heir doth his Father; at least it is not <hi>Heres ex asse,</hi> as Civilians speak, but as the light follows darknes, and the substance the shadow; in regard that the rest of the Jews Sabbath, as it was symbolical is expired, and onely what was grounded upon moral equity in it, is continued in the Lords day, in which for the particular manner of observing we must look to the canons and customs of the Church, which are of such force in these things, that though by the common Canon-law all festivals are from evening to evening. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>de Feriis. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Before we conclude this observation about the Sabbath, it may be fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, why it was so long observed after our Saviour, together with the Lords day; for we finde, that for many years after the Apostles times, the Sabbath was kept, as well as the Lords day, until the Councel of Laodicea, which was not long before the Councel of Nice, and that it is still observed among the <hi>Abyssines:</hi> and that <hi>Balsam.</hi> saith, that the holy Fathers <gap reason="foreign">

And from this cause it was, that <hi>Constantine</hi> (whose Edict we may read in <hi>Eusebius</hi> for the free exercise of Christian Religion) forbids, that they should be impleaded on the Sabbath or Saturday, as well as on the Sunday; because both dayes were observed with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings. And in the Synod of Laodicea, it was appointed, that besides the Law, (which was anciently read upon the Saturdayes) the Gospel should be also read on that day. By all which it may seem, that the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Sabbath, and the Lords day, are both to be kept; and by some learned
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59534:157"/>
men it is hence urged, that the sunday doth not succeed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>But to this I answer, 1. That the sabbath was for some time used as a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as were some other legal rites in favour of the Jews, and that they might be the lesse offended, and more easily gained to the Christian Church: as <hi>S. Paul</hi> circumcised <hi>timothy,</hi> and <hi>S. Peter</hi> abstained from some meats, &amp;c. not as things necessary but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. That though the legal rites were void at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">3. That though holy duties were performed in public on the Saturday, for many years, yet the symbolical and typical rest, which was proper to the Jewish sabbath, was not allowed, or practised in the Church, and therefore when some began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> on the Saturday, by resting on that day, it was forbid by several Councels, as that of Laodicea <hi>cap.</hi> 29. the Councel of Lyons <hi>in cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de consecr. d.</hi> 3. and the Sabbatarians were generally condemned for Hereticks. And therfore the observing of Saturday as a half holy day, as it is still in a manner kept in many places with us, was not with reference to the Jewish sabbath, but for the more honour of the Lords day, as a preparative to that great festival: and therefore though the Church did allow some publick meetings on that day in the Church, yet we never finde that the symbolical rest, which is the proper and characteristical difference of the Jewish sabbath from Christian festivals was ever allowed, but generally condemned.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with these observations and positions which I conceived necessary to insert concerning the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <argument>
                  <p>Reasons of this Commandment. 1. Gods liberality in allowing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Gods rest from the creation. Addition 22. Moral reasons sometimes given of a ceremonial precept. The reason why a rest, and why on this day, are different things: out of Maimon, Aben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezra. 2. Reason, the benefit coming to mankinde by the creation. 3. Reason God blessed the seventh day.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the three next verses (namely the ninth, tenth and eleventh) God first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth<note place="margin">Reasons of this Commandment.</note> his meaning, or gives an explication or further exposition of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, verse 9. &amp; 10. and then gives a reason of the Commandment, verse 11, why they should yield obedience to it. In the explication there is order taken as well concerning works, as persons. First for works, <hi>Six dayes shalt thou labour, &amp;c.</hi> verse 9. Secondly for persons, <hi>Thou and thy son, &amp;c.</hi> verse 10. And again in the same verses there is, 1. An Affirmative, <hi>Six dayes thou shalt labour, &amp;c.</hi> verse 9. and 2. secondly, A Negative, <hi>Thou shalt do no manner of work, &amp;c.</hi> verse 10. Again, there is 1. a Permission. Six dayes God hath given thee wherein thou mayest labour, and do all that thou hast to do. 2. And secondly an Opposition or Antithesis, But the seventh day he hath reserved to himself. Six dayes are thine, but the seventh his. He hath bestowed six dayes on thee, but the seventh he hath reserved to himself. In the six dayes thou shalt do all, but on the seventh no manner of work.</p>
               <p>Now in the opposition there are two by-reasons included (for the main reason is<note place="margin">1. God libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity allowing us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> dayes.</note> in the 11. verse, [<hi>for in six dayes, &amp;c.</hi>] The first is, That because God hath dealt so liberally with us, as to give us six dayes for our selves, and to reserve onely one to himself, therefore we should be the more ready to give him that day, for by right of Creation, we and all ours are the Lords, (for he made us of nothing) and in that regard he might justly challenge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and our service all our dayes, and we (being but his Creatures) could not justly challenge to our selves one day; In so much as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59534:157"/>
if it had pleased God to have given us but one day and reserved the other six to himself, we should have had no just cause of complaint) if he had given us day for day, we could not onely have no iust cause of murmuring but also ought to have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our mouthes to praise him for it.</p>
               <p>But seeing he hath dealt so liberally with us, in granting us six dayes for our own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to do our work, and reserving but one to himself, we must acknowledge it to be a liberal proportion and so it is <hi>

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>We see in <hi>Adams</hi> case that when God had finished the Creation and put him in Paradise, notwithstanding Gods bounty to him in granting him all the trees in<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 16.</note> the garden, (one onely excepted) yet the devil was presently upon him, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided God with his niggardlines, in that, he had not given him freedom to eat of<note place="margin">3. 1.</note> all the trees in the garden; and no doubt but the same devil useth the same pollicy with us still in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. May you not doe what you will with all the dayes of the week? Now the consideration of Gods bounty to us, should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all such suggestions, for we cannot say, but that we are well dealt withall, he having granted us two times, and a time, to his one time; six dayes to one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how careful should we be to give him that one.</p>
               <p>This should draw from us an answer like to that of <hi>Joseph</hi> to his Mistris. My Master hath kept nothing from me but thee, how then can I do this great wickednesse, and sinne against God? All the dayes of the week hath God granted me, onely one<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 9.</note> hath he reserved to himself, how can I then be so unkinde, and unthankfull as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Let not <hi>David</hi> in this be our patterne, who having many sheep of his own, would notwithstanding pluck the one and onely sheep out of the poor mans<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 3.</note> bosom: for if we having many dayes of our own, take from God his one day and pluck that one sheep out of Gods bosom, and make it common for our selves, by doing in it our <hi>opus servile</hi> servile work, we are worthy to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>This is the meaning of those words (<hi>and do all thy worke</hi>) that whereas God might have imployed us in his worke, and musing on his will all the dayes of our life: but he is content to forbeare and spare us the rest of the week, that in that time all our own affaires might be dispatched, and none left undone, or to be done on this day. God might say to us, as <hi>Nathan</hi> said to <hi>David.</hi> All this have I given thee and more I would have given thee, if that had not been enough: but certain it is,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 8.</note> that he saw in his wisdom that these six dayes were sufficient, and therefore will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to remember, and still be so carefull to order our affaires on these dayes, that against his seventh day comes, we may be at leasure to sanctifie it.<note place="margin">Because it is Gods own day</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The second reason implyed, is in these words. (<hi>But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God</hi>) which contain the second opposition, and intimate to us, that the seventh day is Gods own proper day with which we have nothing to do to imploy it as we please, and that it is plain theft and sacriledge to rob God of this part of time which he hath reserved to himself. For if God had thought fit to have given us the seventh day too, then might we have wrought on that day also, but seeing he hath reserved it to himself we cannot without plain theft, or robbery, breake in upon this day to which we have no right, by doing our own worke upon it.

It is as if a man should say, you may wear those clothes which are your own and bought with your mony, but this garment which is bought with mine, you cannot without violence take from me: so likewise because of Gods bounty to us, we cannot without ingratitude and manifest injury to him take this day from him; because it is his, he will have it wholly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>In it thou shalt do no manner of worke.</hi>

                  </gap> was the true and original cause of the rest, is expressed <hi>Deut. 5.</hi> because of their deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, to keep a memorial of it. The other is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed here, for whereas any other day might have been chosen for this rest, yet God thought fit to pitch upon this day, because it had been consecrated for a day of joy and praise from the beginning, by a greatful remembrance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> creation, and because on that day God gave over and finished his work So <hi>Aben-Ezra, presat. in Decal. Isaac. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania</hi> and others, and hence it was called the sabbath. But yet though it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Gods rest from the creation was the principal and immediate reason of this precept, yet this makes it not so simply moral or immutable, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Other reasons<note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note> elsewhere God vseth, as proper and peculiar onely to the Jews, but this benefit<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 15.</note> by the creation being general, is most fit for all, and may be a means to imploy and exercise us in the meditation of Gods works, and in his praise for it, as the 92. <hi>Psalm</hi> shews us, which psalm was made especially for the sabbath day. As also to the continuing of the memory of the Creation, to keep us from Paganisme: for if the duty of the memorial of the creation had been duly and successively kept from
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59534:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the beginning and so continued, that great doubt which troubled all the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers so much [whether the world had a beginning] had been taken away. And therefore this day being one especial means to keep men from Atheisme, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sanctified by God, to be a day of rest. This was one reason why the not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this law was so severely punisht, by the Mosaical Law, as appeares by the man that gathered sticks upon that day and was therefore put to death which was not onely because the law of the sabbath was then newly made (to wit for the ceremonial and typical part which consisted in rest) and therefore required the severer punishment, but also because, the not observing of that day, was in effect a deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that God created the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> treating upon the Creation, saith, it is true that God might have been<note place="margin">in Gen.</note> pleased to have said as well <hi>fiat mundus totus,</hi> let all the world be made in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>fiat lux,</hi> let there be light, in the first day: it had been all one to his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency to have done it at once, as in six <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>: and enquiring further into the cause why he did not so, could finde no other reason, but that God by creating one thing after another would teach us that we should proceed in the musing and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation upon the works of creation severally and in order, as God made them. So did king <hi>David,</hi> and so did <hi>Basile</hi> and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who wrote some books of it. And<note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. The last reason is. <hi>Because the Lord blessed the seventh day.</hi> He did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rest on that day, but he consecrated it also.

               <p>But this is not all: the force of this last reason is in this. God saith, because have blessed and hallowed it, seeing I have appointed it, see you do not resist me, butsubmit your selves to my ordinance.

And whatsoever is meant by the labour and work of the week day, that must be forborn on this day, with this <hi>proviso,</hi> That, <hi>Ab eo quod nec antea fieri poterat, nec postea poterit, non est abstinendum;</hi> such works of necessity, which cannot be de done either before or after, are not to be forborn.</p>
               <p>The grounds are laid by <note n="‖" place="margin">Ep. 157 ad Optat.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> and<note n="†" place="margin">In Ezek. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Jerome</hi> thus. There is nothing (as the Preacher saith) but must have its time: As we destinate a set time for our bodies repast, sleep, and the like: in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> time we usually take order, that we be not interrupted,<note place="margin">Eccl. 3. 1.</note> or disturbed, by any other occasions. And so in other temporal things, the more serious they are, we go about, the more care we take, that we be not hindred in them; but that we may wholly minde them, <hi>&amp; hoc agere.</hi> So in the case of spirituals, there ought to be a set time for the building up of the soul, and procuring holinesse to it, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing holinesse by it, wherein we are to use no lesse care, being a matter of greatest importance: but that in the promoting of it, all impediments. may be removed, that may hinder us in it; <hi>ut promptiores simus ad divinum cultum, cum non habemus impedimentum,</hi> saith <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> that we may be more ready for divine worship, when we have no lets or impediments to hinder us. And this is so plain, as that we see even the Councel of Trent (taking order for observing of holy dayes) hath set down concerning the holy duties which are to be performed on those dayes, that they are such, <hi>Quae ab his qui ab humanarum occupationum negotio detinentur, omnino prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stari non possunt,</hi> which cannot be performed by those that are busied with worldly or secular affairs.</p>
               <p>So many of the Fathers that write upon this place [<hi>vacate &amp; videte, quia ego</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 46. 10</note>

Our heads must not be occupied with worldly thoughts, when we are about the affairs of the soul: not that the works of the other six dayes are evil in themselves, but because they are apt to distract the minde from that, which is proper to this day.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Otium,</hi> Rest, being the first part, it is a very strange thing that the nature of man should be altogether so averse from Gods will, that when the Precept is difficult and laborious, requiring some pains and travail, then they will be idle: and where this precept is not laborious but easy, as this to rest, they will (rather then not break the Commandment) take pains: that is, they will even against their nature, make themselvs businesse, and pick out that day of all the dayes of the week that he hath chosen, so that it shall be a kinde of policy, to make advantage of that day, and to finde out some labour on that day, on which he hath forbid us to labour. And so much for the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Commandment and the perversenesse of man.</p>
               <p>We finde in Scripture six several kindes of prohibitions from working on this day.<note place="margin">Particular works forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Jews.</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Before the Law given, when the people departed from Elim, and came to the wildernesse of Sin, there was a prohibition from gathering Manna, there was<note place="margin">Exod. 16. 1, 4, 26.</note> better food to gather, of which he that eateth shall live for ever. The Lord is to be tasted.<note place="margin">Job. 6. 58.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 3.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. A second is, As there must be no gathering of Manna, nor going out to gather it that day, so there must be no buying of it, though it should be brought to us.<note place="margin">Ne. 13. 15. &amp;c.</note> So <hi>Nehemiah</hi> protested against buying and selling, which sheweth the unlawfulnesse of it: because on that day is <hi>Mercatura animae,</hi> it is the market day of the soul, buying and selling on that day is forbidden.</item>
                  <item>3. A third is that which the Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> mentions, that is the carrying of burthens<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 21.</note> on that day: and the better to dissuade the people from that kinde of work, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet promiseth, in the person of God, great blessings to them if they forbear;<note place="margin">24.</note> and threatneth great plagues upon them if they did not, for if they made that

                     </gap>, God would send upon them a burden, which they should sink under, <hi>viz.</hi> Captivity and desolation by the Enemy, he would kindle a fire in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and burn up the gates and palaces thereof. <hi>verse ult.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Another thing prohibited by the Law, is working in harvest time, because the inning of harvest, and gathering of grapes might seem to be a matter of great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 21.</note> Six dayes shalt thou work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time, and in harvest time thou shalt rest: so that the provision for the whole common-wealth must give place unto the rest of this day.</item>
                  <item>5. A fifth thing prohibited is Travailing or Journeying on the Sabbath day. <hi>Cras erit Sabbatum jehovae, maneat quisque in loco suo, neque egrediatur quisquam die sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">16. 29.</note> to morrow is the Sabbath of the Lord, Abide ye every man in his place: let no man go out of his place the seventh day.</item>
                  <item>6. The last is above the rest. For whereas God (in the three Chapters before) had given <hi>Moses</hi> a platform for the building of a Tabernacle, and taken order that he should go presently in hand with it: yet in the 31 Chapter, he saith notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep, whosever worketh on that day, the same<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 13, 14, 15.</note> person shall be surely put to death. Which is as much, as if he had said: Though that work may seem most lawful, and tending most to my glory of all other, yet ye shall not break the Sabbath to do it: and so verse 15 he gives an universal restraint, whosoever doth any manner of work on that day, shall be put to death: any manner of work, an universal prohibition, and the penalty threatned was accordingly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, upon him that gathered sticks. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 15. 35. he was stoned to death by Gods special appointment.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And the Lord tells the people, that if they pollute the Sabbath by bearing bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, he would kindle such a fire in the gates of Jerusalem, that should devour the<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 27.</note> palaces of it, and not be quenched.</p>
               <p>The Prophets generally urge the observation of this Commandment above the rest. And we may observe, that there hath seldom been any strange visitation by fire, but where there hath some notorious prophanation of the Sabbath gone before. So that when it shall please God to visit us with the like judgement, we may conjecture what hath been the cause of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the rest now required on the Lords day, and the difference thereof from the Jewish symbolical rest, which was therefore more strict, see the former Additional observation, observation</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude this point, let them that go out to gather Manna, carry burdens, buy and sell, gather harvest, journey and travail up and down, or do any<note place="margin">Serm. 3. de quadrag,</note> the most lawful work, not think these things to be <hi>otium sanctum</hi> or <hi>Sabbatum Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovae,</hi> a holy rest, or the Sabbath of the Lord, but (as <hi>Leo</hi> saith) <hi>Sabbatum Tyri,</hi> the Sabbath of Tyre.</p>
               <p>The Councel of Mentz (held in the time of <hi>Charlemain Anno Dom.</hi> 813) hath this Canon. <hi>Omnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> minime sit, nec placitum, ubi aliquis ad mortem vel poenam judicetur;</hi> we have decreed that all the Lords dayes be observed with all reverence, and that servile labour shall be forborne, and that no market be kept on those dayes, nor that any Courts be kept either to condemn<note place="margin">Can. 35.</note> men to death or punish them. Those that offend are to be deprived of the communion for three years. And the Council of Tyburis (<hi>Anno</hi> 895. in the time of the Emperor <hi>Arnulph</hi>) hath one Canon to the like purpose, as well for the observation of other holy dayes, as the Lords day. In the second Council of <hi>Mascon</hi> (<hi>held anno</hi> 582) severe punishments were to be inflicted upon those that should not<note place="margin">Can. 1.</note> observe the Lords day, and that <hi>toto die,</hi> all the day long. As it was larger for the fault, so it was milder for the punishment, for they suspended those that violated this Canon from the Communion but for half a year: so strict were they for the sanctifying of this day; and that (as one saith) because God requires the rest, not for the rest it self, <hi>sed quia hoc die Deo tantummodo vacandum,</hi> because we must this day consecrate our selves wholly to God.</p>
               <p>Now here will arise some questions. Whether the strict Commandment given<note place="margin">Whether the rest enjoyned the Jews obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Christians</note> to the Jews, of kindling no fire, and consequently of dressing no meat upon the Sabbath be to be observed by us Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:59534:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To this we answer Negatively, for this was Ceremonial, and belonged onely to the Jews, For it is a general rule, that every moral or eternal dutie of the Law, may be performed by all men at all times. But they which inhabit under the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole (as it is well known) cannot be without fire one day; and to let it go out were to their utter destruction and so they that dwell under the burning Zone, under the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, cannot well keep their meat above one day: so that this being Ceremonial, the Christian is exempted from the observing of it, as being a thing not observable through the whole world, though it might have been observed by the Jews: and therefore was it a peculiar precept to them onely, because they had no obstacle, but might have kept it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second question is: Whether the six several works formerly prohibited<note place="margin">Whether all the works fordden to the Jews, be also now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</note> the Jews, be absolutely forbidden to Christians; as to travail &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For answer to this, we will go no further then the Precept it self.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath must be remembred <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Our rest must be <hi>ad sanctificandum,</hi> to sanctifie it: the outward rest is destinate <hi>sanctificationi</hi> to sanctity: <hi>ideo quiescimus, ut sanctificemus,</hi> we therefore rest, because we should sanctifie: so that where our rest is not <hi>destinata sanctificationi,</hi> applied to sanctification, it is not required, and where sanctification cannot be <hi>sine quiete</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rest, there a rest is required.</p>
               <p>Certain it is that a man may rest and not sanctifie; so likewise, he may sanctifie and not rest: and therefore in the first case, it is said, there are many resters, and but few sanctifiers. Now sanctification consists either, 1. In the means of sanctification. Or 2. in declaring our inward sanctification by the practise and works of it in our lives. And where the rest is not necessary for one of these, or not destinated to them, (it being a subordinate thing) it may be forborn. The rule in Logick is, <hi>tantum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinati sumendum est, quantum prodest ad finem:</hi> we must take so much of that which is appointed for the end, as conduceth to the attaining of that end. As in the case of Medicine, so much is to be taken, as will serve to the end for which it is taken.</p>
               <p>Again, for the means of sanctification, Christ defending his Disciples against the<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 5.</note> Jews (who were altogether urgers of the bodily rest onely) sheweth, that the rest in regard of the sanctification may be broken: as in the Priest in sacrificing, (that time being the most laborious time for him, as it is now the greatest day of labour for our Minister) was blamelesse, because he was <hi>in opere cultus Divini,</hi> imployed in the work of Gods worship. We read also in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi> of a Sabbath<note place="margin">Acts 1 12.</note> dayes journey; and of the like in the Old Testament, where the Shunamitish<note place="margin">2 Reg. 4. 23.</note> woman coming to her husband for the Asse, he saith to her, Wherefore wilt thou go to the Prophet to day? It is neither new moon, nor Sabbath, as if the custom had been then, to go to the Prophet that day, when they had no publick meetings elsewhere. So that where publick and lawful assemblies are not, a man may take a Sabbath dayes journey to joyn in publick worship with others. Thus much for the first part of sanctification.</p>
               <p>But this is lesse acceptable to God then the other part which is the practise of sanctification, for this is the end, the other but the means: and therefore our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our being reproved by the Pharisees for a work of healing upon the Sabbath, tells them, that if they had known what this meaneth (which he citeth out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet<note place="margin">Hosea 6. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi>) I will have mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 7.</note> the guiltlesse. Mercy being indeed a practical work of sanctification, and preferred before the means. So that in regard of the practise of sanctification, a man may leave the very means, as to shew a work of mercy. As if there should happen a fire, or a man or woman to fall into a swoun, or a woman to be in travail in time of divine service, or sermon, we are to leave the means and practise the work, in shewing mercy, by saving the life or goods of those that need our help, and would otherwise have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished: for it is a true rule, that <hi>periculum vitae pellit Sabbatum;</hi> the danger of life excludes the Sabbath. For as God will be glorified on this day for the works of his Creation, the memorial whereof was a cause of the institution of this day from the beginning: so no lesse is he glorified in the preservation of his creatures. We read<note place="margin">John 6. 12.</note> that our Saviour Christ was careful to save the fragments, and commanded them to be taken up, and his reason was, because he would have nothing lost. If not the least, much less the life of any thing may be lost, and if he be careful of the life of other things
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59534:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how much more then think you is he careful for the life of man? He practised himself this work of mercy upon the Sabbath upon the man that was in peril of<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 13.</note> his life.</p>
               <p>And indeed <hi>Necessitas facit legem exlegem,</hi> Necessity makes law an Outlaw. In the Law it is said, Thou shalt not see thy brothers Asse or his Ox fall down by the way, and hide thy self from them, but thou shalt surely help to lift them up again. Nay<note place="margin">Deut. 22. 4.</note> we see in the Law, that God himself is not so strict in observing the practise, as many now adayes are. For in one place where he appointeth the sanctification of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Sabbath, and prohibits all works, yet he hath there a Proviso, <hi>Save that which every man must eat, that may be done of you.</hi> And in the Gospel our Saviour tells the<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 16.</note> Jews, that they watered their cattel on the Sabbath day.<note place="margin">Luke 13. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But we must take this caution by the way, that we use not this liberty according to the flesh, nor as a cloak, as the Apostles speak, and that these works of Mercy<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 13.</note>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 16.</note> in preserving the life of Man and beasts, and other of Gods creatures be used <hi>presente non imminente necessitate,</hi> in case of present not imminent necessity. As when any present danger appears against my life, I am to defend my self: for <hi>in presenti necessitate quisque Magistratus est, &amp; quisque personam Dei habet, ut potius occidat, quam occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur:</hi> in urgent, and present necessity every one is a Magistrate, and representeth the person of God, to kill rather then to be killed. But if the danger be not present but onely imminent, as, one tells me, there is wait laid to kill me, I must then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the Magistrate: so that for present necessity or peril, there is an exemption, the Lord hath resigned his right into our hands, but not upon an imminent peril or necessity, which may be prevented or avoided.</p>
               <p>On the other side, we are to observe another <hi>Proviso.</hi> We must be careful that (because God seeth the heart, and we are to deal with him) we be sure the danger could not be prevented, nor the work be deferred, but that present danger and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity enforceth us to it. For we must not draw a necessity upon our selves, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a necessity when there is none, because God will not be mocked, though we may delude the eyes of men.</p>
               <p>This is to be remembred, because of the practise of some who Inne their harvest on the Sunday, pretending that it is not Gods will, that any of his creatures should perish, which is true, and might lessen the offence, if they did it onely for preserving the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not for their own gain and profit, which if they pretend, let them know, that God sees their hearts and knows their intentions.</p>
               <p>Therefore for tryal of men in this case, it were good if to put a dfference between their works on that day, and upon other dayes, they would do as they did 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. lay up on the first day of the week, whatsoever they gain or save by their work on that day, and give it to the poor; by this means it would appear with what hearts they wrought on this day, whether onely to save the Creature, or out of a desire of lucre and gain. Thus we see what rest is commanded, and how these cases may be resolved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But here ariseth another question. When we have rested is that all, we are to do? Surely no. It is not sufficient that we rest, if we do not sanctifie too. <hi>Leo</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Homil. 3. de quadrag.</note> said of the people of his time, that on this day their care was, <hi>bene vestiri, &amp; nibil agere,</hi> keep holy day, by wearing gay clothes, and doing nothing. Now as S. <hi>Paul</hi> said<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> of bodily labour that it profitteth little; so we may say of bodily rest, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth lesse.

               <p>For as we may not keep open markets, go to plough or to Law on that day, so neither should we spend the time in hunting, nor yet in dancing and sporting.

The heathen man could say, that a good thing done and performed dy one, is well, but better if by many: by a whole parish or City together publickly.

And the refore they which bring in tyranny seek to divide and separate men and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all meetings, and assemblies by that means, to cause them to be disjoynted (as it were) in their affections.

                  </gap> expounds it.</p>
               <p>And as the chief end of this day, is, that God may be sanctified, that is, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied so the subordinate end is, that we may be sanctified, by the duties which we must<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 13.</note> then performe. The sabbath was a signe between God and his people, that they might know that it was he that sanctified them. That so they being sanctified, might bring forth the fruits of sanctification as Christ saith that he sanctified himselfe for our sakes, not for his own <hi>Job.</hi> 17. 19. Now God sanctified it 1. By appointing it to a holy use as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was sanctified from the womb. 2. By separating it from<note place="margin">Jer. 1. 5.</note>

And thus he makes it holy, or sanctifies it. And as God thus made the day holy, we must sanctifie our selves, and then sanctifie the day as <hi>Hezekias</hi> said to the Levites, sanctifie your selves, and then as it follows, sanctifie the house of God, what God hath sanctified or made holy, that we may reap the benefit of it, we must sanctify our selves, we cannot make it holy, but keep it holy, it is our<note place="margin">2 Cron. 29. 5.</note> duty to keep holy. for if a thing be destinated to an use, and be not applied to it, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. We must not then make that common which God hath sanctified, we are to apply it to the end to which God hath destinated it, and use that holily which God hath sanctified. The destination is from God, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation must be from our selves. When the instruments of the tabernacle were san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified<note place="margin">Act. 10. 15.</note> whatsoever toucheth them must be holy, so here God having sanctified this<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 16.</note> day, all that touch it. that live and breath in it, that behold the sun or light that<note place="margin">Lev. 8. 10.</note> day, must be holy.<note place="margin">1 Jo. 2. 27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the means of sanctification, it is plain, that we are sanctified by the holy Ghost and this sanctifying hath a resemblance to that of the Levitical sanctifying, where nothing could be sanctified, but it must have <hi>unctionem,</hi> be anoynted with oyle, a figure of the spiritual unction, which is nothing else but the spiritual working of the holy Ghost in our hearts so that we must first looke whether we have this unction in us, that is, whether we have the holy Ghost, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> we must be sanctified, which as it is the gift of God (we have it not of our selves) so God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes it not to those that ask it, as our Saviour speaks, we must be fitted to receive it.<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 13.</note> As it is God that gives it, so he gives it not to any but those that are prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; that we may understand this, we may take notice how the Holy Ghost is compared to fire, now the matter must be prepared and gathered by us, but it is God that gives the spark, and makes it burne, and when God hath kindled the spark,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59534:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it must be our duty to blow the spark, and look it go not out. Quench not the<note place="margin">Thess. 5. 19.</note> spirit, saith the Apostle, God will not give the spark it we do not prepare matter, and though we prepare matter, yet it will not burn, unlesse God kindle the fire, so that the holy ghost, and by consequence sanctification is not got by following the devises of our own brain, ye shall not do that which is good in your own eyes<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 8.</note> (saith God) but according to the prescript method which God hath set down we must gather matter for this heavenly spark, which the holy Ghost must set on fire, and this is done by attending to the duties of publick worship on that day; for if any shall wilfully keep at home on that day, though he be never so well oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, having no just cause of his absence from God house, and yet thinks he pleases God, the fathers of that ancient councel of Gangra, have pronounced an anathema<note place="margin">Can. vlt.</note> against him.</p>
               <p>For the means to sanctification the special duties and acts wherein the sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">The duty of sanctification</note> of the day consists, no other directions can be given, then what we formerly gave for the means to attain knowledge, onely we premise that which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith of iteration, that a man may say, <hi>Domine scis, quia dixi, Domine scis quia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Sain <hi>Paul</hi> attributeth sanctification of every thing to prayer premised: and<note place="margin">prayer.</note>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 5.</note> therefore it is termed the preparative to all the duties of a Christian; more plainly,<note place="margin">Mar. 35. 39.</note> Our Saviour very early before day went out into a solitary place, and there prayed, and afterward came and preached in the Synagogue, which is very probable to have been on the sabbath day, whereby we may observe, that Christ himself took pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be the first means of sanctification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now for the times of this exercise of prayer on the Lords day, they are two 1. Before the other publick duties; and 2, After. 1. That before is either private as of a master and his family. 2. Or else in the congregation, which is publick. Both which the psalmist comprehendeth in one verse. I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart, secretly among the faithful, theres the first. And in the congregation theres the last. 1. Concerning the first, we see in the place<note place="margin">psal. 111. 1. Mar. 6. 46.</note> before quoted that our Saviour went out into a solitary place, as also elsewhere. As soon as he had sent the multitude away he departed into a mountain to pray. 2. For<note place="margin">Act. 16. 13.</note>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 16.</note> the other, we may gather out of that place in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that amongst the very Heathen the religious Hellinists (which were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which were a kinde of proselytes that worshipped the God of Israel) vsed to assemble themselves to pray by a rivers side. But more plainly, the Apostle saith, that to the prayers of the congregation, every one should joyn his own Amen.</p>
               <p>Again prayer is to be vsed after. For as we are not fit to receive any spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al<note place="margin">2.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 6. 24.</note> grace before without it, so neither to keep it after; the devil will take the word out of our hearts, after we have heard it, unlesse we desire of God that it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with us, and seek his blessing that the seed may fructify. And this was in the law to come from the Priests mouth. The Lord blesse thee and keep thee. By vertue whereof the devil wil lose his power in taking the word<note place="margin">Luc. 8. 12.</note> out of our hearts, but it shall continue with us, and fructifie in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is the word, which is magnified or sanctified by God for our<note place="margin">The word.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 42. 21.</note> sanctification; for as the prophet saith, God hath magnified the law, that is, his word, and made it honorable, and else where plainly the, hearing of the word is made one end of publick assemblyes, gather me the people together (saith God) and I will makethem hear my words. Now the word upon the sabbath hath a double use. 1. First as it is read, and heard read, onely. 2. And secondly, as it preached, or heard preached.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the first, the Church in great wisdome alwayes thought it most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and necessary, that reading should precede preaching, that when it should be preached it might not seem strange to them that heard it. But as that is thought a thing fit by the Church, so would it be no lesse expedient, that before we come to church we would meditate on it, yet such is our wretchlessenesse in matters spiritual, that we think we have done enough if we can apprehend it, when it is read whereas if we would meditate on it before hand, we might make the better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:59534:163"/>
of it when it is read, and be the better confirmed in what we hear preached. The Jews had their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the preparation to the sabbath, and about the ninth houre of it (which is our three of the clock in the after-noon) they usually met, and spent their time in reading of the scriptures, that they might be the better fitted against the sabbath.</p>
               <p>The publick reading of the word in the congregation on the sabbath day is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by diverse passages in holy writ: as by that in the Acts of the Apostles, where it is said, that when <hi>Paul</hi> and his company came into the synagogue at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och on the sabbath day, the rulers of the Synagogue after the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Law and the Prophets, sent to them saying, ye men and brethren, if ye have any word<note place="margin">Act. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">15.</note> of exhortation, say on. And by another passage in the same Chapter, where it is said, that the Prophets were read every sabbath day. And by another a little after, which saith thus that <hi>Moses</hi> (that is the law) was read in the Synagogue every<note place="margin">27.</note> sabbath day And lastly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives a special charge, by the Lord to the Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">15. 21.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 72.</note> thathis Epistle to them be read unto all the holy brethren.</p>
               <p>There is a vse also of private reading, and that of great consequence, for Christ saith<note place="margin">Jo. 5. 39.</note> plainly, that his witnesses be the Scriptures, and therefore will he have them search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Esa. 8. 19.</note> because they testified and prophecied of him. That this exercise is profitable<note place="margin">20.</note> the prophet maketh plain by a question. Should not a people enquire at their God?<note place="margin">34. 16.</note> which he explains in the next verse by; seeking To the law and to the Testimony. And again, Seek in the book of the Law and read. And therefore we see that the Bereans were much commended, and storied for wiser and nobler <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> other people, why? because they searched the Scriptures daily, to confirm their faith in the<note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> points preached to them.</p>
               <p>There are other vses also in reading. In the Revelation there is a blessing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to those that read or heare the words of that prophecy, because it might<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 3.</note> excite men to praise God when they see all fulfilled. Man seeing the prophecies fulfilled, may thereby give him praise. And for this cause there were (anciently) Monuments kept in Churches, which preserved and set forth the accomplishing of Gods promises or threatnings. As the memorials of the warres of God on the behalf of the Israelites: which was called <hi>liber bellorum Dei,</hi> the book of the<note place="margin">Num. 21. 14.</note> battels of the Lord, and their <hi>verba <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> or Chronicl es of <hi>Nathan, Gad, Shemaiah, &amp;c.</hi> these they permitted in a holy use to be privately read: that seeing his promises and his threatning, denounced in them to have been fulfilled men might the better be stirred up to the praise and fear of God.</p>

                  </gap> about the time of Christs sufferings So the Eunuch while he was reading in the book of <hi>Esay,</hi> had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position<note place="margin">Act. 0. 28.</note> of Christs sufferings from the Apostle <hi>Philip</hi> sent for that purpose by God, and because God doth not now by such extraordinary means informe us in the true sence of Scriptures, therefore we are to read such as have written <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon such places, and so no doubt but if <hi>Philip</hi> had written any thing at that time upon <hi>Esay,</hi> that the Eunuch would have read it, and made use of his writeing as he did of his verbal exposition. Therefore hath God ordeyned expositions, such as the book <hi>Jasher,</hi> which as some think, was a commentary upon the law, written<note place="margin">Jos. 10. 13.</note> for this end, to explicate the hard Texts of Scriptures, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Means to sanctification, is the word preached, of which the Apostle speaks to the Romans, how shall they hear without a preacher, and this is one of the<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 15.</note> ordinary means of faith, and so, of sanctification. The Apostle in that placeq uoteth out<note place="margin">Esa. 52. 7.</note> of two of the Prophets this text, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the<note place="margin">Num. 1. 15.</note> Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things? And our Saviour Christ in his<note place="margin">Jo. 17. 17.</note> prayer (before his passion) for his Apostles, who were to be such preachers, saith, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them with thy truth. and thy word is truth; and by his own practise in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he sanctified this means of preaching. And the Apostle tells us, that the wisdom of God hath appointed by the foolishnesse of preaching to save them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; this way of saving men, the wisdom of God hath pitcht upon, which is not to be altered, but to continue to thend of the world. For though reading of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59534:163"/>
the word be a necessary means to sanctification, yet are not all men capable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what they read.</p>

                  </gap> Custome therefore of the Church was, and so continued in the Apostles times, that after the reading the of Law and the Prophets, some that were learned in Gods Law and sent by him to that purpose, stood up, and expounded to the people some text of that which was read. We may see this plainly in the<note place="margin">Nehem. 8. 8.</note> book of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that after <hi>Ezra</hi> and others had read in the book of the Law to the people in the congregation, they gave the sence, and caused them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the reading.</p>
               <p>And the Apostle S. <hi>James</hi> puts the Jews in minde that <hi>Moses</hi> was preached in the Synagogues on the Sabbath day. This practise continued (as I said) even in the<note place="margin">Acts 15. 21.</note> Apostles time. For we see in the place before mentioned, that the Rulers of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue at Antioch, entreated the Apostles to bestow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> words of exhortation<note place="margin">13. 15.</note> upon them after the reading of the Law and the Prophets. The Eunuch (no doubt but) was a man of as great capacity, as many who now adayes take upon them the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and preaching both of Law and Gospel: yet had not he met with S. <hi>Philip,</hi> he would have been to seek in that place of the Prophet, which the Apostle found<note place="margin">Acts 8. 28.</note> him reading.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third duty is the pondering of that which we have heard read or preached. This<note place="margin">Meditation.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 2. 19.</note> we read that <hi>Mary</hi> did, who pondered all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> continually.</p>
               <p>Besides the meditation of the Word that we shall hear read, or preached, the 92 Psalm (which was a Psalm peculiarly made for the Sabbath and was usually<note place="margin">Psalm 92.</note> sung on that day, the two first verses whereof (if credit may be given to the Jews traditions) came from <hi>Adam,</hi> who used to sing them in Paradise) giveth us three further points to consider.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first is in the fourth verse (which indeed is that which God here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely<note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> urgeth in this Commandment) the Consideration of the works of his hands, the raising to our selves a Contemplative use of the Creatures; that as all the week before, we have had a naturall use of them, so on this day we should make a spiritual. Thou Lord hast made me glad through thy works, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in giving praise for the operation of thy hands.</item>
                  <item>2. A second is (in the seventh verse) a meditation of the judgements of God.<note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> when the ungodly are green as the grasse, and when all the workers of wickednesse do flourish, then shall they be destroyed for ever. And this meditation is most necessary to keep men within the bounds of obedience: for upon the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the severe judgements which God inflicts upon Malefactors, men are held in as with a bridle, from swerving from his Commandments.</item>
                  <item>3. The third is (at the tenth and twelfth verses) a Meditation of Gods benefits<note place="margin">Ver. 10. 12.</note> and Mercies: or of his mercies towards them that love him, as well as his visitations upon their enemies, both which may be included in the Hebrew word; taking judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the <hi>genus</hi> of them both. Such as be planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the Courts of the house of our God, &amp;c. These, whether they extend to our own persons, or concerne our fathers house, or the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live, or the Church round about us, every one of these affoord us an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Meditation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And as we see the other Creatures of God, as the wilde asses, sparrows, cranes, lilies, pismires, &amp;c. yield matter of Meditation, thereby to stir us up to praise the Creator. Upon which we may frame an argument, <hi>a minore ad majus,</hi> from the lesse to the greater. If God have made them thus, how much more are we bound to be thankful to him, for whom he hath done infinitely more?</p>
               <p>So the Apostle setteth forth Gods judgements to provoke us to repentance,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 2, &amp;c.</note> and his mercy to move and stir us up to thankfulnesse. And thus, when we are<note place="margin">10.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 12.</note> wearied with prayer, and that reading and preaching of the word is ended, meditation still remaineth wherein to exercise our selves, and in this dutie we

               <p n="4">4. The fourth duty of this day, is not to be contented onely with meditating<note place="margin">Conference.</note> upon these things in our Closets privately, but there must be conference also between our selves and others, about what we have heard. And this is done two manner of waye s.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is with them that have taught us, if we doubt of any thing we are to<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 7.</note> confer with the Priest. The prophet tells us, that the Priests lips should keep know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and we are to seek the Law at his mouth. we read that it was our Saviours<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. 2. 46.</note> practise. For it was a custom of old, that after the solemnity on the eighth day, the last of the feast, that the Teachers sate down at the Table, and the Auditors (stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them) propounded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and questions, that they might be resolved in them. And so no doubt was Christ, at twelves years old, not as an Opposer, but in the state of a Learner; though he discovered a great guift that way above his years. And if points of doctrine fail, then others concerning practise are to be resolved, such as the souldiers and Publicans put to <hi>John;</hi> and the people to the<note place="margin">Luc 3. 10.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note> Apostles.</p>
               <p>Now because there are now adayes no doubts, no putting of questions, it is a signe. that fear of God is utterly extinguisht in mens hearts: and if there be any doubts at all, they are not propounded with that heart which they did it, that said, Men and brethren, what shall we do? or what shall we leave undone? but onely for some sinister ends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is between the hearers themselves, and that, 1. either among equalls, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> with <hi>S. Peter;</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elizens</hi> who communed together;<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 2. 2 Reg. 2. 11.</note> and the two Disciples, with whom Christ made a third. And it was the old Custom, as it is in the Prophet, that they that feared the Lord, spake every one to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">Luc. 24. 15, 17 Mal. 3. 16.</note> &amp;c. to which a special blessing is promised: That God would keep a book of remembrance for such men, and that he would spare them, &amp;c. By this means a more general benefit may be reaped of what is heard, when many shall lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether what they have observed, as in a <hi>symbolum,</hi> or common shot, whereby some that had no benefit by the word when they first heard it, may receive some good by it afterwards, and by mutual conference men may lay open their infirmities, and imperfections, which hinder them in hearing and applying the word, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive directions from others, whose case hath been the same, how they were holpen and freed from the like. 2. Or else between superiours and inferiours, as the Master and his family.</p>
               <p>And this was Gods Commandement to the Israelites concerning his Law, they were to teach their children, and to whet it upon them as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 7.</note> Thou shalt talk of it when thou sittest in thine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="5">5. The fift and last duty for sanctifying the day (not to be passed over) is<note place="margin">Praise.</note> praise and thanksgiving. <hi>Augustine</hi> accompteth it to be <hi>totum opus Sabbati,</hi> the whole work of the Sabbath, as if the day were made for nothing else. And to this end (as hath been said before) the ninety second Psalm was penned to be sung as a Hymne or song to praise God. Now praise and thanksgiving may be either for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or particular benefits. For general benefits we have the ninety first, sixty eight, and hundred and third Psalms. For particular benefits, (as for fair weather after<note place="margin">Psalm 35. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> rain, or rain after too much drought, &amp;c.) we have the sixty fift Psalm. For these we must (with <hi>David</hi>) praise God in the great Congregation. Especially seeing thanksgiving is accounted by <hi>David</hi> to be a debt due unto God in respect of his goodnesse in hearing our prayers: and it is the very reason the Psalmist gives for it. Praise watcheth for thee in Sion, or as others read it, <hi>Tibi debetur Hymnus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">29. 2.</note> a hymn is due to thee from Sion, the reason is expressed in the next words, because<note place="margin">96. 8.</note>
                  <note place="margin">65. 1. 2</note> thou art a God that hearest prayers.</p>
               <p>Besides all these mentioned, the Sacraments, and Discipline are parts of the sanctification of the day, but are not for every day, but to be performed<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 16.</note> on speciall dayes, and by some speciall persons, whereas the other duties of the day pertain generally to all, and ought to be continually performed. So that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59534:165"/>
no man ought to conceive, that he hath done enough in performing them once. <hi>Qui</hi>

                  <hi>sanctificatus est, sanctificetur adhuc;</hi> he that is holy let him be holy still. There is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of continuing in these means of sanctification, every sabbath day. For, as our knowledge is but in part, and our prophesying but in part, (as the Apostle speaks)<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13 9.</note> so our sanctification is but in part, there will still remain a necessity of that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">John 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And thus much for the several duties, wherein the sanctifying of the day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</p>
               <p>Now the means are for the end, which is the fruit of them, <hi>Nemo mediis utitur propter media,</hi> no man ever useth means, onely for the means, but for some end. And therefore he that planteth a vineyard, and he that tilleth and soweth his ground, <hi>hoc est ultimum, fructus;</hi> that which he aimeth at, is the fruit, and harvest. This is the fruit that God expects, the great end of this Commandment, that his Name may be sanctified in and by us. We have the very phrase of speech in the book of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 20. 12.</note> Because ye beleeved me not to sanctifie me in the presence of the Children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring the Congregation into the land which I have given them: this was Gods speech to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> And in another place the like, <hi>Sanctificate &amp; sancti estote,</hi> sanctifie your selves and be ye holy. Such words<note place="margin">Levit. 20. 7.</note> in respect of the two fold glory that redoundeth to God, have a double sence. God is glorified, 1. Either by us directly, or 2. from us, by other, indirectly; as it is in the Gospel, when men seeing our good works are stirred up also to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie<note place="margin">

               <p>And therefore it is, that these words, [Sanctification, Glorification, &amp;c.] have a double sense. 1. First, to signifie a making holy, &amp;c. and that by means: in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect sanctification is a making holy. 2. in regard of others, a declaring of this san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification so made. By the first (according to <hi>S. Peter</hi>) we make sure to our selves<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> our calling and election. And by the second, we declare it to others, that as we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God our selves, so God may be glorified by others also. Shew me thy faith by thy works, saith <hi>S. James.</hi> Whereby it falleth out, that because good works have this operation to stir up others to glorifie God, that our Saviour saith, That a good<note place="margin">James 2. 18.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 12.</note> work is lawful on the Sabbath day; such works discover our regeneration, and if we be purged and sanctified, we shall be, as the Apostle saith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <argument>
                  <p>Works of Mercy proper for the Lords day. They are of two sorts. 1. First Corporeal, feeding the hungry, &amp;c. Burying of the dead a work of mercy. Such works proper for a festival. Objections answered. 2. Spirituals. 1. To Instruct, Counsel and exhort. 2. Comfort. 3. Reproofe. 4. Forgiving. 5. Bearing with the weak. 6. Prayer. 7. Reconciling those that are at odds.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt because the day was chiefly instituted for a memorial of Gods great mercies:<note place="margin">Of works of Mercy.</note> as 1. For making us, when we were nothing. 2. Secondly for redeeming us when we were worse then nothing. 3. And lastly, For the beginning of our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: therefore in regard of these three great mercies it is, that no work doth so well agree with the day, nor that God is so much delighted in, as the works of mercy, when we shew our thankfulnesse for those great mercies which we celebrate on that day, by exercising mercy towards others, whose necessity requires our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. And in this regard it is, that there is a special affinity between sanctification of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59534:166"/>
the day and works of mercy. The Prophet tells us, that God refuseth all sacrifice,<note place="margin">Hos. 6. 6.</note> and requireth Mercy, so that sacrifice without Mercy was rejected.<note place="margin">Matth. 9. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Let us compare this, with the Ritual sanctification in the Law.</p>
               <p>As anoynting was the first part of typical sanctifying, of which we spake formerly, so was there also a second, If it were a Person, his hand was filled by <hi>Aaron, Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 16. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>manus ejus Aaron.</hi> If it were an Altar, then was there some what offered on it. So that Oblation or filling the hand was the second way of legal sanctifying. In the Law there was a charge to <hi>Aaron,</hi> that whensoever men came to appear before the Lord, none should appear empty. And therefore in another place there is mention<note place="margin">Lev. 8. 31.</note> made of a basket of sanctification at the door of the Tabernacle, in which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served<note place="margin">Exod. 29. 32.</note> the bread offered by the people, which the Priests were to eat with the flesh of the sacrifices. And the very same order was taken in the time of the Gospel, that on the Lords day there should be collections for the poor. But there is no place<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.</note> that setteth this out more plainly, then the 26 Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> the whole<note place="margin">Deut. 26.</note> Chapter throughout; where the manner is particularly set down, how the people were to bring their baskets of first fruits to the tabernacle, and offer them there to the Lord, in token of thankfulnesse, and as an acknowledgement that they received all from God.</p>
               <p>And likewise every third yeer besides the ordinary tythes, they were to bring the tythe of the remainder to the Tabernacle, for the use of the Levite, the poor, the fatherlesse and stranger, that they might rejoyce together, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now mercy as misery is two fold. 1. Corporeal, and 2. Spiritual. Either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and such as are for the good of the body of him that is in misery; or inward, and such as concerne his soul or spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the first of these, our Saviour himself mentions six works of mercy in 2 verses<note place="margin">For the body.</note> of one Chapter, which as sure as he is Christ, he will acknowledge, and take special notice of, when he comes to judge the world, and as he will pronounce those happy and blessed that have exercised them; so he will denounce a curse upon those that have neglected them, three of them are in the first of the two. 1. Feeding the hungry.<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 35.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Giving drink to the thirsty. 3. Merciful dealing with, and entertaining the stranger.<note place="margin">36.</note> And the other three are in the next verse. 1. Clothing the naked. 2. Visiting the sick. 3. And succouring them that be in prison. To which may be added a seventh, which is the care of the dead: we see that King <hi>David</hi> pronounceth a blessing from<note place="margin">2 Sam. 2. 5.</note> God to the men of Jabesh Gilead, because they had buried the body of <hi>Saul.</hi> And our Saviour commendeth the work of <hi>Mary</hi> in her anointing him, as having relation<note place="margin">John 12. 7.</note> to the day of his burial. We finde also <hi>Joseph</hi> of Arimathea, and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to posterity, for their work of mercy in this kinde: the one for begging the body of Jesus to bury it, and the other for assisting him in the charge of interring it. <hi>Augustine</hi> gives a reason why the burial of the dead ought to be accounted a work of<note place="margin">Lib. de cura pro mortuis.</note> mercy. It is done (saith he) <hi>Ne pateat miseria,</hi> that this misery of rotting (being both lothsome to the eye and nose) should not appear to every man. As also, because every one loveth his own flesh so well, that he would have it after his death well and honestly used, and therefore this is a benefit done to him, when he cannot help himself. And in these respects it is a work of mercy.</p>
               <p>That the works of mercy are most requisite (and especially upon our feasts) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that which is related of <hi>David,</hi> who upon his sacrifice on a festival day dealt to everyman and woman (the poorer sort no doubt) a loaf of bread, and a good<note place="margin">1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And by that which is storied of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who<note place="margin">Nehem. 8. 10.</note> upon the Sabbath day (after the law read and expounded) commanded the better sort to eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and to send portions to them, for whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was prepared. And certainly there is a blessing or sanctifying proper to them and their actions that shall be mindefull of the poor, and shew mercy to them. S.<hi>Paul</hi> tells the Milesians, that it is a more blessed thing to give then to receive, especially<note place="margin">Act. 20. 35.</note> seeing God so accepteth works of mercy, as that he imputeth not sin to the truly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable. Therefore it was that <hi>Daniel</hi> gave that counsel to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Break off<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note> thy sins by righteousnesse, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And our Saviour gave the like in his sermon, Give Alms of such things as you have, and all things are<note place="margin">Luc. 11. 41.</note> clean to you. Whereas he that stoppeth his ears at the cry of the Poor, he also shall cry himself and not be heard.<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 13.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:59534:166"/>
But it is an easy matter for flesh and blood to finde objections, against performing<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> these works of mercy. As how know I, whether a man be hungry or not? I see none go naked, and so of the rest.</p>
               <p>To this we answer with the fathers, <hi>potius est occurrere necessitati, quam succur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sol.</note> It is better to prevent or keep a man from misery, then to help him out of misery. And for the practise of that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And indeed, when God requireth thy Almes to the poore, he asketh but his own, and that which he gave thee, and but that which thou canst not keep long. He requireth but <hi>paux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illum,</hi> a very little from thee for them, meaning to repay thee <hi>Centuplum</hi> a hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fold for it. He asketh of thee but <hi>Caducum,</hi> that which is fraile and transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to reward thee in <hi>aternum</hi> eternally.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as there were in their time some, so are there now more, that plead their<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> inability to releeve the poor.</p>
               <p>Our answer to this must be as theirs was, <hi>si <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Lastly, there were some then, as there are now, that having given Almes on the Sunday, would recover it the other dayes of the week, either by oppressing, and dealing hardly with the poor, or by undermining those they dealt with. Therefore the last caution must be out of the Prophet. The Lord of hosts shall be exalted in<note place="margin">Esay. 516.</note> judgment, the holy Ghost shall be sanctified in justice, that is, a mans mercy must not make him unrighteous. So that the conclusion of this point is, if a man doe <hi>dare rem suam Deo, &amp; se peccato, aut daemoni,</hi> give his substance to God, and himself to sin or the devil, and thereby give <hi>quod minus est Creatori, &amp; quod majus, inimico,</hi> the lesse to his Creatour, and the greater to his Enemy, he is far from keeping the sabbath aright, in the point of performing the works of Mercy.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the spiritual part of the works of mercy, which is to be done to<note place="margin">2.</note> the Spirit of him that needs it, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Est quaedam charitas quae de sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo</hi>

               <p>And though some doubt of the morality of the sabbath, yet that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> is a moral duty there can be no doubt. The reason is; because whatsoever was a meer ceremony might not be vsed at any other time, or in any other place or order, then was prescribed by God in the book of Ceremonies; but this of fasting hath been otherwise, for upon extraordinary occasions they had special fasts as in the fist, and seventh and tenth moneth, none of which were prescribed by the law, and had not bin lawful, if fasting were a ceremony, for ceremonies in the time of the law, were tyed to certain times and places. Again, though our Saviour gave a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why his disciples should not then fast, yet he shewed plainly, that after the<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Barnabas.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself had his private fastings, <hi>in multis jejuniis,</hi> in<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 27.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 5.</note> fasting often. And his advise was to married people, to sever themselves for a time, to give themselves to fasting and prayer, which sheweth plainly, that it was accounted a necessary duty, and therefore practised. Now for the other times of the Primitive church, the books of the fathers are exceeding full in praise of fasting, and they themselves were so addicted to it, and did therewith so consume<note place="margin">psal. 109. 24.</note> themselves, that they might well say with <hi>David.</hi> Their knees were made weak with fasting, and their flesh had lost all their fatnes.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now the reasons of the publick fast were these. 1. Either for the averting of some evil. 2. Or for procuring some good. And because <hi>malum est aut poenae aut culpae</hi> evil is either of punishment or of sinne; this duty was performed against both these: but especially against punishment, either of our selves or others.

               <p n="6">6. Lastly, we must give alms and relieve the poor on the day of our fast. The<note place="margin">Esay 58. 10.</note> precept we have in <hi>Esay,</hi> among other things required in a fast, to draw out the soul to the hungry, and to pity the afflicted soul. And an example of it in the Centurion: Alms was joyned with his fasting: for the old rule and Canon is, <hi>Quod ventri subtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hitur,</hi>

               <p>But as we said before, that bodily rest profiteth nothing, so we may say of bodily abstinence, it availeth little, it is not an outward abstinence will serve the turn (for the the kingdom of God is not in meat and drink) if we stay there and go no further:<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> therefore the Prophet tells such fasters, though they lay in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a whole day, yet it was not that which God requireth, but inward sorrow: because the outward action is ordained for the inward, and the internal fast is that which God chiefly accepts. What is said in the Gospel of sacrifice, may be aswel said of outward mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Esay 58. 5.</note> I will have mercy and not sacrifice. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 13. And the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Joel 2. 12.</note> It is not the rending of the garments, but of the heart which God requireth in our<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 11.</note> fasts. The Apostle excellently describeth the whole course of whatsoever is required of us in this fast: when they sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulnesse it wrought<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> in them; yea, what clearing of themselves; yea, what indignation; yea, what fear; yea, what vehement desire; yea, what zeal; yea, what revenge? A true fast must come from the spirit, and be accompanied with sighs and groans which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, as the Apostle speaks in another case. Of this sorrow there cannot be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite method, but as he setteth them down there, they are of two sorts. 1. First, a fear arising from the apprehension of Gods anger provoked, and the punishment due to us for our sins, which must work in us a sorrow that we have offended so good a God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A desire of amendment for the future, which must shew it self by a more strict care that we offend him no more: and this care must be expressed by zeal, and if we relapse or go amisse, that then we be ready to punish our selves for it. In a word the fruit of<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 31.</note> those actions which concern Mortification tend to this end, that by judging our selves we may escape the judgment of God. It was the policy of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> and his people<note place="margin">1 King. 20. 32</note> to humble themselves to the Kingof Israel, which turned to their preservation: and it hath been the usual practise of rebellious subjects to their Prince thus to behave themselves, to regain his favour, and to make his bowels yearn.</p>
               <p>But after all these, unlesse there be a binding of our selves by a vow and promise of reformation andnew obedience (which must be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> all the rest will be to little purpose. Therfore we finde in <hi>Nehem.</hi> at a solemn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Israelites, when they were returned from Babylon, that after solemn reading of the Law four times (for so some take the words, <hi>verse</hi> 3.) whereas their ordinary readings were but twice on one day, and after an humble cessation, and serious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, they all enter into a solemn vow and Covenant of reformation of their lives, and set their hands and seals to it, to remain as a testimony against them for ever if they should fall back. Thus if we upon our solemn fasts do vow and promise to God, unfeignedly to reform what we then confesse to have been amisse in us, and perform it accordingly, then we may be assured our fast is such as God accepts. And thus much concerning the second rule, for expounding the Commandments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to <hi>Homogenea.</hi>

The third rule tells us according to our former method, that the love of God is<note place="margin">3.

               <p>Concerning the adorning of the house of God, the Author (as here briefly) so more<note place="margin">Addition 25: Of adorning of Churches.</note> fully in other places expresseth himself.

I finde that neither under the Law, he liked of their motion, What should the Temple do with Cedar? neither under the Gospel of theirs, What should Christs head do with Nardus? but that to his praise it is recorded in the old Testament that said, <hi>Shall I dwell in my cieled house, and the Ark of God remain<note place="margin">1 Chron. 17. 1</note> under goats skins?</hi> and she in the new, that thought not her best ointment too good for Christs head? Surely they in Egypt had their service of God, it may be in a barn, or in some other corner of an house, yet when <hi>Moses</hi> moved a costly Tabernacle, no man was found that once said, our Fathers served God well enough without one, <hi>ut quid perditio haec?</hi> After that many Prophets and righteous men were well when they might worship before the Ark; yet when <hi>Solomon</hi> moved a stately Temple, never was any found that would grudge and say, Why, the Ark is enough, I pray God we serve God no worse then they that knew nothing but a tent, <hi>Ut quid perditio haec?</hi> Onely in the dayes of the Gospel (which of all others least should) there steps up Judas, and dareth to lay that against Christs Church, that no man durst ever either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Moses</hi> Tent, or <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, &amp;c. In the same sermon a little before, <hi>viz.</hi> page 294, The Scripures record (as a good work) that that was laid down at the Apostles feet, no lesse then this that was laid on Christs own head. And in them <hi>Ananias</hi> a Church robber, and <hi>Judas</hi> a Christ robber both in one case. Satan is said to have filled their hearts in that Act. And the like end came to both, and both are good remembrances for them that seek and say, as thy did: yea, that would not be content to detain a part (<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> went further) but would seize on all gladly, if a gracious Lady <note n="*" place="margin">Q.

Christ was far from it; he that would not see it abused, would never endure to have it destroyed, when he had reformed the abuses. After in the same Sermon, page 485. <hi>Solvite Templum,</hi> is no Commandment (be sure) in no sence. He commands not any Temple, not that they themselves meant to be destroyed. It were sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that, and no better: and sacriledge the Apostle ranks with Idolatry, as being full out as evil, if not worse then it. But indeed worse; for what Idolatry but pollutes, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge pulls quite down; and easier it is to new hallow a Temple polluted, then to build a new one out of a heap of stones. And if to spoil a Church be sacriledge, (as it is granted) yet that leaves somewhat, at least the walls and roof (so it be not lead) to leave nothing, but down with it, is the cry of Edom, the worst cry, the worst sacriledge of all, and never given in Charge to any (we may be sure.) For God himself said to <hi>David</hi> with his own mouth, <hi>Whereas it was in thine heart to build me a house, thou didst well, that thou wast so minded.</hi> Didst well? well done to think of building? then <hi>e sensu contrario,</hi> evil done to think of dissolving, and that which is evil, Christ will never enjoyn.

His grief was no lesse that he could not have the honour to build God a Temple, then their anger is at this day, who bite asunder their own tongues with very wrath, that they have not as yet the power to pull down the Temples which they never built, and to level them with the ground. Thus and much more to this purpose, that learned and devont man, who amongst others learnedly handles the several points considerable in this subject: <hi>viz.</hi> the conveniency and necessity of having set places for publick worship, the consecrating and dedicating of such places to God, the honour and reverence due to them, and the conveniency and fitnes of adorning them in the most sumptuous manner, and that it savours nothing of Judaisme or superstition, but becomes even the most spiritual times of the Gospel. <hi>Sect. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The solemn dedication of Churches serves not onely to make them publick, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to surrender up that right which otherwise the founders might have in them, and to make God himself the owner, as that learned Author speaks, <hi>Sect. 12. p. 204.</hi> I may adde, that hence it is, that not onely the Civil and Canon Laws, but euen our Common Laws do account such places together with the Churches Patrimony, and whatsoever is dedicated to God, to be Gods right, and that he is the sole Proprietor, all humane propriety being extinguished by the consecration, and that all that the Clergie have is <hi>usum fructuum,</hi> as Administrators or Trustees from God, who hath given them the use, reserving the Dominion and right in himself. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lawyers resolve, that there is no Fee simple of a Church, either in the Bishop, Patron, or Incumbent (though all other lands are resolved into a Fee simple, which is in some or other) but there is a <hi>Quasi feudum</hi> in the Incumbent during life, the Law gives him something like a Fee for life, whereby he may sue for the rights of the Church, but a proper Fee is in none but in God alone. Those that would see more of this subject, may read among many other, two learned Tracts, by two reverend and learned men of this Church.

                  <note place="margin">1 Kin. 12. 31 13. 33.</note> there are now some, that think the office of a minister of God to be nothing but the reading of a few prayers, and going up into a pulpit, and speaking there an hour, which some do without sence or reason, and without any reverence or regard to the dignity of the worke and high place to which they are called.</p>
               <p>Therefore God himself takes order for procuring the more honour to the calling (and that for the peoples good) that they shall not onely teach and instruct the people set <hi>Jacob</hi> to school, and learn Israel his lesson, but they shall teach even<note place="margin">Levit. 10. 11.</note> kings and princes themselves; they must give <hi>Joshua</hi> his charge, and the highest<note place="margin">Deut. 31. 9. 23.</note> on earth must not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Princes have need of such to assist them, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts of government, so especially in matters of religion, and in particular for sanctifying the Lords day. They may by their statutes and penall laws enjoyne the external rest on that day, but the works of sanctification, wherein the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the day chiefly consists, are the proper work of the priest, he it is that must teach the Laws of God which reach to the soul and inward man. It is the duty of Princes, who are <hi>custodes utrius<expan>

                  </gap> they cannot perform the work of sanctification themselves, to take care that fit persons be provided and encouraged in this work. Its true, if a Prince were onely (as the Heathen man said) <hi>Tanquam subulcus,</hi> like a herdsman, that keepeth cattel, to take care of mens bodies, and of their outward estate onely, and that they wrong not one another by fraud or force, and had no charge of mens souls, nor of Religion, he might neglect this work, but seeing it is otherwise, and that the care of the Church is committed to him, and that the soul is the principal part, therefore it his duty to see that fit and able persons be provided for this work, such as may be <hi>Doctores Gentium,</hi> Teachers of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Therefore God would not have such as were to do his work to be chosen <hi>ex tumultuario grege,</hi> out of the common people, hand over head; but out of those that had been trained up in the knowledge of the Law; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose<note place="margin">Jos. 15. 15.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 1. 19. 18.</note> they had their several Schools or Universities, as at * <hi>Kirjath-Sepher, ‖ Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth-Sophim,</hi> and † <hi>Naioth.</hi> Nor were they to do Gods work till they were

               </p>
               <p>And as good care was to be taken in the choice of them, so ought there be as<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 13.</note> great in the cherishing and esteem of them. To esteem them very highly in love for their worke sake. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh. We should receive them as Angels<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 14.</note> of God, as the Galatians did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and cleave to them, as his Auditours did<note place="margin">Act. 17. 34.</note> to him; and use them as honorably and as with as much respect as Princes receive and entertain forreign Ambassadors: otherwise, they will neither profit us, we shall receive no benefit by them, nor they be encouraged to go on cheerfully in their calling.</p>
               <p>Besides (which is worst of all) if we disesteem of them and despise them, God will take it as an affront done to himself. He that despiseth you (saith Christ) des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piseth<note place="margin">Luc. 10. 16.</note> me. It is a despight done to God, not to the minister onely: and God will take it to heart and avenge his own quarrel. <hi>Corah</hi> and the rest that murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst<note place="margin">Num. 16. 32. 12. 10.</note> Gods servants, felt his heavy indignation for it. <hi>Miriam (Moses</hi> own sister) was made a Leper for the like offence, we see what became of them that<note place="margin">2 Kin. 2. 24.</note> scorned <hi>Elisha,</hi> though their age might have pleaded some excuse for them. And (not to trouble you with many presidents) it is said of the Jews, that they mocked the messengers of God and despised his words (how long?) until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.<note place="margin">2 Chro. 36. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But it is objected, what if the minister be of bad life and conversation? we finde<note place="margin">Esra. 2. 62.</note> that those that were polluted were put from the Priesthood. To this we answer, many times it falls out that either for a small cause, or sometime upon no just one, the Minister may be accounted scandalous. If the offence be given really, and that without hope of the parties reclaiming that gives it, there is a legal course (yet with charity) to be taken against him, the censures of the Church must be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised against him, but in the mean time, we must carry a fair respect to them for his sake by whom they are sent; for the word we hear of them is not the word of<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 13.</note> men, but of God. Health is not refused though it come to us by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription<note place="margin">1 Kin. 17. 6.</note> of a sick man. <hi>Elias</hi> refused not his food, though brought to him by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.<note place="margin">Jo. 13. 29.</note> Nor was Christs almes one jote the worse, though distributed by the hands of <hi>Judas.</hi>

Nor did the Grecian Monarchy come to its period, till <hi>Alexander</hi> for want of knowing God, would himself be reputed a God, and till his successours fell to covetousnesse; whereby a needles dearth fell upon it, and the greater began to oppresse the inferiour, and the Prince to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his subjects.</p>
               <p>And Lastly, the Roman, Monarchy came to that we see it is at this day, from the most flourishing of all the former, by their own pride, envy, emulation, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning.</p>
               <p>And these miseries befel al these four Monarchies by reason of these vices, which the laws of God would not have suffered, if there had been any to teach them, and the laws of the Heathen could not correct.</p>
               <p>If we come to our own nation in the time of the Brittains, the often and frequent wrongs and injuries of great persons, the perverting of the Laws, which were made to be Cobwebs to catch onely the small flies, while the great ones break through. The Corruptions of Lawyers, maintaining causes and suits for their fee, by which the land was overrun with oppression, (Gods law being not heard in the mean time) brought destruction upon the land.</p>
               <p>Nor is it possible by any Act of Parliament, Law or Statute, to provide or take, order that a man shall not be covetous, or that there be no Idlenesse, Ryot, Pride, Envy, or the like sins in the soul, though these (as is said) were the chief causes that these Monarchies and other Countryes came to destruction. For Sobriety and all vertues must be begotten in the minde, and that by such persons, as shall be able to reach and instill them out of the Law of God, otherwise politick justice will never continue among men.

And that there were Schools and Colledges at Jerusalem, (if any man could doubt that such a great and populous City should be without them) may appear<note place="margin">Luke 2. 46.</note> by diverse places, where we read of wise men, Scribes, and Doctors of the Law,<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 34. Acts 5. 34.</note> Counsellers, &amp;c. who must needs have some places, where they studied the Law,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 15.</note> and heard it expounded, &amp;c. Besides it was the command of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he should be conversant in the study of those things which he prescribed him, which he could not do, if there had not been places to study in. And his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of such places, he shewed, when he disputed daily in the School of one <hi>Tyrannus, Acts</hi> 19. 9. Such places then have alwayes been, and that not onely for the studie of Religion and the Laws of God; but also of humanity and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Arts.</p>
               <p>And as there were Schools, so no doubt there were Guides, such as should instruct them. In the time of the Gospel <hi>Gamaliel</hi> was a Doctor of the Law. And<note place="margin">Acts 4. 34.</note> not onely Guides for Divinity, but Tutors too for the <hi>Encyclia,</hi> that learning which comprehendeth the liberal Sciences: such as was <hi>Moses</hi> learning, and the learning of<note place="margin">7. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon.</hi> For (whatsoever some men account of that which they call prophane<note place="margin">1 Reg. 4. 30.</note> learning) none can be fitter to enter upon the sacred mysteries of Divinity, then they which have been first well instructed and grounded in the general learning and knowledge of the Arts.</p>
               <p>Nor is it fit that young men should leave their studies, as soon as they be a little initiated in Divinity (as many now adayes do) but rather stay till they have years and be well grounded. God (as is said before) would have none ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to serve in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, but from thirty years old and upward. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> not to admit young novices to<note place="margin">Numb. 4. 3.</note> the sacred calling of dispensing the mysteries of Christ. There are in Scripture<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3 6.</note> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, some things hard to be understood, which they that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> are ready to wrest. Christ was long among his Disciples, yet they were<note place="margin">John 14. 9.</note> to seck in some things. And therefore I say; as the Prophet in another case, they ought not to go out in haste, but remain at their studies, till by the help of their<note place="margin">Esay 52. 12.</note> Guides, their own industry, and Gods blessing, they be able to teach others; and have approved themselves workmen that need not to be ashamed, rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 15.</note> the word of truth, and then <hi>sacri sunto,</hi> let such in the name of God be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and go boldly about the Lords work.</p>
               <p>Now as there must be Schools of learning to fit men for this sacred calling, so there ought to be maintenance provided for them, for the Apostle saith, that as the Priests that served at the Altar, lived of the Altar; so they that<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 13, 14</note> now preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel. And this by special ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Christ, who hath so appointed, and the Apostles reason taken from the maintenance of the Priests that served at the Altar, shewes, that the same proportion of a tenth part, which was paid then to the Levites and Priests under the Law, is still due to the Priesthood, and Ministery of the Gospel;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59534:173"/>
and the Commandement for tythes extends to both: besides the Apostle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth,<note place="margin">5, 8, 9, 10. &amp;c.</note> that he which labours for others, ought to eat the fruit of his labours, and be maintained by them who reap the benefit of his labours. He proves it from the bruit creatures; <hi>the mouth of the ox must not be muzled that treadeth out the corn:</hi> he proves further from men of secular callings, whether in time of war or peace. <hi>The souldier goes not to warfare at his own charge, nor doth the husbandman feed his flock, or plant, or sowe, but in hope to reap the fruit of his pains;</hi> from whence he infers, that the spiritual husbandman that soweth spiritual things to others, ought to partake of their harvest in temporall things for whose good he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>Now this maintenance if any ask what it is, I answer, that now as alwayes heretofore from the beginning, it consisted of something certain, and something free and voluntary. The certain maintenance is tythes. The voluntary, oblations: we finde in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when they entred into a vow and Covenant to keep the<note place="margin">Nehe. 10. 33. 34. 37. &amp;c.</note> law after their return from captivity, that both these were part of that Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Tenths and oblations, which they bound themselves to pay for the service of Gods house.</p>
               <p>For tythes, as the seventh part of our time, so at least the tenth part of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is due to God. Reasons.<note place="margin">Of tythes, that the tenth is due to God.</note>

Now if they be due to our high Priest who lives for ever, no question but the Priests and ministers of the Gospel, whom he hath made his Stewards, and whom he hath sent as his father sent him, ought in his right to receive, and to them the people ought to pay their tythes, as to Christ, to whom they belong: for Christ having ordained a maintenance for the Ministers<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 14</note> of the Gospel, and no other certain maintenance being specified, it can be no other then this of tythes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Jacobs</hi> promise long before the law, to give tythes to God of all he possest, compared with <hi>Abrahams</hi> practise before, and the Apostles rule, that the labourer<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 21.</note> is worthy of his wages, with the perpetual practise of the Church (the best expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 18.</note> of the Law) shew this duty to be moral and perpetual.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The chief and principal reason why God reserved the tenth for himself, and gave it to those that served at the Altar, is moral and perpetual; For he reserved the tenth to himself, <hi>in signum universalis Dominii,</hi> as an acknowledgement of that<note place="margin">Levit. 27. 30.</note> all we have is his, and he gave it to the Priests and Levites for their service in<note place="margin">Numb. 18. 21, 24.</note> the Tabernacle.

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note> it may appear, it was not Christs intent to abrogate tythes, or the Apostles meaning to abridge the Ministers maintenance, but that at least a tenth should be paid.</p>
               <p>As I said before of the time of publick worship, that it is probable the seventh day was<note place="margin">Annot. 27.</note>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59534:173"/>
and that the day was altered by the Apostles herein authorized by Christ, so likewise I say concerning tythes, it is the more probable opinion, that God appointed this proportion for himself from the beginning, that as by observing the day, so by paying the tenth all men might acknowledge God to be Creatour and Lord of all, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they enjoy is his free gift, and therefore this precept not being given onely to the Jews, and the reason of the Command being moral and perpetual, and no abrogation of it made by Christ or his Apostles, but ratl es many things found in the new Testament, which seem to confirm it, is of force still, and obligeth all Christians under the Gospel; we finde it not onely practised before by the Patriarchs, but some reliques of it among the Heathen. The Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romanes gave the tenth to <hi>Apollo,</hi> to <hi>Hercules,</hi> to <hi>Jupiter, &amp;c.</hi> The like <hi>Theophanus</hi> reports of the Egyptians, and <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> of the Persians, <hi>Plutarch</hi> of others; which practise came no doubt from the universal tradition derived from the beginning, not wholly obliterated, though much corrupted; as all divine institutions, which were positive and not meerly flowing from the light of nature, were among them. For as was said before of the time, so it may be said of the maintenance for Gods worship, though natural reason dictates, that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion must be allowed, and that this proportion of the tenth is very congruous and reasonable, yet there can no necessary reason from meer natural principles be given, why a seventh part of our time, or a tenth of our estate, and no other proportion should be limited: and therefore those that have laboured to urge either of them as a precept or dictate of nature, have thereby wronged the cause they undertook, and given occasion to some to make all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <note place="margin">Of Oblations. Levit. 27.</note> dedicateth or offereth something to God out of his own estate.

And these things thus dedicated were accounted holy to the Lord, to whom they<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> transferred their right.

               <p>Though oblations seem in the general to be free and voluntary, yet we must know,<note place="margin">Annot 28.</note> that some oblations as well as tythes may become due, by Law or custom.

               </argument>
               <p>THis fifth Commandement beginneth the second Table. It is called by some the Table of justice. As the other taught us the love and duty of man to God, so this the love and duty of one man to another: which gives us a Testimony of Gods love towards us: that he made man after his own image, like to himself, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him a Table for his good, and that with more precepts then that of his own.</p>
               <p>The sum or contents of this Table is delivered <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 39 out of <hi>Levit</hi> 19. 18. <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> In which place of Saint <hi>Mat.</hi> Our Saviour saith, that <hi>the second is like the first,</hi> for indeed when we come to the second Table, we depart not from the love and honour of God, it being no lesse in the second, then in the first nay rather somewhat more. The similitude mentioned by our Saviour consisteth in this, that whereas he hath taken order for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in the second, and though it come not so directly to God, yet indirectly it doth, for our love to man must be grounded uponour love of God, we must love him in and for God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Schoolmen make but one Theological vertue of love to God and man.

               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> exemplifieth it by the love and care a man beareth to the ungratious<note place="margin">Christiana. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And for this we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived<note place="margin">1 Jo. 4. 21.</note> a Commandment from God. That as we love God for himself, so we love man for God: the Commandment lieth upon us in both respects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And further this second is like the former, because the love of our neighbour commanded in the second is a signe of our love of God commanded in the first<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 20.</note> table, and therefore Saint <hi>John</hi> saith expresly, <hi>that if any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>James,</hi> say, that <hi>all the law is fulfilled in this one Commandment, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self,</hi> not properly and formally, but <hi>ratione <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59534:175"/>
which is the cause of our obedience to all the other commandments, for Saint <hi>Johns</hi> argument stands thus. Things that are seen, may sooner be beloved then those that are not seen. If then our brethren cannot finde such favour at our hands as to beloved, having seen them, how shall we love God, whom we never saw.</p>
               <p>For as it is true downward, whosoever loveth God, must love his worke, and the best of his work, and therefore man: so upward too, it is necessary. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever loveth man; of whom he oft times receives injuries, must needs love God from whom he receiveth nothing but benefits.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Again this similitude holds in regard of the punishment or reward for keeping or neglecting of this second which is no lesse then for that of the first. Inasmuch as ye did it not (faith our Saviour) to one of these, ye did it not to me and <hi>econtra;</hi> where<note place="margin">In Jo. tract. 17.</note> we see the reward or punishment there mentioned to be given, will be, not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duty done or omitted to God himself, but as he cometh to be considered in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 45.</note> of an afflicted brother, for it is expressed both affirmatively, v. 34, 35. &amp;c. that what was done to them was done to Christ himself, and negatively, v. 42. 43, &amp;c. that what was denyed to them, was denied to Christ.</p>
               <p>And thus we see the reason why Christ saith the second Commandment, or second table, is like the unto the first, and withal the first end or scope of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That God might be loved not onely in and for himself but also in our brother who is to be loved for his sake.</p>
               <p>Another end of the second table is, that as the first is the foundation and ground of all religious society, as we are the Church of God, and is therefore called the great Commandment, so in the second should be laid the ground and foundation of all <hi>Common-wealths</hi> and <hi>Civil societies</hi> of men, as the first doth <hi>perducere nos ad Deum,</hi> as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>unite and bring us to God,</hi> so the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>unites one man to another</hi> by the matual duties they owe one to another this is a second end of this table and it is gathered from the creation of man at the first Gen. 2. 18. Where it is said, that <hi>it is not good for man to be alone, and therefore he must have a helper.</hi> This second table therefore respects the perfecting of Gods purpose in the work of his creation, that one man be an helpe to another.</p>
               <p>The words [<hi>Love thy neighbour as thy self</hi>] contain three things.</p>

               <p>In the duty Commanded which is the sum of the second table, we must know first what is the sence of the words. As there are in Latine, so in Greek and Hebrew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>He that is the object of our love is expressed in Scripture by three words, which are distinguisht in the Hebrew, as well as in the Latine. 1. <hi>Amicus, a friend or fellow.</hi> 2. <hi>Proximus, a neighbour.</hi> 3. <hi>Frater, a brother;</hi> which is used by <hi>S.

               <p n="1">1. In brethren there is <hi>identitas naturae, &amp;c. identity of nature,</hi> which makes all creatures love one another; one beast delighting in another of the same kinde, and little children delighting in their image in the glasse, shew this.</p>

               <p>Now in the case between the health or good of our own body, and of our brothers soul, it thus stands. There can come no participation of the glory of God to our bodies, <hi>nisi per redundantiam, as it were by an overflowing,</hi> when the soul being full communicates it to the body.

               <p>HOnour thy father and mother. The last commandment is the fountain from whence all the rest of the second table do proceed, as streames from the conduite head, for as the first commandment contains the inward love and worship of God, from whence all the other duties of the second table arise, so the last contains the inward love and dutie of the heart which we ow to our neighbour, from whence all other duties to our neighbour do spring, so that the tenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is the fountain, and the other five are the streams. And the streams re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a second division thus, for either they do equally, and alike concern al men, in general as the 6. 7. 8. 9. Or else they have special respect to some as the fifth. The general duties in the 6. 7. 8. and 9.

In the eighth a restraint of covetousnes which is <hi>concupiscentia oculorum, the lust of the eyes,</hi> which in respect of man is an offence against the politick state, by doing wrong to another in his goods, and in respect of God perverts the rule of justice prescribed by him.</p>

               <p>As the other commandements respect all men in general, so the fifth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects some in special, <hi>viz.</hi> inferiours and superiours, and other mutual duties.</p>
               <p>This fifth commandment being placed in the front of the second table hath an eye also to the first commandment of the first table. The one commanded the honour of God; the other of his vicegerents.</p>
               <p>It containeth a precept, and a promise.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The precept is, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother.</hi>

                  <item>2. The promise, that thy dayes may be long &amp;c.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Some think the first words contain the duty of the inferiour and the last words (that thy dayes &amp;c.) contain the duty of the superiour, because it is the duty of parents by providing for their children, and praying for them, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>As God in his infinite wisdom disposeth all things in due order, so here he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his wisdom more particularly known to us in the disposition of these command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for by setting this in the first place of the second table, he would have us take notice, that after he hath taken order for his own honour in the first table, his principall and first care is for honour to parents, from whom next under him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self we receive our being: and therefore <hi>Philo</hi> saith, the honour due to parents<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 19.</note> is set before all other duties we owe to men, and placed as it were <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>confinio, in the confines of a mortal and eternal nature,</hi> it is set in the middle, betweenh the duties to God and man, because this commandment is the preserver bot of the first and second table; for take away honour and obedience to superiours, and all duties to God and man are neglected, and fal to the ground. Besides we may observe that God delighteth in his charge to us, to knit up whatsoever he especially commandeth in a short and narrow compasse; pressing more especially in every commandment some one more remarkable word in the commandments ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, he maketh choice of the most ugly and deformed word of that sinne, which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to terrifie us even from the very handmayds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants of it. And in this affimative commandment he makes choice of the best words he can, as father, and mother, for the object, and of honour, to set out the duty unto us.</p>
               <p>Now as we said before of the love of our neighbour, so here we may say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning honour, there are two grounds of either.</p>

               </list>
               <p>In the ordering of our love, we shewed, how that we are to respect the conjunction by nature or grace in the duties of love which we freely performe, and that we owe not so much to those persons with whom we have no such conjunction thus we should prefer a faithful man before an infidel, because in the one there is onely the image of God by nature, it is both by creation and regeneration, and as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, with the faithful <hi>semper futuri sumus</hi> we shall live for ever. And among the faithful, we should rather do good to those of our own country, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>This we shewed was the order of love in respect of neernesse of conjunction with us.

Paul</hi> honoured <hi>Nero</hi> an Infidel appealing<note place="margin">Acts 25. 11.</note> to him. Thus a stranger may be honoured rather then one of our own countrey, as <hi>Daniel</hi> was honoured by <hi>Darius</hi> above all the Princes of Babylon: and <hi>Joseph</hi> though<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 3.</note> a stranger, by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> above all the Rulers of Egypt.

               <p>Now such persons as are to be honoured, in respect of their excellent gifts, and of their neernesse to God, which we ought to esteem and honour above all neernesse to our selves, by any relations to us, and that not onely for it self, but also our honour and respect being the reward which God hath appointed to such gifts, although in respect of our selves also we are to regard them, they being of great use and profit to us by their guifts.

from the Apostles discourse in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. where he goes thus to work; first, he<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2 2.</note> layes his ultimate scope and highest end next his own glory. Now that they may be saved, he would have them live <gap reason="foreign">

And that they may live thus, he would have them taught the knowledge of God, <hi>that they come to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> for men cannot live Godly till they be taught to live so. And both these do necessarily require outward peace, rest, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, that they may intend this knowledge the better, and learn how to live godly, (for in wars and tumults there is nothing rightly administred, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, <hi>a quiet life,</hi> in regard of inward tumults, and intestine troubles. Now if the natural father and mother could perform this alone, as they did for some time, in the infancy of the world, and a little after the flood before man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde multiplied and increased to greater numbers, there should have needed no other office to be instituted for the attaining of these ends. But shortly after the flood, there comes one <hi>Nimrod,</hi> with a company of hounds at his tail, (for the Metaphor<note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> of <hi>hunting</hi> used by the holy Ghost implies, that they deserved no better name) with these sons of <hi>Belial</hi> he takes upon him to be a <hi>Hunter,</hi> that is a chaser of men up and down, and disturbs their peace and quiet. Hence then comes in a necessity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a supream civil power over mens bodies and estates to restrain all outward force and violence, and withall a spiritual power and authority to instruct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern men in respect of their souls, as God did afterward, when he setled the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical priesthood in the tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> to continue till the coming of Christ, and then the Evangelical Priesthood of Christ, to be continued in the Apostles, and their successors to the end of the world. For because the natural parents could not so well perform both these, as they did at the first, therefore God appointed and ordained these two functions and dignities, and for this cause Honour and Obedience<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> is required to both. <hi>Obey those that have the rule over you,</hi> (that is your spiritual governours) <hi>and submit your selves, for they watch for your souls, &amp;c.</hi> and for this<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. 7. 11. 12</note> of maintaining and relieving father and mother. Therefore the Apostle requires that<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 7.</note> we render to higher powers, <hi>their dues, tribute, and custome,</hi> to shew that our selves are not onely ready in our persons, but our goods too, at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>The last part of obedience is to the other part of the Law; for the Law hath two parts, the one <hi>directive,</hi> and the other <hi>coercive or corrective:</hi> so that if we deny our obedience, we must submit to correction, and yet with <hi>reverence,</hi> as the Apostle<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9.</note> speaks; we must honour the Magistrate, though we be corrected. Thus far for the act commanded, now for the manner of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The second thing to be considered, is the manner how all these duties must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and this consists in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They must be done in <hi>conscience,</hi> and from the <hi>heart,</hi> not with eye-service as unto men, but with singlenesse of heart, as fearing God, as the Apostle speaks.<note place="margin">Colos. 3. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They must be done <hi>alacriter, cheerfully,</hi> and <hi>readily,</hi> not with grudging, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,<note place="margin">23.</note> and repining, whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not as to men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They must be done <hi>perseveranter, with continuance and perseverance,</hi> yea, though we suffer unjustly by them: <hi>for this,</hi> saith <hi>S. Peter, is thank worthy, if a man for conscience towards God, endure grief,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>if he endure and hold out,</hi> though<note place="margin">1 pet. 2. 19.</note> he suffer wrongfully.</p>
               <p>And because we are not naturally given to perform these duties of obedience and subjection, especially in this manner, therefore expositors yield 6 reasons drawn from the duty, as it is expressed and inforced in Scripture, to induce men thereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because God hath placed this Commandment before that of our goods, yea, and of our life: to shew that the maintaining of authority ought to be dearer to us then goods, or life it self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because the name of father and mother, is full of love and reverence, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as some unreasonable beasts perform this duty more exactly then many men. Therefore God includes all superiours here, as Kings, Lords, Masters, &amp;c. under these amiable names of father and mother.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard of the long life annexed to the true performance of this dutie, long life being a thing desirable, and death a thing most repugnant to the nature of man. To live long, and to prosper, is all that men desire upon earth. Therefore the Apostle urges this Commandment from the promise specially annexed to it above the rest. <hi>That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayst live long on the earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Because (as the Apostle tells us) <hi>it is a thing good and acceptable to God;</hi> and<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 3.</note> in another place, <hi>it is well pleasing to God;</hi> he is especially delighted, and highly<note place="margin">Colos. 3. 20.</note> pleased in it. It is both <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="5">5. The Apostle goes further, and saith it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a just thing,</hi>

               <p n="6">6.

Therefore better it is, that due honour be given to them, the better to encourage them to apply themselves to our preservation. Besides, they that deny this to them that are of right invested with it, and take it to themselves, set themselves against God, and go about to build another Babel, which is nothing,<note place="margin">Gen. 11. 4.</note> but bringing in of Anarchie and confusion.</p>

And this loving, nourishing, and defending, are special ends why superiours were ordained. And therefore the reason is added to the Commandment in <hi>Exodus</hi> 20. and enlarged in <hi>Deuter.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>That thy dayes may be prolonged, &amp;c. and that it may go well with thee;</hi> which, as was mentioned before is expounded by some, not as a <hi>promise,</hi> but as the <hi>duty,</hi> and end of superiours, <hi>viz.</hi> That they under God prolong mens dayes, and are or ought to be means, that it may go well with them. This is one end of their superiority. They are not set over the people <hi>colligere auream messem,</hi> to scrape gold and silver for themselves; their own profit and ease is not the end of their authority, though many times rulers look at nothing else. It was the sin of the Princes in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> time, <hi>They accounted the</hi>

                  <hi>city as a cauldron, and the people the flesh to be sod in.</hi> Evil Rulers take their own ease and security, while the profit of the people and inferiours is no whit regarded. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without cause are the two heads before named, of defending and nourishing inferiours, special duties of superiours towards them.</p>
               <p>This which is commonly affirmed, that the end of government is the good of the<note place="margin">Annotat. 29.</note> inferiours, must be understood <hi>cum grano salis;</hi> for from this principle misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,<note place="margin">Of the end of government, and whether people be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</note> some have collected, that because the end is above the means, and more noble, therefore subjects are above their governours, and so may call them to account for their misgovernment, and judge or punish them, and remove them if they see cause: from which false collections, made by seditious and turbulent persons, infinite troubles, confusions, rebellions, and desolations have followed. We must know therefore. 1. That to procure the good of inferiours, is indeed the duty of supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and one end why God committed the people to them; but not the <hi>sole</hi> or <hi>principal</hi> end of their authority: for princes receive their power onely from God, and are by him constituted and intrusted with government of others, chiefly for his own <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> as his Deputies and Vicegerents upon earth, for they are <hi>his Ministers, Rom.</hi> 13. so that the principal end of their government is the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods honour, who is the supream King and Lord of all the world: and therefore if they fail in performance of this trust, they are accountable onely to him, who intrusted them, and not to the people whom he hath put under them, and whom he never authorized to call them to account, but to appeal onely to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not generally true, that all government is onely for the benefit of those that are governed: for some government there is, meerly for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit<note place="margin">H.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59534:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whereas all tyranny is essentially unjust: and some kingdoms may respect the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit both of Prince and people: as when a people not able to defend themselves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to a potent prince for protection and safety, against potent enemies, and so become his subjects.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is verse. 1. God stands among them, he stands in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the mighty, and judgeth among the gods: from whence he infers the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> vers. 2. <hi>How long wil you give wrong judgement, and accept the persons of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">psal. 82.</note> 
                  <hi>ungodly;</hi> seeing (as in the precedent verse) God standeth among you, and seeth<note place="margin">verse. 2.</note> your actions, and not onely so, but <hi>is a judge among you,</hi> and will exact an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of vou.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second reason (in the next two uerses) is grounded upon the end, why this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3,4"/> power is committed to them. <hi>To defend the poor and fatherlesse, them that be in need, the poor and weak:</hi> and not to oppresse them, their power is <hi>contra <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> non contra <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not against men, but sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is from the evil consequences that will follow if they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> justice. In the fift verse he tells them, well, chuse you, if you will be willfully ignorant <hi>in tenebris ambulare walk in darknes,</hi> do so. But this will follow by your ignorance, all the foundations of the earth wil be out of course, <hi>concutientur omnia fundamenta,</hi> all things will go to wrack, you will bring all out of order by it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is because their power is not absolute, but onely delegate <hi>verse</hi> 6.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
                  <hi>I have said you are gods,</hi> indeed you are none. The meaning of this place is expounded by Christ himself, <hi>John</hi> 10. 35. <hi>They are called gods, because the word of God came to them,</hi> that is, they had commission from God; there came a <hi>commission</hi> from God to you, it was but <hi>a delegate power,</hi> therefore you are not to rule absolutely and simply, but by commission, for you have a superiour, and God will have an account from you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And for abusing that commission, <hi>you shall die like men,</hi> there shall be no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> in your death from other, but (he straitway correcteth himself) <hi>you shall fal</hi>

                  <hi>like Princes,</hi> you shall not die like ordinary men, as it is in the book of Wisdom. <hi>potentes potenter punientur,</hi> mighty men shall be mightily tormented.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, because they have sought themselves by this honour which God had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> bestowed upon them, therefore God will arise and take his inheritance into his own hands, (which they have neglected) and he will judge the earth himself, as it is vets. 8. which is more fully expressed by the Prophet <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the duty, <hi>God will arise and take his inheritance into his own hands:</hi> he willdischarge the duty himself.</p>
               <p>There are two questionss concerning obedience to superiour to be resolved, before we enter upon the particular duties, necessary for the right understanding of that which follows: because in the handling of those particulars we shall have occasion to treate of obedience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether inferiours owe any honour to one that is evil. The resolution of which must be affirmative, according to that of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where<note place="margin">Qust. 1.</note> the Apostle reasoneth in the like case. <hi>That the unfaithfulnes of man cannot frustrate the promise of God:</hi> and so it must be said in this case, that the wickednes of man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin">Rom. 13</note> take away the commandment, nor make voyd Gods ordinance. And Gods ordinance it is <hi>for the powers that be, are ordained of God</hi> as the Apostle speaks. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not the evil of the person that can make voyd his ordiuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:59534:190"/>
Now evill is taken two wayes, it is either <hi>Culpae</hi> or <hi>Poenae of sin or punishment,</hi> and so superiours may be evil in both respects, and yet obedience is due.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the penal evil; as when they are rough and froward. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> chargeth servants <hi>to be subject to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And many times the fault is in the people if the king be bad, It is for their<note place="margin">Job. 34. 30.</note> sins that the hyppocrite raignes, and the People are ensnared, as <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> speaks: and therfore where people choose themselves kings or rulers, rejecting the lawful governours, to whom the government rightly belongs; or looking at their own benefit, or liberty, rise against their lawful Princes, and change the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not proceeding in the fear of God, nor looking at his glory, but at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, God punishes people by those rulers they have set up.</p>

Or if I be bound to obey a man, whose power is onely in <hi>spiritual</hi> things, I am not by the same reason to obey him in temporals, whereof he hath no cognizance, he is not to command out of his <hi>series,</hi> he must not <hi>recedere a principio.</hi> But if a king or ruler observe these two points of order, that he do not leave his <hi>series,</hi> nor <hi>recedere a principio,</hi> we are absolutely to obey him.</p>

In this case there is but <hi>one master,</hi> till the Prince break the order himself, and be a master against order, and <hi>do erigere altare contra altare, erect one altar against another.</hi> For it is in <hi>order</hi> as it is in <hi>nature.</hi> The Prince is the chief mover and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, others command under him. Now in nature heavy things descend: and if on any occasion <hi>ad conservationem universi,</hi> they do break their natural course and ascend, this is out of <hi>order,</hi> yet is requisite for a greater good of the universe. So is it in matters of the Commonwealth. If the inferiour Magistrate command one thing, I must not obey him, if a superiour Magistrate command another, for a greater good of the whole land.

               <p>Our Saviour in another place saith, <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body.</hi> In<note place="margin">Luke 12. 4.</note> which place it is plain, that his meaning is, that though we should not break off our obedience from those that have that power, as long they keep within their <hi>series,</hi> yet if once they break order, then <hi>fear them not, but him that after the body is killed, hath power to cast the body into hell,</hi> which is God; otherwise the caveat were needlesse.

               <p>If therefore a superiour command <hi>extra seriem suam, out of his order.</hi> we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our first vow, and disobey him; but in regard of that which hath been said, that God and he are but one Agent, in whatsoever lawfully he commands, we must give him chief and especial honour and obedience.

               <p>We have examples in this kinde.

               <p>But withall, lest we go too far on the one side, it is very necessary that we search not too narrowly, or inquire too precisely into the commands of our Superiours, but<note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 24.</note> rather, if it be in our power, obey. We see <hi>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59534:193"/>
or evidently without the limits and bounds of their authority. Thus <hi>Thom.</hi> 2. 2. q. 104, a, 5. <hi>Cajet. ibid.</hi> The Summists <hi>in verb. Obedientia. Cessius de justitia &amp; jure lib. 2. cap. 6. dub. 4, 5, 6. Valent. 2. 2. disput. 7. q. 3. p. 2, &amp;c.</hi> whence it follows, that the highest power under God being in Kings and Princes, therefore Obedience is due to them in all things which are not evidently forbidden by God. So that Subjects are not to busie themselves about the thing commanded, to know particular reasons for the lawfulnesse, but, if after <hi>moral diligence</hi> fit to be used in all actions of weight, it appear not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or forbidden by God, they ought to obey; and the reason is evident; because the Superiour hath his commission from God, and so his commands are to be looked upon as proceeding from God whose Deputy he is; and therefore they are sufficient ground and warrant for our obedience (God having commanded us, so frequently in Scripture to obey our King) unlesse it appear cleerly that he exceeds his commission, and that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> are crosse to the immediate commands of God.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I say <hi>cleerly</hi> and <hi>evidently,</hi> because in things <hi>doubtful</hi> we ought to obey (the command of a superiour being a determining of the doubt) for though its true that no man ought to do any thing with a doubting conscience, <hi>for whatsoever is not of faith is sin, Rom. 14.</hi> yet the Command of a Superiour is sufficient cause to remove the doubt, he being Gods deputy to resolve us in doubtful cases, so that his command is a resolving of the doubt, after which we ought no longer to doubt. For as S. <hi>Bern.</hi> saith, <hi>Ipsum quem pro Deo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus,<note place="margin">Deut 17. 8, 9, 10.</note> in omnibus quae non sunt aperte contra Deum, tanquam Deum audire debemus: Him who is in Gods stead to us, we ought in all things which are not plainly against God, to obey as God himself.</hi> And S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that a man may justly obey an unjust Prince commanding a thing doubtful, (he instances in war) <hi>si quod jubetur vel non esse contra praeceptum certum sit, vel utrum sit, certum non est, if either it be certain that his command doth not crosse any command of God, or uncertain that it doth.</hi> For herein we more certainly obey God himself, when we obey the certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Deputy, whereas, obeying a doubtful command of God, we certainly disobey his Deputy, and by consequent God himself; and therefore according to that rule, <hi>in dubiis pars tutior eligenda est, in doubtful things its best to go the safest way.</hi> Its more safe to obey then disobey, for it is certain, the thing is commanded by Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie, and uncertain that God hath forbidden it (as is supposed in all doubtful cases) and so by disobeying we run into a certain sin of disobedience to God in his Deputy, to avoid an uncertain sin against God immediately.</p>
               <p>Besides, <hi>in dubiis melior est conditio possidentis, possession is a good plea when the case is doubtful,</hi> and therefore the superiour being in possession of his authority ought to be obyed, in what he commands, though it seem doubtful to us; for <hi>Quisque praesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur esse bonus, donec constet de contrario, and so the commands of superiours must be presumed to be lawful, till the contrary plainly appear: he that is not against us, is for us, Luke 9. 10.</hi> So that they take a wrong course and perplex their consciences that say, this is unlawful, for where is it commanded in Scripture; when as they ought to say, this is lawful being commanded by my superiour, for where is it forbidden in Scripture. For though the command of a Superiour cannot make that lawful in it self, which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God, yet it may enable me in a doubtful case to do that lawfully, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which without such a command had been sinful and lyable to punishment. <hi>Conscience</hi> indeed is a judge immediately under God, yet as <hi>Alex. Halen</hi> saith, it is so onely in such things as are immediately commanded or forbidden by God, but in other things which God hath left to authority, it must be guided and regulated by <hi>authority:</hi> and this doctrine is so necessary <hi>in praxi,</hi> as <hi>Suarez</hi> well notes, for the preserving of government, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of sedition, that publick peace cannot otherwise be maintained. Neither let any say It is against my <hi>Conscience;</hi> for what is onely <hi>doubtful,</hi> is no more against the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> then with it, and when the scale hangs even, as in doubtful cases, if the weight of authority will not turn the scale, either the authority is made very light, or there is some fault in the beam, as one saith. Nay suppose they do not well in commanding, yet so long as there appears no sin in obeying, <hi>Tolle quod tuum est, &amp; vade,</hi> (as <hi>S. Bernard</hi> saith) <hi>take what is thine, and go thy wayes,</hi> thou shalt not be accountable for the evil that follows. The excellency of Obedience is to look at Gods will represented to us in his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, which may make the same act, which it may be was sinful in him that commands, become an act acceptable and rewarded by God in him that obeyes.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The first Combination, between man and wife. The special end of Matrimony, implied in three words. 1. <hi>Conjugium.</hi> 2. <hi>Matrimonium.</hi> 3. <hi>Nuptiae.</hi> The office of the husband. 1. Knowledge to govern his wife. 2. Conjugal love. 3. To provide for her and the family. The wives duties answerable to these, <hi>officia resultantia,</hi> Duties arising from these. The duties of Parents and children. The duties of Masters and servants.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Now concerning particular duties between superiours and inferiours, first we shall handle the duties of those which constitute a <hi>family,</hi> and then of others, where in the family both Heathen and Christians make three relations or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations. 1. Of the <hi>husband and the wife.</hi> 2. Of <hi>the Parent and the child.</hi> 3. Of <hi>the Master and the servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The husband and wife stand first in order. 1. because the husband is <hi>paterfamilias, the father of the family,</hi> and the wife <hi>materfamilias the mother of the family.</hi> 2. because God kept this order in the Creation, he made man and wife before sons and daughters. 3. Because not onely children and servants, but Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and al other superiours arise from this primitive combination between man and wife, and the first subjection or subordination of an inferiour to a superiour (from<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 22.</note> whence al other have their rise) is that of the wife to her husband, whom Saint<note place="margin">Col. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> requires <hi>to submit or be subordinate to the husband in the Lord</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c <hi>Let them be subordinate to their own husbands.</hi> 4. Because though there be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral relation or conjunction between father and son; yet there is a neerer between man and wife, she was made of his rib, and God hath commanded a man to leave father and mother and cleave to his wife: therefore we shall give to this the first place.</p>
               <p>And because, as the Ethnick said well <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>we must first learn when we are yong what we must practise when we become men:</hi> therefore though we be not now in the state of marriage, yet the knowledge of these duties may<note place="margin">These le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures were delivered in a Colledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</note> be useful to us for the future.</p>
               <p>And before we speak of this combination between man and wife, it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful first to consider the special ends of <hi>Conjugal society,</hi> which are two. The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern God, the other the parties themselves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is, that 1. Seeing God made a promise to <hi>Abraham that in his seed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>all the families of the earth should be blessed;</hi> every <hi>paterfamilias, father of a family</hi> ought to ayme at this, that his family may partake of this blessing. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he do <hi>monstrare pietatem, shew piety at home,</hi> and labour to make his family<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 4.</note> godly, this being the way to attain the end, blessednes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The secondary ends, which concern the parties themselves, may be gathered from three words in Latine which the bond of wedlock is expressed by. 1. <hi>Conjugium.</hi> 2. <hi>Matrimonium.</hi> 3. <hi>Nuptiae:</hi> whereof two signifie what was before sinne came into the world: and the last, what did follow after sinne; and in these ends are some mutual duties implied also, which concerne both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is <hi>Conjugium,</hi> which is the fellowship of one yoke, when two draw one yoke together, Hence it appears, that <hi>mutuum auxilium. The mutual help,</hi> benefit and comfort, which the one ought to have by society with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the first end of this conjunction, that they might be better, then if they were alone. And therefore (as you may see) it was Gods purpose before copulation<note place="margin">Gen. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> was mentioned, to provide a <hi>Help for Adam.</hi> And hence it is, that the word <hi>maritare to marry,</hi> or to joyn a woman to a man, came to signifie the setting of vines to elmes or other trees, to make them grow and thrive better. Now we must not conceive, that God in this first institution accounted solitude to be a sin, for then there was no sin; but because it was a lesse felicity, a lesse blessed estate then society, therefore he thought fit to make <hi>sociam a fellow</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect he saith. it is not <hi>bonum not good</hi> for man to be alone, as also having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59534:194"/>
to the time, when the world was yet empty: whereas in these times, when the world is so well filled; and in some places over full, society is not so needful. In which respect the Apostle seems to set down the plain opposite conclusion to this. <hi>Bonum est <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> non tangere, it is good for a man not to touch a woman;</hi> which is to be understood<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 11. 26</note> in a diverse respect because of the present trouble of the Church, which was then under persecution, and not otherwise: for in several respects that may be good at one time which is not at another; for otherwise when sin entred, there was more need of the help of society, in regard of sin to be avoyded, the imperfections of old age, diseases, and infirmities &amp;c. It was very convenient there should be a<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>yoke fellow.</hi> And therefore it is that God saith, <hi>that a man should for sake father and mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall be one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> which shews the necessity, as well as the neernes of this conjunction: and hence the Prophet termes the wife <hi>a companion</hi> and wife of the covenant. There is <hi>a league</hi> between them, wherein they promise mutual help. This conjunction, and the indissolubility of it, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 14.</note> mentioneth in one verse, they are no more twain, but one flesh; what therefore God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder.</p>
               <p>Now if they ought to be helpful to one another in the things of this life, we may hence argue <hi>a minori ad majus,</hi> that matches ought not to be made with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and unbeleevers, because they will be rather hindrances, then helpers in the best things, which concerne the soul; and therefore the Apostle exhorts, <hi>not to be unequally yoked with unbeleevers, but to marry onely in the Lord;</hi> not but that such marriages being made, are valid, for as the same Apostle saith, <hi>the unbeleeving wife is sanctified by the beleeving husband, and the beleeving man may save his wife,</hi> and so <hi>e contra;</hi> and therefore the same Apostle saith, that <hi>the beleeving husband ought not to put away the unbeleeving wife, nor the beleeving wife to leave her unbeleeving husband,</hi> but when they are free and at liberty to chuse, they should avoyd such unequal yokes: for <hi>multa fieri non debent, quae facta valent, many things ought not to be done, which yet being done, are not void, or null, but are valid and firme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is <hi>Matrimonium,</hi> which imports another end of marriage <hi>viz</hi> that <hi>foemina fiat mater, the woman may become a mother.</hi> This was part of Gods institution before <hi>Adams</hi> fall: for he saith, <hi>Crescite &amp; multiplicamini, be fruitful</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>and multiply, and have dominion over the Creatures,</hi> yet the end is not barely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, as of other things, to replenish the world, but there was a higher end aymed at, to wit, the propagation of a holy seed for the enlarging of the Church, that there might be <hi>semen sanctum,</hi> and for this cause God made but one woman, though he could have created more (as the Prophet speaks) by the plenty of spirit he could have made more helps then one, but he made but one, that he might raise up to himself a godly seed. And this is one especial end of matrimony; not to fill the world, and therefore the Apostle speaking of the woman, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 15.</note> that sinne came into the world by her, yet saith, this shoud be a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate means to save her, that she shall beare children, which may be <hi>semen sanctum, a holy seed,</hi> and even that sanctification shall result to her benefit, as an under means: and so not onely the increase, <hi>populi,</hi> but <hi>populi sancti,</hi> the enlarging<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 14.</note> of the Church, is the second end.<note place="margin">15.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The last is <hi>nuptiae,</hi> which imports something which came aster sin had entred into the world. For <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> saith, that <hi>nubo</hi> in the first signification hath no other sense, but <hi>tegere, to cover,</hi> as it is plain in <hi>obnubo,</hi> and the rest of its compounds; or it denotes to us, that there is <hi>aliquid tegendum &amp;celandum, some what to be concealed and covered;</hi> and there was some cause of shamefastnes, when the fig-leaves were sowed together. The cause is, that after they had sinned, the inferiour parts, as the appetite, grew to be irregular and unruly. Whereupon, as the Apostle speaks, the devil takes occasion to tempt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and therefore he advises, <hi>that to avoyd fornication, every man have his own wife, and every woman her own husband,</hi> that<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 5. 12.</note> so they may have <hi>Thorum immaculatum, the bed undefiled.</hi> This <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the avoyding of a strange woman, which he accounts a special part of wisdom; and so this end includes that duty of fidelity, which the one owes to the other; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> fornication be avoyded, there can be no mutual fidelity. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle<note place="margin">prov. 5. 20.</note> saith, that the one of the married persons hath not power over their own body, but the other: the third end then of this <hi>Nuptiae</hi> is to avoyd fornication.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59534:194"/>
So that the three general ends of this duty are first. <hi>Mutuum auxilium, mutual help</hi> denoted by <hi>conjugium;</hi> secondly, <hi>Proles yssue,</hi> signified by <hi>Matrimonium;</hi> thirdly, The avoyding of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>This for the general ends; Now for the particular duties of man and wife.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now for the particular duties, the first duty of the husband to the wife is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in these word by Saint <hi>Peter, to live with her according to knowledge,</hi> he must know how to govern her. Because as we see in the case of the first wife, she<note place="margin">1 pet. 3. 7.</note> was beguiled by the serpent, and seduced her husband; therefore in the sixteenth<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6. 12.</note> verse of that chapter God told her, <hi>that her desire should be subject to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">22</note> immodest outward allurements ought to be far from them: according to the Apostles rule, they ought to adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes and sobriety, not with broydered haire or gold, or pearles, or costly array, but (which becometh women professing godlines) with good works. And<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 910</note> 
                  <hi>S.

               <p>Now besides the duties between <hi>natural parents and children,</hi> there are others like those <hi>officia resultantia,</hi> of which we spake, to which the father and son respectively are bound: and first of the father.</p>
               <p n="1">1, Because God oftimes takes away the father from the son, that chief du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can no longer be performed by him, therefore God taketh order, that there be <hi>officia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>In the law it is more plain, for God there giveth charge, that if any one for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty<note place="margin">Levit. 25. 48.</note> should sell himself; his brother, his uncle, or his uncles son were to redeem<note place="margin">Num. 35. 15.</note> him.

               <p n="2">2. In the next place, as there is a duty in fathers to the children of their kindred, so likewise is there a duty of children to the kindred of their father, and their elders. We see this most excellently described in the story of <hi>Ruth;</hi> who though <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi</hi> were but her mother in law, yet she would not forsake her, but accompanied her into her own country, and there was very careful to relieve her.

The third Combination is between the Master and the servant, the master being in the family, as the magistrate and superiour is in the Civilbody; onely here the institution was from man, but the approbation was from God, whereas the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the supreme Civil power in kings was from God.

               <p>For the first institution of this relation, we read of no servants at the beginning, for if man had continued in his innocency, there should have been none: and there were none, we read of, till the time of <hi>Cham,</hi> who for dishonouring his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 25.</note> was changed from a son to a servant of servants, by the curse of <hi>Neah,</hi> and the confirmation of it by God.

               <p>Servitude is of three kinds or sorts. First by nature. Secondly by war. Thirdly by Covenant.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The second way was by force or war. Thus the Posterity of <hi>Cham</hi> were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men: and which is strange, though the curse of God was upon him and<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 36.</note> his posterity, that they should be servants, yet they were the first that began to hunt men, and to make servants of others (thereby drawing that curse upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves afterwards) and thus came in <hi>servitus belli, service of necessity;</hi> necessity being that which <hi>dat legem legi, imposeth a law upon the law:</hi> as in the case of <hi>Joseph,</hi>

                  </hi> and his crew <hi>Lot</hi> was taken prisoner, and became a captive or servant for the time, till <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> rescued him. This is the second way.<note place="margin">14. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The last way is <hi>servitus Pacti, servitude by Covenant;</hi> and this came upon the necessity which the other brought with it. For because men were desirous to be freed from the cruelty of the Soveraignty of tyrants, they willingly gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to such as would use them well, and were able to defend them from the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59534:198"/>
tyranny of others. And the Jews say, that the great number of servants that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had, came to him by this means: for they seeing the equity of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and comparing it with the harsh dealing of those Lords they were subject to, came willingly to him, and became of his family.</p>
               <p>And this proved to be a great benefit to them: for when he himself had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the seal of the covenant, the <hi>Sacrament of Circumcision,</hi> the very same day he made all his servants partakers of it. So that though their bodies were in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their sculs were made free, and were set at liberty by it; and therefore it was a good exchange for them. And in this respect it was, that it was prohibited the Jews, to take any bond-servants of the Isiaelites, but out of the heathen, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more might be brought into Gods covenant. Afterwards this kinde of service was established upon other respects, which drew Godly men to it, and made it, lawful: for though that other servitude by war, whereby one is forced to be a servant, may be unjust, so that such servants, if they can escape, they may with a safe conscience, especially when they are taken in an unjust war, and have not bound themselves by a free promise, as those that are slaves to the Turkes; yet no doubt but a man may by his voluntary Covenant make himself a servant, and this Covenant binds him, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was by covenant to serve <hi>Laban</hi> seven years for his wife, and seven years for sheep and cattel. Thus in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And thus came service into the world, first by the justice of God; as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne, though afterwards this <hi>

               <p>And first for their qualification. They must be <hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for teaching and instructing youth.</p>
               <p>And the first thing required in a teacher, which must be laid as the ground work for all his other duties, is to choose fit persons for his Scholers, by judgeing of their disposition, whether they be meet for publick imployments in Church or state; we see, when there were three offered themselves to follow our Saviour, he perceiving their <hi>indoles and disposition</hi> and that some of them were not fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure persecution, or to leave the world, chose onely one of them, and rejected the other two. And though he had many Disciples, yet knowing all of them not to<note place="margin">Luc. 16. 13.</note> be fit for the governing and instructing of his Church, he therefore chose out of them first 12. whom he called <hi>Apostles,</hi> and out of the rest afterwards he chose seuenty two
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59534:202"/>
whom he sent forth, but with lesse power then the Apostles, (for the twelve and the seventy two were distinct orders) and in choosing them Christ shewed he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended to have equality in his Church, but that there should be different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, according to the diversity of gifts and abilities, and that those of the best gifts should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and hence the Church afterwards had diverse offices in the Church, as so many several steps, as the <hi>Lectores, Acoluthi &amp;c.</hi> By which their gifts and abilities being tryed they might ascend, and be chosen to higher employments. As under the law among the Levites, who were under the Priests, there were <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral orders and ranks,</hi> as the Netophathites, Korathites, Meiarites &amp;c. Now in the choice which our Saviour made helooked partly at the <hi>Indoles and natural aptitude</hi> of his Scholers, for the employments which he intended for them: as we see in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> whom he made chief among the Apostles, there were in him three signes by which the brethren would have wits to be chosen; as first, Constancy and unweariednes in taking paines, wherupon Christ when he beheld<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 42.</note> him, said, he should be called <hi>

                     </gap> a stone;</hi> secondly, love to his master, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears both by his counsel he gave him, to save himself, which argued his affection, and his offering himself to die for him; and lastly, his <hi>indoles mansueta, his gentle</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 26. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>tractable nature,</hi> being willing to heare of his faults, though it were by his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as when he was reproved by <hi>Paul.</hi> So in the choice of the sons of <hi>Zebedee;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 11.</note> he considered their fervent and hot disposition, whereupon they were named sons of Thunder; upon which <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observed, that those whom Christ chose<note place="margin">Luc. 9. 34.</note> were like pretious stones which that skilful lapidary knew how to discerne,<note place="margin">Marc. 3. 17.</note> and though they were then unpolisht, yet by his instruction and discipline he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht them afterwards. So that we see disciples fit for those callings, are not to be promiscuously taken, but a choice must be made with judgement, especially he that must be fit for the sacred calling, must be <hi>unus inter mille, one of a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job. 33. 23.</note>

               </p>
               <p>As there must be a choice in the teacher, so the duty lies upon him that offers himself to be taught, if he know himself naturally unfit, he ought not to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for those <hi>high callings,</hi> nor aspire to them, when he is naturally fitted onely for inferiour employments. The Prophet saith, that though in his time many that were unfit would needs be Prophets, yet in the times of the Gospel he foretells, they should acknowledge their infirmities, and say, I <hi>am no prophet, but an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, and therein have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <note place="margin">prov. 17. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>seeing they have no heart to it.</hi> It is but time and mony spent in vain.

And as no doctrine will enter into him, so nei her will any discipline work upon him; for as he sheweth further, if he be sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the fining, if gold, the fornace will do him good, if there be any mettal in him, he is like to prove well: but if he be a fool or unfit, bray him in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>As the teacher then must examine the disposition of the schollers, so the schollers must <hi>interrogare seipsos ask themselves,</hi> whether they be able to uudertake this; and if not, to take another course of life. It was the opinion of the fathers of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, that in making this choice of men in their schooles, that were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to their principal Churches, that a man ought rather to be too strict, then too loose; and their reason was.

The neglect of this, by taking into the Church all commers, was the cause, that as the Prophet complained, <hi>the,</hi> Sun <hi>was gone down upon their Prophets,</hi> that they<note place="margin">Math. 3. 6.</note> were stich ignorant sots, <hi>Bardi, such stupid, blinde guids, which caused the people to erre,</hi> and brought such darknes into the Church, that as the Prophets <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The wiseman speaking of the Ant, besides her industry saith, that she hath a<note place="margin">prov. 1. 6. 7. 8.</note> natural quality, that without guide, overseer, or governour, she provideth her meat in summer, and in hearvest for winter, and this is the first endowment, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lertia naturalis, a natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, or ability of nature,</hi> which ought to be in them, that are intended to be leaders of others. And this ability is by the <hi>active part of the understanding,</hi> the <hi>intellectus agens,</hi> whereby they are apt to <hi>dilate and enlarge</hi> what they heare, and to work upon what they are taught, and thereby become <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> able to learn of themselves, by improving those principles they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from others. This appeared in Saint <hi>Augustine, Erasmus,</hi> and others, who in many things were <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and without help of teachers in those things became excellent.</p>

               <p>Thus it must be presupposed, that the choice is rightly made, els <hi>difficultas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. Now the choice being rightly made, in the second place we come to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction it self: of which we are to conceive, that as we see in other things, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse things are effected by an exteriour agent, as things artificial, and some things must have <hi>interius principium</hi> a foundation within, as things natural have their principle within them, and in some things there must be both, as in Physick. For though in a body ill affected, sometimes the strength of nature alone of it self is able to concoct the humour, and make digestion, and so many times it falleth out, that some become extraordinarily learned without paines taking, as <hi>

                     </gap>,</hi> yet in some bodies to help concoction, Physick is to be applied, something must be given from without, to comfort and help nature. So we must conceive in teaching, every one hath not thos enatural parts which are sufficient, nor is every mans supernaturally and extraordinarily inspired and qualified by God, but must have teaching and instruction by the ministrie of man from without, every man must not look to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> taught immediatly of God, but must in ordinary course have a teacher which doth not adde any thing to the soul, but minister to it, and help it; as Physick doth not adde to nature, but ministers to it, to comfort and strengthen it, though indeed they that are instructed by men, may be said to be taught of God, as they are said to be healed of any infirmity by him, which are cured by Physick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:59534:203"/>
And in this we say, <hi>that the natural light workes,</hi> which is <hi>lume n naturale,</hi> and that <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ohu. 1. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>infusum</hi> is supplied and holpen by the teacher, of whom we are to conceive, that he is not the giver of infused light, but the minister, that supplies matter, as oyle whereby the light burns, which he doth partly by making things plain, by similitudes and examples, and sometimes by Antithesis. And not onely so, but being able to see how every conclusion depends upon the <hi>premises,</hi> and how the <hi>medium</hi> ought to be disposed with the <hi>subject</hi> and <hi>praedicate</hi> in every proposition, is able in the same course whereby he learnt, to shew others how to bring things into me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and order. In which two things. 1. by making dark things known and discerned. Secondly, by a perspicuous disposing and ordering of things confused teaching cheifly consists, and by these the light is holpen, whether it be naturally or supernaturally given.</p>
               <p>This being premised, we will come to mutual duties or qualities of teacher and hearer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is, they must be perswaded, as Saint <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>That every good gift is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights,</hi> and therefore that this<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 17.</note> light of knowledge cannot be had but <hi>desuper</hi> from above, as <hi>John Baptist</hi> told his schollers. <hi>A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">John 3. 27.</note> knowledge nor any good thing els can be had but from God, and therefore we must be thus perswaded, <hi>That all the light we can have, is from Gods light,</hi> as<note place="margin">pfal. 36. 9</note> the Psalmist hath it, <hi>in thy light we shall see light;</hi> we have no light of our own, but as the Apostle speaks, <hi>God who commanded the light to shine out of darknes hath shined in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> hearts to give the light of knowledge:</hi> and by this light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note> supernatural we shall be able to see further into mysteries then by the natural.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first means to attain to this light, is by prayer. To pray to God (as the Apostle directs) <hi>to enlighten the eyes of our understanding.</hi> King <hi>David</hi> by praying to<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 18.</note> God to be his teacher, attained to this <hi>praestantiam rationis &amp; scientiae, this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>
                  <note place="margin">psal. 119. 66.</note> 
                  <hi>in skill and knowledge,</hi> that he professed himselfto have more understanding then all his teachers.<note place="margin">99.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another means to come to this light is, to attend to the word and statutes of God, which as the psalmist saith, giveth light to the eyes. Hereby he professeth<note place="margin">19. 8.</note> that he got understanding, they were a light to his path. And not onely to him<note place="margin">psal. 119. 6.</note> that was a man after Gods own heart, but to them also that were naturally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,<note place="margin">104.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">105.</note> they gave light and understanding to the simple. We finde this true by<note place="margin">130.</note> experience, for since the light of the Gospl came, and was received into the world, learning and knowledge did never so flourish, either among the Grecians or Romans, as it hath done in the <hi>christian Church. The greatest lights that ever were in the world for all learning divine and humane have been christian Bishops,</hi> and the truth is, there is no excellent thing worthy to be known, to be found in any Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Authors, but the same or something more excellent may be had from the word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third means is to follow the Apostles counsel. <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</hi> And what this sleeping is<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 14.</note> the same Apostle tells us in another place, it is high time to awake out of sleep<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 11.</note> that is, out of sinne. If we mean to have this light we must forsake our evil wayes. And indeed, as the Book of wisdom speaks, <hi>in malevolo intellectu sapientia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabit, wisdom will not enter nor dwell in a malicious soule.</hi> Sinne must be removed.<note place="margin">Sap. 24.</note> This makes the difference between us and the fathers of the primitives times; for albeit we have more means of knowledge then they, yet they being holy men, had this light more plentifully bestowed upon them, then we have, and far exceeded the wisest and learnedest among us.</p>
               <p>Having thus shewen the mutual duties that concern both Teacher and Scholar, for attaining of knowledge, we are to proceed to that first duty of instruction already mentioned, as it concerns the Teacher alone, and the manner how he must instruct, which may be gathered out of <hi>Solomons</hi> words, <hi>Have I not written to thee three times,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pro. 22. 20. 21.</note> (so the vulgar Latine reads) <hi>in counsels and knowledge, that I might make them know the certainty of the words of truth.</hi> Where we see he made all known to them, that is, by reading to them, and not onely so, but also did write the same for them, and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59534:203"/>
that not once, but often, and not onely declared unto them what they must learn, but counselled them also, that is, gave direction how to profit by hearing and reading: so that the Teacher must both read to his scholers, and write, and give counsail and direction how to learn.</p>
               <p>More particularly in his manner of teaching three things are to be observed. 1. <hi>Facilitas, to explain and make easie</hi> to them what he delivers. Thus our Saviour that his doctrine might be better understood taught by parables.</p>
               <p>And being thus prepared, that as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Magister sit intus, our master is within us,</hi> we shall heare a voice behinde us (as the prophet speakes) say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Esay 30. 21.</note> this is the way, walke in it, when ye turne to the right hand, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ye turne to the left.</p>
               <p>This being done, we shall know that it is not the teachers labour alone, his<note place="margin">Psal. 127. 1, 2.</note> building and watching is in vain, his teaching without this <hi>lumen infusum</hi> is to no purpose: and that the schollers study, except God gives a blessing, availes nothing, and with his blessing <hi>dabit in somno, he will give it in sleep.</hi> In the first place therefore, (as we said before) we must pray, and that instantly, that he will vouchsafe this <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men infusum, that he will enlighten us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Saviour taught by parables (which practise had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 3.</note> and <hi>Moses</hi> time) shewing things above sense by sensible things. 2. <hi>Methodus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">23. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>order:</hi> we see when Christ was to make it plain to the Disciples, that he was to suffer, the <hi>Evangelist</hi> saith, <hi>that he began with Moses and the Prophets,</hi> and so deduced the Prophecies in order to his time, to confirm his doctrine: and the same Evang. himself<note place="margin">Luke 24. 27.</note> makes this protestation in the preamble of his Gospel, that he intended to write all<note place="margin">1. 3.</note> things, as they fell out in order. So the Apostles observed an order in teaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, they first <hi>taught the principles, and laid the foundation of faith and repentance, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12, 13. &amp; 6. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>then proceeded by steps and degrees to other doctrines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing is, <hi>proportio to proportion the doctrine to the capacity of the hearer,</hi> which requires <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>discretion</hi> in the Teacher. Thus we may observe this in Christ, who having taught his Disciples many things, and yet had many more to<note place="margin">John 16. 12.</note> teach them, yet he forbare, <hi>because they were not able to bear them.</hi> These three are good rules for a Teacher. 1. To help the <hi>lumen infusum by sensible things.</hi> 2. <hi>In a good method and order:</hi> 3. and that in a good proportion <hi>with discretion and wisdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas there be four wayes, as we toucht before, by which a man may be<note place="margin">Psal. 119 23.</note> taught. 1. <hi>By precept. Doce me mandata tua, teach me thy statutes,</hi> saith <hi>David. Thou hast made and fashioned me,</hi> to what end? <hi>that I might learn thy Commandments.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">prov. 24. 32.</note> 2. <hi>By example. Exemplo didici <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="1">1. <hi>By precept;</hi> it is said, that Christ did never teach any thing by parable in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,<note place="margin">Mark 4. 34.</note> but he expounded it afterwards to his Disciples.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By example.</hi> Christ saith, <hi>Exemplum dedi vobis, I have given you an example</hi>

The Jews call them such as draw neer to the Ark for the Corban, for the offering box; they cared not what became of the law, so the corban sped well. It was prophecied of the stock of <hi>Eli,</hi> that<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 36.</note> they should say, put me into the Priests office, that I may eate a piece of bread, and get a piece of silver, this was their end. <hi>Abiathar</hi> a wicked man was of his seed, and was displaced by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Zadok</hi> put in his room. And for want of this care of the flock it is, that others turne wolves, such as are all false teachers who for lucre or ambition, or some such sinister ends, pervert the truth, and instead of feeding the flock, poison them with heresies and errours contrary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived doctrine of the Church; such, if a presecutor or false teacher come with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, will flie, nay, as the Apostle speaks, they will not onely fly, but also become wolves themselves, for of such he prophecied saying, that grievous wolves<note place="margin">Act. 20. 29.</note> should enter, not sparing the flock. The Apostle would have us to mark the issue or end of their conversation that speak the word of God to us. Now this <gap reason="foreign">

So that whether he be for his belly, as the first, or degenerate to<note place="margin">Act. 20. 29. 30</note> a wolf, as the last, they are both distinguished from the good shepherd. Yet they are to be obeyed as pastors, because they come in the right way, <hi>obediendum est male,</hi> an evil man must be obeyed, though not <hi>ad malum,</hi> in that which is ill: of which before in the Magistrate.

                  </gap> is, to preserve religion and the true worship of<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> God, (as was shewed before) that men may live together in all Godlines and honesty. Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> not finding this in Caldea, where he was <hi>pars patriae,</hi>

                  <hi>one of the country,</hi> chose rather by divine warrant to leave his country and kinred, and sojourn in a strange land. And this end is intimated, when Israel, being under a Heathen King in Egypt, one that knew not <hi>Jehovah,</hi> desired to leave Egypt, and<note place="margin">Exod. 5. 13.</note> to go and serve God in the wildernes. The want of this end made the Priests and Levites leave their country and their possessions, and depart from <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and Jerusalem, because <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When this end therefore cannot be had, where true religion is not maintained, à man may leave his country, and live elsewhere, where it may be enjoyed.</p>

                  </gap> principality and government, for the former may be without the other two: there may be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of gifts in some, who yet have no authority nor power conferred upon them, nor are put into any place of government, and in some they do all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, as in good princes and governours. Now where there is the first, <hi>viz</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of gifts, though they have not power or principality, there is an honour due to such, by vertue of this commandment; for honour is nothing else but <hi>testimonium excellentie,</hi> a testimonie of that excellencie which is in another, and therefore such ought to be honoured, though they want the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dignitas</hi> sometimes signifies a state of dignity and honour, and sometimes onely the merit or worth of the person, whereby he deserves honour and dignity, though he have it not. Of the former we have hitherto spoken, and the honour due to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so dignified; of the honour due to such, as have onely the latter, we are now to speak. And according to this two fold consideration of dignity, there are two degrees of <hi>debitnm,</hi> duty to be performed, which the Casuists and schools call 1. <hi>debitum legis,</hi> and 2. <hi>debitum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="1">1. A legal duty, or that which is required by law, which cannot be denied to the party without injustice, and to which a man may be forced: such is the duty owing to parents, Masters, Tutours, Ministers, Princes and Magistrates, of which hitherto.</p>

               <p>This being premised, we come to those that have excellency separated from dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who yet in regard of their excellency are to be honoured. And here accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the threefold good, there is a threefold excellency.</p>

When we stand affected as <hi>Saul</hi> who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vexed with with an evil spirit) was much moved that <hi>Davids</hi> 10000.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 7. 8.</note> should be preferred before his 1000. 2. Secondly, as some deny, so others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the gift that is in another. The manner is to say, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he hath such a gift, but it is not so much as the world conceives it to be. As the devil said of <hi>Job,</hi> He is righteous indeed, but not as he ought, he serves God, but it is for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,<note place="margin">Job. 1.</note> not freely out of love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When men can neither deny the gift, nor extenuate it, for the measure wherein it is: then they will under value the gift it self, and vilifie it, saying, it is but a meane gift, little profit comes by it, either to the Church or common-wealth. It is better to be well read &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When the gift is such, as it is rare and excellent in the view and approbation of all men, that we our selves cannot but confesse as much, then we either taxe and upbraid him with the want of other gifts, or with the abusing of this; or lastly, we finde some fault in his life; one thing or other stands in our way, that we have not power to reverence it for it. We see it was so in Christs own case, when he cast out a devil, which one would think was a work worthy of honour, yet instead of that the Pharisees told the people, he wrought this miracle by the<note place="margin">Math. 9. 34.</note> power of the devil And then they fell upon his breeding: what great matter can there be in him more then others. He is but a Carpenters son &amp;c. and then they<note place="margin">13. 55.</note> fell upon his life and conversation, and sift and examine that, he is a friend of<note place="margin">2. 11.</note> publicans and sinners.</p>
               <p>Answerable to this, there is a duty also required in him that hath the gift. 1 That he acknowledge whence he hath it, and say with Saint <hi>James;</hi> It is <hi>desuper</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 17.</note> from above. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confest asmuch: by the grace of God I am that I am; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">1 Cor 15. 10.</note> grew naturally in him. And consequently this ought to teach him humility, and not to be lifted up with it, as the prophet speaks. This want of humility spoiles<note place="margin">Ezech. 28. 17.</note> all graces whatsoever. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Qui sine humilitate virtutes congregat quasi in ventum pulverem portat. He that hath graces and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>They that founded Churches and Colledges had this reason.

It is a Maxime in Divinity, <hi>Indignum promovere decipere est, it is fraud and deceitful dealing to promote an unworthy person.</hi> It is a breach of the trust which the founder reposed in them, and so they deceive the party that gave his estate to promote those that are worthy.

               <p>Yet (by the way) we are to take notice, that there are some cases, wherein a man is not to be said to be unthankful, though the benefactor so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As first, if a superiour bestow a benefit upon an inferiour, expecting, that he shall like what the other loveth, and mislike as he misliketh, and so to be at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or els he will repute him as an unthankful person. But unthankfulnes is <hi>res gratiae, non officii,</hi> a matter of grace, not of duty, and therefore tis no unthankfulnes not to follow him in his humour.</p>

unthankfulnes in me to deny it: for as in his benefits, there was a <hi>licet dare, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> non dare,</hi> it was lawful for him either to give, or not give; so in matter of thankfulnes, there is a <hi>licet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">3. Lastly, he would have me to follow his appetite, and do an unjust act, and I refuse to consent to him in it, is this unthankfulnes? no surely. For the rule is, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,</hi> a man must do as he would be done unto: that love he beares to himself, must be the square of his love to his neighbour; nor is it required, that I should do any more for my neighbour, then for my self. If any appetite then should leade me to any unjust thing, should I consent to it? no; for so I should hurt my self in consenting to sin against my own soul. In like manner, if my neighbour require m: to do a thing unjust, I must not consent, for it is against the love I owe to my own soul, which must be the rule of my love to him. And so, for the pleasure he hath done to me, he would have me do my self and him a displeasure, by my consenting to do evil at his instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to hurt both his soul and mine own, and so to do evil for good. There may be in this case <hi>species ingratitudinis,</hi> a shew of ingratitude, at the first sight, which a good man may be taxed withal, but being weighed in the true ballance, it is no unthankfulnes at all. A good man <hi>per mediam infamiam bujus ingratitudinis,</hi> will <hi>tendere ad officium;</hi> this reproach of unthankfulnesse not deserved, will make him look the more strictly to the duty of true gratitude. And thus much for the special duties of Inferiours and Superiours required in this Commandment, and the sinnes forbidden, according to our first rule for expo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Decalogue.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> We may see this in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Amos. Amos</hi> lived in the dayes of <hi>Vzziah</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and he
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59534:221"/>
tells us, that then it was a time for <hi>the prudent to keep silence, because it was an evil</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos. 5. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>time.</hi> A wise man must hold his peace, lest it should fare with him, as with the Levite, when the <hi>Danites</hi> cried, <hi>Tace, hold thy peace;</hi> which he was forced to do<note place="margin">Judg. 18. 55.</note> lest they should have slain him. It was certainly no signe of good government, when our Saviour for saying he was not bound to accuse himself before <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A second signe of evil government is, when men cannot have justice, but are delayed by those that should right them. <hi>S. Paul</hi> notwithstanding his appeal to <hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Another signe is by their speech: which the Heathen observed: A good Governour saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>it is my duty, and I must do it.</hi> An evil Governour will say <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>I have power and I may do it:</hi> He boasts with <hi>Saul, I can give you vineyards, &amp;c.</hi> and with <hi>Pilate, I have power to crucisie thee, and power to let thee go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth signe is out of <hi>Menander,</hi> when <hi>their eye-brows swell so, that they will refuse to amend what is amisse.</hi> If there be any fault, and if you tell them not of it, they will say, Why did you not tell me of it? and if you do, they will say, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>we will consider of it;</hi> and then it shall be as much amended, as if it had never been mentioned: and also you shall, when opportunity serves, be remembred with some mark of displeasure, as one too busy or pragmatical. When one told <hi>Joah</hi> of <hi>Absaloms</hi> hanging in a tree, he asked him, why he did not kill him; but the other replied, that considering the kings strict charge to the contrary, <hi>Joah</hi> himself (if the fact had been done by another) would have been ready to accuse him to the king, and to have him punished.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a signe of ill government, when <hi>Religion is pretended to stop justice.</hi> It was much practised in the primitive times, and oft complained of by the Fathers. If any of the Rulers or Officers had wronged a Christian Bishop, and he had complained to the Emperour who promised justice, and appointed a day for hearing; then would the Deputy come and say, <hi>This man is a Christian;</hi> he ought to be patient, and to<note place="margin">Acts 16. 37.</note> forgive injuries, and not to go to law, its against the principles of his religion. And thus they were dismissed without justice and reproached for their labour. So it is often with others: especially, if any Clergie-man seek for justce.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, The thriving of the righteous is a good signe. <hi>In his dayes</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>shall the righteous flourish.</hi> But on the contrary, when as the Heathen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <hi>The flatterer is chief in esteem</hi>

                  <p>The second part of this Commandment, A promise of long life. Reasons why this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is annexed to this Commandment. How this promise is made good. Reasons why God sometimes shortens the dayes of the godly, and prolongs the dayes of the wicked.</p>

               <p>VVE are now come to the second general part of this Commandment, which is the Promise, <hi>That thy dayes may be long, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</hi> a prolongation of dayes. In the second Commandment, there is a general promise, to them that love God and keep his Commandments. In this there is a particular promise for them that observe this Commandment; and therefore its true which the Apostle observed,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 2.</note> that this is the first Commandment with promise, that is, with a particular promise.</p>
               <p>Now the reasons why God adds a promise and reason to this Commandment may be these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because (according to the proverb) <hi>Adorant plures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Therefore God adds this reason or motive to stir us up to give due honour to them, even when they are old, because we shall be rewarded our selves with honour and long life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, here is a convenient proportion between the promise and the duty, which is most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Before we leave this a question must be answered.</p>
               <p>How is this promise fulfilled, since we see by daily experience, the contrary, we see<note place="margin">Quest.</note> that dutiful children have died in the strength of their years, and disobedient and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born have prospered and lived long; and therefore that is very true which the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher<note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 2. 3.</note> tells us, all things come alike to all &amp;c.<note place="margin">Answer.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We say, that riches honour, long life, and other outward things are but gifts of Gods left hand, and are common alike to all, as well to the bad as to the good. <hi>Isaac</hi> in his blessing gave the fat of the earth to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and after, verse 39. He gives it to his brother <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> and prosperity is the lot of the wicked aswell<note place="margin">prov. 3. 16.</note> as the godly, <hi>ne boni nimis cupide prosequerentur,</hi> lest the good should be set too eagerly upon it; and adversity is common to the godly, aswell as the wicked, <hi>ne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> it basely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, the reason why adversity is common to both is, because if it should sall upon all the wicked in this life, question would be made, where is that judgment we look for? And if wholly upon the godly, we should be apt to say, <hi>

                  <hi>nos,</hi> God regards us not, his providence failes. And therefore to let us see, that his providence continues, he will give to his children some good things here, and to let us know, that he hath judgement in store, he imparts some of them to the wicked. Nor will he bestow all upon the ungodly, because then<note place="margin">Hab. 1. 16.</note> they would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>But how then shall we acquit God of injustice, and how is his promise of long life, to them that honour their superiours performed?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The distinction of <hi>bene</hi> and <hi>male,</hi> will acquit him. A promise must carry a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit<note place="margin">Answer.</note> with it, if not, it were better to be without it then to have it. Now long life, without that blessing of going well with a man, is a displeasure. It is the comfort<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 16.</note> and delight which we enjoy in our life, which is here promised as a blessing. For Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>non est vera vita, ubi non seliciter, vivitur,</hi> that cannot be called a true life, which brings not content and happines with it. <hi>Eliah</hi> being persecuted by<note place="margin">1 King 19. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Jexebel,</hi> thought his life not a benefit, and therefore quits God of his promise, Now, O Lord, take away my life. And indeed long life may be no benefit in two respects.</p>

                  <p>Non occides. Thou shalt do no murther, or Thou shalt not kill.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have seen, that whatsoever duty was between men, as Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and Inferiours, pertained to the fift Commandment, which hath been handled at large. Now the duties that are called <hi>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> which are common to all, follow in the four next commandments. This sixth concerneth the life of man, and the preservation thereof. The seventh respects chastity, and the preservation of it in wedlock, and out of wedlock. The eighth takes care of <hi>meum &amp; tunm,</hi> the goods, propriety, and estates of men. And the ninth concernes the reputation and good name of a man.</p>
               <p>This commandment conducing so much to publick and private peace, is rightly and in its due order placed next to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> whereby authority and government is established with due respect and honour. And the lawgiver considering the frailty of mans memory, hath in his infinite wisdom under one word [murder] comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a whole catalogue of sinnes, and made choice of this word, which signifies the highest degree of sinnes of this nature, to shew how odious the other degrees are, and that those affections of unjust anger, hatred &amp;c. Are murder in his sight, which otherwise would not perhaps have seemed so haynous to man, if they had not been expressed by that word.</p>
               <p>This commandment is expounded in the law by <hi>Moses,</hi> where not onely mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der itself is forbidden, but all the degrees and causes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And as in the law, so in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel<note place="margin">18.</note> by our Saviour himself there is a large comment upon this law, from the<note place="margin">Math. 5. 22. &amp;c</note> two and twentieth verse of the fift of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> to the 27. And from the 38. verse to the end of the chapter, where rash anger and malice is made murther in the heart and revenge even against enemies is severely forbidden. The like is in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Epistles almost throughout them all, but especially in one place, most plainly and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially; whosoever hateth his brother is a murtherer.

And when we have well weighed these places, we shall finde that to be true, which the Apostle saith, that Anger and hatred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>For the order and dependance of this Commandment upon the former, it is very exact. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, the fifth was concerning parents, the beginners and Authors of our life, therefore no object cometh better to be treated on in the next place, then life it self; which floweth as an effect from the former, and every man ought to prize and esteem it both in himself and others. And as it ought to follow the fifth, so ought it to go before the rest; for we must first have <hi>life and being</hi> before we can partake of <hi>wedlock, goods, or good name,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> do all depend upon life, and therefore the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for preserving of it ought to stand before these.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ground of the fifth Commandment was self conceit; to restrain that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which men have of their own excellency, whereby they assume <hi>honour</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and are unwilling <hi>to give honour</hi> to whom it is due. Hence men are apt to hate those that are better and more honoured then themselves; for <hi>omnis iniquitas menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur sibi, all iniquity deceives it self,</hi> and we may observe that the first <hi>murder</hi> came from<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 5. 8.</note> this, <hi>Cain</hi> hated his brother, because he was accepted and preferred before him, and the text saith plainly that he slew his brother, because he was better then himself, for<note place="margin">1 John. 3. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>his brothers works were good, and his own evil.</hi> So was <hi>Esau's</hi> anger kindled against<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Jacob,</hi> because of his prerogative of birth-right which he had bought, and for the blessing which he stole from <hi>Esau.</hi> The like was in the Patriarchs against <hi>Joseph:</hi> so<note place="margin">37. 4. 8.</note> that in both cases (had they not been prevented) they had proceeded even to murder, when they hated them. All this, I say, grows upon the conceit, that we are not honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much, and others (in our opinion) are honoured more then they should be. Thus then we being thwarted and crossed, do as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, fall into anger and revenge, and (to obtain our desires) into murder. And therefore in the placing of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before those that follow, there is very good order observed.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Now the first step or motive to murder is anger, which is <hi>vindex laesae concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentiae, the revenger of our desire impaired;</hi> this being not satisfied, there naturally follows <hi>ebullitio sanguinis, a boyling of the blood,</hi> for we commonly say, when a man is crossed in that he desires, <hi>His blood riseth,</hi> upon which follows <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>anger,</hi> and a desire of removing the impediment. But this we are to understand, that anger is not of the same quality with some other affections, as namely that of envy, that doth sound ill, assoon as it is named, for it implies a grief at the good of another, which is simply and altogether sinful, as being directly contrary to the vertue of love: but anger is not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply evil in regard of the act or object, but when it fails either in the cause, or the quantity, or measure, then our Anger may be faulty. <hi>Be angry,</hi> saith <hi>S. Paul, but sin not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 26.</note> So that there may be anger which is not sinful: and when anger is a sin, often it cometh not in regard of the object, nor at any time in regard of the affection it self, which is indifferent, but when we are angry either without cause, or upon a trivial and light occasion, or when upon a just cause we keep no measure, but our anger is extream.</p>
               <p>To be moved with indignation, in Gods cause, or for the publick good, is a vertue, and it is called <hi>Nemesis, indignation,</hi> as when a man doth see a thing committed against Gods glory, that ought not to be done, or a thing that ought to be done, not done to the glory of God, or the good of the Church and Common-wealth.

                  <p>In the beginning Government was establisht upon this ground, <hi>Optabilius est timere unum quam multos,</hi> it is beter to fear one then many; and therefore more fit it was for one to have power to kill, then for all to have this power.

For as in the natural body, if any member become so infected, as that without cutting it off, the whole body will be endangered, (as in the case of a gangrene) the rule is, <hi>melius est utpereat unus, quam unitas,</hi> better to cut off that member, then the whole body perish, so it is in the Civil body, better one offender be cut off then the whole land endangered.

                  <p n="1">1. The first is, when a man is suddenly assaulted, either upon the high-way, or elswhere, where he cannot make use of the power of the magistrate. In this case when the necessity is extream, he may <hi>cum moderamine inculpatae tutelae,</hi> for saving his own life, kill him that would take it away, that is, when he cannot otherwise preserve his own life.

               <p>Now this anger of which we speak, must be understood, either of our selves towards others, or of others towards us.

               <p>The order of ranking this Precept in this place is this.

               </p>
               <p>Before we come to treat of the sin prohibited by this Commandment, we will take a view of one chief cause, upon which this prohibition is grounded: which is Marriage.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first of the thing it self, <hi>Conjugium</hi> or <hi>Matrimonium,</hi> what it is. Wedlock or Matrimony is a Covenant and conjunction of Man and Woman, taken and agreed on with mutual consent, for the propagation of mankinde, and the mutual good of both, instituted in the beginning by God himself in Paradise, between <hi>Adam</hi> and<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 22. 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Eve</hi> in their innocency; God onely being the Maker of it, as both Father and Priest in the Marriage, before the Congregation of Angels.</p>
               <p>This may be easily gathered out of the story, which contains, a prophecy, a gratulation, a consent in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and a law for the future.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The prophecy. <hi>Adam</hi> first speaks <hi>illative</hi> by inference <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

He had been asleep when the rib was taken from him, and yet could tell that the woman which was not before, was taken out of him, as perfectly as if he had been awake at the Anatomy. And secondly <hi>de futuro,</hi> for the time to come, that a man, to cleave to his wife, should leave father and mother. This should be the practise of posterity: for he had neither father nor mother, and therefore could not speak it of himself.</item>
                  <item>2. His gratulation. <hi>Leah</hi> being fruitful after a long barrennesse saith, <hi>Now will I</hi>

                     <hi>praise the Lord. So Adam</hi> seems to say, God brought to me, so many thousands of creatures, I awake, and rightly understanding all, yet found I no helper like or meet for me, but they were all either brutish, dumb, hairy, or the like. But now at this time God hath brought me one that is <hi>bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh,</hi> and though sleeping, yet I have found one meet and like; so like, as almost the same with me.</item>

               <p n="3">3. The causes or reasons why mariage was instituted, are generally or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally two. 1. First, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and propagation of mankinde. 2. That mans life might be more comfortable, and delightful to him, but these causes may more especially be enlarged to three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. God in the beginning said, <hi>It is not good that man should be alone,</hi> I <hi>will make</hi>

                     <hi>a help meet for him.</hi> The first cause therfore was the benefit and commodity of man. For God thought that <hi>Adam</hi> could not live pleasantly and well, unlesse he gave him a wife. And therefore a wife is not to be accounted a necessary evil, as some phrase it, but as a help. Whosoever then hath not, nor ever had wife or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is ignorant of a double blessing. And this the very heathen did acknowledge. He that wants a wife, is in as ill case as he that wants a hand, an arme, a foot, or an eye. But besides the blessing by procreation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> children, this cohabitat on or living in society with a wife is most profitable and comfortable. Her company gives a man refreshment after labour, and maketh him to forget sorrow and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so greivous, nothing so burthensome, but a man and wife, living lovingly together, can well overcome it.</item>
                  <item>2. The second cause why matrimony was instituted, was the procreation of children, and education of them, in the feare of God. That there might be <hi>semen</hi>

                           <p>Besides this, two mischiefs more attend this crime. 1. <hi>Incest,</hi> where the fault is kept close; for by this means, those that marry, not knowing how they are allied, nor who is of their race or lineage, it fals out, that sometimes they may joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with those they are near unto, and so commit <hi>incest,</hi> 2. <hi>Frequent divorces,</hi> or separations, when one party knows or suspects the incontinency of the other, from whence hatred and debate usually arise; and it is plain by the whole course of prophane Histories, that the greatest Wars both foraign and domestick in many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have from hence had their original, because there commonly followeth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hatred of each other upon this occasion; as <hi>Ammou</hi> hated <hi>Tamar</hi> exceedingly:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13. 15.</note> so that his hatred, after he had knowledge of her, was greater then his love was to her before.</p>
                           <p>To this we may adde the breach of the ninth Commandement; <hi>Persidiam, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulnesse,</hi> and of the third, <hi>Perjurium, perjury:</hi> For at the solemnization of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The remedies of this sinne. 1. Chastity of a single life. 2. Matrimonial chastity. The means to preserve us from this sinne. Of drawing others to keep this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw against these vices there are two vertues opposed as remedies.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Castitas coelibatus,</hi> chastity of a single life. 2. <hi>castitas conjugalis,</hi> matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 8.</note> chastity, both commended by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the first, theres no doubt but it is beter then the other, either, if we take<note place="margin">of chastity.</note> it simply, He that giveth not his virgin in marriage doth better; or in regard of the<note place="margin">vers. 38.</note> present necessity, which is to be thought upon; for the Apostle would have men<note place="margin">26.</note> to be without carefulnesse. But in a married estate, there is the care and<note place="margin">The benefit of a single lise</note> trouble of a family to attend it; she that is married careth for the things of this<note place="margin">32</note> world.</p>
               <p>Besides; the married must neither watch, nor fast, nor pray without each others consent, which the unmarried may do freely, at their own will, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of another. Besides, he that is single may better provide for himself, and shall not need to be chargeable to others, which was one of the Apostles motives to preach the Gospel freely, that he might not be burdensome, hereby also a man may live more free from covetousnesse, and exercise the vertue of liberality the better.</p>
               <p>And lastly, as the Apostle urges, the unmarried may <hi>the better attend upon the Lord without distraction.</hi> They may be more constant in adhering to Christ, and suffering for his cause, more willing to die and to follow Christ, <hi>Minus mali metuit, qui mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus delicias gustavit,</hi> he feares the evil of affliction the lesse, who hath had a least tast of the delights and pleasures of the world, whereas those <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of parents, and married persons, beget in them a greater care of <hi>res famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares,</hi> their domestical affaires, that they may provide for their children &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are more wedded to the world, and more distracted in their devotions, and easilier drawn from God and from Christ. For these reasons chastity of single life is chiefly to be desired. But if we cannot attain to the first, to <hi>castitas coelibatus,</hi> then we must flie to the second, which is <hi>castitas conjugalis,</hi> conjugal chastity, which is the remedy provided against concupiscence.</p>
               <p>Now the means of preserving our selves from this sin of concupiscence, we thus consider.<note place="margin">The meanes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="1">1. Whether it be in him, as a punishment for sinne or, onely as a temptation (for<note place="margin">Causes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward burning</note> it is certain, that adultery, and uncleane lusts are oftentimes, a punishment of pride)<note place="margin">Hos. 5. 4. 5.</note> The spirit of whoredom is in the midst of them (saith the Prophet) and in the next verse follows the reason.

               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> observes, that when the heathen Romans grew so proud, as to think<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 22.</note> themselves wise, then God gave them over to uncleannes <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The dependance of this commandment upon the former two is very exact: for in the two former commandments order was taken for the actions of that part of the soule, which is exercised about nutrition and generation, or the desires that all men naturally have of meat, drink, and apparrel for the preservation of themselves, <hi>in individno,</hi> and to encrease and propagate in the world, for the preservation of their <hi>species</hi> or kinde, for when there is a desire stird up by hunger, <hi>desiderium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The end of this Commandment is to moderate that desire of Riches, which of it<note place="margin">The end of this Commandment</note> self is no sin, but lawful and good; for as a desire <hi>suscipere prolem,</hi> to have yssue in the right way is lawful, (as we shewed in the former Commandment;) so <hi>procurare neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saria,</hi> to provide necessaries is no lesse lawful and good in this.

It is true, that if man had continued in innocency, there would not have needed any division of the earth, every one would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that which had been sufficient for him, and none would have been troubled with that unruly appetite and desire of having more, and the earth would have been sufficient for all. But when sin entred, it was then necessary there should be a division, and a <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> among men. And though the first occasion hereof was evil, (as commonly good Laws arise <hi>ex malis moribus,</hi> from evil customes) yet God was pleased with it, and approved it. <hi>Cains</hi> persecution of <hi>Abel,</hi> and others, was the cause why <hi>Seth,</hi> and the rest that feared God, severed themselves from him and his posterity by a publick profession of the worship of God, and would not live in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 26.</note> with them. The first <hi>inclosure</hi> of what was formerly common, or the first <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation</hi> to particular persons, that we read, of was that of <hi>Cain,</hi> when he built a City, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 17. He chose out a plot of ground, and <hi>built a City, and called it after his sons name.</hi> This act of his gave occasion to the Fathers and Patriarchs, hereby see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 17.</note> that <hi>Cain</hi> would else usurp government and power, and considering the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of it for their peace and safety, in well ordering of private possessions, to do the like: and thus came in propriety before the flood.</p>
               <p>After the flood, when all the world was common again, and all private interest was destroyed, <hi>Noah</hi> having all the world before him, had all <hi>jure primae occupationis,</hi> by right of the first possession, or first seizure, and his sons from him: and whether by <hi>Noahs allotment</hi> of the chief parts of the world to his three sons; <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>Cham, Asia</hi> to <hi>Sem,</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Japhet;</hi> or whether it were by mutual agreement among themselves, its plain, they had all by this right of <hi>prima occupatio:</hi> and thus propriety came in presently after the flood. Other examples we finde afterward, when <hi>Terah</hi> came out of Ur of the Chaldees with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> &amp;c. they came to Haran in Canaan, where they dwelt by right of <hi>first occupancy:</hi> and afterwards, when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> came out of Egypt into Canaan, where they lived together, a while in common, upon occasion of their herd-mens strife, they agreed to part the countrey between them; and <hi>Lot,</hi> though he were younger, had the choice: thus we see how things stood at the first. <hi>Epictetus</hi> sheweth it by a familiar similitude, when a dish is brought to the Table, before it is cut up, it is common to all that sit at the Table; but after it is cut up, and every man hath taken his share, then <hi>quam quisque occupavit partem,</hi> what part soever a man hath taken to himself, that is proper to him and not common to the rest, so that it were neither justice, nor civility to take it off his tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. Thus at the first all the earth was common to mankinde, but then by the first<note place="margin">Deut. 11. 24.</note> occupancy or possession, or by consent, it came to be divided. <hi>Omnem locum quem calcaverit pes vestra, every place whereon the souls of your feet shall tread</hi> (saith God) <hi>I give unto you, it shall be yours.</hi> So that it was <hi>pedis occupatio,</hi> or <hi>calcatio,</hi> the treading of the foot, or first occupation, that entituled every man to his first right.</p>
               <p>Thus if a people possesseth a countrey, either not inhabited before, or which is <hi>terra derelicta,</hi> a countrey forsaken by the former inhabitants, <hi>primus Occupator,</hi> the first possessor or discoverer hath the right to it: as we read that the posterity of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi> entred into the land of <hi>Gedor, seeking pasture for their flocks; and they found</hi>

In the treaty between the <hi>Amorites</hi> and <hi>Jephthah,</hi> they claim restitution of certain lands which the Israelites had taken, as they passed from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan. Jephthah</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 11. 13.</note> answereth, <hi>That they had enjoyed them</hi> 300 <hi>years, and asks them, wherefore did you</hi>

                  <hi>not recover those lands within that time?</hi> And having this right of prescription kept them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another maxime, and which hath more shew, is <hi>Interest Rei-publicae, ut re sua quisque bene utatur;</hi> it concerns the Common-wealth to take care, that every one use his own well.

And thus if one leave his ground untilled and unmamanured so many years, or such a prescript time, he shall lose it. And upon these reasons it is, that men have right by prescription and possession.</p>
               <p>And in these forenamed cases of right either <hi>in communi</hi> or <hi>proprio,</hi> because men are thus lawfully vested in that they possesse, it is a sin to put any out of possession <hi>invito domino,</hi> without the owners consent.

               <p>Now that it was Gods will, that the earth should be thus divided, appears plainly<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 8.</note> in <hi>Moses</hi> his song, where he saith, <hi>The most High divided to the nations their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when he separated the sons of Adam, and set bounds to the people:</hi> and after the flood, it is said, <hi>That God scattered the people over the face of the earth,</hi> and<note place="margin">Gen. 11. 9.</note>

               <p>Now these places and the like, though they shew the lawfulnesse of propriety, yet the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are not satisfied in that, because they are not out of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and so not binding to us Christians. But in that also we may finde testimonies sufficient to confirm this point. <hi>S. John</hi> had a house of his own, <hi>from that hour</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is true that we read in the Acts of the Apostles, (the place chiefly urged by them) <hi>That all that beleeved were together, and had all things common:</hi> but in the<note place="margin">2. 44.</note> same book <hi>S.

                  <hi>of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own.</hi> By which we may collect that the Christians of the Primitive Church possessed houses, lands, and goods of their own, yet so that in the use they were common to others, and though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety<note place="margin">5. 4.</note> rested still in the possessors; yet when there was a necessity they sold them, to supply the poverty of them that wanted, lest they might return to Judaisme. And if they sold them, certainly they were their own. S. <hi>Peter</hi> clears this fully in his speech to <hi>Ananias, While it remained, was it not thine own.</hi>

them that were in prison, and by this did grant that the faithful had a propriety in their goods, by which they might be charitable, and beneficent to the needy. For take away propriety, and take away all beneficence, and almes. Out of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17.</note> stock, a particular man cannot be said to give that which is his own. And<note place="margin">18.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth rich men how to imploy their wealth, and directeth the Corinthians what proportion they shall lay aside for the poor, out of their<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 2.</note> estates.</p>
               <p>In the Acts we read of many that had the disposing and use of their own estates,<note place="margin">Act. 9. 36.</note> as of <hi>Tabitha</hi> that was full of good works, and almes deeds, witnesse the coats and garments which she made for poor widows. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion likewise<note place="margin">39.</note> was a devout man, and gave much almes. And these good works cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived<note place="margin">10. 2.</note> to be done, but out of that, which they possessed, as their own. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20. 33.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 27. 57.</note> saith, he never coveted any mans silver, or gold, or apparrel. We finde also many<note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> of the faithful to have been rich, as <hi>Joseph</hi> of Arimathea; and <hi>Lydia</hi> the seller of<note place="margin">8. 27.</note> purple; as <hi>Candaces,</hi> Eunuch. Diverse other testimonies might be produced, but these may serve sufficiently to prove a propriety of possessions and goods to be lawful for Christians.</p>
               <p>Besides those original wayes of propriety, there is also a propriety, by the right of war, or law of Armes, because the Magistrate hath power and authority, in diverse cases to use his sword abroad aswel as at home, and may punish a forrain enemy in some cases, even by expelling him his land. It is true, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle counselleth, if it be possible, as much as lyeth in you, have peace with all<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 13.</note> men, but not long after, he addeth, the Magistrate beareth not the sword in vain.

And we see still that in all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Laws, whereby propriety is distinguished, there is none of them that hold in case of extream necessity. And there is a right which every man hath in things which remain common to this day; as in <hi>feris Naturae, wilde beasts,</hi> appropriate to no man; fowl and fish, and in such things which are found on the sea shore, as Pearls, Gems, &amp;c. concerning which the rule is <hi>jus occupanti,</hi> the propriety is invested in them that finde them; because part of the possession of every countrey is alloted to remain to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the poor.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, for the proprieties which arise by publick right, we laid down four, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Seizing on a countrey uninhabited; 2. on those things which were left and forsaken by the owners, which are <hi>res derelictae,</hi> things given over; 3. Pre. scription; 4. the right got by the bow and sword, or the right of war.</p>
               <p>And for private right, there are liberal and free, and illiberal alienations, of which we have spoken; and in all these there is <hi>justa acquisitio,</hi> a just way of getting.</p>
               <p>Contrary to which are the unjust wayes of getting, whereby theft is committed, which may be reduced to three heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first two we may finde in <hi>Leviticus, Non extorquebis, neque fraudabis proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi>

                  <hi>tuum, Thou shalt not rob thy Neighbour, neither defraud him.</hi> The first is <hi>rapina, robbery.</hi> which is <hi>extorquere per vim, domino invito,</hi> to extort any thing by force, the owner being unwilling.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>To this Head may be referred the converting of things to a common or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Simonie</hi> is committed thus, in <hi>re sacra, in selling of holy things,</hi> so there is a kinde of <hi>Simonie</hi> in selling of <hi>Justice,</hi> which is a sacred thing: and therefore s. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> and s. <hi>Ambrose</hi> say, that <hi>Quid dabitis mihi, ut faciam justitiam?</hi> what will you give me to do justice? is all one with <hi>Quid dabis mihi ut vendam tibi Deum?</hi> what<note place="margin">Esay 5. 23.</note> will you give me to sell God to you?

               <p>A third thing to be comprehended under, <hi>Selling that which cannot be sold,</hi> is the selling of <hi>gratuita beneficentia,</hi> what ought to be freely and liberally given without reward.

Gratuitum &amp; mutuum,</hi> loan, and no hope of recompence, must go together. Hee that doth <hi>inscribere pretium liberalitati,</hi> set a price upon his liberality, corrupts the vertue. For as <hi>Donatio liberalis est alienatio, sine omni mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede in aeternum;</hi> Giving is a free alienation of our right to a thing for ever, without recompence: so <hi>Mutuatio est liberalis alienatio, sine omni mercede ad tempus,</hi> Lending is a free alienation of a thing for a time without any recompence: both lending and<note place="margin">Psal 112. 5.</note> giving ought to be free. <hi>A good man is merciful, and lendeth.</hi> If his lending be with expectance of reward, the vertue of mercy is utterly lost.</p>

About the labour and reward, when either of these is wanting, or where an equality between them is not observed. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate hath tribute paid him for his care of the publick, and the Levites portion is due for his service at the Altar. Now if they kill the fat, and cloath themselves with the wooll, and instead of feeding the flock, care onely for feeding themselves, they are<note place="margin">Ezek. 34. 3.</note> as the Prophet calls them, <hi>Companions of theeves and robbers: Fures officii,</hi> theeves in their office.</p>
               <p>So when a Scholar hath <hi>Pretium sapientiae,</hi> the price of wisdom, the reward of<note place="margin">Prov. 17. 16.</note> study; if he have not <hi>curam sapientiae,</hi> a care to attain wisdom, by taking pains in his studies, he is <hi>Fur,</hi> a theef in study, because there is not an equality between the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and his labour. So on the contrary, if any of these do labour in their place, they must have their reward, and it is theft to defraud them of it, <hi>for the labourer is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of his hire:</hi> yea, the labourer in Gods Vineyard must have <hi>Decorum pretium,</hi> a<note place="margin">Deut. 24. 15.</note> goodly price, or a rich reward, (as may be gathered by the contrary from that in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 13.) there must be a proportion between the labour and the reward: He must have a reward, and that a liberal reward. God required that a servant, which<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 14.</note> after six years service was set free in the year of Jubile, should be <hi>furnisht liberally</hi> at his departure: and if for bodily service such a free and liberal reward be due, much

                  <p>Of the vertues opposite. 1. Just getting. 2. Restitution, commanded both in the Law and Gospel. That we must make restitution, not onely of what is unlawfully got, but of some things lawfully got. As 1. Of what belongs to another by gift. 2. Of things deposited. 3. Of things found. 4. Of things lent. 5. Of what will prejudice the publick, if it be detained for our private benefit.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OPposite to this vice of unlawful getting, is the vertue of just getting:<note place="margin">Of the vertue of just getting.</note> which is the subject wee are now to handle. It is called <hi>studium honeste rem parandi,</hi> an endeavour to get by honest meanes, where men doe <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:59534:262"/>
The Apostle sets both down together in one place, where speaking of covetous<note place="margin">Tim. 6. 5.</note> men, who set themselves to get by any means, he saith, they are <hi>men of corrupt mindes, and destitute of truth,</hi> and gives the reason, because this is their position, that <hi>gain is godlinesse:</hi> gain got by any means they count lawful, let men say what they will, they applaud themselves in their unjust gains; like the Heathen that said, Let me have the money in my bag, and let the people call me piller and poller, or what they will. But in the next verse he shews the practice of just getting, when a man can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the proposition, and say, that <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is gain;</hi> accounting onely that the true gain, which is got in the way of godlinesse. This is indeed the true gain, which is got according to Gods prescript, not by mans over-reaching; when a man can say<note place="margin">Gen. 43. 12.</note> concerning all his gettings, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did to <hi>Laban;</hi> call me to account when you will,<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Cras respondebit pro me justitia mea,</hi> my righteousnesse shall answer for me in time to come.</p>
               <p>Now though to this vertue of just getting, it belongs, to keep and preserve<note place="margin">Of Restitution.</note> us from evil and unjust dealing; yet because the World is full of it, and most men have <hi>mentem malam,</hi> a corrupt minde, and run on in an unjust course of acquiring, till the conscience bee touched and awakened, whereby they are stopt. Therefore to this must bee added a second vertue called <hi>Restitution,</hi> which is absolutely necessary if a man have over-shot himself in the way of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just getting.</p>
               <p>It is one of the most frequent and principal common places throughout the Fathers. saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sets down this for a Canon, <hi>Non remittitur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum,</hi> the sin of an unlawful purchase, or getting, is never pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unlesse restitution be made of what is unjustly got.</p>
               <p>The ground of this is laid both in the Old Testament, and in the New. In the Old, God appointed, that he that had trespassed against his neighbour, should <hi>confesse his sin and make recompence, adding a fifth part more.</hi> Agreeable to which is<note place="margin">Numb. 5. 7.</note> that speech of <hi>Zophar,</hi> before the Law, <hi>He shall restore his labour and devour no more,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 20. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>according to his substance shall his restitution be, &amp;c.</hi> The reason is added in the next verse, <hi>For he hath undone many, and spoiled houses that he never built.</hi> And as this was known before the Law, so we finde it practised under the Law. For after the return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> when divers had oppressed their poor brethren by usury, &amp;c. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> gave order, <hi>That they should restore their lands, and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Neh. 5. 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>and houses, and the hundred part of the money, the wine and the oil which they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13.</note> 
                  <hi>exacted of them.</hi> And they said, <hi>We will restore and take nothing of them:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he called the Priests and took an oath of them, <hi>that they should do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this promise.</hi> And <hi>Nehemiah shook his lap, and said, God shake every man from his house and from his labour, that performs not this promise, &amp;c.</hi> to which all the congregation said, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we come to the Gospel, S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives a general rule, <hi>to render to every man his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 7.</note>

               <p>And as restitution must be of goods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> gotten, so also there is a restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made of some things, which are got by a lawful contract.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of things which are committed to our trust, the <hi>Depositum</hi> must be restored. So under the Law, <hi>If any man did deliver money to his neighbour to keep, or Ox, or</hi>

               <p>But now, when a mans estate is justly got, then in the next place, he is to take care<note place="margin">Of the right use of riches</note> about the use of it, which is the second thing to be considered.</p>
               <p>This use respects, either a mans self, or others. Of the first the Wise man speaks,<note place="margin">Eccl. 6. 7.</note> when he saith, <hi>that all the labour of a man is for his mouth,</hi> (that is, for his own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities:) Of the second the Apostle, when he exhorts the Corinthians <hi>to be rich in liberality,</hi> by considering the necessities of others. He offends against the first, who <hi>when God hath given him riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wants nothing for his soul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 6. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>of all that he desireth, yet God gives him not the power to rule thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity and an evil disease.</hi> And he offends against the second, who looks onely at himself, and wants bowels of compassion to wards others.</p>
               <p>These two uses are both comprehended by <hi>Solomon</hi> in two verses, <hi>Drink waters of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 5. 15, 16.</note>

The Apostle speaks of a double sowing, answerable to this two fold use of riches, a <hi>sowing to the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>flesh,</hi> and a <hi>sowing to the spirit,</hi> whether it be <hi>propter piosusus ecclesiasticos,</hi> for pious uses that concern the Church, and the Ministery, or <hi>propter usus civiles,</hi> for pious uses which concern the Common-wealth, as the relief of the poor, &amp;c. Both uses may be best and plainlyest seen in Christs practise, who when he bade <hi>Judas dispatch,</hi> the<note place="margin">John 13. 29.</note> rest thought, that because he bore the bag, that Christs meaning was, either that he should he buy such things as were needful, that is, for their own use; or else that he should give something to the poor, which is the second use, so that by the words of the Disciples it appears, that those were the two uses of our Saviours purse; first, to provide things needful for themselves, and secondly to contribute to the necessities others, of these two uses we are now to speak severally.</p>

Thus by all those several expressions of the Apostle, it appears, that the use of riches, is to have them communicated; and therefore if any do appropriate that to himself, which God would have common, he perverts the use of it.</p>
               <p>Again, this use of communicating to others appears, in that good works are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 8.</note> to <hi>seed,</hi> and doing good, to <hi>sowing. He that sows to the spirit, shall of the spirit</hi>

Thus we see if the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral blessings of God be seed (as in truth they are) there must be a casting of them away and a scattering of them, that we may receive them again with increase.</p>
               <p>And yet in this casting them we do not lose them, nor our right and interest in them, for when a man hath sowen an Acre of ground, if one ask him, whose is that seed, he will not say it is the grounds, but his that sowed it: so if a man could be brought to this perswasion, that <hi>semen est serentis, non recipientis,</hi> that what is sowen in works of mercy, is his that sowes it, and not the grounds on which he sowes it, he would not sowe sparingly. Thus we see the true state of riches, they are seed which must be sowen.</p>

                  </gap>; so if God enlighten our eyes, and give us hearts <hi>credere quod non videmus,</hi> to beleeve what we do not yet see, we shall reap the fruit thereof, which shall be <hi>videre quod credimus,</hi> to see and enjoy what we beleeved; and so we shall finde, that this seed of good works, though at present it seem to be lost, and cast away, yet it is <hi>serentis,</hi> it belongs still to the sower, and that an Autumn or harvest will come, when it will return an hundred fold.</p>
               <p>And thus we see the wayes of just getting, by lawful means, without deceit or violence; and when things are unjustly got, the necessity of restitution.</p>
               <p>We have seen also the right use of riches, both in regard of our selves, against prodigality and covetousnesse, the two extreams; and also in respect of others, by bounty and liberality, and so we see what is forbidden or commanded in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>

               <p>Now to attain this, he must be perswaded, that as God will have some to be poor, so it is he that maketh rich, and that whosoever would have <hi>divitias sine verme,</hi> riches<note place="margin">1 Thes. 3. 8.</note> without cares and sorrows, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, must be perswaded, that riches<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 28.</note> are the gift of God; and that whomsoever God would have to be rich, he would<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 11.</note> have them use onely lawful and direct means for the attaining of them, that is, to do nothing, but according to the strict rule of Gods will, for the attaining of them.</p>
               <p>Those that keep to this rule, we shall finde that God hath extraordinarily blest them, we may see it in <hi>Isaac,</hi> God blest him strangely, so that he made him feared of<note place="margin">Gen. 26. 11.</note> the Philistims; and so its said of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that his rightcousnesse in his service to <hi>Laban</hi>

               <list>

The need of the thing sold.</note> it also, which makes it valuable; for as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>unus panis,</hi> one loaf of bread is worth twenty flyes and one field better then a great company of mice, not in respect of their nature by creation, for living creatures are more noble and of more worth then things inanimate but in regard of the need we have of them; for thus sometimes a good horse is more esteemed, then an unprofitable man, because there is more need of the one, then of the other.</item>
                  <item>2. To the need they adde the use, for if a thing be fit for our purpose, if it be dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">2. The use.</note> if it have manifold uses, this increases the price.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now, because the want of things is varied many wayes, therefore the price is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried accordingly. As in regard of the place, thus in the middle of the land, sea fish is dearer, then neer the sea. So in regard of the time, as corn presently before harvest is dearer, because every man is to look to the getting in of his corn; and the longer from harvest, the cheaper it is. So also the scarcity of a thing may increase the price, because there are but few that have it to sell; as also <hi>utentium inopia,</hi> the scarcity of such as use it, when there are but few that will use it, and great pains is taken to make it, this makes the price uncertain.</p>
               <p>The need of a thing being uncertain, makes the price uncertain, so that it consists not <hi>in termino indivisibli,</hi> in an indivisible point. And then further, a mans charges which he is at, and the damage he sustains for the getting of it, and his care for the keeping of it, and his labour to polish and trim it, and the danger he passes thorow in attaining it, these are all valuable: but now, what a mans pains is, and what cost he is at, is not easily known. And therefore because this <hi>justitia contractuum,</hi> this justice and equity in bargaining cannot easily be brought under certain rules, because men will take too much liberty for their own gain and profit, we must avoid the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, and labour to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>We must remember that Charity doth not onely <hi>not seek her own,</hi> but <hi>giveth to others,</hi> and <hi>is bountiful;</hi> and the Apostle makes an opposition between <hi>stealing,</hi> and<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 5.</note>

               <p>In particular the rules of giving to the poor.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because, as we shewed formerly, it is a sin not to give, therefore every one must give, except he himself be in extream necessity; out of which case every man must give somewhat, according to his ability. The reason is given by the Apostle, <hi>Every man shall be accepted according to that which he hath, and not according</hi>

                  <hi>shall not want his reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Giving in some cases, and lending in other, are both enjoyned by our Saviour:<note place="margin">Matth 5 42.</note> and we have rules prescribed for the measure. Those Beleevers in the <hi>Acts, gave to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2 45.</note> 
                  <hi>every one, as they had need,</hi> they had respect to the necessity of the party; they were not like the prodigal, of whom the Heathen said, that he fared the worse for his luxury. Alms should be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>harlots,</hi> when they are prostituted without regard to the person. Neither as the Apostle saith, must men so give, <hi>that others may have, and themselves want,</hi> that others may finde case,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 13.</note> and themselves disease; like those that have the <hi>passio diabetica,</hi> who can hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but give promiscuously to any so long as they are able, for by this means, their liberality doth <hi>perire liberalitate</hi> perish with liberality.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the measure, so also for the manner God gives rules; as, that we <hi>give freely,</hi> God doth not love <gap reason="foreign">

2. Another rule is given by the Wise man, <hi>Say not to thy Neighbour, go and come</hi>

                  <hi>again, and to morrow I will give thee, when thou hast it by thee:</hi> we must give present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, lest we be like him that <hi>S.

                     </gap>, those money changers?</hi> and he findes at last, that <hi>Pauperes</hi> are <hi>Campsores, the poor be those money changers.</hi> And therefore he saith, If a man be to go into another countrey, where he shall need money, if he be in danger of thieves and robbers by the way, or if his money will not be currant in the place whither he is to go, he goes to the exchanger, delivers him his money, and takes a bill of his hand, which he carries with him, and so he fears neither robbers by the way, who he is sure will not rob him of a piece of paper, nor that he shall want currant money in the place he goes to: so saith he, is the case of every man in this life, he is travelling to his heavenly Countrey, and therefore he should do like a Traveller, who will neither load himself with that which may endanger his life, nor will passe for currant in the place to which he goes, but will so lay it out here, that he may receive it there.</p>
               <p>Now, as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, <hi>We came naked out of our mothers womb:</hi> and as the Apostle<note place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> saith, <hi>We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out of it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 6. 7.</note> for if we would, we are sure to be stript of all as we go. <hi>The proud are robbed,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>they have slept their sleep, and when they awake in the morning, they finde</hi>

Therefore the best couse is, in our passage hence, to make friends of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Mammon, to deliver it here, that we may receive the worth of it there.

               <p>This is the committing of our wealth here to Christs factors and exchangers, the poor, for whom he himself is surety: <hi>what ye do to them,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>ye do to me,</hi> I will make it good: he gives us his bill for it, which is the very gospel, the word of God, which cannot fail, wherein he hath promised, that not a cup of cold water, but shall be returned. This is our warrant for delivering here, and receiving it there.</p>
               <p>The Heathen man said, that works of mercy do swim out with us; and the Scripture saith, that the just, when they rest from their labours, <hi>opera eorum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

Therefore <hi>S. Pauls</hi> advise is, that Law suits should be diminished and lessened, as much as may be, and that there should be no suit, but when there is <gap reason="foreign">

When a man is out of judgement, he is not to say with those in the Psalm, <hi>Ego sum Dominus linguae meae, my tongue is my own,</hi> I may<note place="margin">Psalm 12. 4.</note> speak what I will; for <hi>nemo est Dominus sui, nisi ad licita,</hi> no man is Lord of his own,<note place="margin">prov. 24. 28.</note> further then to imploy it for a lawful use. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath a strange speech, <hi>Be not a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> without cause;</hi> which speech implies, that a man being not called, may be a false witnesse against his neighbour, when there is no cause. How can this be? In common ordinary talk, when a man speaks evil of his neighbour, he bears false witnesse against him, though he be not before any Judge. Therefore he advises to <hi>put far from us, proter vitatem oris, &amp; labiorum, a froward mouth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>

               <p>That we may understand this, we must know, that there are four things to which the tongue may do harm. For 1. a man hath favor or good esteem among men, this is in the minde. 2. A good report, which consists in speaking well of him. 3. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with friends, &amp;c. 4. A state or dignity, as a Superiour.

If any be disordered<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 13.</note> by a bare admonition, if the offence be small, and without aggravating circumstances,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 20.</note>

                  <hi>privately in the ear,</hi> with this caveat, except it redound to the damage and detriment of another, for then it must be declared to the party whom it concerns.</p>
               <p>So we see as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, that there is a double truth.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Dulcis, quae fovet,</hi> a sweet truth, which cherishes when we do well.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Amara, quae curat,</hi> a truth which is bitter, yet cures us when we have done amisse.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And therefore the Apostle writes to the <hi>Corinths, Though I made you sory, yet I</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>repent it not,</hi> though the example of the person punisht, made you sorry for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Rather I do now rejoyce, not for the act of punishment inflicted upon the offendor, as for your amendment by that act. Thus we see reproof is a way to bring men to repentance; and therefore we are to perform this duty, that thereby we may bring men to repentance, and so having performed it, we shall never repent us of it. And this is the reason of that speech, <hi>Non amo quenquam nisi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</hi> I love not any till I have made him sad: which is to be thus understood, that by making him sad, we bring him to repentance, and so we testifie our love to him.</p>
               <p>There are some such as the Philosopher saith, who having done evil, if a man come to deal with them, he must either <hi>

                  </gap>. But though they be such, yet we must not fear openly to rebuke them; for as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Open rebuke is better then secret love;</hi> and <hi>vulnera diligentis,</hi> the wounds of a friend, are better then <hi>oscula blandientis,</hi> the kisses of a flatterer: as in Physick we know, <hi>Amarum salubre,</hi> a bitter thing whlosome, is better then <hi>perniciosum dulce,</hi> an un wholsome thing, though sweet. This duty must not be neglected, though we shall be sure to meet with such as the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> mentions, <hi>who will hate him that reproves them:</hi> For this was seen by the Heathen, as appears by that speech; <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas odium parit,</hi> truth brings forth hatred.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>tres optimae matres trium filiarum pessimarum,</hi> three very good Mothers which have three most wicked Daughters; the first of which mothers is Truth, <hi>quae parit odium,</hi> which brings forth Hatred, so there is <hi>mater optima, &amp; filia pessima,</hi> an exceeding good mother, and a most naughty daughter. Neverthelesse we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve<note place="margin">Prov. 27. 5. 6.</note> to speak truth to our friend, though we make him sad; as <hi>Demaratus</hi> in <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi>

                  <hi>will please you?

               <p>The vice opposite to this duty of fraternal reproof, is flattery, which <hi>Hierom</hi> calls <hi>Natale malum,</hi> our native evil, for <hi>natali ducimur malo philantiae,</hi> we are all trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

               <p>We come now according to the former rules, to the means of keeping this Commandement.</p>
               <p>First, we must avoid <hi>groundlesse suspitions,</hi> which are the first cause of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>This suspicion is one of the fruits of that concupiscence wherewith our nature is<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 58.</note>

                  </gap>, and though the first boyling of it, or rising up in our nature, cannot be hindered, yet we must labour to suppresse it when it is risen. The true and proper use of it is for our own preservation and safety; and so in matters that concern the health and safety of soul or body, there is the onely lawful use of it; for in these things it is better to be <hi>nimium timidus quam parum prudens,</hi> a little too timid, rather then a little improvident. This we see in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, when the Mariners said, they<note place="margin">Acts 27. 30.</note> would but cast out the anchor, he fearing they would have gone down into the boat, and left them in the ship, he said, <hi>Vnlesse these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when such affections as are, given for our own good, are converted to the hurt and prejudice of other, this is an abuse; yet in this case it is so common in the world, that not the godly themselves are free from it, but there is a difference between suspitions arising in them and in the wicked: When Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> quickly; presently suspitions arose in the hearts of the Apostles; one thought, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

was about giving somewhat to the poor. Suspitions will arise, but in evil men they are<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 11.</note> positive, in good men privative. The Apostle had some fear and Suspition of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> which prevailed to the diminution of his good opinion of them, but not to a positive judgement of the contrary. An other example of this privative suspition we have in <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper, against Christ; he suspected him not to be a Prophet,<note place="margin">Luke 7. 39.</note> because he admitted a sinful woman so neer him, til Christ, by the Parable propounded to him, made him alter his judgement, which he did presently; his opinion of Christ began to lessen, but he came not so far as to conclude any thing positively. The godly may have a diminution of their good opinion of some, but this affirms nothing; they may suspend their good opinion, but they do not admit or cherish those thoughts so as to come to a positive determination, and to say it is so. But evil men, as first they suspect and say, I alwayes suspected him to be such an one, so they go further, and make <hi>e suspicione judicium, a judgement upon a bare suspicion,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, but they proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to resolve in their minde what to do hereupon against the party suspected, and sometime they proceed to act accordingly.</p>
               <p>Now for a man to keep himself from rash judging upon suspicions, he must consider two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That such thoughts and affections as arise in himself, the same he thinks to arise<note place="margin">Rules again Suspicions.</note> in others, and so such as we think others to be, such we are commonly our selves, as if we be angry, when another speaks evil to us, we suspect, that if we speak evil to any, he is angry with us. <hi>Cum ipse stultus sit, omnes stultos putat,</hi> the fool thinks all others to be fools. If a man make himself the measure of all things, he cannot but suspect evil of others, if he himself be evil.</item>
                  <item>2. As a mans affections are, so are his suspicions: If he be ill affected to any, every small suspicion makesa conclusion. When the minde of the Disciples ran upon bread, the Leaven of the Pharisees was a Loaf, they understood Christ of Loaves, when he<note place="margin">Mark 8. 14.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 8.</note> meant the Doctrine of the Pharisees. On the other side, <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren were ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to him, and then every dream did increase their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and remove evil affections from us, and strive against suspicions, there is good hope we may remove them; otherwise, we shall be apt from suspicions to proceed<note place="margin">Acts 28. 4.</note> to conclusions, as they did against <hi>Paul,</hi> when the Viper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </list>
               <p>There are six things to be observed, to keep our suspicions from growing into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, and they may be reduced to two, for they concern either the ground, or the object.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The ground whereupon they rise. Suspicions naturally rise from slender<note place="margin">1 The grounds of our suspitions</note> grounds; sometimes in good, as when the Disciples gathered from Christs answer,<note place="margin">John 21. 23.</note> to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> that <hi>John should not die;</hi> some in evil, as when they concluded, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Peter</hi> was of Galilee, as his speech shewed, therefore he was one of Christs<note place="margin">Mark 14. 7.</note> Disciples; therefore every man must examine his grounds.<note place="margin">2 For the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The object, which is either God, or man.</item>

               <p n="1">1. Sometimes a man is reproached with a matter known, and of which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed; here, 1. he must take heed of <hi>frons meretricia,</hi> a whorish forehead. If the word of God, and the censures of the Church will not prevail, it is not their civil censures that will work any thing: and 2. he must not onely have the shame in his countenance, but also confusion inwardly, that he may be able to say, This shame I willingly bear, onely I wish, that I may amend my fault, and recover the favour of God, and be in credit with his servants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes a man is reproached for a thing not known, nor is he convicted of it, yet he knows himself to be guilty; here he is not bound <hi>retegere peccatum,</hi> to uncover his sin, <hi>nisi sine peccato tegere non potest,</hi> except without sin, he cannot keep it close; yet he must confesse it to God, and say with <hi>David, Tibi soli peccavi, against</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 51. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>thee have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight,</hi> thou knowest of it, though I cannot be convicted of it before men.</p>
               <p>Now in this case, either a man hath given some occasion, by carrying himself so, as may give some suspition of such a sin, though he never acted it, and then, because he hath offended in not avoiding all appearance of evil, he must know God hath by this means dealt lovingly with him, to make him more wary to avoid all appearance of evil for the future, and to keep him from wandring and pleasing imaginations of the sin in his heart, for it is sure, sin cannot be long in the heart, before it will come into action.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes a man is charged with that, which he ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in his heart, yet in this case he may make use of an unjust reproach; for by this means, he may be stirred up to prayer, to be still kept from that sin, which he may fall into afterwards, though as yet he be free from it, for many have fallen so; there he should take this as a warning from God, to take heed that he fall not into the just reproach, as <hi>Solomon</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 28. 14.</note> advises, <hi>Vereri opera sua,</hi> be afraid and jealous of himself; for, <hi>blessed is the man that seareth alwayes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="520" facs="tcp:59534:286"/>
And in this case, it is the advise of the Fathers and Doctors, that when a man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into unjust reproach, by lyes and slanders, he should examine himself, whether he have not lyed unto God, and so deserved this lying report from men, whether he have not made many promises of amendment to God, in the day of his affliction, which afterwards he hath forgotten; like the Israelites in distresse, who prayed the<note place="margin">Judg. 10. 15.</note> Lord, <hi>that he would but deliver them that day,</hi> and then he should do as it should please him; or as those in <hi>Hosea,</hi> that <hi>cried not with their hearts, when they howled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hosea 7. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>their beds,</hi> but were like them in the Psalm, <hi>that lyed with their mouths and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 78. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>with him in their hearts.</hi> This lying to God, when men make fair promises in their sicknesse, or other distresse, which they have no care to perform, may justly cause God to give them over to the lying tongues of men: and for this cause it is, as with them in <hi>Hosea,</hi> that <hi>vinea mentitur nobis, the floor and the winepresse fails us;</hi> we shall have fair and forward springs, but God sends such weather as shall deceive our hopes. And as it is said, <hi>that the house of Achshib, should be a lie to the kings of Israel;</hi> so<note place="margin">Micah 1. 14.</note> those that trust in men, for whose favour they are contented to lie and do evil, hoping those men shall be pillars to support them, they shall finde that those they trusted in, shall prove a lye to them, they shall deceive them, and finde there is no help in them. And thus much for the means and rules for observing this Commandment.</p>
               <p>The last rule, according to our former method, requires, that we procure the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">The sixt rule for procuring the observation by others.</note> of it by others, and herein we have <hi>Davids</hi> example, whose eyes were upon <hi>veraces terrae, the faithful in the land;</hi> so effectually would he work, that no deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful person, nor any that telleth lies should tarry in his sight. The one should be his Companions, but the other should not come neer him. And thus much for this<note place="margin">Psal. 101. 6, 7</note> ninth Commandment.</p>

                  <p>Reasons against the dividing of this Commandment into two. The dependance of it. The scope and end of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have formerly mentioned, <note n="*" place="margin">Expos. Com. 1. Chap. 2.</note> That the Church of Rome toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as they make the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the first but one, so to make up the number of ten, they divide this into two; so that these words, <hi>Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours wife</hi> is the ninth, and the rest that follows, is the tenth. And though they take herein the Authority of<note place="margin">Reasons against the dividing of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into two.</note> Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> yet we choose rather to follow those that make it but one, as most of the Fathers besides him do, and that for these Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it would be unreasonable to thrust two Precepts into one period, and so to pronounce them with one breath; whereas every one of the rest is a full sentence by it self; and therefore it is most agreable to Reason, that this should be so too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because to make two Laws for two lusts or Concupiscences, as they would do here, is to make Laws for every particular, which is counted absurd in all Laws, for Laws are made in general, and descend not to particulars; and it would be most absurd in this Law of the Decalogue which is most compendious, and therefore most general.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because by this reason we might make more Commandments of this then two, for, though two Concupiscences onely be named, yet there are diverse others here included, as the inward lusts against the fifth, the sixth, and the ninth, which will fall under no Commandment, if they be not reduced hither, and if they be, then they make so many precepts, as well as these two, which refer to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and eighth, which are here mentioned: for <hi>objectum determinat propositio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> the object makes the proposition; and therefore, how many Lusts there be, so many objects there are, and so many propositions, and by consequence, so many Commandments: and if they say that the rest are forbidden under these two, they must shew how the rest, being of a different nature, can be referred to these two, which if they cannot do, this is <hi>gratis dictum.</hi>

                     </gap>,</hi> and such a Hyperbaton or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as is not to be found any where in the scripture besides: for here is (by their division) first, a prohibiting of the Concupiscence against the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and then of that against the seventh, and then again of that against the eighth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In their Catechisms, when they come to expound this Commandment as two, they are in such want of matter, when they come to lay forth the several branches of them, that they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The exposition of this Precept is to be taken out of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours wife, neither shalt thou covet thy Neighbours house, his field, &amp;c.</hi> and from the Prophets, <hi>Esay</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his thoughts, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> 18. 12. where, <hi>the doing after the imagination of ones evil heart is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi> and in the Gospel, from our Saviours exposition, against the false doctrine of the Pharisees, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 15, 16, &amp;c. shewing, <hi>that what comes out of the heart defiles a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The dependance of this Comamndment upon the rest, appears in this, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">The dependance of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> the observing of this, none of the rest can be kept; for, by giving this after all the rest, God would teach us, how all the rest are to be understood, <hi>viz.</hi> that not onely the outward act is forbidden in them, but also the inward purpose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the heart, though we never proceed to the outward act; so that this is the rule and measure for the understanding and so for the observing of the rest, this is the hinge whereupon all the rest do turn; and therefore <hi>S.

Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>superbi peccatores,</hi> proud sinners, who are not <hi>sanati,</hi> healed, may by this Law be <hi>convicti,</hi> convicted of their need of a Physitian; for though a man may in regard of the full consent of heart, hold out, and justifie himself in some things, and for some small time, (though few attain to this) yet, when he comes to this Commandment, wherein the <hi>partus imperfectus,</hi> the imperfect birth, (when there is no perfect consent, but some pleasure and titillation onely in the motion) is forbidden, this will make him sweat, and cry out, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 0 <hi>wretched man, who shall deliver me from the body of death,</hi> and so will make him see that he cannot acquit himself, nor be a Christ or Saviour to himself: but must fly out, and seek to another without himself, as it is in the next words, <hi>I thank God through our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the consent of the heart is forbidden by the other Commandments, as they are expounded by our Saviour, who saith, that <hi>if a man look upon a woman, hoc animo, &amp; hoc fine,</hi> with this purpose, and to this end, <hi>to lust after her,</hi> that this concupiscence<note place="margin">Hierome.</note> is Adultery; but here the intention and desire, though it have not <hi>plenum consensum,</hi> full consent, but be onely <hi>partus imperfectus,</hi> is attainted by this Precept.</p>
               <p>The distinction here is, that in the former Commandments, the intention of evil is forbidden, <hi>etsi non consequaris,</hi> though it be not executed; here also, <hi>etsi non prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaris,</hi> even though it be not prosecuted or resolved upon, as when the motion is entertained with some approbation or delight, though not fully consented to. <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine contra Julian.</hi> explains the matter thus: the one is, <hi>Non concupisces, thou shalt not lust,</hi> forbidden by this Commandment; the other is, <hi>post concupiscentias tuas ne eas, follow not after thy lusts,</hi> as it is in <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 18. 30. and he that hath attained this latter (not to go after his lusts) <hi>magnum fecit,</hi> saith the same Father, hath done much, <hi>sed non perfecit,</hi> but hath not done all, <hi>quia adhuc concupiscit,</hi> because he lusts still.</p>
               <p>The Apostle distinguishes them thus, he calls the one <hi>peccatum regnans, sin reigning in us,</hi> when <hi>we follow it in the lusts thereof;</hi> the other <hi>peccatum inhabitans, sin dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us,</hi> when it lusts in us, but hath not got perfect dominion: here it dwells as a private person, there it rules, and hath got a kingdom; for <hi>quando peccatum transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit in affectum cordis, &amp; impetravit sensum rationis, ut si adsit occasio, facere disponat,</hi> when sin hath so far prevailed both upon our affections, and upon our reason, that there wants onely an opportunity to act it, there it reigns. But when we have given some entertainment to it in our mindes, but are not resolved, so that there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

If we resolve once, <hi>faciam,</hi> I will do it, then it is <hi>factum,</hi> as good as done before God, and may be referred also to the other Commandments, as forbidden there.</p>

               <p>By this Concupiscence, evil motions, when they arise in the heart, are checked, as<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 5, 11.</note> we see in the Psalmist; <hi>Why art thou cast down O my soul, and why art thou disquieted within me? trust in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> This Concupiscence is not condemned here, but as<note place="margin">Rom 8.</note> it is in it self acceptable, so <hi>by helping our infirmities,</hi> it makes our prayers acceptable with God, and so procuring audience, whereby we obtain our desires of God, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases in us love to God, and charity to men.

               <argument>
                  <p>How a man comes to be given up to his own desires. Thoughts of two sorts. 1. Ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from our own hearts. 2. Injected by the Devil. The manner how we come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: Six degrees in sin. 1. The receiving of the seed, 2. The retaining of it. 3. The conception. 4. The forming of the parts. 5. The quickning. 6. The travel or birth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw for the means whereby a man comes to be thus endangered, it hath been partly handled already in the first Commandement, which in our duty to God, answers to this, towards our Neighbour, and shall partly be now touched.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="526" facs="tcp:59534:289"/>
A man comes thus to be given up to his own desires, by degrees, when he gives<note place="margin">Zach. 8. 17.</note> way to civil imaginations against his Neighbour. <hi>Let no man imagine or think evil in his heart</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>against his Neighbor.</hi> We must not give way to it at all, though we suffer it not to proceed to <hi>suppuration.</hi> There is in every of us an evil ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination against our Neighbour to do them prejudice; and this being in us, then there comes in a temptation, as the Apostle shews, partly from the world, (<hi>according to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>the course of the world</hi>) partly from the Devil, who then begins to strike and to work and fashion the thought of the heart, to a perfect sin (<hi>according to the Prince of the power of this air.</hi>) Thus they both work upon our thoughts and desires, <hi>to fulfil the desires of the flesh,</hi> as it is in the next verse.</p>
               <p>So that here is a double cause to draw us to this. 1. Our concupiscence alone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered<note place="margin">Thoughts as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from the heart.</note> in it self, as it riseth by it self, without any blowing or quickning of it from without. 2. As it is imployed and wrought by the World, or the Devil, or both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By it self alone, Christ speaks of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>descend</hi> or come from above; the one comes from our selves, the<note place="margin">James 1. 18.</note> other from God and his Spirit, for <hi>omne bonum desuper.</hi> Now the Devil knowing this, takes occasion by those desires which he perceives by some outward signe to arise within us, to assault us, by propounding worldly objects and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and so makes use of the world to tempt us. Thus he dealt with Christ, he forbare him till he was hungry, and had his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>his natural desire of bread;</hi> and then he comes<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. 4. 3.</note> to him, and offers him <hi>stones to be turned into bread;</hi> thinking by that means (when<note place="margin">2 Kings 3. 14.</note> Christ had a natural appetite) to have been entertained, as <hi>Jehoram</hi> was for <hi>Jehosaphats</hi> sake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there are <hi>cogitationes ascendentes,</hi> thoughts ascending into the heart, so there<note place="margin">2. Thoughts injected by the Devil.</note> are another sort, <hi>cogitationes immissae,</hi> thoughts cast in by the Devil. Thus the Devil<note place="margin">Luke 22. 3.</note> entred into <hi>Judas,</hi> when he put those evil thoughts into his heart of betraying his<note place="margin">Acts 5. 3.</note> Master. So he filled the heart of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the Holy Ghost, and to commit sacriledge. And as he sometimes doth this immediately by himself, so he sometimes makes use of the world, and os outward objects, to cast evil thoughts into us. Thus the World and the Devil infect us from without, when we infect our selves fast enough from within: For as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> speaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the sparkle is within us, the flame is from the evil spirit, which blows it up: so that though there were no Devil to tempt us, and though we were in the Wildernesse where no worldly objects could allure us, yet we carry enough in our bosomes to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our selves. Neither can we be safe though we leave all the world behinde us, so long as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> our own hearts with us, saith <hi>S. Basil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of these. The ascending thoughts within us, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the other <hi>cogitationes immissae,</hi> that are sent or injected into us, unlesse they infect us, or we give way to them, are our crosses, not our sins: Nay, <hi>Daemon tentando coronas nobis fabricat,</hi> by resisting these motions and temptations of Satan, we win the crown, and every temptation we resist, is a new flower to our Garland.</p>
               <p>The manner how these thoughts come to infect us is thus. There are six degrees<note place="margin">The manner how we come to be infected with sin.</note> before we come to that full consent and purpose of heart which is prohibited by the other Commandements.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Genesis,</hi> when <hi>Eve</hi> was tempted, we see how the infection began. There is the<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> fruit held out, the object to allure, and withal the three provocations by which all sins are ushered in to the soul are there set down.</p>
