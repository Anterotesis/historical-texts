            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The fourth ſygne is, yf great vapours and fumes ariſe out of the body, when a man is in a bathe, and wolde fayne ſweate, but he can not.</p>
                  <p>The fifth ſigne is yf the paciente can not drawe his breath eaſely, for many one is ſo ſtrayte wynded, that he can not ſpeake, and when he breatheth it is with great laboure and difficultie.</p>

For as ſoone as many ſortes of other ſykneſſes doo ariſe, the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence abateth and is gone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10036:119"/>And here is to be noted, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer chyld in the tyme of peſtilence, be vexed with the wormes, ye maye ſafely affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is infected, for it is a matter ſo diſpoſed to the peſtilence, euen as is brymſtone, to be kindled of the fyre.

                  <p>Therfore by and by without delaye, ye muſte admynyſtre ſome good and holſome medicine, as ſhalbe ſayd her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, or elles the ſtylled water that we ſpake of in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former Chapiter, or ſome other valiaunt medicine againſt the peſtilence, that it may deſcend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hert afore the venyme haue the vpperhande of nature.</p>
                  <p>For yf it bee once ſettled at the hert, I affirme plainely, ther is no hope at al. Yet there be ſome fooles, that tarye tyl the twelueth houre, or the foure &amp; twentye, after the infeccion, and they booſt them ſelues that they wil heale the pacient, but that is a manifeſt &amp; a a ſhameful errour, for yf any by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is ſo recouered, it commeth of God, &amp; not of any medicine, for where as one ſo eſcapeth, an hundred other periſſhe.</p>

                  <p>Nowe we haue declared the ſignes by whiche ye maye eaſily know whan a perſon is infected, and wee ſayde it was conueniente to take the medicyne as ſoone as anye of them appeareth, without any longer tarying, afore the venime commeth to the hearte, here wee wyll enfourme you, howe ye ſhall perceiue whether the ſaide venime bee ſetled in the hearte or no.</p>
                  <p>Take a dramme of bole armeny made in pouder accordyng to the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt chapter in the firſt part, and if ye can not get it, take ſome other excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t medicine againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peſtilence, namely one of the receites that ſhall bee ſayde hereafter, and geue it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pacient, but

                  <p>Therfore by and by waſh his mouth with wine, or with water of ſcabious, of ſorel, or of roſes, and it ought to be very wel mundified and clenſed.</p>

            <p>Generall or commune veynes are iii. which appeare in the middeſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mannes arme on the inner ſyde, &amp; of them the higheſt is called of learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cephalica, or the head beine, and the loweſt of al three, is called commonly
<pb facs="tcp:10036:139"/>
baſilica or regia, in the righte arme by an other name epatica, or the veine of the liuer, but in the left arme, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led pulmatica, the veine of the longes. The .iii. common veine, lieth betwene the other .ii. in the middes, and is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med cordiaca, or the veine of the heart.</p>
            <p>The fyrſt that we dyd ſpeake of, that is to ſaie cephalica, is a veine moſt apt to be letten bloude, in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hyer partes of mannes body, and is opened for the head ache, and the eyes.</p>
            <p>This veine yf by chaunce ye touche it, and yf it blede not at the fyrſt ſtroke ye may be bold to ſtrike it once again, for there is no ieopardye of cutting of anye muſcle. And yf ye cannot finde it out, take hys hraunche that is aboute the thombes ende.</p>
            <p>The veine epatica, emptyeth from the middle partes of al the body, and it is euer opened againſt diſeaſes of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſplene, but ye ought ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be very dilygent, that there be no muſcule perced.</p>
            <p>

            <p>The cordiaca veine draweth bloud as wel from beneth, as from aboue, for it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pouned of cephalica and epatica. If any feleth a weakenes at his heart, he ought to take good hede that he bee not opened in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> veine cordiaca, but yf neceſſitye be of bleding, let him blede in the cephalica or els mediana.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe of the other .ii. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaca, is good to cure the paſſions of al the hole bodye, whan they doe procede of heate, ſpecially of the hearte and of the longes.</p>
            <p>But in the percing of it, ye muſte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedyngly beware, for vnder it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain muſcle, which if it bee very depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye cutte, the pacient is in ieopardy of his lyfe.</p>
            <p>When ye entend to let a perſon bloud in any veine, ye muſte bathe the arme wherin ye perce, in good hote water, &amp; draw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole abrod, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the groſſe bloude

            <p>The .ii. veines in the corners of the iyes are opened in the cure of webbes, ſpottes, cloudes, miſtes, perles, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, cornes, and other infirmityes and weakeneſſe of the ſyght.</p>
            <p>The .ii. veines in the holowneſſe of the eares, ſerue to heale the ſhaking of the heade, ſwymminge of the eyes, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, ſounding of the eares, new deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and vnclennes of the mouth.</p>
