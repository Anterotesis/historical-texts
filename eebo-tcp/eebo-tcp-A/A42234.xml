            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book, Most Eminent of Kings, is bold to bear Your Royal Name in the Front, in Considence, not of It self, not of the Author, but of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Because it is written for Justice. Which Vertue is so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Yours, that, by your own Merits, and by the Suffrage of Mankind, You have thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Title most worthy of so Great a King: being known every where now, no less by the Name of JUST, than of LU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOVIC. The <hi>Roman</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders esteemed the Titles very specious, which were deriv'd from <hi>Crete, Numidia, Afric, Asia,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:96775:5"/>
and other conquer'd Nations: How much more Illustrious is Yours, whereby you are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both the Enemy every where, and all ways the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour (of no people, of no man, but) of that which is Unjust? The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings thought it a great matter, if One were called the Lover of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Another of his Mother, a Third of his Brother: How small parts are These of Your Name, which comprehendeth not only those things, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever can be imagined fair and honorable? You are Just, when, by Imitation of Him, you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Memory of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a King Great, above all that can be said; Just, when you instruct your Brother every way, but no way more than by
<pb facs="tcp:96775:5"/>
your example; Just, when you grace your Sisters with Highest Matches; Just, when you revive the Laws almost buried, and, as much as you can, oppose your self against the declining Age: Just, but withal Clement, when you take away nothing from your subjects (whom Ignorance of your goodness had transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond the limits of their Duty) beside the licence to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; and offer no Violence to Souls of a different perswasion in matter of Religion: Just, and withall Merciful, when, by your Authority you relieve oppressed Nations, afflicted Princes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther permit Fortune to be too insolent. Which singular Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of yours, and as neer like to God, as human Nature suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, compells me, on my own
<pb facs="tcp:96775:6"/>
behalf also, to make this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick thankfull Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, as the Heavenly Stars do not only communicate their Influence to the greater parts of the world, but vouchsafe it to every living Creature; So you, being the most beneficent Star on earth, not content to raise up Princes, to ease people, have been pleased to be a safeguard, and a Comfort, even to me, ill used in my own Country. Here is to be added, to fill up the Orb of Justice, after your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Actions; the Innocency and Purity of Your private life, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be admir'd, not by Men alone, but by the Angels too. For, how Few of the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour sort, yea of those that have secluded themselves from the Fellowship of the world, keep
<pb facs="tcp:96775:6"/>
themselves so untoucht by all faults, as You, being placed in such a Fortune, which is sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with innumerable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements to sin? And how Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable a Thing is This, among Business, in the Throng, in the Court, among so many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Those that sin so many ways, to attain unto that, which solitude scarce, yea often not at all, affordeth others? This is indeed, to merit, even in this life, not only the name of JUST, but of SAINT, which was given by the consent of pious men, to <hi>Charles the Great &amp; Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovic</hi> your Ancestors, after their Death; that is, to be, not by a Gentilitious, but by your own proper right, <hi>Most Christian.</hi> Now, as every part of Justice is Yours, so is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb facs="tcp:96775:7"/>
the Matter of this Book, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Counsells of War and Peace, yours peculiarly, as you are a King, and King of <hi>France.</hi> This your Kingdom is great, which stretcheth it self to both Seas, through so many spaces of so happy Lands: but it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Kingdom than This, that You do not covet other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. This is worthy of Your Piety, worthy of that eminency; not to Invade the Right of any Other by your Arms, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move antient Bounds; but to do the Business of Peace in the time of War; neither to begin War, but with this Desire, to bring it to a speedy end. And, How Brave, How Glorious is This, How Joyful to Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that, when God shal call you up to His Kingdom, which
<pb facs="tcp:96775:7"/>
alone is better than yours, you may confidently say, <hi>This sword have I receiv'd from Thee, for the safeguard of Justice; This I render to Thee pure and unstained with the blood of any man, rashly shed?</hi> Thus it shall come to pass, that the rules we now look for in books, hereafter may be taken from Your actions, as from a most perfect Exemplar. It is a very great matter, This; Yet doth the world of Christians dare to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act something more at Your Hands; Namely, that, the Flames of War being every where extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, not only Empires, but Churches may see their Peace returning to them by Your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement: and, that Our Age may learn to submit to the Judgment of That Age, which All Christians profess to have
<pb facs="tcp:96775:8"/>
been truly &amp; sincerely Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. The minds of Good men, weary of Discords, are raised to this Hope by the Friendship newly made 'twixt you &amp; the <hi>King of Great Britain</hi> (a most wise Prince, &amp; exceedingly stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of that Holy Peace) and confirmed by the most Auspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Marriage of your Sister. Difficult is the Business, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Partial Affections, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and exasperated more and more: but Nothing is worthy of so excellent Kings, but That which is Difficult, but That which is Despaird of by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The God of Peace, the God of Justice, O Just &amp; peaceable King, Crown your Majesty (nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to His) as with all other happiness, so with this also, the procuring of a Just &amp; Universal Peace. 1625.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Civil Law, whether Roman, or that which is proper to any other Countrey, many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have attempted either to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate with Commentaries, or in a more compendious way to propose unto their Readers: But, that Law which is between many Nations, or their Rulers, whether proceeding from Nature it self, or constituted by divine precepts, or introduced by customs and tacit agreement, Few have touched, None have hitherto
<pb facs="tcp:96775:9"/>
handled universally, and in a certain order, when yet the Doing hereof is of much Concernment to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For, <hi>Cicero</hi> truly call'd this an excellent Science, in Leagues, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and Agreements of several people, Kings and forein Nations, and in all Rights of War and Peace. <hi>Euripides</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <note n="†" place="margin">Sic enim Theoc'ymenem compellari facit: <hi>Nam turpe id essct, cum scias hominum ac Deûm Quod est eritque, justa te haud cognoscere.</hi>
                     </note> prefers this science before the knowledge of divine and humane things. 1. This Work is the more necessary, because, both in our age there are, and in former times there have been some, who so contemned this part of Right and Law, as if it were onely an empty word, and had no real existence. That saying of <hi>Euphemus</hi> in <hi>Thucydides,</hi> is almost in all mens mouths, <note n="*" place="margin">Thucyd. l. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Likewise, in the first Book, the Athenians being at that time in their pride, say thus to the Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Humane reason judgeth those things just which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; and things possible to be done, are done by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and suffered by the weak.</note> 
                     <hi>That nothing is unjust, which is profitable to a King or Common-wealth having power.</hi> Whereto that is like, <hi>In the highest Fortune that is more right, which is more prevalent.</hi> And, <hi>A Common-wealth
<pb facs="tcp:96775:9"/>

                  <p>From this signification of Law is derived another more large: for, because Man above other Animals, hath not onely that social virtue which we mention'd, but also judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to discern what things delight or hurt, not present onely, but fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and what things can lead to either; it is convenient to humane nature, according to the measure of humane understanding, in these things also to follow a rectified judgement, and neither to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with fear, or the allurement of present pleasure, nor to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with any impetuous rashness: And that, which is plainly repugnant to such a judgement, is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to be against the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to wit, humane.</p>
                  <p>What we have now said, would have some place, though we should grant, which cannot be granted
<pb facs="tcp:96775:12"/>
without the highest sin, <hi>That there is no God:</hi> or, <hi>That he hath no Care of humane Affairs:</hi> the contrary whereof being implanted in us, partly by Reason, partly by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Tradition, and confirmed by many Arguments and Miracles te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in all Ages, it follows, that we must without exception obey God, as our Maker, to whom we owe our selves, and all we have: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, seeing he hath many waies declared his infinite Goodness and Power; So that, he is able to give unto those that obey him greatest Rewards, and eternal, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self eternal; and may be believed willing; and much the more, if he hath expresly promis'd it: Which we Christians, convinced by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted testimonies, do believe.

For the mother of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law</hi> is humane nature it self,
<pb facs="tcp:96775:14"/>
which would carry us to a desire of mutual society, though we wanted nothing: but the mother of <hi>Civil Law</hi> is the very obligation by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which having its vertue from the Natural Law, Nature may be call'd the Grandmother of this Law also. But to <hi>Natural Law</hi> Utility is added: for the Author of Nature was pleased we should be weak <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly,</hi> and stand in need of many things usefull to our life, that we might the more vigorously embrace Society: To the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> Utility gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion: for that consociation or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection aforesaid, began to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for some Utilities sake. And they that prescribe Laws to others, are wont, or ought, to respect some Utility therein.</p>
                  <p>But, as the Laws of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth respect the interest and profit of the same; so, between Common-wealths, either all, or most, some Laws may have arisen from Consent, (and it appears they have arisen) which might respect the Interest, not of several Societies, but of the Whole. And this is that
<pb facs="tcp:96775:14"/>
which is call'd the <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> as oft as that name is distinguisht from Natural Law. Which kind of Law <hi>Carneades</hi> omitted, distributing all Law into Natural Law, and the Civil Law of single Nations: when yet, being to treat of that Law which is common to Nations one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (for he added a discourse of War, and things got by War) he ought by all means to have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same.</p>
                  <p>And it is another errour of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades,</hi> to traduce <hi>Justice</hi> by the name of <hi>Folly.</hi> For, as by his own confession, the Citizen is not a fool, who follows the Civil Law in the Common-wealth, though for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence unto it he must omit some things profitable to himself: So, neither is that people foolish, that value not so much their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as to neglect therefore the Common Law of Nations.

Whatsoever action of thine hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, either near or remote, to the common Good, it makes a breach, and is against the peace, and seditious, like him that separates himself from the people. <hi>And as the same</hi> Antoninus <hi>saith,</hi> What is good for the Hize, is good for the Bee.</note>, who breaks the Civil

                  <p>Again, though no profit were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected out of the observation of Law, yet were it a point of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not of Folly, to be carried unto that, to which we feel our selves directed and enclined by our nature.

                  <p>Now, whereas Many require not that justice in a State or Governour, which they exact of private Men; the Cause of that errour is, first, in that they consider nothing in the Law, but the Profit arising thence: Which is evident in single Citizens, unable to defend themselves; but

                  <p>And withall, my Design was, by my private study and diligence, to advance the profession of the Laws,
<pb facs="tcp:96775:19"/>
which heretofore in publick Offices I had exercised with as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity as I could: This comfort of my studies was left me, after I was unworthily cast out of myown Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, honour'd by so many Labours of mine. Many, before me, have purposed to bring this into a form of Art, but no man hath done it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly: Nor is it possible, unless (which hitherto hath not been done with care enough) the things which are by Constitution be rightly sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Natural. For, Naturals, because they are alwaies the same, may easily be collected into Art: but the things that come from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, because they are often changed, and are divers in divers places, are put without Art, as other precepts of singular things. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, if the Priests of true Justice would undertake to handle the parts of natural and perpetual Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence (laying aside what hath its original from free will,) One of Laws, another of Tributes, another of the Judges Office, another of the
<pb facs="tcp:96775:20"/>
conjecture of Wills, another of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Facts, thereupon might be composed a Body of all parts col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. What course we thought fit to take, we have shewed in deed, rather than words: this work, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that part of Juris-prudence, which is by far most noble. For in the <hi>first Book,</hi> having first spoken of the Original of Right and Law, we have examined that question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any War be just and lawfull. After, to know the difference 'twixt publick and private War, we had to explain the nature of the Supreme Power; what States and Kings have it full, what in part; what with right of alienation, what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Last of all, we had to speak of the duty of Subjects towards their Superiours. The <hi>second Book</hi> expounds what are the Causes whence War may rise: And there we speak of Community and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, Leagues, Oaths, Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Punishments, &amp;c. The <hi>third Book</hi> having expounded what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the time of War, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
<pb facs="tcp:96775:20"/>
what is done without fault, from what is done without punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ends with Arguments and Peace.</p>
                  <p>Now this Argument seemed the more worthy of our pains, because, as I have said, no man hath handled the whole; and, they that have handled the parts, have so handled them, that they have left much for anothers Industry. The old Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers have nothing extant in this kind, neither the Greeks, among whom <hi>Aristotle</hi> made a Book, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, nor They that gave their name to new Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism (which was much to be wished:) And the Books of the old <hi>Romans, De jure Feciali,</hi> have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us nothing of themselves, but the Title. I have seen also spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Books <hi>De Jure Belli,</hi> partly by Divines, <hi>viz. Franciscus Victoria, Henricus Gorichemus, Wilhelmus Matthaei</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Add to these <hi>Joannes de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena,</hi> set forth at <hi>Rome, An.</hi> 1609.</note>; partly by Doctors of Law, <hi>viz. Jannes Lupus, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscus Arius, Joannes de Lignano, Martinus, Laudensis:</hi> But all these
<pb facs="tcp:96775:21"/>
have said but very little of a most copious Argument; and most of them so, that without order they confounded things of Natural Law, and of Divine, and of the Law of Nations, and of the Civil, and of the Canon Law, and mingled them all together. What was most want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all these, <hi>the light of Histories,</hi> the most learned <hi>Faber</hi> in some Chapters of his <hi>Semestria</hi> (but as it stood with the purpose of his work, and alleging onely testimonies:) <hi>Balthazar Ayala</hi> more largely, and bringing a heap of examples to some definitions, have attempted to supply. <hi>Albericus Gentilis</hi> yet more largely: by whose diligence, as I know others may, and profess my self to have been helped; so what may be wished in him, in the kind of teaching, in order, in distinguishing the questions, and several sorts of Law, I leave to the Readers judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This onely I will say, He is wont, in determining Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, to follow either a few examples not alwaies to be approv'd, or also
<pb facs="tcp:96775:21"/>
the authority of the new Lawyers, in his Answers; Many whereof are framed in favour of those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult them, not to the Nature of Right and Good. The Causes whence War may be called just, or unjust, <hi>Ayala</hi> hath not touched: <hi>Gentilis</hi> hath, as it pleased him, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated some general heads, and hath not so much as touched many places of both noble and frequent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies. We have endeavour'd to speak of all, shewing also the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, whence it may be easy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine what we have here omitted.</p>
                  <p>It remains now, that I declare briefly, with what aids, and with what care I set upon this business. First, my Care hath been, to refer the proofs of things pertaining to the Law of Nature, unto Notions so certain, that no man, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering violence to himself, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deny them. For, the <hi>principles</hi> of that Law, if you mark them well, are open and evident of themselves, even after the manner of things

perceived by our outward senses: which, if the organs be well formed, and other necessaries be present, do not deceive. Therefore <hi>Euripides</hi> in his <hi>Phaenissae</hi> makes <hi>Polynice,</hi> whose cause he will have to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly just, speak thus:</p>

<pb facs="tcp:96775:22"/>
and places affirm the same thing for certain, it ought to be referr'd to an universal Cause: which, in our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, can be no other, than either right Illation proceeding from the principles of Nature, or some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Consent. That shews the Law of Nature, This the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Difference of which Laws is to be conceived, not from the testimonies themselves (for Writers do commonly use the words, <hi>Law of Nature and of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> promiscuously:) but from the quality of the Matter. For, that which cannot, by sure consequence, be deduced out of sure principles, and yet appears every where obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, must needs have its rise from free will and consent. These two therefore, I have still been very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to discern one from the other, and both from the Civil Law. Yea, in the Law of Nations also, I have distinguisht what is truly and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry respect Right, and what onely brings forth a certain external effect, like unto that Primitive Right, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:96775:23"/>
that it may not be resisted; or also, that every where, for some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities sake, or the avoyding of great incommodities, it must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Which observation, how necessary 'tis to many things, will appear in the contexture of the Work it self.</p>
                  <p>Among Philosophers, <hi>Aristotle</hi> deservedly obtains the principal place, whether you consider the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his discoursing, or the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his distinguishing, or the weight of his Reasons. Only I wish that Principality had not, for some Ages, gone into Tyrannie; so that Truth, to which <hi>Aristotle</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> faithfull servant, is opprest by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than by the name of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> For my part, both here and elswhere, I imitate the liberty of the Antient Christians, who were sworn to no Philosophers sect: not, that they did assent to them, who said, <hi>Nothing could be known,</hi> than which nothing is more foolish; but, that they judged no sect had seen all Truth, and not any but had some.
<pb facs="tcp:96775:23"/>
Wherefore, to gather up Truth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed among them all, and diffused into Sects, into a Body, This they thought was indeed to deliver Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Institutions <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note>. Our purpose is to magnifie <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but with that liberty, which He, in love of Truth, indulged to himself towards his own Masters. Histories have a two-fold use, as to our Argument: For they supply us with Examples, and with Sentences. The Examples have so much the more authority as the times and Nations are more vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: therefore we have preferred the old Greek and Roman above the rest. Nor are the Sentences or Judgements of Historians to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, especially when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing: for the Law of Nature, as we have said, is in some sort proved thence; and the Law of Nations cannot be proved otherwise. Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Poets and Orators have not so much solidity: and we
<pb facs="tcp:96775:24"/>
use them oft, not so much for proof as ornament.</p>
                  <p>I do often use the Authority of the Books either written or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Men inspir'd of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a difference 'twixt the old Law and the new. Some do urge the <hi>Old Law</hi> for the very Law of Nature: erroneously, no doubt: for many things in that proceed from the free will and pleasure of God, which yet never is contrary to the true Law of Nature: and so far is an argument rightly drawn thence, while we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish accurately the Right of God which God sometimes executes by Men, and the Right of Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves. We have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to our power, avoyded both this errour, and another opposite to it, that thinks there is no use of the Old Covenant, since the times of the New. Our judgement is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, both upon that ground now mentioned, and because such is the nature of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> that the things pertaining to virtue and good manners, commanded in the
<pb facs="tcp:96775:24"/>
Old, 'the same, or greater, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the New: And we see the Antient Christian Writers have used the testimonies of the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in thé same way. But, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the meaning of the Books belonging to the Old Covenant, no little light may be borrowed from the <hi>Hebrew Writers</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ira sentit Cassianus, Instit. divin. Scriptur.</note>, those espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially who throughly knew the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and the Manners of their own Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>New Covenant</hi> I use to this end, that I may teach, what cannot be learned elswhere, what is lawfull for Christians: which yet, contrary to the opinion of many men, I have distinguisht from the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; being assured, greater Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is commanded us in that most Holy Law, than the Law of Nature exacteth by it self alone. Yet have I not forgotten to observe, what is rather commended to us than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that we may know, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and penal to decline from the precepts; to aspire unto the highest perfection, is the part of a generous
<pb facs="tcp:96775:25"/>
mind, and shall not go without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Synodical Canons,</hi> which are right, are Collections out of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral sentences of the Law Divine, fitted unto the present Occurrences. These also either shew what the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law commandeth, or exhort to that which God perswades. And this is the office of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, to deliver those things which are delivered to Her from God, and after the same manner wherein they are deliver'd. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the <hi>Customs</hi> among those old Christians, who filled up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of so great a name, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or praised, justly have the force of Canons. Next to these is their Authority, who flourished among the Christians in several Ages, Men renowned for their Piety and Learning, and noted for no grievous Errour. For, what these men say with great asseveration, as certain, ought to have no small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for interpretation of things that seem obscure in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: and the more, by how much
<pb facs="tcp:96775:25"/>
greater is their Consent, and nearer access to the times of the first pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when neither domination as yet, nor any Faction, could adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate the Primitive Truth. The <hi>School-men,</hi> that succeeded the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> often shew what good Wits they had: but they fell into unhappy times, and ignorant of good Arts: the less cause we have to wonder, if, among many things to be prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they have some things to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Yet, when they agree in matter of morality, they seldome erre: having very clear eyes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what was awry in the Sayings of other men. Nevertheless, in this contentious study, they give us a commendable pattern of Modesty, opposing one another with Reasons, not (which is a fashion of late times risen up to the disgrace of Learning) with reproaches, the unhansome issue of an impotent and unruly mind.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman Lawyers</hi> are of three sorts. <hi>First</hi> are they whose labours appear in the Pandect, the Codes of
<pb facs="tcp:96775:26"/>
                     <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Justinian,</hi> and in the Novel Constitutions. The <hi>second</hi> rank are they that succeeded <hi>Irnrius,</hi> viz. <hi>Accursius, Bartolus,</hi> and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of names more, that a long time reigned in the Court. In the <hi>third</hi> place we have those, who joyned polite Learning with the study of Law. To the <hi>first</hi> I owe much: for they do both often afford excellent reasons, to demonstrate that which is of the Law of Nature; and often yield testimony to the same Law, and no less to the Law of Nations: But thus, that they, as well as others, often confound these names; yea, and call that the Law of Nations, which is onely of some people; and that, not as on Agreement, but, which some have receiv'd by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of others, or by chance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they often handle what is truly of the Law of Nations, promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and indistinctly, with those things which are of the Roman Law, as appears by the Title, <hi>De Captivis &amp; postliminio.</hi> That these things therefore might be discerned, we
<pb facs="tcp:96775:26"/>
have taken some pains. The <hi>second</hi> sort, incurious of Divine Law, and of antient Historie, was pleased to define all the Controversies of Kings and Nations out of the Roman Laws, assuming now and then the Canons. But these men also, by the infelicity of their times, were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from a right insight into those Laws, being otherwise subtil enough to search into the nature of Right and Good: whence it comes, that they are often very good Authors of Law to be made, even when they are bad Interpreters of Law made before. But then chiefly are they to be heard, when they bear witness to such a Custom that makes the Law of Nations of our times. The Masters of the <hi>third</hi> order, who confine themselves to the Roman Laws, and expatiate, either never, or very lightly, into that which is Common, have scarce any use in our Argument. Two Spaniards, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varruvias</hi> and <hi>Vasquius</hi> (the latter with great liberty, the other more modestly, and not without exact
<pb facs="tcp:96775:27"/>
judgement) have joyned Scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal subtilty with their skill in the Laws and Canons, not abstaining from the Controversies of Nations and of Kings. The French have been more studious to insert Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the same profession of the Laws: amongst whom, <hi>Bodin</hi> and <hi>Hottoman</hi> are of great name, the former in a continued Work, the latter in scatter'd Questions: whose determinations and reasons will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten furnish us with matter to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>In the whole Work I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to my self three things; to make the reasons of defining most evident, to dispose in a certain order the matters to be handled, and to distinguish perspicuously the things which seemed to be the same, and were not. I have abstained from things that are not of this Treatise, as, those that shew what is usefull to be done: because they have their special consideration in the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> handles so ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously and distinctly, as to mingle
<pb facs="tcp:96775:27"/>
nothing that is impertinent, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than <hi>Bodin</hi> hath done, in whom this Art is confounded with the Art of our Law. Notwithstanding, in some places I have mention'd what is <hi>profitable,</hi> but on the by, and that I might distinguish it more plainly from the question of <hi>just.</hi> He will do me injury, that thinks I had an eye upon any Controversies of our Age, either already up, or like to rise. For I profess sincerely, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians consider Figures ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract from Bodies, so have I in treating of Right, elevated my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations above all particular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As to the stile and manner of speech, I was not willing, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a multitude of words to the multitude of matter, to cloy my Reader, whose Good I intended. I have therefore followed, as near as I could, a concise and plain way of expression convenient to a Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: that such as have a hand in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs may here behold, as in one view, both what Controversies are usually incident, and what are
<pb facs="tcp:96775:28"/>
the Principles whereby they may be judged: which being known, it will not be difficult to accommodate that which is said to the subject matter, and to extend it as much as you will. I have sometimes alleged the very words of antient Writers, where they were such, that they might seem spoken with authority, or with a singular grace: which I have done in the Greek too now and then, but especially where either the sentence was short, or whose Elegancy I could not hope to equal by my translation.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; the Liberty I have taken to my self in judging the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Writing of other men, let All, I humbly intreat them, into whose hands this Book shall come, take the same to themselves upon me. They shall not more readily admonish me of any errour, than I will obey their admonition. And at this instant, if here be any thing spoken by me diffentaneous to piety, or good manners, or holy Scripture; if any thing against the
<pb facs="tcp:96775:28"/>
Consent of the Christian Church, or against any Truth, with all my heart I wish it never spoken.</p>

By which note, this Law differs not from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane only, but from the Divine vo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; which doth not command or forbid what is by it self and in its own nature, due or unlawfull; but by forbidding makes the thing unlawfull, and by commanding makes it due. For the better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Natural Law, we must observe, some things belong unto it not properly, but reduct vely, <hi>viz.</hi> the things whereto the Law Natural is not repugnant: So are things called just, which are without in justice. Sometimes also by abuse of the word, the things which Reason alloweth for honest and better than the opposite, although they be not due and necessary, are said to be of the Law Natural. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve farther, this Law is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about things not subject to human pleasure, but about many things also which are consequent to the Acts of Mans Will. So the Will of Man introduc'd Dominion, such as is now in use: But, that being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, the law of <note n="*" place="margin">Furtum natura turpe <hi>Ulpian.</hi> Nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que odit iose vim Deus: nec</note> Nature tells me 'tis wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes for me to take away, without thy

                           </note> Moreover the Law of Nature is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: yet somtimes it comes to pass that in the Acts determined by that Law, a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming mutation deceivs the unwary; when in truth the Law of Nature is the same, but the matter about which it is, is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For example, If my Creditor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the debt I owe him as received, I am not bound to pay: The reason is not, because the Law of Nature is become more indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>gent, &amp; requires me not to pay what I owe; But because by the indulgence of my Creditor the debt is forgiven me. So if God command a person to be slain, or his Goods to be taken away, it will not follow that Man-slaughter or Theft is lawfull; which words include a Vice; but the act is not Manslaughter or Theft which is done at his command who is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord of our Lives and Goods.

                        <p>VOluntary Law Divine (as the words at first sound inform us) is that which hath its rise from the will of God; whereby it is distinguished from Natural Law, that may be also, as we have said, entituled Divine. Here hath place that indistinct <note n="*" place="margin">Anaxarchi apud Plut. in Alex.</note> saying: <hi>God wills it not, because 'tis just; but 'tis just,</hi> (i. e. due in Law) <hi>because God wills it.</hi> This Law was given either to mankind,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96775:44"/>
or to one people; thrice to mankind; presently after the creation, again in the restauration after the floud, lastly in that more sublime restauration by Christ. All these Laws doubtless oblige all men, after they have sufficient notice of them.</p>

                        <p>NOw, seeing the Law given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> cannot induce upon us a direct obligation, as we have shewed; let us see what other use it may have, both in this of War, and other the like questions. To know this is very usefull to many purposes. First then, the Hebrew Law doth manifest, that which is commanded in that Law not to be against the Law of Nature. For, the Law of Nature, as we have said, being perpetual and immutable, it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth not with the justice of God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing contrary unto it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is called pure and right by the Psalmist; and, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96775:45"/>
precepts; for, of the permissions we must speak more distinctly. Legall permission (for that which is meerly of fact, and signifies removal of the impediment, is not pertinent here) either is plenary, which gives a right to do a thing law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; or less than plenary, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives impunity among men, and a right that no other can lawfully hinder the doer, From the former permission, as from a pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>cept, it follows, that the thing permitted is not against the Law of Nature: not, from the later. But this consequence seldom is of use: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the permitting words being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, we must rather, by the Law of Nature, interpret what kind of permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is meant, than from such a kind of permission prove it to be the Law of Nature. Our second observation is, That it is now lawfull for Christian Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to make Laws of the same sense, with the Laws given by <hi>Moses:</hi> unless the whole substance of any Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the time of Christ exspected, and of the Gospel not yet revealed; or, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Christ himself, either in general or in special, hath ordained the contrary. For, no other reason can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, why any of <hi>Moses</hi> constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can be now unlawfull. A third observation's this: Whatsoever pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the vertues Christ requires of his Disciples, is given in precept by <hi>Moses,</hi>
                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96775:46"/>
the same is now also, if not more, to be perform'd by Christians. The ground of this observation is, that the vertues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of Christians, as Humility, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Love, are requir'd in a greater degree <note n="*" place="margin">

And justly, because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the heavenly promises are much more clearly proposed in the Gospel. Hence, in comparison of the Gospel, is the old Law said to have been neither perfect nor faultless; and Christ is call'd the end of the Law; and the Law a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master to bring us unto Christ. So, that old Law of the Sabbath, and that other of Tithes <note n="*" place="margin">V Iren. l. 4. c. 34. &amp; Chrys. ad Eph. 11. 10.</note> do shew, that Christians are oblig'd to separate no less than a seventh part of their time for Gods service; nor less than a tenth of their fruits, for the maintenance of his Ministers, and the like pious uses.</p>

                           <hi>XII.</hi> That War is not contrary to the voluntary Divine Law, before the time of the Gospell.</head>
                        <p>THe greatest difficulty lies in this point, concerning the positive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law. Nor may any object, the Law of Nature is immutable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing could be constituted by God to the contrary; for this is true in things commanded or forbidden by the Law of Nature; not in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted only: which things, being not properly of the Law of Nature but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, may be either forbidden or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. First then, against VVar is brought by some that Law given to <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and his posterity: <hi>And surely</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 5, 6.</note> God) <hi>Your blood of your lives will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, at the hand of every mans Brother will I require the life of man. Who so sheddeth mans bloud, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.</hi> Here do some most generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that which is said of <hi>requiring blood:</hi> and what is said of <hi>shedding blood for blood,</hi> they will have to be a commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not an approbation. I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of neither; for the prohibition, <hi>not to shed blood,</hi> is not of larger extent than that in the Law, <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi>
                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:96775:49"/>
and this, 'tis manifest, hath neither ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away capitall punishments nor VVars. VVherefore, both this Law and that doth not so much constitute any new thing, as declare and repeat the old naturall Law obliterated and depraved by evill custom. And the words are to be understood in a sense which includes a crime: as in the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We have no mean Author to countenance our interpretation. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who being not ignorant of the Law given to <hi>Noah,</hi> took arms against the four Kings, not doubting but his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was very reconcilable with that Law.

with in this. Moreover, capitall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, it appears, were used not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst man-slayers only, but other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors; <note place="margin">Gen. 38. 24.</note> and that as well among the holy people as other nations. By the aid of naturall reason, having some ground to make conjecture of the divine will, they proceeded from like to like, and collected, that the constitution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the man-slayer, might extend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to other notorious and great offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. For, some things there are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall unto life, as reputation, virginall chastity, conjugall fidelity; or without which life cannot be secure, as reverence to authority, whereby society is preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Offenders against these seem no better than man-slayers. Hither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an old tradition extant among the Hebrews, that more Laws were given unto <hi>Noah's</hi> Sons by God, but <hi>Moses</hi> did not relate them all, because it was sufficient for his purpose, that they were after comprehended in the peculiar Law of the Hebrews; so, against incestuous Marriage, there was extant an old Law, though not remembred by <hi>Moses</hi> in its place, as appears <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. And among the Laws God gave to <hi>Noah's</hi> children, this also they say was decreed, that not only homicides, but adulteries, incests and rapes should be punished with death; which is confirmed by the words of <hi>Job.</hi> Also, the Law given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>

How so? The Apostle sheweth in another place: <hi>He is the Minister of God to thee for good, but if thou do that which is evill, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill.</hi> By the right of the sword is understood all coercive power (as in the Lawyers sometimes) yet so, that the highest part of it, which is the true use of the sword, is not excluded. For the illustration of this place much light may be had from the second <hi>Psalm:</hi> which, although it were verified of <hi>David,</hi> yet more fully and perfectly pertains to Christ, as we learn out of the <hi>Acts</hi> and <note place="margin">Acts 4. 25. 13. 33.

                           <hi>XV.</hi> The second Argument.</head>
                        <p>A Second Argument is deliver'd us by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the place cited al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in some part, out of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> where the highest power, <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> such as the regall is, is said to be of God, and is called the ordinance of God: whence it is inferr'd, that obedience and honour is to be given to it, and that from the heart: and he that resisteth it, resisteth God. If by <hi>Ordinance</hi> a thing were to be understood, which God only will not hinder, as in vicious acts, then would there follow thence no obligation either of honour or obedience, especially laid upon the conscience: nor would the Apostle say any thing, where he so much extols and commends this power, which might not agree to robbing and stealing. It follows therefore, that this power be conceiv'd to be ordained by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96775:54"/>
the will of God <hi>approoving</hi> it: whence it further follows, that, seeing God wills not contraries, this power is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the will of God revealed by the Gospel, and ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>iging all men. Nor is this Argument avovded, because the persons that were in power when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, are said to have been enemies to Christian piety: For first, that is not true of all. <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> Propraetor <note place="margin">Acts 13. 2.</note> of <hi>Cyprus</hi> had given his name to Christ before this time: to say nothing of the King of <note n="*" place="margin">Est Edessa in Osroene No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Abea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <hi>Edessa,</hi> of whom there is an old tradition, grounded (as it seems) on truth, though perhaps a little mixed with fables. Moreover, the question is not of the persons, whether they were impious; but whether that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in them were impious: we say, the Apostle denys that, when he saith, the function, even for that time, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, and therefore to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, even within the recesses and secrets of the heart where God alone hath Empire. Wherefore both <hi>Nero</hi> might, and that King <hi>Agrippa</hi> too, whom <hi>Paul</hi> so seriously invites to his <note place="margin">Acts 26.</note> Religion, might subject himself to Christ, and retain, the one his regal, the other his imperial power: a power, which without the right of the Sword and of Arms cannot be understood. As then of old, the Sacrifices according to the Law were pious, although administred by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96775:54"/>
impious Priests; so Empire is a pious thing <note n="*" place="margin">Bene hoc ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequitur ad hunc locum E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Rom. <hi>Chrysostomus.</hi>

                        <p>THe third Argument is from the words of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, who being seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously asked by the Jewish Souldiers (many thousands of that Nation served the Romans in their Wars, as <hi>Josephus</hi> and other writers cleerly tell us:) what they should do, to avoid the wrath of God, He answered not, that they should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake VVar (as he must have answered, if that be the will of God) but <hi>abstain from violence and falshood, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their wages.</hi> To these words <note place="margin">Luke 3. 14.</note> of the Baptist, containing an approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of VVar plain enough, many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, The Baptists prescripts are so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the precepts of Christ, that we may conceive their Doctrine not to be the same.

Now, it being proved, that capital punishments are rightly used since the comming of Christ, it is withall proved, as I suppose, that some War may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully waged, to wit, against a multitude of armed offenders, who must be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in battail, before they can be brought to judgement.

And here, on the by, we must note their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who draw the Israelites right to War, from this alone, that God had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them the Canaanites Land.

But Christ, a Teacher of more patience, is so <note place="margin">Si membrum vupit, talio esto.</note> far from approving that ardent desire of revenge in the person wronged, that he would not have some kind of injuries to be repelled, either by force, or Law. What injuries? Such as are tolerable; not, that patience is not laudable in the more <note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

Wherefore, the same words or the like precepts, though of larger extent, are not now neither to be forced to such a sense: the less, because the division of Chapters is not from the Apostles, nor their age, but of much later time, for the more distinct reading, and easy allegation of the text. So, the beginning of the 13. to the <hi>Romans, Let every Soul be subject to the higher powers,</hi> and that which follows, was continued with those fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going precepts against revenge. Now, in this dissertation <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like powers are Ministers of God, to execute wrath <hi>(i. e.</hi> punishment) upon them that do evil: therein most plainly distinguishing between vengeance for the publike good (which is administred
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96775:64"/>
in behalf of God, and is to be referred to the vengeance reserved to God;) and that revenge for private satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he forbad in the former words. For, if you will have that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance also which is expected for the publike good, comprehended in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interdict, what will be more absurd, than for the Apostle, when he had said we must abstain from capital judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, presently to adde, The publike powers are ordained of God for this end, to exact punishments in his stead?</p>

upon the incestuous Corinthian, upon <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> This pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he saith, is not carnal, that is, weak: yea on the contrary, he asserteth it to be most mighty. What is this to the right of capital punishments, or of War? Yea, on our side, because the Church at that time was destitute of ayd from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick powers, Therfore had God raised up, for her defense, that prodigious power, which began afterward to fail about the time when Christian Emperours were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Church, even as Manna ceased, when the Hebrew people were come into the fruitful Land.

                        <p>WHen the question is about the sense of a writing, both the following practice, and the authority of wise men is wont to have much value. This is a good rule in the interpretation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture. For it is not probable, that the Churches founded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96775:65"/>
did either suddainly, or all of them depart from those things, which the Apostles having briefly written, had explained more largely by word of mouth, or also introduced into the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and use of Christians. Now, our opponents that fight against Wars, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually draw out unto their aid, some speeches of the antient Christians: to which I have three things to say. The first is this: No more can be collected out of those speeches, than the private opinion of the speakers, not the publick judgement of the Churches. It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to be noted, that the Authors of those sayings love to go single, for the most part, and to teach somewhat of a higher strain, than others; namely, <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian;</hi> who yet are not very constant to themselves. For the same <hi>Origen</hi> saith, God hath given us a lesson in the Bees, <hi>That just and orderly Wars may be waged amongst men, if necessity require.</hi> And the same <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> saith, <hi>That it is good when Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders are punished no man denies</hi>

                        <p>OUr second Observation is, That the Christians have either disallowed or avoided serving in the Wars, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of circumstances and condition of the times, which would scarce permit Military orders to be executed without some acts repugnant to the Christian Law. In the Letters of <hi>Dolabella</hi> to the Ephesians, extant in <hi>Josephus,</hi> we see the Jews requested immunity from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions of War; because in such a mixture with strangers, they were not able to keep their legal rites with due observance: and because they were constreined to carry Arms, and make long marches upon the Sabbath dayes. For which causes, they obteined a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from <hi>L. Lentulus,</hi> as the same <hi>Josephus</hi> sheweth. He declares in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, that when the Jews were commanded to depart the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> some of them were listed, others puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for their refusal out of a reverence toward their own Country-Laws; for those reasons which we have mentioned: unto which sometimes a third was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, because they had a necessity impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on them to fight against their own Country men.

                        <p>FRom the former testimonies it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, what opinion the community of Christians had of War, even before the Emperours were Christian. If, in those times, the Christians were not willingly present at capital punishments, it may not seem a wonder, when for the most part Christians were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons condemned. Adde hereunto, that in other matters also, the Roman Laws were harder than Christian lenity would suffer, as appears sufficiently, though we instance only in the <note n="*" place="margin">Cujus aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

But in them all must be observed the sincerity and measure of their repentance. For, they that by fear, and tears, and patience, and good works do shew their conversion to be without hyprocrisy, after they have fulfilled their appointed time of hearing, shall be admitted to the prayers of the Church, and afterward the Bishop may entertain some favourable thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them.

But haply some may think it now unlawful, since the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of publick Courts of Justiee; for although these Courts be not from nature, but from humane Ordinance,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96775:73"/>
yet seeing it is much more honest and becomming, and more conducible to mans quietness, that the matter should be tryed before an indifferent Judge, than that the parties themselves inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed, who too often favour themselves overmuch, should execute what they think right, by force; equity and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason dictate to us, that it is our duty to observe so laudable an Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer saith: <hi>It is not to be granted to the parties to do that which may be done publickly by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,</hi>

That we have said, all private War is not repugnant to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral right, even since the constitution of Courts of Justice, may also be made apparent from the Law given the Jews. where God speaks thus by <hi>Moses.

That God, who hath more right over our lives than we have our selves, might have required of us so much patience, as to lay down our lives, and, when we are brought in danger by the assault of a private person, rather choose to be killed than to kill, I do not doubt.

But thus it may be answered: He that is inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hath oftentimes himself also need of time to repent, or hath some reason to think so; and that the assailant too may possibly find some space for repentance before his death. Besides, in a moral judgement, that peril seemeth not fit to be regarded, into which a man casts himself, and from which he may free himself, if he will.

                        <p>PUblick VVar is either <hi>Solemn</hi> by the Law of Nations, or <hi>less Solemn.</hi> What I here call solemn is commonly called <hi>just,</hi> in the same sense as a just Testament is opposed to Codicils <note n="*" place="margin">Ita inter cives erant quaedam matrimonia non justa, non justi liberi. Paul. sent. l. 2. t. 19. Sic &amp; libertas quaedam non justa. Sen. de vit. bea. c. 24.</note>: not that it is not lawful for him that pleaseth to make Codicils, but because a solemn Testament hath, by the Civil Law, some peculiar effects. This is worth our observation, seeing many misunderstanding the word <hi>just,</hi> conceive all VVars to be condemned as unjust and unlawful, whereunto this appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of just is not agreeable. That VVar, according to the Law of Nations, may be solemn, two things are requisite: first, that it be waged on both sides by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96775:78"/>
his authority who hath the highest pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Common-wealth: Secondly, that certain rites be used, of which we shall speak in due place. One of these, because they are both required, without the other, doth not suffice. Publick War less solemn, may want those rites, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And truly, if the matter be considered without civil Laws, it seemeth that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Magistrate hath right to wage War, as for defense of the people committed to his charge, so for the exercise of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, if he be opposed by force.

Let us now see, in what subject this highest power is. There is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> subject, and a <hi>proper</hi> subject: as the common subject of <hi>sight</hi> is the body, the proper is the eye; so the common subject of the highest Power is a <hi>City,</hi> that is, a perfect society. We exclude therefore people or Countries that have yielded up themselves, or fallen to the dominion of another people, such as were the Provinces of the Romans: for these are not by themselves a City, as now we take the word, but less wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy members of some great City, as servants are members of the family. Again it comes to pass, that several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Countries have one and the same <hi>head,</hi> which do nevertheless every one make up a perfect society by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for it is not in the <hi>moral</hi> body as in the <hi>natural;</hi> in the natural, <hi>one</hi> cannot be the head of several bodies; but in the moral, the same person, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a divers relation, may be the head of bodies many and distinct.

not yours. You as subjects ought to obey, I must consider what is fit to be done.</hi> Besides, the Assumption is not true, that all Kings are constituted by the people: which may be sufficiently understood by the examples of a Father of a family admitting Tenants on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of obedience, and of Nations o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome in War, which above are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Another Argument they draw out of that sentence of Philosophers; <hi>All Government is for the benefit of them that are govern'd, not of them that do govern:</hi> Whence they think it follows from the Nobilitie of the end, that the Governed are superiour to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.

So, certain Empires may have for their end the utility of the Kings; namely, such as are gotten by conquest, and are not therefore to be called Tyrannical, seeing <hi>Tyranny,</hi> as the word is now taken, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes injustice.

And yet, it doth not follow thence, what they infer, that the people are superiour to the King; for tutelage also was found out for the Pupils good, yet is tuition a right and power over the Pupil. Nor is the objection of any moment, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I confess, by this means the Empire is in some sort streightned, whether the obligation ly upon the exercise of the act only, or also directly upon the faculty it self. In the first way, the act done against promise will be unjust: because, as we shew elsewhere, a true promise gives hima right, to whom 'tis made: and in the other way, it will be null by want of faculty. Nor yet doth it thence follow, that he that makes the promise hath any superiour: for, in this case, the act is rendred null, not by superiour force but in Law.

So when the Roman Empire was one, it often came to pass, that one Ruler had the East, another the West, or that three divided the world between them. And so it may be, that a people choosing a King may reserve some acts to themselves, and may commit others to the King with full right. Yet is not that done, as we have shewed already, whensoever the King is bound up with certain promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but then we must conceive it to be done, if either a partition be made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly <note n="†" place="margin">Ita Probi tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Senatus firmabat prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipum leges, de appellationibus cognoscebat, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consules creabat, legatos consuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus dabat.

Parity therefore at least follows from coaction, and so a division of the supremacy. Against such a State, as being double headed, many allege many incommodities: but (as we have also said above) in civil affairs there is nothing wholy without incommodities; and Right is to be measured, not by that which seems best to you or me, but by the will of him whence right ariseth.

                        <p>TO many it seems a more difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion concerning feudal obligation, but it may easily be solved out of that which hath been said. For in this contract,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96775:106"/>
(which is proper to the <hi>German</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor is any where found but where the <hi>Germans</hi> have seated themselves) two things are to be considered, Personal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and Right over the thing. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal obligation is the same, whether one by feudal right possess the right it self of Governing, or any other thing also placed else where. Now, such an Obligation, as it would not take away from a private man the right of personal liberty, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it take away from a King or people the right of the highest power, which is civil liberty. Which is most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently to be seen in the free feuds which they call <hi>Franca,</hi> which consist not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny right over the thing, but in personal obligation onely. For these are nothing but a kind of unequal league, (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have spoken) wherein the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty promiseth aid and service, the other safeguard &amp; protection. Suppose also that aid was promised against All, which Feud they now call <hi>Ligium</hi> (for that word was of larger signification) this detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth nothing from the right of the highest power over subjects: not to mention now that there is alwayes a tacit condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while the war is just, of which els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But, as to the right over the thing, truly it is such, that the right it self of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, if it be holden in Fee, may be lost, either the family being extinct, or also for some sort of crimes. Yet in the mean it ceaseth not to be highest: for we
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96775:107"/>
must distinguish (as hath been said) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the thing it self, and the manner of having it. And by such a right I see many Kings constituted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> so, that the royal family exspiring, the Empire should return to themselves: which is noted by <hi>Strabo</hi> concerning <note place="margin">Lib. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>Paphlagonia</hi> and some other.</p>

For as an Infant King hath right, but cannot exercise his power; so also one of an alienated mind, and in captivity, and that lives in the territory of another, so that freedome of action about his distant Empire is not permitted him: for in all these cases Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Vicegerents are to be given.

                        <p>WAr may be waged, both by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men against private, as by a traveller against a robber; and by those that have the highest power against those that have it likewise, as by <hi>David</hi> against the King of the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> and by private men against those that have the highest power, but not over them, as by <hi>Abraham</hi> against the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> and his neighbors; and by those that have the highest power over private men, either subject to them, as by <hi>David</hi> upon the part of <hi>Isboseth;</hi> or not subject, as by the <hi>Romans</hi> against the pirats. Only the question is, whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for private or for publique persons to make war upon them, under whose power, whether supreme or subordinate, they are. And first, that is beyond all controversy, Armes may be taken against inferiors by those who are armed by authority of the Highest power: as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias</hi> was armed by the Edict of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxers</hi> against the neighboring Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. So the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors grant <note place="margin">L. votu mc. de Metatorib. l. 12.</note> leave to the Lord of the soil to force away the Camp-measurers. But it is inquir'd, what is lawful against the Highest Power, or the Lower Powers doing what they
<pb facs="tcp:96775:108"/>
doe by authority of the Highest. That's without controversy amongst all good men; If they command any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to naturall right or to the divine precepts, what they command is not to be done. For the Apostles, when they said, we must obey God rather than men, appealed to a most certain rule, written in all mens minds, which you may finde almost in the same words in <hi>Plato:</hi> but if for any such cause, or otherwise because it is the pleasure of the Soveraign, injury be offerd us, it is to be sufferd with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, rather than resisted by force.</p>

He addes two reasons: <hi>First,</hi> because God hath approved that order of ruling and obeying, both of old in the Hebrew Law, and now in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell; wherefore the publique powers are to be so esteemed by us, as constituted by God himself.

I desire to explain this by a noble passage in <hi>Dio Cassius: Truly I think it not becoming, that the Ruler of a City should give place to his subjects, nor is there hope of safety if they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whose duty is to obey. For consider, what order will be in a family if the elder be despised by the yonger; What method in a school, if the learners care not for the teachers; how can the sick recover their health, if they will not in all things be obedient to their Physicians; how can Seamen escape danger, if the Saylors will not hearken to the commands of their Masters. For by nature it is necessary and safe for men, that some should govern, and some be subject.</hi>

Howbeit, if at any time any thing was done by force against the Kings, it is related for testimony of divine providence permitting it, not for approbation of humane fact. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the contrary opinion are wont to object a saying of <hi>Trajan,</hi> when he gave a sword to the Praetorion Prefect; <note n="*" place="margin">Hoc pro me utere, si recte impero; si male, contra me.</note>

And these, if they were asked, whether their will was to impose upon all this burden, to dy rather than in any case to repell by force the force of their superiours, I know not whether they would answer, it was their will, unless perhaps with this additament; if resistance cannot be made without very great perturbation of the Commonwealth, or the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of very many innocent persons.

Certainly, where Superiours threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Christians with death for religion sake, Christ gives them leave to fly; them I mean whom necessary office binds not to any place: beside flight he permits nothing, And <hi>Peter</hi> saith, Christ, when he suffered, left us an example to follow; <hi>Who did no sin, neither was guile found</hi>

Wherefore, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the antient Christians, who, coming fresh from the disciplin of the Apostles and Apostolical men, did more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both understand and obey their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, are very much injur'd by them, who think the reason why they defended not themselves in most certain perill of death, was, because they wanted

For such an act, if a Kingdom be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by election or by successory law, is null: and therefore can have no effect of right. Whence also, concerning an Usufructuary, to whom we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared such a King, it seemes to me the truer opinion of Lawyers, that, if he <note place="margin">Instit. de usus. §. fruitur. L. Usufr. D. de jure dotium.</note> yield his right to an extraneous person, his act is nothing. And, as to that, that the usufruit reverts to the Lord of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, it is to be understood, <hi>in due time.</hi> But, if a King really attempt even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up, or subject his Kingdom, I doubt not, he may be herein resisted. For, as we have distinguished afore, the Empire is different from the manner of holding it: which manner, the people may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from being changed; for that is not comprehended under the Empire.

                        <p>TO this question we frame this answer. First, if the Invador, by unjust war, and such as hath not the requisits accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of Nations, hath seised on the government; nor hath there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any agreement, or faith given him, but his possession is kept onely by force; in this case. the right of war seemeth to remain, and therefore it is lawfull to act against him as against an enemy, that may lawfully be slain by any, even by a private man. <hi>Against Traitors,</hi> said Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, <note place="margin">

                           <hi>and publick enemies, every man's a souldier.</hi> So also, against desertors of the war that run from their colours, all persons, for the common quiet, have a right indulged to them to execute publick revenge. And I am of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s <note n="*" place="margin">Qui ita sentit ib. de sato ad Pisonem.</note> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the same is lawfull, if, before the invasion, a publick Law were extant, giving power to every one to kill him, that shall adventure to do this or that,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96775:123"/>
which falls under sight; as, that being a private man shall get a guard about him, or shall invade the Fort; that shall slay a Citizen uncondemned, or not by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full judgment; that shall create magistrats without just suffrages.

For, as dominions, so also Empires are not lost by delinquency, unless the Law ordain it. But, no where is found a Law ordaining this concerning Empires, that they should be lost by an offence against a private man; nor will ever such a Law be found, as I believe; for it would bring
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96775:132"/>
in very great confusion of things. As to that foundation which <hi>Vasquez</hi> lays for this and many other Conclusions, That al Empires regard the utility of those that obey, not of those that governe; grant it were universally true, it would not serve the turne: for the thing doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fail, whose utility in some part faileth. And whereas he adds, that the safety of the Commonwealth is desired by every one for his own sake, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one ought to prefer his own safety even before the whole; this doth not sufficiently cohere. Tis true indeed, for our own sake we would have the Commonwealth be safe: but not onely for our own sake; others are: also to be regarded.

otherwise I cannot keep off that evill from me. Charity also, by it self, seems not to bind us here, in favour of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender. But the Evangelicall Law hath clearly made such a deed unlawfull. For, Christ commands a blow to be received rather than any hurt be done the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; how much more forbids he him to be slain for to avoid a blow? By which example we are admonished to beware of that saying of <hi>Covarruvias,</hi> Humane <note place="margin">Covar. p. 3. sect. 1. de Homicid.</note> understanding, not ignorant of naturall right, allows not any thing to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by naturall reason, which very thing is not also permitted by God, who is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self. For, God who is the Author of Nature, so, that he can also work freely above nature, hath a right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing us Laws even of those things, which by their own nature are free and indefinite: and much more, that a thing may be due, which is by nature honest, though not due. But it is strange, seeing the will of God appears so manifestly in the Gospel, that there are found Divines, and those Christian Divines, who do not <note place="margin">Navar. cap. 15. 4.

Nor is it materiall, if some men of a corrupt judgment traduce this vertue with names made for disgrace: for those perverse judgments neither change the thing, nor the estimation of it. Neither did the antient Christians onely see this, but the Philosophers too, who said, It is a token of a weak spirit not to be able to bear contumely, as we have shewed elsewhere. Hence also it is apparent, how unsound that is, which very many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <note n="*" place="margin">Dd. in l. ut vim.

Some <note n="†" place="margin">Lessius dub. 11. num. 68.</note> think this is it, that by night he cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned who comes, whether he be a Thief or a Murderer: and therefore may be killed as a Murderer. Others <note n="*" place="margin">Covarruv. d. loco.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the difference lyes here, that in the night, because the Theif is unknown, there is less possibility to recover the Goods. To me the Law-giver seems to have properly respected, neither this, nor that; but to have meant thus rather, that no man, for Goods, ought <hi>directly</hi> to be slain: (which would be done, if, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>example, I should with a weapon knock him down as he runs away, that after he is slain I might recover my Goods:) but if my self be brought into danger of life, then it is lawful for me to avert the danger, even with the peril of another mans life. Nor is it against me, that I brought my self into that hazard, whilst I desire to keep or to recover my Goods, or to take the Theif: for herein no blame can be laid on me, who am about a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful act, and do no injury to any one, but use my own right. The difference then 'twixt a Theif by day and by night lyes

here, that by night there is scarce at possibility of calling witnesses: and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There is then, as I have said, a presumption on his side who hath slain a <note place="margin">L. furtum.

Homicide. Add, that as well by day as by night the Law of the XII. Tables re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, that he that found the theif should testify so much by an out-cry (as we learn <note place="margin">L. Itaque.

Now because such a concourse is more easily made by day than by night, (as <hi>Ulpian</hi> notes upon the forecited place of <hi>Demosthenes)</hi> therefore is more easy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit given to him, that affirms, he was in danger in the night time. In like manner, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law allowes a maid credit concerning a rape in the field <note n="†" place="margin">
                              <hi>Philo</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it well: that the place is set for more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent example sake, not that thereby always the controversy may be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For it may come to pass, as he discourses in his book of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Laws, that a maid may be ravished in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, her mouth being stopt, and in the field one may consent to the act.</note>, and not in the town, because here she might and ought to have cryed out, and called aid. Moreover, although in other respects there were no difference, yet this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, that the things that happen in the night are more obscure, and cannot be so well known what and how great they are; and therefore are more terrible. The Law therefore, both <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> gave in precept to the people, that which Charity perswades, that they kill no man for this reason onely because he stealeth goods, but in case he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to save them, comes himself into danger. <hi>Moses Maimonides</hi> hath noted, that the killing of another is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any man on other terms, than to preserve that which is irreparable, as life and Chastity.</p>

                        <p>THat is in no wise to be allowed, which some have deliver'd, that by the Law of Nations, arms may be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken to abate a growing power, which being encreased might be able to do hurt. I confess, in consultation about war this is wont also to come in, not under the respect of just, but of profitable: that if the war be just upon some other ground, upon this it may be judged prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertaken. Nor do the Authors cited <note place="margin">Bald. lib. 3. de rer. divis.</note> here say any more. But, that a possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of suffering force should give a right of offring force, this is far from all equity. So is the life of man, that full security is never in our hand. Against uncertain fears, we must guard our selves by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of divine providence, and by harmless caution, not by doing violence to our neighbours.</p>

For, that fear of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain thing cannot give a right to use force: whence, neither hath a person ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of a crime, any right to resist by force the publick officers willing to apprehend him, for fear lest he may be punisht more than he deserves.

Withall we learn, how things went into propriety: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by act of the mind (for they could not know the thoughts of one another, what every one would have to be his own, that

                        <p>NOw let us see, what common right is competent to men over those things, which are made proper unto some. Which question, perhaps some may wonder at, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propriety may seem to have swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up all that right, which arose from the common state of things. But it is not so. For, it must be considered, what was the mind of them, who first introduced singular dominions: which is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved such, as hath receded as little as might be from natural equity. For, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so written Laws are to be drawn, as far as they may, into that sense; much more are Customs, that are not bound up in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

                        <p>ANd verily, if the matter be such, and the words so conceived, that they be referred not to God alone, but to man, a right doubtless will be acquir'd by man out of the oath, as out of a promise or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which ought to be understood most

simply and plainly. But, if either the words do not respect man, by conferring upon him a right; or, if they do respect him, but there is somewhat which may be oppos'd against him; then, such will be the force of the oath, that indeed he can attain no right, yet nevertheless he that hath sworn is bound to God to stand to his oath. An example hereof is in him, who by unjust fear gave cause to a sworn promise <note n="†" place="margin">Austin teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that an oath extorted by force is also to be kept for the reverence of God. <hi>Epist.</hi> 124, 125. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 17. 12. 13. 15. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 29. 7.

For he attains no right, or such as he ought to render, upon this ground that he gave cause to the loss. So we see the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings, both reproved by the Prophets, and punished by God, because they kept not their faith sworn to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings. <hi>Cicero</hi> commends the <hi>Tribune Pomponius,</hi> who performed what being compell'd by terrour he had sworn. <hi>So much,</hi> saith he, <hi>in those times did an oath prevail.</hi> Wherefore it was not only the duty of <hi>Regulus</hi> to return to prison, how unjust soe'r it was; but of those ten also, whom <hi>Cicero</hi> mentions, to <note place="margin">Offic. 3.</note> return to <hi>Annibal:</hi> for they were obliged by their oath. <note place="margin">Tho. 2. 2. 89: art. 7. &amp; ibi Cajet.

                        <p>THe acts of Superiours cannot so far <note place="margin">August. epist. 240, 241.</note> prevail, that an oath, so far as it was truly obligatory, is not to be performed: for that is of naturall and divine right. But because our acts are not fully in our <note place="margin">Tho. 2. 1. qu. 89. art. 9.</note> own power, but so that they depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Superiours, therefore may there be a twofold act of Superiours about that which is sworn, the one directed upon the person of him that swears, the other upon the person to whom he swears. Upon the person of him that swears it may be directed, either before the oath is taken, by making such oath void, in as much as the right of the inferiour is conteind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the superiour; or after the oath is taken, by forbidding it to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96775:160"/>
For, an Inferiour, as Inferiour, could not bind himself, but so far as it should please his Superiour: for he had not more ample power. Thus, by the Hebrew Law, Husbands made void the Oaths of their Wives, Fathers of <note place="margin">C.

And upon this ground may be defended those absolutions of oaths, which of old <note n="*" place="margin">Sueton. Tib. 35. sic &amp; in Hispania diu usurpatum notat Ferdinand.

Upon the person of him to whom one swears, the act may be directed by taking away from him the right which he hath gotten, or also, if he have no right, by forbidding his emolument out of such an oath; and that two ways, either for his punishment, or for the publick good, by vertue of supereminent dominion. Hence also may be understood, if the party swearing be not of the same country with him to whom the oath is made, what his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96775:161"/>
or the others Rulers may do concerning it. But, he that hath sworn and promised something to a nocent person as such, namely, to a pirate, cannot therefore take away from him, in the way of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, the right which he hath gotten by the promise: because then the words would have no effect, which by all means is to be avoided.</p>

I gave my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they were bound no farther, than to punish, or yield the offenders if they could be found; and to take care, that legal reparation might be made out of the goods of the Robbers. For, they were not
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:96775:177"/>
the cause of the unjust spoil that was made, nor were partakers of it in any wise: yea, they forbad, by their Laws, any hurt to be done their friends. That they should require caution, they were obliged by no Law, seeing they might, even without letters, give all their sublects power to spoil the enemy: which was also done of old. Nor was such a permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion any cause, why damage was done to their friends, when even private men might without such permission send forth ships of war. Moreover, it could not be foreseen, whether they would prove evill men: and besides, it cannot be avoided, but we must imploy such, otherwise no Army can be raised.

And first we must consider of the persons of Embassadors, then of their Train and their Goods. Of their persons some think thus, that, by the Law of Nations, onely <hi>unjust</hi> force is kept from the bodyes of Embassadors; for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive priviledges are to be understood by Common right. Others think, force may not be offerd to an Embassador, for <hi>every</hi> cause, but on this ground, if the Law of Nations be broken by him; which is a very large ground: for, in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Law of Nature is included, so that the Embassador may now be punisht for all faults, except those which arise meerly out of the Civil Law. Others, restrain this to those Crimes which are
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96775:180"/>
done against the State of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or his Dignity, to whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador is sent. Which also some hold perillous, and would have complaint made to him that sent him, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador left to his Master's judgment. There are some too that say, the Kings or Nations <hi>unconcerned</hi> are to be consulted with: which indeed may be a point of prudence, cannot be of right. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which every one brings for his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion conclude nothing definitely: because this right, not, like <hi>natural</hi> right, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariseth out of certain reason, but is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the <hi>will</hi> of Nations. Now, it was in the power of Nations, either <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> to provide for the safety of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, or with certain <hi>exceptions;</hi> for on this side may be alleged the utility of punishing great offenders, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side the utility of Embassages, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility whereof is best promoted by secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them as much as may be. We must therefore see, how far Nations have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented; which cannot be evinced by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples only; for many are extant on both sides. Wherefore we must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course both unto the judgments of wise men, and unto conjectures.

                           <hi>Rome on the publick faith, is made guilty rather according to rules of equity, than by the Law of Nations.</hi> Equity, that is, the meer Law of Nature suffers punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be exacted, where is found a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent; but the Law of Nations excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Embassadors and such like, who come upon publick faith. Wherefore, that Embassadors be made guilty, is against the Law of <hi>Nations,</hi> whereby many things are wont to be prohibited, which, by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> are permitted, Conjecture also goes on this side; for it is more true, that <hi>privileges</hi> should be so understood, that they may give somewhat beyond <hi>Common</hi> right. Now, if Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors be only secur'd from <hi>unjust</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, therein were no great matter, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of preeminence. Add, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Embassadors outweighs the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity arising from punishment. For pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment may be taken by him, that sent the Embassador, being <hi>willing:</hi> and if
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96775:181"/>
he be <hi>unwilling,</hi> it may by man be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of him, as an approver of the crime. Some object, better one be punisht than many involv'd in war. But, if he that sent the Embassador approve his deed, the Embassadors punishment will not free us from the war. Now on the other side, the safety of Embassadors is in a slippry place, if they ought to render a reason of their actions to any other, but him by whom they are sent. For, when the Counsells of them that send and receive Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors are for the most part divers, often contrary, it can scarce happen but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways somewhat may be said against an Embassador, that may bear a <hi>shew</hi> of a crime. And though some are so manifest, that they have no doubt, yet is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral danger sufficient for the equity and utility of a general Law. Wherefore my opinion clearly is, that it pleas'd the Nations, that the Common custom, which subjecteth every one being in a strange land to the Law of that land, should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an exception in Embassadors, 1. That, as they are accounted, by a certain ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the persons of their Masters <hi>(He brought with him a face of the Senate, the authority of the Commonwealth,</hi> saith <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of an Embassador:) so also, by the <note place="margin">Senatus facie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore if the offense be such one as may seem possible to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is either to be dissembled, or else the Embassador is to be commanded to depart <note n="†" place="margin">Fecit id.

Indeed, that hight of necessity is not in the taking of punishment, which also in other cases is taken away by the Law of Nations, as we shall shew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: much less in the place, time and manner of taking punishment, but in the precaution of a great mischief, especially publick.

The Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons provides not only for the dignity of him that sends, but for the security of him that is sent: Wherefore there is a tacit contract with him also; and wrong is done to him, though none is done to his Master.

may be also referred the judgment of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust</hi> concerning <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> which we made use of above. But if the Embassador will not yield them, the same course is to be taken, which before we said about the Embassadors own offense. Now, whether an Embassador hath jurisdiction over his own family, and whether his house be a sanctuary <note n="*" place="margin">Distingui fermè hac in re solent crimina. Vide Parutam lib. 10. ubi Rex Gallioe hanc ob causam iratus pacatur. Vide eund. lib. 11.</note> for all that fly unto it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the concession of him with whom he resides. For this belongs not to the Law of Nations. That the movable Goods also of the Embassador, which are accounted an accession to his person, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be seised on, neither as a pledge, nor for payment of a debt, nor by order of judgment, nor (which some allow) by the Kings hand, is the truer opinion. For all coaction ought to be far from an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, as well that which toucheth his necessaries, as his person, that he may have full security. If therefore he hath contracted any debt, and (as it is) pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess no immovables in that place, He is to be calld upon kindly, and if he refuse, his Master; so that at last that course may be taken with him, which is usual against debters in another territory. Nor is it to be feared, which some think, lest, if this be so, none will be found to contract or deal with an Embassador: For even Kings, who cannot be compell'd, want not creditors; and among some Nations it was a custome, saith <hi>Nicolaus Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenus,</hi>
                           <pb n="292" facs="tcp:96775:186"/>
that contracts which were gone into trust should bear no action, no more than ingratitude: so that men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained either to fulfill the contract pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, or be content with the naked faith of the debter. And <hi>Seneca</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth all the world were in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Would we could perswade men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>

God in the Prophets, threatneth the Kings he hates, that they should have the burial of an Asse, that dogs should lick their blood. Nor doth <hi>Lactantius</hi> consider any thing els in burial, when he saith, <hi>We will not suffer the Image and work of God to ly a prey for beasts and birds;</hi> And <hi>Ambrose</hi> his words are these, <hi>You can do no better office for him, who is now past requiting of you: save him from the fouls of the air, save from the beasts a partaker of the same nature.</hi> But, though such injuries were not, yet for the body of man to be trod under foot, and broken, seems very unbecoming the dignity of his kind. That in <hi>Sopater</hi>'s controversies is to our purpose: <hi>It is a comely thing to bury the dead, and by nature it self appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto bodies, lest they be vilified after death if they putrify naked. All the Gods are pleased to indulge this honour to bodies deprived of life. For, because it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, the secrets of human nature should be exposed after death to the sight of all, we have received a custome of old, to Inter human bodies, that being laid up in their sepulchers they may conceal their rotteness.</hi> To the same purpose is that of <hi>Gregory Nyssen, That the Sun may not see what is shamefull</hi>

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96775:200"/>
he is injured. In <hi>Tacitus</hi> we read, <hi>He should provide for his security by a just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</hi> That the injur'd party may not suffer wrong from the same hand, three ways may be taken: first, by destroying the person that hath offended; secondly, by weaking his force that he may not be able to do hurt; and lastly, if he be taught by his own evil to do so no more, which is the same with emendation, whereof we spake even now. That the injur'd party may not be hurt by others, is effected, not by every punishment, but that which is open, conspicuous and exemplary. If then, to these ends, and within the bounds of equity, vindication be directed, though private, if we respect the bare Law of Nature, abstract from Laws Divine and Human, and from all not necessary acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to the thing, it is not unlawfull; whether it be made by him that is wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or by another, seeing it is consenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to nature that man should receive aid from man. And in this sense may be admitted, that <hi>Cicero,</hi> having said, the Law of Nature is that which comes not from <note place="margin">De Invent. 2.</note> opinion but innate vertue, among the examples of it placeth Vindication, which he opposerh to Favour: and that none might doubt how much he would have to be understood by that name, he defines Vindication, <hi>Whereby by defending or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging we keep off force and contumely from us, and ours, who ought to be dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

For these are remedies for the mind, not less innocent than medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ungrateful to the sense. Of revenge we must have another opinion. For, as it only exsatiats the mind of the offended person, it is so far from agreement with the Gospel, that, as we have shew'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is even naturally unlawfull. But the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law not only forbids hatred to be kept against the <hi>neighbour,</hi> that is, <note place="margin">Levit. 19. 17.</note> one of the same nation, but also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands certain common benefits to be <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 4, 5.</note> conferrd upon such enemies. Wherefore, the name of <hi>neighbour</hi> being extended by the Gospel to all men, it is manifest here is required of us, not onely that we hurt not our enemies, but that we do them good: which is also plainly commanded <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44. Yet the Law permitted the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to revenge greater injuries, not with the hand, but by address unto the Judge. But Christ doth not permit the same to us, as appears by that opposition, <hi>Ye have heard it hath been said, An eye for an eye:</hi> and after: <hi>But I say unto you.</hi> For although the words that follow, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly speak of repelling in jury, (and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain

                        <p>IT is manifest, that wars are not to be undertaken for every offence: for, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the Laws bestow that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which is safe and hurts only the nocent, upon all faults. Rightly saith the forecited <hi>Sopater,</hi> That less and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon transgressions are to be winked at, not revenged. Now, that which <hi>Cato</hi> said <note place="margin">Gell. l. 7. c. 3.</note> in his Oration for the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> that it is not equal any one should be punisht for an intent of doing evil, was indeed well set in that case; because no decree of the <hi>Rhodians</hi> could be alleged, but only conjectures of their fluctuating minde: yet is not this to be received universally.

And truly, if their opinion, from whom we dissent, be admitted, no enemy now shall have the power of punishment against another enemy; no not after war undertaken, from a cause not punitive: which right nevertheless very many grant, and the use of all Nations confirmeth; not only after the war is done, but even while it endures; not out of any Civil Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but out of that natural right, which was before the institution of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and now also prevaileth, where men live distributed into families and not into Cities.</p>

Plutarch.</note>; <hi>To reduce the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nations to more civility of manners, is a pretence to colour an unlawful desire of that which is anothers.</hi> Second, that we do not rashly account among things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by nature, those things which are not manifestly so, and which are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rather by Divine Law: in which rank haply you may put copulations without marriage <note n="†" place="margin">

                        <p>WHat shall we say of those Arms which are carried against any people for this cause, that they will not entertain Christian Religion proposed to them? I will not now enquire, whether it be proposed in such a quality, and in such a manner, as it ought. Suppose it be: two things we say are to be noted. The first is this; that the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion (to wit, so far as it super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addes to natural and primitive Religion things not a few) cannot be perswaded by arguments meerly natural, but depends upon the history both of Christ's Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and of the miracles wrought by himself and his Apostles: which is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, of old indeed confirmed by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable testimonies; but, of old; so that this is a question of fact, and that now very antient. Whence it happens, that this doctrin cannot throughly sink in into the minds of such as, now first, hear it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be seconded by the secret assistances of God; and these, as they are not given to them that have them for a reward of any, work, so if they be denyed to any or
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:96775:225"/>
any, or granted more sparingly, this comes to pass for causes, not unjust indeed, but for the most part unknown to us and therefore by human judgment not punishable. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent here is the Canon of the <hi>Toletan</hi> Council: <hi>The precept of the Holy Synod</hi>

                        <p>AS to them that embrace the Law of Christ for true, but doubt or mistake in some things, which either are beside the Law, or in the Law seem to have an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous sense, and have been expounded by the antient Christians not after one manner, they that persecute such do very unjustly: as appears both by what we have said afore, and by the old example of the Jews.

They think us injurious to the Father; because we believe them to be equal. The truth it with us, but they presume it is with them. The honor of God is with us, but they suppose what they believe is for the honour of the Deity. They are inofficious, but this is to them the chiefest office of Religion.

Howbeit, so full a right they have not, in offenses which in some sort belong to the Society of mankind; which other Commonwealths and their Rulers have a right to prosecute; just as in every Commonwealth, any one in some cases, may commence an action: much less have they that full power in those offenses, whereby another state, or the Governour of it is peculiarly wronged; and for which therefore He or She, for their dignity of security, have right to require punishment,

according to what we have said above. This right then, the Commonwealth in which the delinquent lives, nor the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler thereof, can justly hinder. But, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commonwealths are not wont to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit another State to come armed within their bounds to exact punishment, nor is that expedient, it follows, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, wherein he lives that is found <note n="†" place="margin">For the knowledge of the cause ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, between the whole and the parts, the Community and single persons, the fault is communicated; because, as <hi>S.

For, the punishments of the whole, and of the parts, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct. As the punishment of particular men sometime is death, so it is the death of a Commonwealth to be overthrown: which is, when the Civil body is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

                        <p>HEre occurres an eminent question, Whether punishment for the fault of a Community may always be exacted. So long as the Community lasteth, it seems it may: because the same body remains, the parts succeeding one another. But, on the other side, is to be noted, that some things are attributed to a Community first and by it self, as, to have a treasury, Laws, and the like: some things, by deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the particulars. For so we call a Community learned, and valiant, which hath most such. Of this sort is <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> or Desert; for, primarily it agrees to <note place="margin">Aristot. 7. pol. cap. 13.</note> the particulars, as having understanding, which the Community by it self hath not. Those then being extinct, by whom Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was derived to the Community, the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:96775:237"/>
Merit it self also is extinguished, and therefore the debt of punishment, which we have said cannot consist without Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>It seemeth to me,</hi> saith <hi>Libanius,</hi>

Neither, if it be just that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should receive honours and rewards for their Fathers good deeds, is it therefore just that they should be punisht for their evil.

Directly given I call that, whereby somewhat is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from one, to which he hath a proper right; By consequence, that, whereby it comes to pass that one hath not, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he should have had: to wit, the condition ceasing without which he had

Which is rightly noted by <hi>Alphenus,</hi> when he saith, By the Fathers punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the children lose that which should descend from him to them; but those things remain entire, which were given, not By the Father, but by nature, or some other way. So <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth, <note place="margin">Lib. 2. epist. 11. &amp; 19.</note> that the children of <hi>Themistocles</hi> were in want, nor thinks he it unjust, that the children of <hi>Lepidus</hi> should bear the same calamity.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:96775:239"/>
Civil liberty, walls, and other things, the particulars who are innocent do also bear the loss; but in that thing, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined not to them but by the whole. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> we must note, some evil is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times imposd upon one, or some good is taken away, by <hi>occasion</hi> indeed of some fault, yet not so that the fault is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>cause</hi> of that action, as to the right of doing. So he, who by occasion of anothers debt hath engaged himself, suffers evil <note n="*" place="margin">Sponde, nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a praesto est.</note>; but the immediate cause of his obligation is his promise. For, as he who is become surety for a Buyer, is not properly bound by the bargain, but by his promise: so also he who is bound for a delinquent, is not held by the delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but by his engagement. And hence it is, that the evil to be born by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its measure, not from the fault of the other, but from the power which himself had in promising. Consequent whereunto is this, that (according to the opinion which we believe to be the truer) no man can, by his becoming surety, lose his life: because we determine, No man hath such right over his own life, that he can take it from himself, or engage it to be taken away by another: though the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> were of another mind in this matter: and therefore thought sureties were bound <note n="*" place="margin">

For to both of these ways it is not sufficient, that the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ought to be done by some moral reason, but moreover it is needfull there be in us a certain right unto it: which right sometimes divine and human Laws do give also about the dues of other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and then a new kind of debt ariseth perteining unto Justice.

But, so soon as the Armies have faced each other, they lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side anger and embrace concord, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Kings, to put their differences to triall of Law; or, if they will not do that, to enter into single combat, and bring the matter to an end, only with their own danger.

to the thing it self, as a sute in Law neither; because a moral facultie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, to wit, both to act and to hinder, is not granted by nature. But, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the parties warring may do <hi>unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> is possible; for no man doth unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he that also knows he doth an unjust thing: and many are ignorant of that. So may a sute be followed justly, that is, with an honest mind, on both sides. For, many things, both in point of right and fact, whence right ariseth, are wont to escape men. In a general acception, just is wont to be called that which is without all fault of the Doer. And many things without right are done without fault through ignorance inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. An example whereof is in them, who observe not the Law, which without their fault they are ignorant of, after the law it self is promulged, and time suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient by it self for knowledge hath pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. So also in Law-sutes it may happen, that both parties may be free from inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and all other blame, especially where both parties, or either, goeth to law not in his own but anothers name, to wit, by the office of a Tutor or Guardian, whose duty is not to desert any right though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.

either must, or alwayes may lawfully be undertaken. For, the contrary is true, that for the most part it is more pious and <note place="margin">Victor. de ju. bel. n. 14. &amp; 33.</note> honest to depart from ones right. That we may honestly forsake the care even of our own life, that we may provide, as much as lies in us, for the eternal life and salvation of another, hath been shewed afore. Which is especially the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Christians, therein imitating the most perfect example of Christ, who dyed <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 6.</note> for us, while we were his enemies. This doth much more excite us, not to pursue our worldly interests with so much hurt of other men, as Wars do carry with them. That for every such cause war is not to be waged, even <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Polybius</hi> do <note place="margin">Arist. Polit. 4. Rhet. ad Alex. cap. 3.</note> advise.

The things that lead to the one or other, are not desired by themselves, but as they lead thither. Wherefore in Debates, are to be compared, both the ends among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the effective faculty of those things that lead to the end, to produce the same. (For, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath rightly <note place="margin">Arist. de ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. mot.</note> noted, <hi>

<pb n="443" facs="tcp:96775:261"/>
in a moral estimation, equal efficacy to Good and to Evil, it is so to be chosen, if the Good hath somewhat more of good, than the Evil hath of evil. Whence <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus Rhodius,</hi> where he describes the magnanimous man, saith, He will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go dangers, not for every cause, but for the greatest. Another Rule is, If the Good and Evil seem equal, which may proceed from the thing in question, that thing is eligible, if the efficacy to Good be greater than to evil. The third, If both the Good and the Evil seem to be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and the efficacy of the things no less unequal, that thing will be eligible, so that the efficacy to good be greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compar'd which the efficacy to evil, than the Evil it self is, being compar'd to the Good <note n="*" place="margin">Narses in Procopius makes a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent use of this rule. <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic.</hi> 2.</note>. This have we set down af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a more exact manner. But <hi>Cicero</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth to the same purpose in a plainer way, when he saith, We must take heed we do not offer our selves to perils without cause, than which nothing can be more foolish: wherefore in running hazards, the custome of Physicians is worthy of our imitation: They apply gentle reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to light diseases, but in the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous are compelld to use more perillous and doubtful Medicines: Wherefore, he saith, it is a wise mans part to take the <note place="margin">De Offic. 2.</note> opportunity, and the rather, if he may obtain more good by success of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than he can fear evil upon the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.

Yea, supposing arms cannot, no not in extreme necessity, be taken rightly by Subjects (whereof we have seen those to doubt whose purpose was to defend the regal power:) nevertheless will it not therefore follow, that arms may not be taken by others on their behalf. For, as oft as a personal, not real, impediment is put against any action, so oft may that be lawfull for one for anothers good, which was not lawfull for that other; if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be of such a nature, wherein one may procure the good of another.

                        <p>ALthough these things be true, yet by the voluntary Law of Nations it might by induced, and it appears to have been induced, that, for that which any Civil Society, or the head thereof, ought to make good, either by it self pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, or because in anothers debt it hath also made it self lyable by not doing right; for that, I say, are tyed and bound all corporal and incorporal Goods of them that are subject to the same society or head. And it was a certain necessity that effected this; because without this, great licence would be given to the doing of injuries, seeing the Goods of Rulers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes cannot so easily come to hand, as of private men who are more. This then <note place="margin">Justinian. de jure nat.</note> is among those Laws, which <hi>Justinian</hi> saith were constituted by the Nations <note place="margin">Tho. 2. 2. q. 40. art. 1.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, this is not so repugnant to nature, that it could not be induced by custome and tacit consent, when even without any cause sureties are bound by consent alone. And there was hope, that the members of the same society might more easily obtain mutual right, and provide for their own indemnity, than foreiners, who in many places are very little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

                        <p>BEside the impunity of some acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst men, of which we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, there is also another effect in solemn War, properly arising out of the Law of Nations. And truly by the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> in a just War, those things are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to us, which either are equal to that, which being due unto us we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwise obtain; or also, which do infer damage to the guilty part, within fit measure of punishment, as hath been said above. By this right <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the spoyles he had taken from the five Kings, gave the Tithe to God <note n="*" place="margin">And food to his servants, and part of the spoyl to his companions. <hi>vide Josephum in hac historia.</hi> Hebr. 7. 4.

<pb n="559" facs="tcp:96775:319"/>
which his posterity called by his name should do afterward; as if the person of the progenitor and his children were the same. For, this is righter, than with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to draw these words to that spoyle of the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> which was made before by the sons of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob:</hi> which being joyned with perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 30. 49. 6.</note> was condemned by the piety of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as we may see in the Story. Now, that the right of taking spoyle was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God, within those natural bounds which I have mentiond, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest also in other places. God in his Law <note place="margin">Deut. 20. 14.</note> speaking of a City conquerd after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal of peace, saith thus: <hi>All the spoil thereof shalt thou take unto thy self, and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God hath given thee.</hi> The <hi>Reubenites, Gadites,</hi> and part of the <hi>Manassites</hi> are said to have conquerd the <hi>Ituraeans</hi> and their neighbours, and to have taken from them much spoil, this reason being added; because they called <note place="margin">1.

                           <hi>thing hath escaped pursuance,</hi> as <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> speaketh in a like question. And this so proceeds in movable goods, that they are said <hi>Taken,</hi> when they are brought within the bounds, that is, the guards of the enemy. For in the same manner a thing is lost, as it returns by <hi>Postliminium.</hi> It returns, when it comes within the bounds of Empire, <hi>i. e.</hi> within the guards. And <hi>Paulus</hi> saith plainly of a man, that he is lost, when he is gone beyond our bounds: and <hi>Pomponius</hi> interprets him <hi>Taken</hi> in War, whom the enemies have taken out of ours, and brought within their own guards; for before he is brought into their guards he remains a Citizen. Now, in this Law of Nations, there was the same reason of a man and of a thing. Whence it is easy to be conceived, that elswhere things taken are said presently to become the Takers, ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood with some condition, to wit, of

continuing the possession so far; whence <note place="margin">Consulatn maris c. 283. &amp; 287. Constit. Gallicae lib. 20. tit. 13. art. 24. Corn. de Lap. in Gen. c. 14. Molin. disp. 118.

But, by the newer Law of Nations among the people of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope we see 'tis introduc'd, that such things are supposed taken, when they have been in the enemies power for the space of four and twenty hours <note n="*" place="margin">By land also the same is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, as you may learn out of Thuanus l. 113. in an. 1595. <hi>Vid. &amp; Alb.

For, though it be true, that that part of the field, which an Army hath entred with great force, is for the time possessed by it, as <hi>Celsus</hi> hath noted; Yet, as to that effect which we speak of, every possession is not sufficient, but a firm possession is requir'd.

                        <p>ANd this is manifest, that a thing may be made ours by the Law of war, 'tis requir'd, that it have been the enemies; For, things that are with the enemies, that is, in their Towns, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their guards, but whose Owners are neither the enemies subjects, nor of an hostile mind, those things cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by war, as appears, among other arguments, by that saying of <hi>Aeschines</hi>

                        <p>IN the Primitive state of Nature, no men <note place="margin">L. Libertus §. 1.

But, by that Law of Nations, of which we now speak, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude is of larger extent, both as to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> and as to <hi>effects.</hi> For, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Persons, not only they that give up themselves or promise servitude are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for servants, but all indeed that are taken in publick solemn War, after they are brought within the guards, as <hi>Pomponius</hi> saith.

Now, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this right are infinite, so that, as <hi>Seneca</hi> the Father said, there is nothing which is not lawful to a Master over his servant. No suffering, which may not freely be imposed on him; no work which may not every way be commanded or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from him: so that even the cruelty
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:96775:324"/>
of Masters toward servile persons is unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, unless so far as the Civil Law sets a measure and a penalty for cruelty, <hi>We may observe,</hi> saith <hi>Caius, that Masters,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">L. X. D. de his qui sui sunt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. Instit. de his qui sui.</note>

Moreover, all things which are taken with the persons are acquir'd to the Master. The servant himself, who is in the power of another, <note place="margin">Instit. per quas person. ¶. item vob.</note> saith <hi>Justinian,</hi> can have nothing as his own. Whence is refelled, or at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, their opinion, who say incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things are not acquired by the Law of War. For, it is true, they are not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and by themselves acquired, but by means of the person whose they were. Yet here are to be excepted those things which flow from a singular propriety or the person, and therefore are unalienable, as the right paternal. For these, if they can remain, remain in the person; if not, they are extinguished. Now, all these things were introduc'd by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for no other cause, but that the Takers tempted by so many commodities might willingly abstein from that extreme rigour, whereby they might kill those they <note place="margin">L. Pupillus. D. de V. S. vide &amp; Servium ad 5. Aen. ubi origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem vocis sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem explicat.</note> had taken, both at the instant, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as we have said afore. <hi>The appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion of servants,</hi> saith <hi>Pomponius, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived hence, that Commanders are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:96775:324"/>
to sell Captives, and so preserve and not kill them.</hi> I said, that they might <hi>willingly</hi> abstein: for here is nothing like a Covenant whereby they may be <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peld</hi> to abstain, if you look upon this Law of Nations, but a manner of perswading from consideration of that which is more profitable. And for the same cause, this right is also transcribed to others, just as the dominion of things. The reason why this dominion was extended to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is, because otherwise, if the Takers should use their highest right, they would not be born. Whereto is Consequent, that the Children born before that cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, unless they be taken too, become not servants. And, the reason why it pleasd the Nations, that the Children should be of their Mothers condition, is, because servile copulations were neither regulated by Law nor by certain custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so that no sufficient presumption could shew the Father. So is that of <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> to be understood, <hi>The Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

                        <p>I Must now return, and take away from those that wage War almost all that I have seemed to give them, and yet have not given. For I said at first, when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to explain this part of the Law of Nations, that many things are lawfull or of right, in that they are done <hi>impunè,</hi> without punishment, and partly because coactive judgments do lend them their
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:96775:328"/>
authority; which things yet, either are exorbitant from the rule of right; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that rule be placed in right strictly so call'd, or in the precept of other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; or els at least may be omitted bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and with more commendation among good men. In <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Troades,</hi> when <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> saith, <hi>No law spares a captive, or hinders his punishment,</hi> Agammenon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>What Law forbiddeth not, Pudor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids to be done.</hi> Where <hi>Pudor</hi> (or, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty) signifies not so much respect of men and reputation, as of Right and Good, or at least, of that which is righter and better. And in that sense you may often see Justice joyn'd with Pudor, <hi>Plato; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is call'd the companion of Pudor, and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 12. de leg.</note> 
                           <hi>that deservedly.</hi> And in another place; <hi>God fearing the destruction of mankind,</hi>

                           <hi>gave unto men Justice and Pudor, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of Cities, and bonds of friendship. Cicero</hi> so distinguisheth between Justice <note place="margin">Offic. 1.</note> and Modesty, that he makes it the part of Justice, not to violate men; of modesty, not to offend them. With that which we brought out of <hi>Seneca</hi> well agrees a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de ira. cap. 27.</note> of the same Author in his Philosophic writings; <hi>How narrow is that Innocence, to be good according to Law</hi>

Now, to restitution are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of war (whether by right of power, or by counsil) bound, concerning all the things that usually follow war; yea such things as are not usual, if they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any such, or perswaded, or when they could hinder, have not hindred. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Leaders are bound concerning the things done by their Command; and all soldiers fully, who have concurred to any common act, as namely the burning of a town; in divided acts, every one for the damage whereof himself is the only cause, or at least one of the causes. Nor can I <note place="margin">Vasquez. lib. 1. controv. ill. c. 9. n. 17. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. disp. 118. §. ut vero.</note> think, that exception is to be admitted, which is added by some, concerning them
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:96775:329"/>
that do service unto others, if in them be any part of the fault. For the fault suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to restitution without deceit. Some there are, who seem to be of opinion, that things taken in war, though the cause of war was not just, are not to be restored; because Warriors, when they enter into war against each other, are understood to have allowed those things to the Takers. But, no man is easily presumed vainly to expose his own, and war of it self is far distant from the nature of Contracts. And, that peaceable people might have somewhat certain which they might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and not be entangled in war against their will, it sufficed to introduce that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal dominion of which we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Which also the said Authors seem to determine in the Law of the captivity of persons. Therefore the <hi>Samnites</hi> in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, We have sent back,</hi> say they, <hi>the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>things of our enemies taken in prey, which seemed ours by the right of War.</hi> They say, <hi>seemed,</hi> because that war was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, <note place="margin">Lib. 8.</note> as the <hi>Sammites</hi> had before acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. Not unlike is this, that from a contract entred without deceit, wherein is inequality, by the Law of Nations there springs a certain faculty of compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him who hath contracted, to fulfil his Convenants; and yet notwithstanding is he bound by the office of an honest and good man, who hath covenanted for more than is right, to reduce the matter to equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:96775:330"/>
Moreover, He that hath not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self given the damage, or hath given it without all fault, but hath in his hand a thing taken by another in unjust war, is bound to restore it; because, why the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should go without it, there is no cause naturally just, not his consent, not his i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

On purpose no man can be slain justly, unless either for just punishment, or as without it we cannot defend our life and our goods; though this, to kill a man for perishing things, however it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to justice strictly so called, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the Law of Charity.

                        <p>AGainst these Precepts of equity and Natural Law, are wont to be brought exceptions very unjust: to wit, if talion be exacted, if there be need of error, if there was an obstinate resistance. But, that these things are not sufficient to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify slaughter, he will easily conceive, who remembreth what we have set down a fore about the just causes of killing. From Captives, and those that yield or desire to <note place="margin">Vide Vict. de jure belli, n. 49. &amp; 60.</note> yield, there is no danger: that therefore they may be justly killed, there must be some antecedent Crime, and that such a one, as an equal judge would think worthy of death. And so we see sometimes great severity shewed to Captives, and those that have yielded; or, their yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on condition of life not accepted; if, after they were convinced of the injustice of the War, they had nevertheless persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in arms; if they had blotted their enemies name with unsufferable disgraces; if they had violated their faith, or any right of Nations, as of Embassadors; if they were fugitives.

And, For a more obstmate affection to ones own side, if the cause maintained is not at all dishonourable, that deserves not punishment, as the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> discourse <note place="margin">Lib. 1.

Of old, when it was commonly believed, that every one had as much power over his own life as over other things within his propriety; and that that power, by consent either tacit or express, was devolved from every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son upon the Commonwealth; it is the less to be admir'd, if we read, Hostages (though in themselves innoxious) were put to death for the offense of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, either as by their own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, or as by the publick consent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own was included also. But after that the more true and perfect Wisedom hath taught us, that Dominion over life <note place="margin">Vict. de jure belli. n. 43.</note> is excepted by God, it follows, that by consent alone no man can give to any, power and right over the life either of himself, or of his Citizen. And therefore it seem'd atrocity to <hi>Narses</hi> a good Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to take punishment of innoxious Hostages, as <hi>Agathias</hi> tells us: (and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note>

                        <p>IT might seem superfluous to speak of them, who have nothing to do with War, seeing it is manifest there is no right of War over these: Yet because by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the VVar, many things are wont to be done against these, borderers especially, on pretence of necessity, we must here repeat what we have said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">Part. 2.</note> that Necessity ought to be extreme, that it may give a right over what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to another man: 'tis requir'd moreover, that the Owner himself be not in equal necessity: and, where the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity is manifest, no more is to be taken than the necessity exacteth; that is, if the custody suffices, the use of the thing is not to be taken; if the use, not the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse: if the abuse be necessary, yet is the price of the thing to be restored. <hi>Moses,</hi> when the highest necessity ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him and the people, to pass through the Land of the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> first he saith, he would pass along the high way, and not divert into their Corn-fields or Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards: if he had need but of their water, he would pay a price for it. The worthy Captains, both Greek and Roman, have done the like. In <hi>Xenophon,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> with <hi>Clearchus</hi> promise the <hi>Persians</hi> to

                     <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> was born at <hi>Delf</hi> in <note place="margin">Athenae Bat. Anno 1583.</note> 
                     <hi>Holland,</hi> 4. <hi>eid. April. Anno</hi> 1583. He was of an Antient, and Noble House. His Grandfather of the same name was lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned above the model of those darker times, and well skild in the three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Languages, <hi>Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</hi> His Uncle <hi>Cornelius Grotius</hi> was professor of the Civil Law at <hi>Leyden,</hi> where he flourished in the good esteem and favour of the best men. His Father was <hi>Joannes Grotius,</hi> Curator of that University: whose Poems are extant, with <hi>Lipsius</hi> Letters to him, and <hi>Dousa</hi>'s verses: whose name also hath adorned many learned Mens Books dedicated to Him. Being blest with this Hopeful son, he used all pains and care in his good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and cherished this great Wit so well, that when he was but eight years old, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1591. He did <hi>fundere</hi>

He tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled <note place="margin">Anno 1598.</note> into <hi>France</hi> in the train of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable person, <hi>Joannes Oldenbarne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veldius,</hi> Embassador from the States to the Great <hi>Henry;</hi> and returned honour'd with Royal Bounty, and the Friendship of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Men; having before that time
<pb facs="tcp:96775:374"/>
begun to set forth notes upon the seven Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Arts of <hi>Martianus Capella.</hi> When he had after studied some years at <hi>Leyden,</hi> much endeared unto <hi>Scaliger,</hi> his Father fearing the yong Scholars mind should, by the Amenity and delight of human lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature and Poesy, be drawn away from more profitable employment; he was taken off, and ascribed among the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates at the <hi>Hague, Anno</hi> 1599. and <note place="margin">Anno 1599.</note> soon after pleaded Causes. Yet did not he addict himself so much to that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but that his Genius led him back, and made him often revisit his former stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Humanity. For which, he was most dear to the <hi>French</hi> Embassador <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanvall,</hi> to <hi>Janus Dousa</hi> the Father, and many other Persons of Honour. About this time the States of <hi>Holland</hi> began to use his service, in penning the History of the most famous War in the whole world. Afterward <hi>Anno</hi> 1607.

Here perceiving the Trade into <hi>India</hi> of great Importance to his Countrey, that he might stir up the spirits
<pb facs="tcp:96775:375"/>
of his Countrymen thereto, he wrote a Book, <hi>De jure Commercii Indicani. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> observing, after the Truce with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the peace of the Common-wealth began to be disturbed by certain dangerous Innovators, judging it to be the Duty of a good Patriot, to oppose himself against their Designs, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto All the present State, he set out a Dissertation, entituled, <hi>De Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Reipublicae Bataviae.</hi> After the death of <hi>Elias Olden Barneveldius,</hi> a man not less Noble for his good parts, than his family, Our <hi>Grotius</hi> sufferd himself to be chosen into his place, <hi>Syndic of Roterdam,</hi> and so was advanced from the Bar to the Bench. And then was he sent into Great <hi>Britain</hi> to accommodate the difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade: whence he was dismist not without eminent marks of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from that King of Learning and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and from the most learned and pious men of that Iland, together with this most pleasing fruit of his Journey, that he there had found the Great <hi>Isaac Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon,</hi> whom he reverenced before at a distance, and had now enjoyed a more intimate and familiar conversation with him. About that time the Church being very sick of the Controversies of <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination,</hi> and of the contention of some Pastors with the Magistrates about the right of Church-Government: in so much that the States of <hi>Holland</hi> were by some
<pb facs="tcp:96775:375"/>
Contumeliously reproached: Our Author thought it his Duty to vindicate the Right of the State, and offer his Medicines for the Cure of those Distempers, and shew the way to Peace in those and other Differences that disturb the Christian World.</p>

celebrated in the Annals of <hi>France,</hi> to be inscribed upon this Book: that Men, by this sign may see, though I cannot be thankful enough, I have not willingly been unthankful. The truest praise of the <hi>French-Nation</hi> is Humanity, especially toward strangers: but your Humanity hath exceeded all former limits, and is not common to the Nation, but proper to your self. You have new-spirited a yong man, commendable for nothing but his love of good learning, and admiration of eminent persons, and you have not only countenanced him &amp; encouraged him with gracious words, (which was much:) but of your own accord, have admitted him (let me not offend your honour in saying so) into your bosom, as an intimate friend. Moreover, You have laid hold on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to advance me, with a bountiful, prone, and (I had almost said) Paternal Affection. Whensoever the Affairs of <hi>France</hi> and greater cares shall recall you from us, it will be a sad time to All, most to Me; For it will deprive me of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest part of my felicity: Yet tis a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that it shall never be able to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, either the memory which you are pleased to retein of me, or the honour which I have received from so illustrious a Friendship. And, seeing it much concern'd me to have it known, I thought it meet upon that account to make this publick Address, and offer you this Tragedy for
<pb facs="tcp:96775:379"/>
a testimony of a mostd voted Heart. That it might be worthy of you, seeing I could not give it value from my self, I have taken it from the matter most woeful in in the fact, most joyful in the effect and fruit, most sacred every way. This alone unites the divided minds of Christians, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with one another as much in hatred as they ought in love, and keeps them stil almost invincible, not permitting their differences to be infinite. No other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument could be found more agreeable to your Mind, who long mourn for the lamentable distractions of this Age, and study to procure, as much as is in you (and very much is in you) the Peace of the Church; a thing that we can only wish for. For, that, Truth necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation being establisht, due liberty 'twixt unjust Domination and unbridled Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence being granted in other points, the Parties much inflam'd by ambition, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, private Interests, and impunity of speaking &amp; doing evil brought in by wars, may by degrees be reconciled and close in a league; to this end <hi>(I say)</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of your King, the Prince of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes, and next unto that your le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and moderation, and of such as you are, yieldeth us the greatest Hope. Which Hope, may He at length, bring unto an Issue, who is our Common Redeemer, and hath bought us with his own blood, the memory of which ineffable Benefit, we

Feb. 1612.</note> You have made me happy with your Letters which I lately receiv'd: and I cannot express the pleasure I take in your cares and studies of Peace and Concord. You see in your Country, how easy a thing it is to stir up con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions among brethren, how hard to allay them. Think every Country to be <hi>Holland.</hi> So great store is there of the lovers of Contention every where: who account it a matter indifferent, or not so much, whether the Church have any peace or no. 'Tis a small thing, not to
<pb facs="tcp:96775:383"/>
love concord: I know many, that do suspect and hate no men more than peace-makers. The more have I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd the piety of King <hi>James,</hi> who doth so embrace the study of Truth, that he recedes not from the study of Unity. <hi>The same</hi> Casaubon <hi>in another Epistle to</hi> Grotius: <note n="*" place="margin">Casaub. Epist. 221. 6. Kal. Febr.</note> The most wise King, most studious of Peace and Concord, having read your Letter, exceedingly praised your piety joyn'd with equal prudence. His Majestie could wish, that all They, who have any hand in the Government of Christian Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, were of your mind: and, he doubteth not, it would be for the great good of God's Church. He also won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully approves the counsel you sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, of procuring concord by all means, at least among our own. If this, any way, through Gods mercy, could be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the King assures himself, Many good men, who at this day knowing not whither to turn themselves amidst our so great discords, do groan under the Popes Tyrannie, would provide for the liberty of their Consciences. I will pronounce nothing of the Papists of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes: but of my Countrymen of <hi>France</hi> I think I may truly say, the best of them do wait for the day of the Lord, and from their souls detest the maintainers of empty superstitions, and of Papal Tyrannie. I say more, and I say it upon
<pb facs="tcp:96775:383"/>
good ground: If in our <hi>France,</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation had been carried on, without so much varying from the form of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church, many thousands more, now most a verse from the Doctrine of our Churches, had been converted. When I have said thus to our Ministers in <hi>France,</hi> I found but few, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not their own preciseness before gentle and moderate counsels. Here, far otherwise minded are both the King, and every most learned man of the English Clergy. Many of the Bishops in this Kingdome, men excelling in learning and piety, I have found, who day and night study the same thing with you, and give themselves continually to the same Cogitations. And I doubt not, if a beginning were made, or if any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion did arise of effecting that, of which you have most prudently written, both his most excellent Majestie, and the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> and especially the most reverend Bishops, would try all things, to promote so good a work. His Majestie commanded me, to let you understand so much, requesting you to continue in the same mind, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate your counsels to us.</p>

For, to tell you the very truth (and who better deserves to hear the truth?) ever since I began to consider diligently of the Affairs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I found their complaints, who called for amendment in doctrines, in rites, in government, to be most just; but (as it commonly happens) they went too far, and erred a little on the other hand <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:96775:387"/>
fear of Tyrannie (which had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable) they proceeded to the confines of Anarchy. VVherefore I have alwaies thought it the duty of all good men on our side, to do their utmost, that by little and little, whatsoever was exorbitant might be reduced to a Golden medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity. VVhich cogitation I see was fixed in the mind of <hi>Melancthon.</hi> Now, there is nothing objected, I will not say, to our Churches, but to the most famous Doctours of our Churches, more odious, than that by too much urging certain rigid doctrines, and savouring more of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Porch than <hi>Salomon</hi>'s, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign unto God the causes of sinning, and <note n="*" place="margin">

The learned <hi>Melancthon</hi> saw this, and having been carried upon these rocks by the violence of <hi>Luther,</hi> afterward, by the admonition of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> steered a better course. VVhose footsteps, when some of our Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> insisted in, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prest by the vehemence of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues, had their onely refuge in the goodness of the Magistrates, I associated my self to them, who conceiv'd it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, that a most pernicious thing should from this beginning go into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and that the VVorld should know, Moderate men could not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in our Churches. VVhen some sharp Doctours in the Neighbourhood
<pb facs="tcp:96775:388"/>
made strong opposition against this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous design, and mixed other matters with this business, onely to raise an <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> against the Magistrates pursuing peace; it seemed good, that it should be shewed how unjust those turbulent clamors were, in the consutation of one most eminent among his fellows, who had in ill manner implored the aid of external power. To this service was I chosen, not but that many might have done it better, but because it seemed proper to the office which I then did execute. Nor was I ignorant what 'twas to provoke VVasps, but being armed with a good Conscience, I adventured to expose my self to calumnies, which they shall never escape that will oppose vices aged and robustious. But I give you thanks, and acknowledge your good will to me, and your wisdome, when you perswade me to abstain for the future from such contentions. I will indeed, in compliance with your Authority, and my own inclination both, carefully avoyd a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> unnecessary quarrels; because I see it is (as you write) of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well to the health of body, (which to me is but weak) as to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of mind. <hi>After this he comes to speak of his historical writings, thus:</hi> The Historie of our VVar I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the end, that is, to the Truce.
<pb facs="tcp:96775:388"/>
There remains now the labour of revising and correcting it, almost more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some than the writing: I see, when I had leisure to write more heedfully, I was not well provided with solid know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of affairs: now, when I am able to get a better understanding of matters, my employments (being many rather than great) do not afford me time to select words fit for the Historie. And I much fear, that the work will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaven and broken, and being composed at divers times, will not resemble the same Author. VVhat I have written, upon your encouragement I will revise and amend as perfectly as I can, and then lay it up where it shall have no commerce with this Age; for it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to contract with it. Posterity is better trusted; not because it will be better, but because it will be more kind to the deceased; for there will arise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objects for envy and malice to work upon.</p>
                  <p>Anno 1616. Gulielmus Grotius, <hi>our Author's Brother, published a Collection of his Poems. Concerning which our Author, in an Epistle of his prefixed, saith:</hi>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Hugo Grotius Gulielmo Grotio fratri.</note> Some will accuse the Variety and desul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious kind of writing. The work indeed is not of one age. Spring and Summer are several seasons. And a mans mind is not always in the same temper: some times free and at its own command; sometimes wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and seeking where to breath; often by request of friends bound and confined to a certain subject. Neither do I think it the part of a constant man, to put the same ccuntenance upon jest and earnest. Moreover, my wit and <hi>Genius</hi> being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctile and apt to follow, as it was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the reading of any Poet, was easily led in the way of imitation. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my self in some places full of <hi>Lucans</hi> spirit, in other very studious of <hi>Manilius,</hi> and in other attempting some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more castigate after the pattern of <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Claudian,</hi> &amp;c. But for the edition of these poems, I neither say <hi>yea,</hi> nor <hi>nay,</hi> but leave you to your self, and to the Counsils of those, who are most able to judge thereof. Such as are those Princes of this Art <hi>Heinsius</hi> and <hi>Rutger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and the most honest and most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Vossius.</hi> However, I rejoyce in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such a brother, who loveth not my person only but my writings so frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>

                        </gap> Grotius.</note> I have this onely way left me to open and declare the Truth to all those that have not their mind subject to their passions. And the plain Truth is this.</p>
                  <p>Among the Doctors of that Religion, which obteins the name of Reformed, both among us and in other places, hath been a variety of opinions, about Divine Praedestination, the amplitude of Grace, and the manner of its efficacy, and about certainty of perseverance, as appears by the Books published. The number of them that hold Predestination conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Grace universal and resistible, and peseverance conditionate likewise (some such in former time had been at <hi>Utrecht, Goad, Horn,</hi> and elswhere:) by inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diligently into those points was much encreased. Against these other opposed themselves, preaching, that that Opinion was contrary to the Word of God and the confessions of the Church, attempting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to out them of their Pastoral office, and bring them under other Ecclesiastical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. The accused and prosecuted party
<pb facs="tcp:96775:391"/>
were not wanting to themselves in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their defence, both by their tongues and pens. The States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frisia</hi> following the Counsil, first of the Judges of their own upper <hi>Bench,</hi> and then also of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> deliverd by word of mouth and by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: (when 'twas clear, that the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of those Controversies by most voices of the Pastors would make a rent, and much afflict both the body of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, and the Commonwealth too, and that many of the Magistrats (to say nothing now of a great number of private Citizens, lovers of Vertue and of their Countrey) were so well affected to the accused party, that they could not think the condemnation therof could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with the safety of Religion, nor could they use their power to that purpose:) They judged it best to set forth a Decree of mutual Toleration, charging the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, that in those Controversies they should bear with one another, and not handle that Argument, but temperately, and only in order to Godlyness, preserving among themselves the bond of Christian Charity unbroken. And that all abrupt points of those questions might be shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and no new ones started, more and more Decrees were made, which pleased very many Godly-learned Men, both at home and abroad. But, some of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, assuring themselves of certain vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb facs="tcp:96775:391"/>
by a definitive sentence, and not able to attain unto it lawfully, the way being obstructed by the said Decrees, did, by Clandestine Meetings and secret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, move the common people to a Church-separation; and, to gain the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Authority, laboured with some Towns and neighbouring Nations, to bring the businese to a Common Synod; which themselves, as if the seven Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Nations were one Nation, call Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional: which was against the will of most of the Rulers of <hi>Holland,</hi> against the will of the <hi>Trajectins</hi> and <hi>Transisalans</hi> and part of <hi>Geldria,</hi> being afraid of the ill effects usually caused by determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and defining Questions. The same were of opinion, that they could not be compell'd by those Nations which were less molested with those controversies, to joyn with them in the indiction of a Synod for the said definition: because, every Nation, even after the <hi>Trajectin</hi> league had excepted for it self, as other points of supremacy, so also the right of ordering the Church and publick divine service; witness the league it self, and the succeeding Acts, and the practice conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to these last times. Nevertheless they affirmed, They would persist in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Religion, on these terms, that a liberty of dissenting in those Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies should be permitted: for the use of which liberty in a moderate way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:96775:392"/>
commotions of the people, divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients were proposed. But, whilest this was under debate, the Adversaries of mutual peace, in some places, invaded the Temples, cast out their Dissenting bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and moreover stood against that Right, which the Magistrates, in <hi>Holland</hi> as well as among their neighbours, had exercised of old, and did exercise to that time, <hi>viz.</hi> Of having their voices in the election of Pastors. There were some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, who by their bitter Declamations and libells defaming the Rulers expos'd them to the hatred of the people, and also used violence against them <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> having long kept himself quiet in these Controversies, by the secret arts of some men is exasperated more and more against <hi>Oldenbarneveld</hi> Assessor (or, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate) of <hi>Holland,</hi> a man of most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Authority in the Assembly, from whom long since at the making of the Truce he had dissented: Withall, he is possest with such things concerning the form of the Common wealth (which he had not been very much conversant in hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, being taken up with military affairs:) which were neither agreeable to the Laws, nor Customs. He then, at length begins to disallow the Decrees made by the States of <hi>Holland</hi> for toleration of diversity of opinions, to forsake the publick Churches, and associate himself to the separating Congregations. And further, without the
<pb facs="tcp:96775:392"/>
knowledge of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> he gave Command to the ordinary Soldiers, not to stir in any businesses arising from those Controversies; when as the States of <hi>Holland</hi> were of another Judgment, <hi>viz.</hi> That obedience from the Soldier was due to their Decrees, and safeguard to the Rulers of Towns and to publick places against all force and sedition whatsoever. Upon this motive, some Magistrates of Towns, that had either no Garrisons at all, or such as were, for the said causes, suspected by the Rulers, by the Decree of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> encreased and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Guards of their Town: which right also they had heretofore often used, without contradiction of the States con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate, or the Governour, who is the Commander of the ordinary Soldiers. The same was done by the <hi>Trajectin</hi> Rulers and as well these as the other professed, they would entertain these Soldiers at at their own charge, over and above the common burdens of the War. About the same time, the two Benches of Judges, to whom lyes an Appeal from the Towns, begin to decree against the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> in those writs whereby they call'd whom they pleas'd into question. That, the States of <hi>Holland</hi> pronounce to be unjustly done, and the limits of their judiciary power to be exceeded, as it was often before these times. Some Nations are impelled by
<pb facs="tcp:96775:393"/>
Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and others, to call a common Synod (which we have said was stiled National) in the name of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Confederates, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the military guards of the Towns. Both the <hi>Hollandian</hi> and <hi>Trajectin</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers oppose themselves against this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, testifying, that 'twas not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Consederates, themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding, to constitute any thing in those matters by the vote of the major part. They go on to call the Synod inviting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Divines of other Nations, but no other than they knew would joyn in those opinions, to which the victory was destin'd. The proposals of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and others for a fair accommodation of the matter were rejected. And in the mean time Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with some Legates (or, Deputies) of the Assembly of Confederates goes to <hi>Trajectum,</hi> and against the will of the Rulers there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms the Guard: though the Deputies from <hi>Holland</hi> did what they could (but all in vain) to hinder it; for they were commanded by their Superiours, to affect the <hi>Trajectin</hi> Rulers to their utmost, and if need were, to admonish the ordinary Soldiers in their service that they should attempt nothing against the will of the said Rulers, by force, in the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the internall government of that Nation, and to the security thereof, being such as every Nation by it self had
<pb facs="tcp:96775:393"/>
reserved in their own power. The King of <hi>France</hi> having receiv'd intelligence of the Differences of his friends, dispatcheth <hi>Bossizius</hi> to them; who in consequence to the things treated on already by <hi>Maurerius,</hi> the same King's Leiger, might pursue all means of reconciliation. In hope whereof, the Rulers of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landian</hi> Towns dismissed their Guards. This was no sooner done, but eight men, in the name of the Confederate States, from whom they had no such Commission, commanded <hi>Oldenbarnveld</hi> (whom the States of <hi>Holland</hi> a little before had taken into their protection) and <hi>Hogerbet</hi> and Me to be apprehended. Against this, the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and the Rulers of our Towns make their complaints. When we were long detein'd in prison, and oft examin'd; Judges at last, in the name of the Confederate States, are given us. Nor did it avail us, to shew out of our Country Laws and Customs, that the Confederate States have no Jurisdiction over them, and that the Judges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for many reasons, were suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. They go on in their Design, and give us not leave, neither to revise what things we written in our exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor to lay open the justice of our cause, nor to prove matters of fact pert eining to our defense, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the witnesses, nor to use Counsil: Sentence of death is pronounc'd upon

                     <hi>Oldenbarneveld,</hi> of perpetual imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Us, of publication of Goods upon all Three. A year after, without hearing us, followed an Interpretation of the sentence, whereby we are pronounced Traitors. I can truly profess, in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against Me, many things were set down beside the truth, many things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly denyed by Me, some things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I was wholly ignorant, some things of which I was not so much as exami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This, and much more would be very evident, if my Answers to every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory in my examination might come to light intire and sincere, as I do earnestly intreat. Before we were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, at <hi>Trajectum</hi> the Noble men and Rulers of the City; whilst we were kept prisoners, all over <hi>Holland,</hi> the Decurions, Consuls, Oppidan Judges are removed before their time, others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in, against the most sacred Laws. established of old by the Oaths of the Earles of <hi>Holland,</hi> and religiously obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many Ages. Before the Synod (which they call'd National) and in the time of it, many Pastors who taught praedestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conditionate (whom they call'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants) are put out of office. Others <note place="margin">Anno 1618.</note> of them being summoned to the Synod are requir'd to plead their cause before their Adversaries, who had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them by their secession, by their
<pb facs="tcp:96775:394"/>
declamation in the Church, by the Synod, and by their writings: neither yet is it granted them to defend their own, and to oppugn the contrary opinion, otherwise than it seemed good unto the Synod, that is, unto their Adversaries. They are cast out of the Synod and condemned. There follow cruel Decrees against the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the condemned opinion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Collection of Alms for the feeding of Pastors, who being expeld or banisht from their Country, if they return, are clapt up in perpetual prison, their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers being invited by Rewards. Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are scattered more unmercifully than the Edicts would bear, by force, and oftentimes not without blood, to the great grief of a huge number of very good Men, lovers of Christian piety and of their Countrey. This is a true Relation of what was done. Now, I profess I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly approve that contempt of the Equity of the <hi>Hollandian</hi> States in their Decrees for a mutual Toleration, nor the condemnation of the Pastors and the things that followed. All which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose had been better prevented upon fair terms, seeing those things could not be profitable to the publick and to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> whose safety and glory (if I mistake not) consists in the good Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people, those especially, who are devoted and addicted to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, such as I judge them that were cast
<pb facs="tcp:96775:395"/>
out of their Magistracy, and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of the overthrown opinion. But, in all those things whereof I am accus'd, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was acted by Me on my one head, but by command both of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and of the Rulers of the Town of <hi>Rotterodam,</hi> to whom, and to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man living, was I bound by my Oath. To whom therefore, when I shewed my Obedience, I was a Traitor to none, but gave that respect both to the highest and to the inferior powers, which Nature and my Office did require. If any one thought he had to complain of that which I had done as the Minister of other men, He was not to proceed against me, but against my superiors. And, if I had done any thing by my own private undertaking (which is not so) yet was I not to be judged by my Adversaries, nor by Judges found of purpose against me, nor by any one who had receiv'd power of judging from the Confederate States, but by the perpetual and my proper Judges, as the Common Laws of our Countrey and the proper Laws of Towns (for which Laws we at first took Arms) appoint. As to my mind and intention, I testify before God and the world, it was no other, than to maintain that lawful form of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth under which I was born and bred, and to procure the unity of the Church by a loving Composure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the divine Precepts: to which
<pb facs="tcp:96775:395"/>
end, many things I proposed, and many I had in readiness, when I was carryed away to prison. Whosoever judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of my Intention, do me injury, and have no just ground of their mistake. My life hath been without stain or spot. The Rulers of <hi>Rotterodam,</hi> in the time of my Office, know what Labours I did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go for the safety and interests of that town. The Curators of the Treasury can witness, how exactly and without favour or fear I defended the rights thereof. The Benches of the Judges in <hi>Holland</hi> have good experience of my integrity in the prosecution of offences. They that have seen me in the Assembly of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and in the Sessions of the Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that Commonwealth, can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what pains I took, that by parsimony and improvement of the Tribute there might be a supply of Money. Nor is Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> ignorant, how I satisfyed his desires in private businesses which he was pleased to commend unto my care. And, They that were together with me in the Assembly of the Confederates, are intreated to call to mind, how I omitted nothing that might conduce, to secure the Publick against the enemies force, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Trade through <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> to continue a fair Amity and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with Kings and other our Confederates and Allies. How heartily I affected the glory of our Commonwealth,
<pb facs="tcp:96775:396"/>
and of all things done valiantly in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense of it, and peculiarly favour'd the renown of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> my Books may testify; which I have partly divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and partly communicated to my friends. For these Offices, if I had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a Reward, truly it had not been without example: but I never regarded that, being content with my salary, and the recompense of a good Name. What Return had I, after all my service? That for the space of nine months, being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously sick, I was kept under a most streight custody, so as I could not so much as once have the comfort to see my wife or any friend: That, in the habit of a guilty person I was brought into that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, wherein I had upheld the honour of Publick Justice. That, being shut up afterward in one chamber, I was so close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded with Soldiers, that my wife sometimes had not liberty to go abroad: That those few Goods I possessed, and (if ever any man) had gotten honestly, were taken from me and my five Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Than all which, yet, This one thing is more grievous, that the eares of my Countreyman and of foreiners are filled with a false rumour, as if I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired and plotted against my Countrey; because, it is incredible to most men, that any Man of truth and honesty should be so used, as I have been. Neither is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury confined to my person alone, but
<pb facs="tcp:96775:396"/>
part of the <hi>odium</hi> and Calumny redounds to those that are allied to me by blood or marriage: who, as publick enemies and traitors, in several places, are persecuted by evil words and deeds. Against all these things, my comfort is in God, and in a good Conscience, and in the example of very many excellent Patriots, who for no sin but for solid vertues sake have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the like Afflictions. Of late, there is come forth a Latin Book of an unknown Writer, who saith, that, by reason of the injuries done me, I will be in affection, if not in body, with the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> This is far from Truth. I know all desire of Revenge is forbidden Christians. To the King of <hi>Spain</hi> I am not obliged, nor do I desire to be obliged. My Body is in <hi>France:</hi> there I live; and so long as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there, I will be faithful and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the King, as tis my duty. Toward my Countrey in the mean time, which hath special need of the Kings friendship, I will preserve the same Affection I ever had, sollicitous for her safety, liberty and profit, and ready to do Her service, if she can make any use of me. For which Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I desire nothing, but that You All of what Order and degree soever (for I know, many among the Rulers too, by the cunning of others, are depriv'd of the true understanding of what was done in our Case) laying aside prejudices, would be pleas'd to judge of mine and other

long examined my Cause in the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of my own Conscience (more sacred to me than all Tribunals) in the inmost recesses of my own Soul I find onely this, that my constant purpose was (li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of opinions in things disputable being preserved) to retain the Unity of the Church; a thing wanting neither old nor new examples. I never meant to innovate any thing in the Common-wealth: it was my hearty endeavour, to maintain their Right, to whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made me a Subject, and my office a Servant, and to whom I was sworn: that Power remaining in the hand of the Confederates, and of the Prince, which hitherto they had enjoy'd, being conferr'd on them by publick suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages. They that know the matter, easily understand this to be our onely crime, that we did not act in the Common-wealth according to those Laws which they were about to constitute for their own Interest. If, upon that account, we are depriv'd of our Goods, Honours, Fame, this also is not without example. But the worst of all is, that, both the infirmity of my body is denied the free air, and the sadness of my mind the comfort of my friends. Yet, by Gods assistance, I will endure this, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever can be imagined more cruel, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ask pardon of those things wherein my mind acknowledges no fault.
<pb facs="tcp:96775:398"/>
If there be any honest way of getting liberty, I would owe it to none more willingly than to your King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; whose infinite merits towards our Common-wealth, I alwaies have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled, whose friendship I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, whose wholsome Counsels I have defended from the calumniation of Enemies, both at liberty, and in my captivity, and the like I shall never cease to do. And, God grant I may live to transmit unto Posterity, together with those publick benefits, this private one conferr'd on me, by some Monuments of Learning. That certainly will be to me the greatest fruit both of my life and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But, if that be above our Hope, yet whatever shall be performed for me and <hi>Hogerbet</hi> (whose cause being most near to mine, I equally commend) will, among our Countrymen of the highest, midst and lowest order, be most gratefull and glorious.</p>

Your Affection was never the less, though God prevented you, and took unto himself the Glory of the Work. And now, the Favours you do me, and offer me, are so great, that if any could be equall'd with the Good of Liberty, They might, which are of much concernment to my life, safety, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I have chosen my first Refuge in this City, that I might here explore, whether it be a seasonable time for me to go into <hi>France,</hi> while the Embassie of our Countrymen, (I cannot say, of our Friends) is there. For that reason, I have written to the most honour'd, the President <hi>Janninus.</hi> But, what I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from him, I find abundantly in your Letter. Wherefore, by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, I will follow your Counsel. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I betake my self, and render Thanks to my good Friends, that have labour'd so much to procure my Liberty. <hi>In the next Epistle</hi> (from <hi>Paris) to the same Person, he saith:</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:96775:400"/>
you, in your favours and graces toward me. This I perceive by their love, whom your love chiefly hath made to be my Friends. <hi>Putean</hi> and <hi>Peiresc,</hi> so soon as they heard of my commlng, ran pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to bid me welcome, and obliged me by their extreme courtesy. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident <hi>Janinus</hi> sent his Letters to me, while he suppos'd I stay'd at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> overflowing with Kindness, and (which I esteem greatest) giving as large a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of our Innocence, as could be wisht. Thus kind I found <hi>Boissizius</hi> also, whom I met at his own house, where he stay'd for me, being about to go to Court. By the advice of them Both, I rest at <hi>Paris,</hi> ready to follow that way for the future, which they shall think good, to whose wisdom, fidelity, and friendship, I do entirely commit my self.</p>

Such a Body of Churches being once constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is hope, their Neighbours, one after another, will by degrees close with them. And this is the more to be desir'd by Protestants, because Many do every day forsake them, and joyn with the Romanists, for no other Reason, but because they are not one Body, but distracted parties, separated Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, having every one a peculiar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Rites, and moreover striving one to disgrace the other with reproaches.

And I mean Peace without injury to that Truth, which the Scripture and perpetual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition consign unto us.

                     <note n="*" place="margin">J. Quistorpii Epistola. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoch. Sept. 1645.</note> You are earnest with me, to relate the last act of that Phoenix of learned men <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> and how he behaved himself, when he took his leave of this world. Here take it, briefly thus. He took ship at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> bound for <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec.</hi> At Sea he met with a great Storm, and having been beaten with it, and tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the space of three dayes, he suffers Shipwrack, and is cast upon the shore of <hi>Cassubia</hi> sick and weak: Thence, in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry incommodious Journey, and a rainy season, passing sixty miles and more, he is brought at length to <hi>Rostoch.</hi> He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to <hi>Balemannia,</hi> and sends for <hi>Dr. Stochman</hi> the Physician; who observing the weakness of his body, by reason of age, shipwrack, and the incommodities of the journey, presageth the end of his life to be at hand. The next day after his entrance into this City (which in the old style was the XVIII. of <hi>August)</hi> about IX. at night he requesteth me to visit him. I came, and found the Man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching neer to the agony of death: I saluted him, and signifyed how happy I should have been to have had conference with him, had he been in health. His ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer was, <hi>Ita Deo visum fuit:</hi> Thus it hath pleased God. I go on, and advise him to compose himself to a happy depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to acknowledge himself a sinner, and repent of whatsoever he had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss:
<pb facs="tcp:96775:406"/>
and when, as we discoursed, I had mentioned the <hi>Publican</hi> confessing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a sinner, and praying God to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull unto him, He answers; <hi>Ego ille sum Publicanus:</hi> I am that Publican. I proceed, and remit him to Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom there is no salvation. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes: <hi>In solo Christo omnis spes mea est reposita:</hi> In Christ alone is placed all my Hope. I rehearsed with a loud voice that <hi>German</hi> Prayer in the <hi>German</hi> tongue, <hi>Horr Jesu, wahrer Mensch und Gott, &amp;c.</hi> He, with closed hands and a low voice said after me. When I had done, I asked whether he had understood me: He ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, <hi>Probe intellexi:</hi> I understand you well. Afterward, I repeated some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages out of the Word of God, which dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men are wont to be put in minde of, and I ask again, whether he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood me: <hi>I hear your voyce,</hi> saith he, <hi>but hardly understand what you say.</hi> Then he became speechless, and in a short time after gave up the Ghost, just at twelve, midnight. Thus have you the Catastrophe of <hi>Grotius,</hi> the last end of this excellent Man's Life. His dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was committed to the Physicians. His Bowells were put in a Vessel of Brass, and that they might be laid up in the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable place of our principal Church dedicate to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> I easily obtained of the Governours. <hi>Let him rest in Peace.</hi>
