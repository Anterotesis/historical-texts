            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

kept from fainting, and that he doth ſeal up inſtruction to their ſouls, leading them to the Rivers of Pleaſures, cauſing them to drink deep of his Love and Free-Grace in his dear Son: Oh what a choice Mercy it is, that the Moſt High God ſhould ſo far condeſcend, as to have regard to ſuch worthleſs Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; who in the day of their fulneſs ſo much provoked the Eternal God by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs and miſ-improvement of ſuch Choice Mercy, as the Mercy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is.</p>
            <p>It is wonderful Grace that God ſhould (notwithſtanding ſuch provocations wherewith he hath been provoked by Congregations in general, and by every Member in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) ſtill continue the good ſavour of his Grace upon the hearts of any of them, or that he ſhould account any of his poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants worthy to ſuffer Reproach and Bonds for his ſake.</p>
            <p>Which Mercy (which I eſteem very choice and ſweet to my ſoul) he hath been pleaſed for ſome time to let me enjoy; which is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in my ſight, that ſuch a nothing,

            <p>Yet notwithſtanding the length of time I have been in durance, I find my heart is not ſo cleanſed and brought to the foot of Chriſt, as I hope it may, and wait it ſhould.</p>
            <p>And if it ſo pleaſe the Lord to ſanctifie theſe Bonds, that I may by the help of his holy Spirit ſo crucifie the remains of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that I find ſtill in my heart, and ſubdue, and bring in ſubjection every vain imagination, that every high thing that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts it ſelf, may be brought in obedience to the King, then may I bleſs the Lord for the day that ever I lay in <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The which I may ſay I am engaged (and not without cauſe) already to do, for aſmuch as God hath let me ſee my ſelf, and the baſeneſs of my own heart, the unbelief and diffidence that lodgeth there in ſome meaſure, which give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have in this Poem rudely ſcattered here and there ſome of thoſe <hi>MEDITATIONS</hi> and <hi>EXPERIENCES,</hi> that God hath been pleaſed to viſit my Soul with; the which I preſent to the view, and commend to the ſerious thoughts of all the Faithful, but more particularly, to that Remnant and choſen ones to whom I ſtand more immediately and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly related in the bonds of the Goſpel:</p>

            <l>I think their will's their Law, I cannot ſee</l>

            <l>What ſhould the reaſon be, they nought will have,</l>

            <l>Within ſtone walls, and bars of iron ſtrong,</l>
            <l>As if I had done unto them ſuch wrong,</l>

            <l>I am an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, and am born free:</l>
            <l>My Birth-right is not then without juſt cauſe</l>

            <l>That I muſt lie in Priſon night and day?</l>
            <l>For that, and for no other cauſe do know,</l>

            <l>And therefore thus ſaith ſhe, Chriſt did ordain,</l>
            <l>And left in charge until he came again,</l>

            <l>His blood likewiſe, and therefore <hi>Rome</hi> doth will</l>
            <l>That none ſhould now receive in both the kinds;</l>
            <l>A pretty querk of hers to blind the minds</l>

            <l>For <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf did for him this deviſe;</l>

            <l>That Bread &amp; Wine ſhould be ſo much disjointed;</l>
            <l>For when the Bread Chriſt his Diſciples gave,</l>
            <l>He never will'd the Cup they ſhould not have,</l>
            <l>But in like manner he the Wine did bleſs,</l>
            <l>And alſo ſaid, <hi>Take, drink ye all of this</hi>;</l>

               <hi>This is my Body</hi>; and we alſo know</l>

            <l>The Wine <hi>his Blood,</hi> but ſacramentally;</l>
            <l>It muſt be underſtood to be to them</l>

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:55072:51"/>That Faith that Jeſus Chriſt unto them gave;</l>
            <l>For there is no man on the earth can have</l>

            <l>For that Prerogative is his, and none</l>

            <l>She doth by force preſume to contradict</l>
            <l>That precious Faith, the Faith of Gods elect:</l>
            <l>Nay, ſuch ſhe ſaith is her Authority,</l>
            <l>That Kings and Princes ſhe dares to defie;</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Peter</hi> never had; then this, if true,</l>
            <l>She <hi>Peters</hi> Faith and Practice never knew.</l>
            <l>And therefore it (concluding) is that <hi>Rome</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Hath not <hi>Antiquity</hi> beyond what ſome</l>

            <l>The next thing which we chiefly are to heed,</l>

            <l>And that from him, and ſince down all along,</l>
            <l>Which ſhe will prove by arguments ſo ſtrong,</l>
            <l>That none ſhall them oppoſe; her reaſons are</l>
            <l>So wicked ſtrong indeed, that no man dare.</l>
            <l>As for her arguments, the beſt are theſe,</l>
            <l>If any <hi>Rome</hi> oppoſe, or her diſpleaſe,</l>
            <l>Away with him unto the Inquiſition,</l>
            <l>Or, take him Gaoler, grant him no permiſſion</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:55072:51"/>Of any Liberty, but keep him from</l>
            <l>His Friends, or thoſe that unto him would come,</l>
            <l>And keep him there cloſe up ſome months or years,</l>
            <l>And then he will conform, be fill'd with fears</l>
            <l>Of worſer things that after will enſue:</l>
            <l>If all theſe fail, and none of them will do,</l>
            <l>Then out ſhe brings that argument at laſt</l>
            <l>That is the ſtrongeſt, and that keeps them faſt:</l>
            <l>Unto the queſtion anſwer <hi>Yea,</hi> or <hi>no,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Will you conform, or to the Fire go?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The ſtrongeſt argument <hi>Rome</hi> hath is Fire,</l>
            <l>Which is confuted when Saints do expire</l>
            <l>In flames, as Witneſſes of Chriſt againſt</l>
            <l>Her Uſurpation, Darkneſs, Ignorance,</l>
            <l>That ſhe hath introduc'd, and caus'd to be</l>
            <l>Committed ever ſince the time that ſhe</l>
            <l>A right did plead or claim unto <hi>Succeſſion</hi>
            </l>
            <l>(As ſhe pretends) to <hi>Peters</hi> great Commiſſion.</l>
            <l>But alſo unto this we do reply,</l>
            <l>She doth not him ſucceed; the reaſon why,</l>
            <l>Is very clear, exceeding plain, that ſhe</l>
            <l>A Succeſſor of <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be;</l>
            <l>Becauſe that none but thoſe of <hi>Peters</hi> Faith</l>
            <l>Can him ſucceed, or that from <hi>Peter</hi> hath</l>
            <l>Receiv'd Commiſſion or Authority</l>
            <l>To be a Biſhop, or to uſe thereby</l>
            <l>The Pow'r of Chriſt, to rule or take the care</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55072:52"/>Nor pomp and ſtate, nor have things as they will,</l>
            <l>But muſt deny themſelves, if they'l fulfil</l>
            <l>Their Miniſtry with joy, which they receiv'd</l>
            <l>Of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom they have believ'd,</l>
            <l>And ready be to offer up their All</l>
            <l>For him, and for his Flock, if God ſhould call</l>
            <l>Them forth to ſuch a ſervice and a work,</l>
            <l>Them to defend againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Turk:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Defend, I ſay, by ſound and wholſome preaching</l>
            <l>Of Goſpel-truths, and them confirm by teaching,</l>
            <l>To let them underſtand, to ſee and know</l>
            <l>What great Impoſtors there's at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhow</l>
            <l>Their great prophaneneſs, and their filthy pride,</l>
            <l>Idolatry and cruelty beſide.</l>
            <l>But as I ſaid, <hi>Succeſſion</hi> no man hath,</l>
            <l>But ſuch as follow Chriſt, and keep the Faith,</l>
            <l>That precious Faith which <hi>Peter</hi> had, and none</l>
            <l>But that which Chriſt did build his Church upon:</l>
            <l>For thoſe that do ſucceed in that true Faith,</l>
            <l>They, and no other, true <hi>Succeſſion</hi> hath;</l>
            <l>Which all impartial men may clearly ſee</l>
            <l>By what <hi>Paul</hi> writeth unto <hi>Timothy:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>This charge he gives to <hi>Timothy, That all</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>The things that Timothy had heard of Paul,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Among thoſe many witneſſes, that he</l>

            <l>That <hi>erred from the Faith,</hi> or thought it much</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55072:52"/>
               <hi>To feed the Flock,</hi> except they had the <hi>wool,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And would <hi>make war</hi> except their <hi>mouths were full</hi>:</l>
            <l>But unto ſuch whoſe lives were commendable,</l>
            <l>And who to teach the Truth were very able,</l>
            <l>That they likewiſe to other <hi>faithful men</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Should give the ſelf-ſame charge as <hi>Paul</hi> did then;</l>
            <l>That down along none ſhould ſucceed but he</l>
            <l>That kept the Faith. From time to time you ſee</l>
            <l>From what is ſaid it doth appear ſo plain,</l>
            <l>That there doth no <hi>Succeſſion</hi> now remain</l>
            <l>In <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> now hath wrackt and loſt</l>
            <l>The Faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> whereof ſhe doth boaſt,</l>
            <l>For ſhe that Faith hath often ſtigmatiz'd</l>
            <l>With ſuch defame, and hath apoſtatiz'd,</l>
            <l>That long ago ſhe her <hi>Succeſſion</hi> loſt,</l>
            <l>And Chriſt withall, ſhe chang'd him for the Hoſt</l>
            <l>Which now ſhe doth adore, and fall down to,</l>
            <l>And therefore let us give the Whore her due;</l>
            <l>If any one there be ſhe doth ſucceed,</l>
            <l>It is the Serpent, for ſhe doth proceed</l>
            <l>So fully in his ways and paths ſhe goes,</l>
            <l>That ſhe's a friend to none that are his foes:</l>
            <l>Then none but blind men can perſwaded be,</l>
            <l>But ſhe her power hath from none but he,</l>
            <l>For him ſhe is a faithful ſervant to,</l>
            <l>And therefore her Authority 'tis true</l>
            <l>Doth come from him, and him ſhe doth ſucceed,</l>
            <l>He is her Father, and her help in need.</l>
            <l>If <hi>Rome</hi> will wipe away this great defame</l>
            <l>And filthy blot that is upon her Name,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:55072:53"/>That ſhe doth not ſucceed good <hi>Peter</hi> in</l>
            <l>The ſacred Chair; then let her now begin</l>
            <l>To prove from Scripture, if ſhe can, that ſhe</l>
            <l>The faith of <hi>Peter</hi> hath; and if ſo be</l>
            <l>That ſhe can prove her idle god of Bread</l>
            <l>To be that man that's riſen from the dead,</l>
            <l>And dyed for our ſins, and roſe again,</l>
            <l>And went to Heav'n, where now he doth remain;</l>
            <l>Unleſs ſhe prove, I ſay, he came from thence,</l>
            <l>And is become a bit of Bread, from whence</l>
            <l>He doth into her filthy belly go,</l>
            <l>And whither then, all men, but fools, may know:</l>
            <l>Which blaſphemies were never thought by <hi>Peter,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>'Twas never known that man could eat his Maker.</l>
            <l>I then conclude in ſpight of Pope or Hell,</l>
            <l>Do what they can, true Faith will bear the Bell.</l>
            <l>And though the Whore pretends ſo much to be</l>
            <l>Poſſeſt by <hi>Peter</hi> with the ſacred Key,</l>
            <l>And that without all kind of intermiſſion,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Popes</hi> have followed <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Succeſſion,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The truth of which we do more then ſuſpect,</l>
            <l>Becauſe his Faith and Words ſhe doth reject:</l>
            <l>For his Authority ſhe will not take,</l>
            <l>Nor no account of that or him doth make</l>
            <l>To be a Rule to her for what ſhe doth</l>

            <l>They alſo teach that we ſhould bravely paint</l>
            <l>Their Images, that we may ſee, and have</l>
            <l>A high eſteem of them when ere we crave</l>

            <l>They alſo teach we muſt not be unkind,</l>

            <l>That he for us may willingly preſent</l>
            <l>What we do crave to God above, and then</l>
            <l>They us perſwade, and we believe that when</l>
            <l>This is perform'd, we merit ſuch acceſs</l>
            <l>Unto this Saint, that us he will ſo bleſs,</l>
            <l>We need not fear but he will ſend us down</l>
            <l>Such ſtore of Pardons, ſealed in his Throne;</l>
            <l>Or give ſuch order unto them that are</l>

            <l>We ſhall not miſs nor fail of the remiſſion</l>
            <l>Of all our ſins, though great, and ſuch as be</l>
            <l>As black as Hell it ſelf; then what care we</l>
            <l>If we our pleaſure take and live in ſin,</l>
            <l>Tuſh, we'l not care nor matter that a pin:</l>
            <l>For if we ſhould ſome beaſtly ſin commit,</l>
            <l>Such that we muſt ſome penance do for it,</l>
            <l>Or go ſometime a Pilgrimage agin</l>
            <l>To invocate ſome Saint for this foul ſin;</l>
            <l>'Tis but the giving him another bribe,</l>

            <l>They never think of thoſe like wrongs too much.</l>
            <l>Theſe are the things the Fathers teach, and ſay,</l>
            <l>(Which if we do) they lead the ready way</l>
            <l>To happineſs. Oh! what a thing is this,</l>
            <l>That we ſo eaſily can go to bliſs!</l>
            <l>But if (they ſay) we in the Scripture look,</l>
            <l>And pore therein, and do what that ſame Book</l>

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55072:54"/>Doth teach to do, we never then ſhall find</l>
            <l>That good content and quietneſs of mind</l>

            <l>And we believe in that they tell us true:</l>
            <l>We willingly conſent unto their motion,</l>
            <l>For<hi> Ignorance is mother of Devotion.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus doth this blind Whore lead the blind along</l>
            <l>With ſuch deceits, ſo powerful and ſtrong,</l>
            <l>That with this cord ſhe binds them all ſo faſt,</l>

            <l>It is the promiſe of the Father he</l>

            <l>To rule the Nations with an Iron Rod;</l>
            <l>This ſhall be given to him by his God:</l>
            <l>For 'tis the Covenant his Father made</l>

            <l>Should ſit and rule upon the Throne for ever,</l>

            <l>Both he and they together ſhall ſit down</l>

            <l>For part of this believed is by <hi>Rome</hi>:</l>
            <l>To wit, that Chriſt was of a virgin born,</l>

            <l>I here conclude, it is a certain truth,</l>

            <l>For on the Earth once <hi>Davids</hi> throne was plac'd,</l>

            <l>For on the throne of <hi>David</hi> he ſhall ſit,</l>

               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:55072:68"/>But here by ſome it may objected be,</l>
            <l>That Chriſt doth reign now on the earth, and he</l>
            <l>Exalted is already by his Father,</l>
            <l>And ſhall not rule nor reign on Earth no other-</l>
            <l>Wiſe, than by his Wiſdom, Strength and Pow'r</l>

            <l>Was great Commander univerſallie,</l>
            <l>O're all the world, it clearly follow will,</l>
            <l>Thoſe Propheſies God did not then fulfil</l>
            <l>In <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe it's plain that he</l>

            <l>Not ſuch a corrupt Crown that fades away,</l>
            <l>But ſuch a Crown of Life that won't decay:</l>
            <l>Then fear not little Flock, for 'tis the pleaſure</l>
            <l>Of God your Father to give you the treaſure</l>
            <l>That's in a Crown; by Grace he will you ſave,</l>

            <l>And now hath made you Kings &amp; Prieſts by birth,</l>
            <l>And one day you ſhall reign with him on earth.</l>
            <l>Then ſhall that Princely, Heav'nly ſong be ſung</l>
            <l>On Harps of God moſt ſweetly tun'd and ſtrung,</l>

            <l>For then the glory of the Lord they'l ſee,</l>
            <l>The Lamb will always with them preſent be:</l>
            <l>They then will God ſee face to face, no blame</l>
            <l>Will he find in them, but will write his Name</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:55072:78"/>Upon their foreheads, he will dwell with them,</l>
            <l>And they for evermore ſhall be with him;</l>
            <l>They then ſhall be his people, he will be</l>
            <l>Their God for ever, to eternitie.</l>
            <l>Then ſhall they hear no ſighing nor no cries,</l>
            <l>All tears he'l wipe away from off their eyes.</l>
            <l>No death nor mourning, ſorrow, greif nor pain,</l>
            <l>Shall ever overtake thoſe ſouls again;</l>
            <l>For ſuch things then there will be left no room,</l>
            <l>Becauſe the Bride enjoys her dear Bridegroom.</l>
            <l>If ſhe rejoiceth now to hear his voice,</l>
            <l>When ſhe his face ſhall ſee, ſhe may rejoice:</l>
            <l>When ſhe beholds his perſon, and doth ſee</l>
            <l>His Beauty, Glory, and his Majeſtie;</l>
            <l>All former things with her will paſs away,</l>
            <l>Now ſhe can ſing, and on Gods Harps can play.</l>
            <l>Nothing can her to grief or ſorrow move;</l>
            <l>How can ſhe mourn, that hath her fill of Love?</l>
            <l>What ere ſhe did here in this mortal ſtate,</l>
            <l>She'l now rejoice, to mourn it is too late.</l>
            <l>The Bride did mourn and weep while he was gone</l>
            <l>Who is her Bridegroom, though ſhe wan't alone.</l>
            <l>Her heart was with him, he with hers, and ſtill</l>
            <l>He with his Spirit did her always fill</l>
            <l>With full aſſurance that ſhe was his Bride,</l>
            <l>And that he from her went but to provide</l>
            <l>A City and a Manſion for each one,</l>
            <l>And then he'd come, and leave no more his own</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:55072:78"/>And wel-beloved Spouſe, his chiefeſt Joy,</l>
            <l>His Darling to the Lions to anoy;</l>
            <l>Who can report the joy when ſhe goes thither,</l>
            <l>She there wil meet with when they meet together?</l>
            <l>Thus have I hinted, as I ſaid I would</l>
            <l>In ſuch a place, ſo well as well I could,</l>
            <l>The doubtleſs fall of that great <hi>Scarlet Whore,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who in her loftineſs and pride doth ſoar</l>
            <l>Above the Throne of Kings, but ſhe ſhall be</l>
            <l>Thrown down from thence into the deepeſt Sea,</l>
            <l>From whence ſhe nevermore ſhall riſe again,</l>
            <l>The healing of her breach will be in vain.</l>
            <l>And as I promiſ'd, ſo I've now perform'd,</l>
            <l>To hint that Chriſt ſhall one day be enthron'd;</l>
            <l>Yet one or two words more by way of uſe</l>
            <l>I ſtill have yet to ſay, which may produce</l>
            <l>Some good effect to ſome, though not to all,</l>
            <l>But to the Whore (I think) 'twill none at all;</l>
            <l>But ſome there be which are of her, that yet</l>
            <l>Adore her much, if they'l reade what is writ,</l>
            <l>(I mean her plagues here hinted in this book)</l>
            <l>It may provoke them now about to look,</l>
            <l>If they'l conſider well what Sorcery,</l>
            <l>What Fornications and Idolatry,</l>
            <l>What guiltineſs there is upon her ſtill</l>
            <l>Of th' Martyrs blood which ſhe a Sea did ſpill:</l>
            <l>Who knows but that it may a motive prove,</l>
            <l>Some one, or more, from off their lees to move:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:55072:79"/>And who can tell but this may call forth ſome</l>
            <l>From out of her, leſt they ſhare in her doom;</l>
            <l>When they ſhall reade her ſins her plagues withal,</l>
            <l>Or elſe partake with her in her great fall?</l>
            <l>And therefore let it be a uſe of terror,</l>
            <l>Of great aſtoniſhment, of fear and horror</l>
            <l>Unto the Pope and all his Cardinals,</l>
            <l>His Moncks and Friers, ev'n thoſe <hi>Canibals,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who eat the fleſh of men, trade with their ſouls,</l>
            <l>And drink the blood of Saints, as Wine in bowls;</l>
            <l>Let pains, and pangs, and ſorrows on them ſeize;</l>
            <l>The time doth haſten now, when God will eaſe</l>
            <l>Himſelf of ſuch an evil Generation,</l>
            <l>Who are ſuch foes to Chriſt, his Death and Paſſion,</l>
            <l>Whom they would tear &amp; pluck out of his throne,</l>
            <l>If they thereby could but keep up their own.</l>
            <l>The next and laſt word I intend to ſpeak</l>

            <l>A refuge from the ſtorm, and from the heat</l>
            <l>A ſhadow is when grievous ſtorms do beat;</l>
            <l>The ſtorm of furious ones, whoſe blaſt doth fall</l>

            <l>Afflictions are but light, the Glory's pondrous</l>
