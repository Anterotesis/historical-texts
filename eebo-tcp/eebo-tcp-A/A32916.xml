            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Church-Lurcher Unkennelled.</head>
            <p>WHere men are confident, that, through the partiallity or prejudice of the Hearers or Readers, their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are condemned already; they ſtudy not ſo much how to argue, as to reproach; nor how to prove a guilt, as how to aggravate a guilt preſumed. Such hath been the fair dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we Sufferers have had from our Oppreſſors in theſe late days. The queſtion never being put, <hi>Whether according to the Rule</hi> of the Scripture we were capacitated for the Miniſtery? or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule of the Law of the Land rightly inveſted in our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings?</p>
            <p>But they thought it enough to run us down with a full cry' <hi>that we were Baalls Pri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſts,</hi> Ceremony-mongers, Popiſhly-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Malignants, Formaliſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to exalt themſelves for the only Soul-ſaving ſin-ſwinging, Church-reforming, Ordinances purifying Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40253:3"/>But (we hope) it is not an affected and ill-joynted Cant, that will charm thoſe juſt &amp; rightful Judges, before whom our Cauſe is now depending; And to them: and all the world in the name of our ſelves and our ſuffering Brethren, we are confident to offer theſe things;</p>
            <p>Firſt, That if any of us, who were ejected, were ever proved either Ignorant, Scandalous, or Superſtitious, we are contented to be again turned out of our Livings, the very next day, after the Law hath re-ſettled us therein.</p>
            <p>Only this we hope, that we ſhall not be judged (as of late we were) by <hi>Taylors</hi> and <hi>Shoe-makers, Joyners</hi> and <hi>Pewterers,</hi> or (which is worſe) <hi>Anabaptists, Socinians, Quakers, Athieſts, King-killers,</hi> with two or three dull Temporizers, ſhuffled in for Aſſiſtants; nor that we ſhall have our uſing the Lords Prayer, or kneeling at our prayers or being uncovered at the worſhip of God, to go for Superſtition; or our Loyalty to our Sovereign, and Obedience to lawful Conſtitutions, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil to be reckoned for ſcandal.</p>
            <p>Let th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe judge us, that by the Rule of the Scriptures, and the Law of the Land are to judge us, and let them judge us by thoſe two <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ules, and we are contented to ſtand, or fall, as ſuch a Judgment ſhall conclude of us. We are moſt of us as ready to confeſs, as our Adverſaries are to charge it, that there were many who deſerved cenſure.</p>
            <p>But that it was not their demerits and guilt, (but either the value of their Benefices, or the conſiderableneſs of their Parts and reputation) that laid moſt of us under the cenſure of the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Powers, we could eaſily evince, if the world had not already, the proof of it ſo clear, that they have brought it to a Proverb, <hi>Such a mans Living o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his Learning made him a Malignant.</hi> And if our Adverſaries will call for further proof, they muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us, if we come to names, in telling the Story, that when one of their own gang in the Univerſity begged <hi>That his Tutor might not be ejected,</hi> pleading, <hi>that he was a very honeſt, godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſome replyed, <hi>Oh! but your Tutor, being not for our cauſe he muſt be the rather ejected; for ſuch a one will do our Cauſe more harm, then if he were either Ignorant, or Scand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.</hi> And it is no hard matter, to gather up a Jury of ſuch
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40253:3"/>
abominable tranſactions, that will evidence, the deſigne not to have been for real reformation, but the ſetting up of their own faction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This we offer to prove (every man of us) againſt his own Church Pyrate, that he is, or hath been ignorant, or ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or in default of our proof, wee'l diſcharge them, for all the profits of our livings, and places, except the fifth<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; And that they may ſee we can make good this offer in a great meaſure, let them but call for one, that ran through ſequeſtered Living after Living, and in one dropt a Son, in another a Son in Law, in a third a Kinſman, and we can tell how to ſpell his name.</p>
            <p>Let them inquire for another that had Preached againſt ſelf (till as the Mayor of the Town told him) he had preached ſelf into above a 1000l. <hi>per annum</hi>—and we ſuppoſe we ſhall be able eaſily to anſwer the queſtion: Or if they ſend hue and cry after Convict Drunkards, Extortioners, Revilers, Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their very Fathers to forſwear themſelves, or thoſe who promoted the firſt Petition to bring the King to his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Condemnation; and men of the like brand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are ſure we can name ſome ſuch poſſeſt at preſent (or very lately) of ſome of our livings.</p>
            <p>But we confeſs the very writing of theſe Blanks is that which we could hardly have brought our ſelves to, had we not ſeen it neceſſary to ſtop the mouths of our Slanderers by juſt recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Not that we accuſe all: For here we f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eely profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (and we are ſure we can have the ſuffrages of multitudes of our ſuffering Brethren in this matter,) that many who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon living that were vac<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nted by ſequeſtration, yet were men very learned, truly Godly, Charitable, Humble, and Juſt and eminently labourious in the work of their Miniſtery, and took up the places they entred on, for the works ſake, not for the wages.</p>
            <p>And we our ſelves know many of them ſo well qualified, that we could readily have ſet down under their Miniſtry, and Communicated in all Ordinances with them, during the violent ſuſpenſion of our ſelves from the exerciſe of our Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>But we deny again, this laſt Character to be due to any, who contrived aud promoted the ejecting of a Miniſter, and entred

            <p>But this is the Queſtion, <hi>Whether thoſe Lights which the Law of the Land ſet up in the Candleſticks, or thoſe Williams-with the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſpe, that violence and uſurpation conjured up, have the beſt claim to the Candleſticks?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queſtion is not, Whether or no an hopeful Reformation ſhall be made blank and voided? But, <hi>Whether Oppreſſion ſhall prevail under the name of Reformation?</hi> For many of us can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs in the preſence of God, That our prayers to him and our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with men, have been frequent and ſincere, to this effect;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40253:4"/>
That the Nation might be reformed from ignorance and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Sectarianiſme, and be made a Body of intelligent, ſerious and united Chriſtians. And if any amongſt us ſtrive to hinder that work, wee'l joyn in reading from Mount <hi>Ebal</hi> that curſe againſt ſuch Let <hi>the great Maſter</hi> lay them aſide as veſſeſs, in which he hath no pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Here therefore we adjure our Brethren (who own the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſcience of what is juſt and equal; not to labour fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by clamour, and importunity, and falſe imputations to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Sacred Majeſty, and this his happy Parliament, from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to our juſt Suits, and the cryes of our impoveriſhed Wives and Children, and the groans and deſires of our ſcattered ſlocks, whoſe eyes &amp; hearts are generally toward us their lawful Paſtours.</p>
            <p>Our Deſires are not to obſtruct the way of any that have been in our Livings, (if deſerving men) from ſuch preferments, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments as they may lawfully purſue.</p>
            <p>And we confeſs, there are many of them of ſuch eminency, for Parts, and Piety, &amp; Moderation, that they are much likelyer to be exalted to the higheſt Spheres in the Church, then moſt of us a<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But this we ask (not only for our own ſakes, but that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry be not blamed, and that a ſtumbled block may not be laid in the way of worldlings, (who plead Miniſters leaping upon other mens threſholds) to the hardening of themſelves, and that the mouths of our common Adverſarys may be ſtopped) give us up our Rights, ſhew that you did but take the charge of the ſlocks, till the rightful Shepherds were again free to look to them, and ſtop the further progreſs of that jealouſie, that is already entred into the heads of ſome (both your and our betters:) That the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters manifeſt ſuch diſcontents, and ſpirit their prayers and preaching with the former pretences of fears and jealouſies, not becauſe of their diſtances from the Epiſcopal in point of Church Order, but for fear they ſhould (by Law) be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to forgoe the ſweet Morſels of ſequeſtred Living.</p>
            <p>We are ſure many of you abhor from any thing that may give riſe to this Suſpiicion, and for thoſe that do otherwiſe, the Lord will judge them.</p>
