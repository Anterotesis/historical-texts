         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God to direct me to a further
<pb facs="tcp:23187:6"/>
labour herein, waigh with mee I
pray thee in equitie these reasons
hereof:</p>
            <p>First I doe hereby professe my
thankefulnes vnto God for those
excellent labours of his Saints that
now rest from their labours and
their fruits follow them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would haue thee
know that I am not ashamed of this
foolishnes of preaching and practick
Diuinity, which is such a mysterie
to the world, and stumbling blocke
vnto the wisedome thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Howsoeuer I do professe
that I am not able to attaine such
perfection, as I haue herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceined,
yet I would haue thee
know further, that I would rather
haue a rule to condemne sinne in
the flesh, and so confound the old

not to giue testimony to that ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the sunne, and not be warme, and
where twolie together, will there
not be heat? and can the light be

            <p>5 Can wee doe lesse in these
dayes then conuince a prophane

            <p>6 Can wee doe better then
strengthen that which is readie to

            <p>7 Shall not Gods remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
renue their strength, when the
diuels instruments do so rage with
all licentiousnes?</p>
            <p>8 Doe we not iustifie the good

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We must not speake that
of our neighbour which we know and is
necessary to be knowne to all persons, <hi>as
neither,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the weake, lest they stumble
at it; nor to the wicked, lest they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
in the infirmities of others. Gen.
8. 2. Sam. 1.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Some may speak that euill of
their brethren which it is not lawful for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23187:48"/>
others.</hi> As the Magistrate or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in reproouing of sinne may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base
the persons with names sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with their sinnes. Galla. 4. 1.
Matth. 3. which priuate men may
nor doe.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>If it be thought fit to mention the
euill which we know by any man,</hi> here
first it must bee done onely in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
manner, the person and all
circumstances which will descrie
the parson concealed. 1. Cor. 6. 11.
2. Sam. 12. 1.</p>
            <p>6 The partie also in some cases may
bee discouered, but yet with a double
respect:</p>
            <p>First, if his sinne be of infirmitie,
here wee may in some sort <hi>conceale
the sinne.</hi> As</p>
            <p>1 That it might bee mistaken
in regard of the person. Actes 3.
17.</p>
            <p>2 That the fact may bee mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reported
and falsely conceiued
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>If we see the partie ashamed, and
cast downe for his sinne, here wee are
bound much more to couer it, <hi>And that</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>From God</hi> by harty praier, that it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23187:48"/>
may be forgiuen. Actes 7. Matth.
27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>From our selues,</hi> And
that</p>
            <p>1 By not taking notice of it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
            <p>2 Not beleeuing it.</p>
            <p>3 Interpreting it to the best.</p>
            <p>4 Forgiuing it, if it be apparent.</p>
            <p>3 We must also hide the sinne from
the sinner. <hi>And that</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, If we see him vnfit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued.
1. Sam. 25.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we see him suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
checked already by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
then we must also hide his
sinne from him. <hi>And that</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 By opposing his contrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
Act. 3. 17. Rom. 10. 2.</p>
            <p>2 Comforting him, with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
course of holines.</p>
            <p>3 From the occasion, that it was
in his heat, or prouoked thereto in
his defence.</p>
            <p>4 From the qualitie, that it was
in ignorance, not wilfulnes, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
not presumption.</p>
            <p>5 From Gods mercie, which is
aboue all his sinne. Rom. 5. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:23187:49"/>
6 Age, that it was done in his
youth. Psal. 25. 7.</p>
            <p>7 The time of life, that yet there
is hope to recouer. Psal. 95. 2. Tim.
2. 25. and that it was but the first in
that kind.</p>
            <p>8 From the examples of the
Saints, the best of whom haue had
their slips. Iam. 3. 2 Psal. 19.</p>
            <p>9 From his person, opposing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good parts to counteruaile that
euill. 1. Kin. 15. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus may we hide the sinne from
the sinner, and thus also may
we hide his sinne from the
world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the sinne be grieuous and cannot
be excused, yet heere we must moderate
our speech:</p>
            <p>1 And prepare mercie for the
party.</p>
            <p>2 Acknowledge wee it might
haue beene our case, if God should
haue left vs, and so may be. Galat.
6. 1.</p>
            <p>3 Intimating his sorrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of the fact, as the truth shal
be. 2. Cor. 2. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>4 Recounting circumstances that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23187:49"/>
induced thereunto, though not to
excuse altogether, yet to diminish
the same, or at least to make known
the deceitfulnes of sinne.</p>
            <p>5 Labour his outward release
from the hope of the time to come.</p>
            <p>6 Howsoeuer; commend his
case to the Church in prayer, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in thy priuate vnto God.</p>
            <p>If the fact be such as must needes bee
punished, <hi>yet here we are:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 To lay it soundly to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the offender, to bring
him to repentance, that so the sinne
may be killed in him. 1. Cor. 5. 5.</p>
            <p>2 To raise him vp with the sweet
comforts of the Gospel, that so
though his body smart for it, yet his
soule may be saued. 1. Iohn 1. 9. 1.
Cor. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus are we to speake concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our neighbour:<note place="margin">

Now concerning our selues, there
are these rules:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Wee must neither praise nor
dispraise our selues, but leaue it to
another. Pro. 27. 2.</p>
            <p>2 In some cases we may &amp; must
stand vpon our own approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.<note place="margin">1 In praise</note> As</p>

               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:23187:50"/>
1 When we make profession of
our faith. 1. Pet. 3.</p>
            <p>2 In Thankefulnes we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Gods graces in vs. 1. Cor. 14.
18.</p>
            <p>3 Wee must defend our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.
2. Cor. 11. 12. and</p>
            <p>4 Iustifie also our calling against
the slanders of our aduersaries to
the stopping of their mouthes.</p>
            <p>5 Hereby we may comfort our
selues in troubles. Psal. 35. 13. 12.</p>
            <p>6 And propose our selues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
vnto others. 1. Cor. 11. 1. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here these caueats are to be
obserued:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 That this be done sincerely
as well acknowledging our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
as the graces of God in vs.</p>
            <p>2 That in doing hereof we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if it may be, take occasion to
speake in another mans persons. 2.
Cor. 12. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>3 That wee boast not of that
which is not in vs.</p>
            <p>4 Wee must not speake of the
good we haue, as if it were from our
selues. 1. Cor. 15. 10.</p>
            <p>5 Our speech must rather tend
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23187:50"/>
to the defect then to the excesse.</p>
            <p>6 We must doe it soberly and
sparingly, rather shewing that wee
are compelled thereunto then of
our owne accord. 2. Cor. 11.</p>
            <p>7 We must here especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
how we are made manifest to
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>science of the saints. 2. Cor. 4.</p>
            <p>8 And lastly wee must herein
especially ayme at Gods glorie. 1.
Cor. 10. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus may we speake good of our
selues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 We are also bound to speake euill
of our selues, in these cases,</p>
            <p>1 We must confesse our sinne
vnto man, in that hereby we may
cleare others and giue glorie to
God.<note place="margin">2 In dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise.</note> Ios. 7.</p>
            <p>2 Hereby also we ease our owne
soules. Psal. 32. 45. Iam. 5.</p>
            <p>3 We magnifie the mercies of
God in recounting how vnworthie
we are. 1. Tim. 1.</p>
            <p>4 We stay vp others that haue
bene ouertaken with the same ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
&amp;c. 2. Cor. 1. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here obserue these cautions:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 We are not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d to accuse our
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23187:51"/>
selues to the betraying of our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
or the truth of God, or his
children.</p>
            <p>2 we may not open our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to the disgrace of our calling, or
offence of others.</p>
            <p>3 we must take heede of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
as if by acknowledging our
vilenes, we would be counted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts,
as Ecebolius did.</p>
            <p>4 That we labour to hide what
we haue laid open, by casting our
burthen vpon Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus may wee speake of the euill that
is in vs. And thus much concerning
the persons of whom we must
speake.
Concerning things to be spoken,
obserue,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 That we cannot speake of all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. Of things to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</note>
because we know but in part, and
therefore it is vanity to presume
thus. 1. Cor. 13.</p>
            <p>2 That we may not speake of all
we know: <hi>Because,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Some things are knowne to vs
which are neither fit to be done nor
spoken, as the vaine thoughts of our
owne hearts. 2. Cor. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:23187:51"/>2 Some things <hi>are lawfull to be
done,</hi> which it is not lawfull to
speake of, as the secrets &amp; necessitie
of nature. Iudges. 3. 24.</p>
            <p>3 Some things are <hi>lawfull, but
not fit to be spoken:</hi> such as either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
the capacities of those to
whom we speake, or are not sutable
to them. 2. Cor. 12. Hebrew. 5. 11.
1. Cor. 14.</p>
            <p>3 We must speake <hi>what we know,</hi>
but <hi>with these conditions:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 That wee keepe our selues
within the compasse of our callings.</p>
            <p>2 That we speake from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purpose of the heart.</p>
            <p>3 That wee labour herein the
glory of God. 1. Cor. 10. 31.</p>
            <p>4 And also the good of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
Ephes. 4. 29.</p>
            <p>5 Yea our owne increase both
in knowledge &amp; holines. 1. Cor. 14.
26. 40.</p>
            <p>6 Obseruing the fitnes of time,
place, persons, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus may we speake of such things as
do occure. And thus farre concerning the
matter of our speech.</p>
            <p>Touching the manner thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:23187:52"/>
First, Our speech in generall
must bee <hi>gracious,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 15 The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speech, &amp; 1 It must be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> which is, when
the graces of God imprinted in
the heart, are truely pictured in the
tongue. Col. 4. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence it followeth:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 That all rotten and vngratious
speech is disclaimed.</p>
            <p>2 No vice must be spoken of,
but with dislike. Reuel. 2.</p>
            <p>3 No gracious speech, but from
a gracious heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Speech is then grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
when it is seasoned with wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Act. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>And this is when our speech is applied:</p>
            <p>1 Fitly to times, places, persons,
circumstances. Pro. 19. 11. Pro. 10.
31. Esay 50. 5.</p>
            <p>2 When it profits most to the
good of mens soules.</p>
            <p>3 When it turnes not to the hurt
of the speaker. 2. Tim. 2. 16.</p>
            <p>4 When it proceeds from a wise
&amp; vnderstanding hart. Eccle. 12. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence is disclaymed,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 All foolish talke, wanting rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and conscience. Ephes. 5.</p>
            <p>2 All carnall counsell of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23187:52"/>
whatsoeuer shew of wisdome
it hath in it. 1. Sam. 17.</p>
            <p>3 All vnseasonable and vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screete
communication.</p>
            <p>4 All <hi>mysticall,</hi> or curious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
&amp;c. 1. Tim. 6. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A second holy property of speech is:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Truth and fidelitie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. 2 Our speech must be true.</note> Ephes. 4. 25.
And it is discerned;</p>
            <p>1 When wee know what wee
speake vpon a sure ground.</p>
            <p>2 We speake as the thing is, the
whole truth, and no more.</p>
            <p>3 And as himselfe thinketh plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therof, not out of others conceits.</p>
            <p>4 And also to the mind and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of him that asketh.</p>
            <p>5 And that to haue the trueth
boulted out, not obscured.</p>
            <p>6 When wee stand to that wee
haue spoken or promised, which
that we may doe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here consider diuers euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and bonds of truth,

            <p>First,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 17 Of the bonds of truth. 1 Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> A <hi>simple assertion,</hi> which is
either,</p>
            <p>1 <hi>A</hi> simple affirmation, Yea, Yea.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:23187:53"/>
            <p>
               <hi>2 Or a bare negation, Nay, Nay,
Here obserue,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 That in a doubtfull case wee
must adde vnto our affirmations
(these qualifications: (<hi>As I thinke,
As I take it,</hi>) because wordes thus
spoken, if they proue true, they shew
the modesty of the speaker: If false,
yet they saue his credite, as shewing
that there is not a purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
but onely that we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
            <p>2 Another euidence of Truth is,
an <hi>Asseueration,</hi> whereby we doe
vehemently denie or affirm a thing,
as In very truth, Without al doubt,
&amp;c. Here note,</p>
            <p>1 That this is not to be vsed but
in waightie and vrgent occasions.</p>
            <p>2 When there is a gaine saying
of what we affirme. Christ saith,
Amen, Amen.</p>
            <p>3 When we are to conuince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous
and obstinate persons.
Rom. 9. 1. And thus farre of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidences
of Truth.</p>
            <p>A first bond of truth is <hi>a promise.</hi>

               <hi>Here obserue:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 What promises we must make.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:23187:53"/>
2 <hi>How they are to be kept,</hi> &amp; how
they bind.</p>
            <p>The promises we are to make to
men, must be such as,</p>
            <p>1 Be conditionable, asking God
leaue. Iam. 4. 15.</p>
            <p>2 Be of such things as are in our
abilitie to performe.</p>
            <p>3 Such as may benefite the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to whom we make promise.</p>
            <p>4 And also may stand with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and credite to performe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus they bind with
these bonds:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 They bind according to the
will &amp; pleasure of him to whom it is
made. Psal. 15. though it be to our
owne hinderance.</p>
            <p>2 Yet so, if by necessarie casualty
we are disinabled to performance,
the partie to whom the promise is
made, in conscience is to giue some
relaxation. Mat. 18.</p>
            <p>3 To this end we are bound to

and submission thereto.<note place="margin">2 Bonds. <hi>Sect.</hi> 19</note> Pro,

endangers the life of the innocent;
and therefore I am not to reueale

            <p>Truth in part is to concealed,

not our bondage vnder this tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
Heb. 12. 1.</p>

obserue now how we may
vse it a right:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, then let vs consider the
ends, why the Lorde bestowes
these outward blessings in this life
vpon his children, which are these</p>
            <p>1 To trie whither we wil prefer
him before them, and can loue him
better then them. Iob. 1.</p>
            <p>2 To make vs his stewards in an
holy dispensation of them. Mat. 25.</p>

1 We must not set our hearts
vpon them but keepe them intirely
to God. Psal. 62.</p>
            <p>2 We must not be puffed vp
with them. Psal. 75.</p>
            <p>3 Wee must not tie, nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
God onely by them. Psalme
30. 6.</p>
            <p>4 Wee must bee willing for
his sake to part with them either

our owne hurt. Mat. 10. 37.</p>
            <p>5 And all this not as if they
were ours, but Gods to dispose
wholy to his glory, and the good of
his church &amp; children. Matt. 19. 29
13. Colos. 3. 23. Rom. 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because the ouer high
conceite of these things is no small
occasion to bewitch our hearts
with them, therfore let vs labour to
rectifie our iudgements concerning
prosperity that so our ouerweening
opinion thereof may be abated, and
our affections rectified therein.</p>

therfore, if there were no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence,

they are nothing, yea lesse then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Eccles. 1. 2. 1. Cor. 7.</p>
