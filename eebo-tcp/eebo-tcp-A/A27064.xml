            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT is neceſſary that I give ſome Account how theſe Diſputations (with many others) came to my hands, and of their Publication. Being ſent to <hi>Cambridge</hi> by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> be was pleaſed at my return from thence, to receive me into his Family, and to make uſe of me as his Aſſiſtant at my firſt entrance into the Miniſtry, <hi>Anno, 1657.</hi> in <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminſter</hi> the place of my Birth: Some of the firſt work he put me upon was to tranſcribe theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Redemption, which he deſigned for the Preſs. The Miniſters of <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood thereabouts who uſually attended on his <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Lecture, and heard theſe Diſputations at their Monthly Meeting, were generally deſirous to have them Printed. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had long ſince raiſed their expectation thereof, by declaring his intention of it in Print. At laſt (though long firſt) viz. <hi>July 17.</hi> 1691. he gave them to me, ſignifying his willingneſs to have them Printed.</p>
            <p>If any Perſon queſtion whether he wrote and fitted theſe Sheets for the Preſs, I ſhall readily ſatisfie him by producing the Original of his own hand writing, as well as the Copy thereof wrote by me at leaſt 38 years ſince. If theſe Diſputations of Redemption find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance (which I ſee no cauſe to doubt of) I ſhall be thereby incouraged to Print the reſt, or ſuch of them as may be thought moſt uſeful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59524:4"/>It was a great word of Biſhop <hi>Wilkins,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Baxter had cultivated every Subject he handled,</hi> (read this Subject of Redemption, and judge whether there be not cauſe to ſay ſo of it) <hi>if he had lived in the Primitive times, he had been one of the Fathers of the Church.</hi> And again. <hi>It was enough,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for one Age to produce ſuch a Perſon as Mr.</hi> Baxter: But his works praiſe him much more than the Tongues or Pens of the greateſt Doctors or beſt of Men can do. There is therefore no need of Letters of Recommendation to ſet forth the excellence of this Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Praiſes of the Author thereof. Let it ſuffice to aſſure the Reader that this Diſputation of Univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was compoſed by him in the ſtrength of <hi>his day,</hi> about the <hi>40th</hi> year of his Age, when the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Learned of differing Opinions had ſharpen'd his Pen, and made him critically exact in conſidering what he intended for the Preſs. That which I earneſtly deſire is, that <hi>young Miniſters,</hi> and eſpecially all <hi>Candidates for the Miniſtry</hi> would put on humbleneſs of mind, and ſet themſelves at the feet of this <hi>Great Man</hi> as Learners, and then through the Divine Bleſſing, I doubt not but their profiting will appear unto all men: And let thoſe of different Judgment from him, but remember, that Mr. <hi>Baxter now dead</hi> is as much above their clamorous cenſures, as <hi>while living</hi> he was their Superiour in his Gifts and Graces: Had the one or the other but known Mr. Baxter, as well as others of his familiar Friends, his Works would be highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by them; or at leaſt his <hi>unſpotted Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>great Charity</hi> would ſo far have conciliated their minds, and engaged their affections as to love and honour his memory, and imitate <hi>his Life,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:59524:5"/>
we impatiently wait for an account of from another band, being now ready for the Preſs. May every Miniſter but have that Book when Printed, and lay aſide prejudice ſo far, at leaſt as calmly to read it, and then I may with confidence expect, not only, that humble Learners, but the greateſt Scholars will be as deſirous of acquaintance with his Works as ever Uſher, Gataker, Vines, and many others of the beſt of men were admirers of his Perſonal worth, and deſirous of his Converſe and Company.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall be ſo far diſſatisfied with the Title and Subject of the Book as to throw it aſide, I only deſire they would ſeriouſly think of thoſe words, p. 286. [When God ſaith ſo expreſly that Chriſt dyed for all, and taſted death for every man, and is the Ranſom for all, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the ſins of the whole World, it beſeems every Chriſtian rather to explain in what ſenſe Chriſt dyed for all men, than flatly to deny it.] And let me add thoſe words of Biſhop Uſher;
<q>
                  <p>Diſtinguiſh between the ſatisfaction of Chriſt abſolutely conſidered, and the application of the ſame unto every one in particular: The former was once done for all, the other is ſtill in doing; the one brings with it ſufficiency abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to diſcharge the whole debt, the other adds unto it efficacy. The Univerſality of the ſatisfaction derogates nothing from the ſpecial grace; neither the ſpeciality of the one, abateth the generality of the other.</p>
                  <p>The Lord give us a right underſtanding of his mind and will, and bleſs this work of the Author, both to Miniſters and their People, that the common Salvation may not be narrowed or leſſen'd, that Coming Souls may not be diſcouraged, and that the Goſpel of Salvation which we Preach may be Tydings of Joy to all People, and then I ſhall not repent my part in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication thereof.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THough, according to the Order of our Diſputations, I muſt directly Affirm or Deny; and indeed may ſafely Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm as the Queſtion is thus generally put, yet that it may be underſtood in what ſenſe I affirm it, it is neceſſary that thoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities be removed, which, in ſome of the terms do cloud the ſenſe, and that the nature of the Subject be ſomewhat opened. And indeed, it is a clear Explication that is moſt neceſſary in this Controverſie; that we may not (as is here uſual) fight in the dark, and trouble our ſelves with unuſeful Argumentations, on an ill ſtated queſtion, and in dubious terms; not knowing each others mind, if well our own.</p>
               <p>Who is meant by [<hi>Chriſt</hi>] we are all agreed: and who by [<hi>Men:</hi>] and that therefore we extend not the Queſtion to <hi>Angels;</hi> though that with ſome be a great diſpute, whether Chriſt dyed not in ſome

ſort for them. By his [<hi>Dying</hi>] we mean, <hi>His whole Humiliation,</hi> of which his <hi>Death</hi> is ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal a part; that as the Scripture takes moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, ſo muſt we. <hi>Ameſius</hi> thinketh that the <hi>Aſſumption of the Human Nature,</hi> is no part of this Humiliation; his reaſon is, becauſe it was an Act of the <hi>Sole Deity:</hi> And the <hi>Godhead</hi> cannot ſuffer. But I think we need not be of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; For, 1. The Holy Ghoſt ſeems to me to contradict it, making it part of Chriſts Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>To make himſelf of no Reputation and take upon him the form of a Servant, and be made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men,</hi> when he was in the <hi>form of God,</hi> and <hi>equal with God,</hi> Phil. 2. 6, 7. 2. And though the Godhead cannot ſuffer the <hi>Loſs</hi> of any <hi>Real Good,</hi> or <hi>ſuffer any Pain,</hi> yet in a <hi>Relative Senſe</hi> he may be ſaid to <hi>ſuffer</hi> while he is <hi>diſeſteemed</hi> and <hi>diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</hi> Mans <hi>Obedience addeth nothing</hi> to him, nor can it properly be ſaid to <hi>do Good</hi> to God; yet is it in <hi>Bonum Dei Reputavitè</hi> as <hi>Aquin.</hi> ſpeaks: It is <hi>Good and due to God from us;</hi> and when we deny it him, we deprive him of <hi>his due:</hi> Gods Glory is dear to him, or elſe Divines would not ſo uſe to affirm it his <hi>Sole End:</hi> (which ſaying yet needs Caution:) And as <hi>Relative</hi> and <hi>Reputative</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth and delighteth in his Honour and our Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as good, ſo <hi>Relative</hi> and <hi>Reputative</hi> he <hi>ſuffereth</hi> when he is <hi>Diſhonoured.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Condeſcention</hi> was ſo great (indeed to the aſtoniſhment of Angels and Men,) that it may well be taken for part of Chriſts <hi>Suffering;</hi> that <hi>

                     </gap>od</hi> ſhould by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo mean a Nature, become <hi>Man:</hi> It is the point that ſo ſurpaſſeth Human Reaſon, and ſeemeth ſo improbable to it, that it puts Faith harder to it, (and conſequently ennobleth it more)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59524:6"/>
than any other in the World; which occaſioned the whole Moral work of Faith, containing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Phyſical Acts; to be all entitled or denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated hence, by the name of <hi>Belief.</hi> So that I am readier to think that the <hi>Eclipſing</hi> of the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Godhead</hi> in ſo ſtrange a <hi>Condeſcention</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> not only in his <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of the <hi>Human Nature,</hi> but in the <hi>Life and Death</hi> of Chriſt, was the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of his <hi>Sufferings:</hi> And am ſo far from thinking that the <hi>Godhead</hi> did <hi>not Suffer,</hi> that I think <hi>its Sufferings</hi> were the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> for <hi>merit;</hi> though in a <hi>Natural Senſe</hi> it be unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuffering.</p>
               <p>But a greater Ambiguity lieth in the Word [<hi>All.</hi>] [<hi>All</hi>] is taken ſometime <hi>limitedly</hi> and <hi>improperly</hi> for the <hi>multitude</hi> or <hi>very many,</hi> as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 3. and 3. 5. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 32, 33. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Sometime <hi>properly,</hi> according to the different ſubjects. Sometime it is ſpoken of <hi>All kinds</hi> only, as of <hi>All Ages, Sexes, Eſtates, Degrees, Nations, Conditions</hi> of Men: Sometime of <hi>All Perſons,</hi> and then if it be [<hi>All</hi>] in proper ſpeech we need not expect that [<hi>Every one</hi>] ſhould be added; for <hi>All Perſons</hi> and <hi>Every Perſon,</hi> are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. And though our Queſtion be of [<hi>All</hi>] in this laſt proper ſenſe, yet principally as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Elect only:</hi> And I had rather far ſo take it here, as referring only to thoſe that have heard the Goſpel. Not that I doubt at all of <hi>Chriſts Dying for every Man,</hi> ſo far as we ſhall anon explain. But 1. Becauſe the caſe is more clearly opened in Scripture: 2. And much more concerneth us to know, <hi>How God dealeth with thoſe to whom Chriſt is revealed, than with thoſe to whom he is not revealed.</hi> God ſpeaks both <hi>little</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59524:7"/>
and <hi>more darkly</hi> of the State of thoſe to whom he ſpeaks <hi>not;</hi> ſeeing it concerneth us not to know his Counſels about others, ſo much as about our ſelves. Thoſe therefore who in all diſputes on this Queſtion, do ſtill inſiſt on the Caſe of <hi>Infants</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> to whom Chriſt was never revealed, to prove that he <hi>Dyed not for All,</hi> do plainly ſhew, that they ſeek not the <hi>clearing</hi> of the point, and manifeſtation of the truth, but the Obſcuring of it. It being the uſual trick of men that are at a loſs, and can carry on their Cauſe no farther, to argue preſently <hi>à minus noto, &amp; ad obſcurum ab ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuriore,</hi> that ſo they may carry the buſineſs into a miſt, which will not endure the light, and ſo may bring their Antagoniſts to grope; the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt having the moſt diſadvantage in the dark. If it had much concerned us to know on what terms the Indians are judged that never heard of Chriſt, the Scripture would have ſaid more of it; and not have fitted the deſcription of the Judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>wholly,</hi> or <hi>almoſt wholly</hi> to the ſtate of thoſe that have heard the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that I deſire to handle this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now, as it concerneth all thoſe that have heard the Goſpel, knowing no great uſe (but ſome hurt) that may be in the extending it farther in our diſpute; yet with thoſe that are contentious, and will needs inſiſt on the ſuppoſed advantage which the ſtate of Indians and other Pagans and their Infants do afford them, I ſhall though unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, proceed further, rather than prejudice the Truth.</p>
               <p>But the greateſt Ambiguity in our Queſtion is in the term <hi>[For.]</hi> This propoſition here may admit of divers Senſes: Sometime Chriſt is ſaid
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59524:7"/>
to <hi>Die [For] our Sins:</hi> Sometimes <hi>To Die [For] us;</hi> When he is ſaid to <hi>Die [For] our Sins,</hi> it may be underſtood, 1. Either <hi>for our Sins as the pro Meritorious procuring Cauſe of his Suffering</hi> through his own undertaking to bear what they deſerved: (Or if any think it fitter to call them <hi>the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the Meritorious Cauſe,</hi> they may.) And ſo, to <hi>Die [For] our Sins.</hi> is to <hi>Die [through the Deſert] of our Sins.</hi> 2. Or elſe he may be ſaid to <hi>Die [For] our Sins, Finalitèr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as Sin is part of the <hi>Evil</hi> which he intended through death to free us from. And ſo, to Die <hi>[For] Sin,</hi> is <hi>To Die [againſt] Sin:</hi> As when we ſay, <hi>This Medicine is good [For] ſuch a Diſeaſe;</hi> we mean <hi>it is good [againſt it.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>Die [For us]</hi> it may be meant either, 1. <hi>Subjectivè</hi> that he Died <hi>Loco noſiro</hi> (of which more anon,) 2. Or <hi>Finaliter;</hi> And that two ways, 1. Either as we are to be his own in <hi>propriety;</hi> and ſo 1. To be a means to <hi>his own glory,</hi> 2. Or his <hi>Propriety</hi> a means to our <hi>further good.</hi> And thus he dyeth <hi>[For] Men</hi> by way of <hi>purchaſe,</hi> as a Man gives a <hi>Price [For]</hi> a Slave or Condemned Malefactor, (for I will not ſay, as we buy a <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the Market, ſeeing that is only <hi>for our ſelves;</hi> and not <hi>for the good of the Beaſt.</hi>) 2. Or elſe <hi>more directly</hi> as we are the <hi>Finis Cui</hi> of thoſe benefits which by his Death he procureth. And ſo Dying <hi>[For us]</hi> is either taken <hi>generally,</hi> reſpecting <hi>our ſelves generally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> as the Objects of his love. As one Friend or Lover is ſaid to <hi>Die for the ſake</hi> of another in ſeveral Caſes; as in <hi>fighting for him,</hi> or other way of <hi>ſignifying</hi> or <hi>teſtifying Love:</hi> So generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered Chriſt Died <hi>noſtri gratiâ.</hi> 2. Or in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59524:8"/>
to the <hi>ſpecial Benefits</hi> which by his Death he procured [for us.] Which Benefits might be variouſly conſidered, either, 1. <hi>As to be offered, or to be enjoyed:</hi> 2. Either <hi>quoad poſſibilitatem, vel quoad futuritionem poſſeſſionis:</hi> 3. <hi>Quoad rem ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, vel quoad Jus ad rem:</hi> with divers other Conſiderations, which I will paſs by; leſt by needleſs diſtinguiſhing I ſhould rather obſcure the point than clear it. Only, before I can go any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I muſt needs lay down a few Diſtinctions which are of great moment and neceſſity for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this matter. 1. And firſt and above all, we muſt both diſtinguiſh between the divers <hi>Effects</hi> or <hi>Ends</hi> of Chriſts Death; and rightly conſider the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of each of them. For to know only in general that <hi>Chriſt dyed for us,</hi> is ſo far from being a ſufficient knowledge for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that it is not ſufficient to denominate a man a Chriſtian; ſeeing it ſaith no more of Chriſt than may be ſaid of <hi>Stephen, Peter, Paul,</hi> or one another: For we muſt, if called to it, die for one another, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 3. 16. Yet I confeſs the <hi>right ordering</hi> of this whole work in our <hi>Conceivings</hi> is a matter of <hi>great difficulty</hi> though of <hi>great moment.</hi> At the preſent time will permit me only to give you this brief Account of my thoughts herein.</p>
               <p>I Conſider, 1. <hi>What Chriſt did:</hi> 2. <hi>Why he did it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That which he did was 1. <hi>In ſenſu Naturali,</hi> to <hi>Suffer</hi> and <hi>Die.</hi> 2. <hi>In ſenſu Legali vel Morali,</hi> It was, 1. <hi>In General,</hi> to be <hi>Puniſhed:</hi> 2. <hi>In Special,</hi> it was <hi>A voluntary bearing in the perſon of a Mediator in the ſtead of fallen Mankind that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in weight which for their Sin the Law of works
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59524:8"/>
Obliged them to bear.</hi> Or to ſpeak in the Scripture phraſe (which it were well if men had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with) it is the offering himſelf a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sin, and ſo to take them away as a Ranſom for Attonement and Propitiation.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Why Chriſt did this,</hi> muſt be anſwered from the <hi>Efficient</hi> and <hi>Final Cauſes.</hi> In <hi>general, Gods will</hi> is the <hi>Principal Efficient</hi> and <hi>Ultimate Final Cauſe</hi> of this, and all things. More <hi>particularly,</hi> 1. <hi>God</hi> was the <hi>Author</hi> or <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> in committing this work to his Son, and <hi>ſending him</hi> to do it. 2. Gods <hi>Mercy and Compaſſion</hi> (ſpeaking after the manner of Men) was the <hi>Impulſive Cauſe.</hi> 3. <hi>Mans miſery</hi> was the <hi>Occaſion.</hi> 4. <hi>Mans ſin</hi> was another occaſion, as being <hi>loco Cauſae Meritoriae;</hi> for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> there was no <hi>Meritorious Cauſe.</hi> 5. The <hi>Laws Curſe</hi> or <hi>Obligation</hi> was another occaſion, as being <hi>Miseriae Cauſa removenda.</hi> 6. Chriſts <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Sponſion</hi> or <hi>Conſent</hi> was the <hi>Moral Obliging Cauſe,</hi> ſupplying the place both of a <hi>Meritorious</hi> and of a <hi>Legal Obliging Cauſe.</hi> 7. <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> was the <hi>Voluntary Patient.</hi> 8. <hi>God himſelf</hi> was the <hi>Principal moral Efficient,</hi> ſo far as it had <hi>rationem boni:</hi> (For he cannot be a <hi>morally deficient</hi> Cauſe, nor an <hi>Efficient</hi> of Puniſhment ſo far as it hath in it <hi>rationem veri mali.</hi>) 9. <hi>Satan</hi> was the <hi>Principal Author</hi> of it, as it <hi>was Evil.</hi> 10. <hi>Wicked men</hi> were the <hi>Instruments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And for the <hi>Ends</hi> there is two ways of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning and expreſſing them. The 1. is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods order of <hi>Intention.</hi> The 2. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to His Order of <hi>Attainment</hi> and <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59524:9"/>1. The <hi>former</hi> is leſs fit for our obſervation both becauſe we are utterly uncertain whether it be <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>wholly revealed;</hi> ſeeing God may have <hi>End<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> which he judgeth not fit to communicate to us; and where it is not revealed either 1. By <hi>Scripture;</hi> or 2. By <hi>Event,</hi> it is impoſſible we ſhould know it.</p>
               <p>2. And becauſe when we do <hi>ſee Events,</hi> yet we are ſo vaſtly <hi>diſtant</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and exceeding ſtrange to his unconceivable unexpreſſible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we know not what hath the place of an <hi>End</hi> and what of a <hi>means</hi> in the <hi>Divine Intention,</hi> farther than <hi>He</hi> hath <hi>told us:</hi> Nor know what Gods intention is, the term being properly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only to <hi>Creatures,</hi> and no term of Human Language in ſtrict propriety appliable to the Nature of God.</p>
               <p>But this much the Scripture <hi>Revealeth</hi> to us, 1. That in the ſenſe as God may be ſaid to have an end, <hi>Gods proper ultimate end</hi> is <hi>himſelf. He made all things for himſelf,</hi> and can have no <hi>lower end than himſelf. But how himſelf</hi> is his <hi>end</hi> is hard to open. If we ſay, his <hi>Being as ſuch</hi> is his <hi>End,</hi> or that his <hi>Eſſential Glory</hi> is his <hi>End;</hi> we do but darken the matter and loſe our ſelves. For neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption nor any other work can either cauſe, conſerve or add to that Being and Glory. If we ſay, <hi>His Glory</hi> in the <hi>Eſteem of the Creature</hi> is his utmoſt <hi>End,</hi> we ſuppoſe him to have an <hi>End In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely below himſelf.</hi> If you ſay, that <hi>the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of himſelf to his Creature</hi> is his <hi>End,</hi> either you ſpeak of the <hi>Acts</hi> of Communication as <hi>in God,</hi> and ſo it is <hi>himſelf;</hi> (as before expreſſed) <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and not Finally Conſidered:</hi> Or elſe you ſpeak of the <hi>form produced by it,</hi> or as <hi>received</hi> by the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59524:9"/>
Creature; and ſo it is <hi>quid Creatum &amp; extra Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Divinam,</hi> and too low to be his End. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore that man is uncapable of a clear and full conceiving of the <hi>Nature of Gods End</hi> or <hi>Intending.</hi> But the <hi>conception</hi> and <hi>expreſſion</hi> which I judge to be <hi>moſt favoured</hi> by Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, <hi>That Gods will is the Beginning and End of all things. Whatſoever pleaſed him, that did he,</hi> And when he hath done it <hi>the pleaſing him is his End.</hi> And therefore he <hi>Rested</hi> after the work of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and expreſſeth himſelf <hi>well pleaſed by and in his Son in the work of Redemption,</hi> as ſeeing his work in both to be <hi>very good:</hi> and therefore inſtituted a day of <hi>Reſt</hi> in <hi>Commemoration</hi> of <hi>both.</hi> The term <hi>Reſt</hi> expreſſeth the <hi>End;</hi> and his <hi>Well-pleaſedneſs, Content,</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> is his <hi>Reſt,</hi> and ſo his <hi>End</hi> (And in this ſenſe God himſelf is his own <hi>End,</hi>) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this <hi>Pleaſing</hi> him ſhould be Mans <hi>End</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>2. But beſides this <hi>Ultimate End,</hi> (though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly God can have <hi>no End but himſelf;</hi>) yet there are <hi>ſome means</hi> ſo cloſely conjunct with this <hi>End,</hi> as being the <hi>immediate matter</hi> of Gods <hi>Approbation</hi> &amp; <hi>Delight,</hi> that they may not unfitly be called Gods <hi>ſecondary</hi> or <hi>leſs principal ends</hi> themſelves; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we may ſo ſay in regard of <hi>Chriſts intentions</hi> who is <hi>Man</hi> as well as <hi>God.</hi> And theſe are,</p>
               <p>1. The Glory, or Image, or Perfections of God, as appearing in all his works; thus his own Power, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs there ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth, is that Glory in which he is <hi>well-pleaſed,</hi> and which he loveth. And thus the Glory of God is <hi>materially only</hi> or objectively his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt End, as that in which his <hi>Will</hi> doth <hi>Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59524:10"/>2. The <hi>Glorifying of the Mediator</hi> in his <hi>Human Nature,</hi> and his full ſatisfaction and content in the fruits of his Redemption.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> of his <hi>Elect</hi> who are his Body.</p>
               <p>4. Their <hi>Everlaſting perfect Praiſes of God, loving him,</hi> and <hi>rejoycing in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And even in <hi>this Life,</hi> the Juſt, Wiſe, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Adminiſtrations of the Mediator in his Kingdom, and the imperfect Deliverance and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Saints, and the glory that redounds to God hereby, may not unfitly be ſaid to be the <hi>Ends</hi> of the Redeemer.</p>
               <p>But I will meddle with this <hi>Order of Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> no farther, as intending God willing, to ſpeak more fully and accurately of that Queſtion <hi>de or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine decretorum, de fine &amp; de mediis</hi> in a fitter place.</p>
               <p>2. But let us conſider of the <hi>Order</hi> of theſe <hi>Ends</hi> as <hi>Executed,</hi> I mean of the <hi>Effects</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Death.</hi> And they are 1. Such as <hi>immediatly</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, as it is the <hi>Diſcharge</hi> of the <hi>Sufferers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,</hi> being indeed, 1. <hi>Part</hi> of his <hi>Work</hi> in its <hi>Moral Conſideration:</hi> 2. Or elſe the <hi>immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults</hi> of that <hi>Diſcharge</hi> Theſe are, 1. That Chriſts Death doth <hi>demonſtrate Gods justice and hatred of Sin.</hi> 2. In it an <hi>Example</hi> is given for the <hi>deterring of Offenders.</hi> 3. And for <hi>preſerving the Lawgiver,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> from <hi>contempt.</hi> 4. And a demonſtration made of unſpeakable Love to Men. 5. And in and by theſe, 1. The Lawgiver ſatisfied. 2. And the chief Ends of the Law are attained: (though we cannot ſtrictly ſay that the <hi>Law it ſelf is ſatisfied,</hi> becauſe its <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>nearest end</hi> is not <hi>fulfilled.</hi> Thus <hi>ſatisfaction of Justice</hi> is)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59524:10"/>
the <hi>ſum</hi> of theſe moſt <hi>immediate Effects.</hi> And the whole work together may well be called <hi>A Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Penalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Satisfaction</hi> being thus made, there are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately hereupon,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Relative Effects reſulting</hi> from it. Whereof ſome are from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Work,</hi> (ſuppoſing that which is called <hi>The Covenant between the Father and the Son,</hi> that is, <hi>Gods Acceptation.</hi>) And ſome are given as it were by way of <hi>Retribution,</hi> or in <hi>Communication</hi> to Chriſt <hi>for his ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the <hi>first ſort</hi> are theſe,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Christ himſelf</hi> is now <hi>free</hi> from his <hi>Voluntary obligation to ſuffer.</hi> In the ſame ſenſe as he was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made Sin,</hi> he is <hi>now Justified;</hi> and upon his <hi>Reſurrection declared just.</hi> He <hi>oweth no more,</hi> nor can any more be required of him.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Father</hi> therefore doth give him an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance,</hi> and acknowledgeth the ſatisfaction, proclaiming himſelf <hi>well-pleaſed</hi> in his Son.</p>
               <p>3. And hereby is Chriſt become <hi>Conquerour</hi> over <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Him who had the Power of Death,</hi> even the <hi>Devil;</hi> (Suppoſing his Reſurrection.)</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is ſo <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God, that upon the <hi>giving</hi> thereof, the work becomes <hi>Meritorious</hi> of <hi>Reward</hi> to the <hi>ſatisfier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Becauſe it was not <hi>Due</hi> from <hi>Him,</hi> nor <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,</hi> but <hi>voluntary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Becauſe (though God be not capable of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving good,</hi> yet) it was from his own <hi>earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> which he was moved to by <hi>Compaſſion to Man,</hi> and ſo it was <hi>reputative, in bonum Dei,</hi> as being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>things given</hi> to the <hi>Satisfier</hi> by way of <hi>Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution</hi> are, 1. Some <hi>directly to himſelf,</hi> as neceſſary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59524:11"/>
to the <hi>Ends of Redemption:</hi> 2. Some <hi>for the Sinners</hi> in whoſe ſtead he ſuffered.</p>
               <p>To himſelf is given. 1. Something to be <hi>received before the End</hi> and Delivering up of the Kingdom, and ſomething <hi>after. Before he Received,</hi> 1. <hi>Real,</hi> the glorifying of his perſon. 2. <hi>Relative Fruits, Novum jus Dominii,</hi> a full <hi>Propriety</hi> in the Creature as his <hi>own</hi> which he <hi>bought.</hi> And that is, 1. <hi>Over Mankind</hi> whom he <hi>Redeemed.</hi> 2. And <hi>all the Creatures</hi> as they may be <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to his <hi>Ends.</hi> By his <hi>Propriety in Man</hi> he hath <hi>Power,</hi> 1. To <hi>uſe</hi> what <hi>means</hi> he ſeeth meet to perſwade them to himſelf. Either 1. <hi>External,</hi> 1. As the <hi>Word,</hi> or 2. <hi>Works.</hi> 2. Or <hi>Internal,</hi> by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and their <hi>Conſcience.</hi> 2. And to <hi>ſucceed the means.</hi> By his <hi>Propriety</hi> in <hi>other Creatures,</hi> he hath <hi>Power</hi> to diſpoſe of, 1. <hi>Perſons,</hi> both 1. <hi>Angels,</hi> and 2. <hi>Enemies,</hi> as Devils; and 2. <hi>Things:</hi> As 1. <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> 2. <hi>Actions,</hi> and <hi>Thoughts,</hi> ſo as many ſerve his <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Beſide this <hi>Propriety,</hi> he hath <hi>Novum Jus Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii,</hi> and is become <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> whom he Redeemed. This is partly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential to his <hi>Jus Dominii:</hi> For every Man hath <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Rule his Own</hi> according to <hi>its Capacity.</hi> By this <hi>Rectorſhip</hi> Chriſt hath Power, 1. To <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> both 1. What ſhall be <hi>Due from Man,</hi> 2. And <hi>What ſhall be Due to him:</hi> Which he doth, 1. <hi>By making Laws de novo.</hi> 2. And <hi>diſpoſing</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> at his pleaſure. And as he hath this power of the <hi>Laws:</hi> So, 2. Of their <hi>Execution.</hi> 1. By Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. 2. And by the Execution of the <hi>Sentence.</hi> Thus much of that which <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> was to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for his ſatisfaction</hi> in <hi>this time</hi> before the End.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59524:11"/>2. <hi>After the End</hi> he was further to receive, 1. The <hi>continuation</hi> or <hi>perpetuating</hi> of his <hi>Perſonal Glory</hi> and <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi> 2. A full <hi>Content</hi> in the <hi>perfect accompliſhment</hi> of his work, 1. In the <hi>juſt Deſtruction</hi> of his <hi>Enemies</hi> that rebelled and rejected him. 2. And in the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of his <hi>Saints,</hi> who are his <hi>Body:</hi> and in the <hi>pleaſing of God in all.</hi> Thus much of what Chriſt was to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That which <hi>Mankind</hi> was to <hi>receive</hi> for whom he ſatisfied, was 1. <hi>Immediately,</hi> in the change of his Condition; where is Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> which was, <hi>A Legal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Deſtruction</hi> or <hi>Damnation;</hi> which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this, that <hi>now</hi> the <hi>Lawgiver (God-Creator)</hi> being <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> he is no longer <hi>neceſſitated</hi> or <hi>oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (as we may ſpeak) to deſtroy the Sinner; (tho' yet the Law is not wholly <hi>Abrogate,</hi> nor its <hi>Obligation</hi> of the Sinner to <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved:) but the <hi>Sinner</hi> is <hi>Delivered</hi> from that <hi>Law</hi> as it <hi>ſtands alone without a Remedy,</hi> ſeeing a ſufficient Remedy is provided, and the Law it ſelf is now at the pleaſure and diſpoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, who will Judge no Man by this <hi>Law alone,</hi> or <hi>principally.</hi> So that the Sinner who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was <hi>not pardonable,</hi> but <hi>in potentiâ remotiore</hi> nor <hi>at all quoad Potentiam Dei ordinatam</hi> in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate, without this change; is now become <hi>pardonable in Potentiâ propriore, &amp; quoad Potentiam Deiordinatam</hi> in his <hi>preſent</hi> ſtate.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> or ſtate to which he is Delivered; is,</p>
               <p>1. To the <hi>Redeemer</hi> as <hi>Proprietary,</hi> he being his <hi>Own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59524:12"/>2. To the <hi>Redeemer as Rector,</hi> to be dealt with on terms of <hi>Grace,</hi> and in order to <hi>Recovery</hi> from his <hi>Miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And in both theſe to the <hi>Redeemer</hi> as our grand Benefactor and Saviour whoſe Office is to lead us to God by the winning demonſtration of his Love.</p>
               <p>Mans ſtate having this immediate change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: 2. The <hi>Benefits Conſequential</hi> to theſe which he <hi>receiveth;</hi> are Either, 1. From <hi>Chriſt as Rector:</hi> Or, 2. As <hi>Dominus abſolutus, Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi> 3. And as a free Benefactor doing as he liſt with his own benefits.</p>
               <p>1. As <hi>Rector,</hi> Chriſt is (as is ſaid) 1. <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator:</hi> 2. And ſeeth to the <hi>Execution.</hi> As <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator,</hi> 1. He taketh <hi>down</hi> the <hi>old Law,</hi> both, 1. That of works, as it is a proper covenant and means of Life, and ſo freeth man from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of perfect obeying for ſalvation (though yet he deſtroy not its being or obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience.) 2. And he freeth thoſe that were under it, from the <hi>Moſaical Law of Rites,</hi> and that by <hi>Abrogating</hi> it (But this was not till the fulneſs of time, but the other was preſently upon the beginning of Reſtauration.) 2. He [1. <hi>Maketh,</hi> 2. <hi>Promulgateth</hi>] a <hi>New Law of Grace,</hi> containing, 1. Eſſentials: 2. Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. By the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of the Law, 1. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth to men a ſweet and eaſie Courſe of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and giveth them commands that are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; which 1. In ſome reſpects he maketh meer <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Means:</hi> 2. And in other reſpects, <hi>Conditions</hi> of their receiving farther benefits. 2. He determineth of what ſhall be <hi>Due to man,</hi> (as by way of <hi>Penalty</hi> if they <hi>Rebel;</hi> ſo, 1.) By
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59524:12"/>
conferring farther benefits on men: Which are Conſiderable, 1. In themſelves: 2. In the way of Collation. 1. The Benefits given by the new Law or Covenant are, 1. <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>relative Benefits</hi> or new Relations. 2. Or Right to <hi>real Benefits.</hi> The former are, 1. <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Radical,</hi> that is, Memberſhip of Chriſt or Union with him. 2. Or <hi>Conſequential:</hi> Which are, 1. The fruits of ſatisfaction, properly as ſatisfaction; that is, The Reſtoring us from the miſery we fell into, by freeing us from Guilt or Obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by pardoning our Sin, and Juſtifying us, ſo far. 2. Thoſe that are <hi>Conſequential</hi> to ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not meerly as ſatisfaction, but as a <hi>Price Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing</hi> or <hi>Meriting</hi> farther good, (and ſo are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of his <hi>Meritorious Works</hi> alſo.) And that is his bringing us to a higher and better ſtate of Relation than that which was loſt; which is in, 1. <hi>Adoption</hi> to Sonſhip. 2. Memberſhip of the Church of the Redeemed and Called.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>real Benefits</hi> which the Covenant giveth us right to are, 1. Such as are to be received in <hi>this Life:</hi> As 1. The Spirit to be, 1. Our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sanctifier: 2. And Comforter. 2. And all other things to work for our good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our Recovery and Happineſs. 2. Or ſuch as are to be received in the <hi>Life to come;</hi> Either at the Entrance, as, 1. Felicity of the Soul firſt, and then Reſurrection from the Dead. 2. And Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by ſentence and adjudication of Eternal Glory: 2. Or in the ſtate thereof, which is our Perfect Bleſſedneſs in Enjoying God, and being perfectly acceptable to him in our Perſons, and Praiſes. We ſpeak not now of theſe real benefits as <hi>Conferred in themſelves;</hi> but in the <hi>Right</hi> we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59524:13"/>
have to them before hand: All which <hi>Right</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the <hi>New Law or Covenant,</hi> as <hi>Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And as the benefits given, ſo the manner of the Laws giving muſt needs be obſerved: Which is, 1. By imperfect Collation, not <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently making the thing our own, which is, 1. When the gift is conditional, ſuſpended on ſome Condition: And only thus doth the Law or Covenant give Pardon, Juſtification, Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with all that Right to real Mercy before mentioned; to all men, Elect or not Elect before they believe. 2. Or when the thing is given only <hi>in Diem.</hi> And ſo Right to a Reſurrection is given to all. 2. Or elſe the Law makes a perfect Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and that is, 1. When it gives the Benefit abſolutely and preſently: So that Chriſt freed men from the Law of Works and Ceremonies, ſo far as is before expreſſed. 2. Or when it actually confers that Benefit after the performance of the Condition, which before was but Conditionally Given. For it was the will of the Legiſlator that the actual Gift ſhould be ſuſpended on that Condition; and therefore though the Nature of the Law change not upon that performance of the Condition, yet it then begins <hi>Moraliter Efficariter agere,</hi> which it did not before. And thus the Law of Grace gives actual Pardon, Adoption, and Right to glory, to men as ſoon as they ſincerely believe. And here begin the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Chriſts death in Law ſence, to be peculiar to ſome; when they perform the conditions which others do not (which condition Chriſt giveth not as Legiſlator.) All that we have ſpoke till now, was common to Non-elect. Thus we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59524:13"/>
have ſhewed what the Law gives by its Eſſentials. 2. By the Integrals or Accidentals (which you will call them) of this new Law; (for Laws uſe to have Preambles, Narratives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to inform men of the ground, occaſion, and end of them:) Chriſt doth, 1. Give all men that hear it infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or objective diſcovery of whatſoever is neceſſary to be known for attaining the foreſaid benefits: As of God, Chriſt, his Nature, Office, Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. He giveth them potent Reaſons, Motives, Perſwaſions, Exhortations, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to work upon their Wills. And both theſe are Grace and ſufficient in <hi>ſuo genere.</hi> Having ſhewed what Chriſt giveth as Legiſlator, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, 2. That we ſhew what he giveth in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of theſe Laws. And that is, 1. In this Life, as was promiſed. 2. After, 1. At Death and by Reſurrection, 2. By Judgment, 1. By Sentence, where as Judge, 1. He Juſtifieth all Believers, 2. Adjudgeth to them Everlaſting Glory; (as he Condemneth their Enemies to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire: Both Wickedmen as Rebels, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils as <hi>hoſtes</hi> open Foes.) 2. In Execution of this Sentence he perfecteth them in Glory. So far of Chriſts Benefits which we receive from him as Rector.</p>
               <p>2. Next we are to view thoſe which Chriſt gives as free Benefactor, and <hi>Dominus abſolutus</hi> meerly (though yet with reſpect to the Ends of Government.) And ſo, 1. He diſpoſes of the Means. 2. Of the Succeſs. 1. He giveth Means differently as he pleaſe, to ſome more, to ſome leſs. And they are, 1. Outward Means: 2. Inward. The outward are, 1. The Works of God. 2. The Ordinances or Juſtified Means. The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59524:14"/>
works which are means to teach and win men are, 1. The Creatures themſelves as diſcovering Gods Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, and much Mercy to man, ſo much as opened to all Nations that hope of pardon, which was their Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all that Sacrificing, Prayers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religiouſneſs, which they generally in ſome meaſure uſed, and would never have uſed it, had it not been for this hope, which was grounded in a diſcovery of Gods Mercifulneſs to them, though Sinners. 2. And Providential diſpoſal of Events, much furthers this: 1. In ſeaſonable Afflicting and Puniſhing: 2. In giving the Mercies of Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. 2. The Ordinances or inſtituted means are, 1. His Ordinances ſtrictly ſo called, as, 1. His Laws, Covenants, Doctrine. 2. And his Sacraments. 1. Baptiſm. 2. And the Lords Supper. 2. And the concomitant means. 1. For the divulging of his Word; by 1. Men appointed thereto, 1. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as, 1. Miniſters in their places; and 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians in theirs. 2. Extraordinary, as Apoſtles and Prophets. 2. And by Artificial means. 1. To the Ear by Speaking, in Teaching and Perſwading by the foreſaid men: 2. To the Eye by Writing, Printing. 2. And as he giveth theſe means for the divulging his word; ſo for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing of it and the ſucceſs that men may Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, Believe and Obey it, he giveth means. 1. Extraordinary, as the Holy Ghoſt to work Miracles.</p>
               <p>2. Ordinary, 1. By fellowſhip with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ordinary community, whether. 1. With private Chriſtians: 2. Or Miniſters, either of which help us: 1. Either by Example: 2. Or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either, 1. By Conference. 2. Or ſolemn
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59524:14"/>
Teaching, 1. By Voice, 2. Or Writing, being gifted, 1. Meanly, 2. Or Eminently, 1. By Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2. Art, Learning, Grace as God is pleaſed to diſpoſe. 2. Or elſe theſe Ordinary helps are from and in Aſſociation, and that, 1. In leſſer bodies as Families. 2. In greater as, 1. Eccleſiaſtical Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: Where we have the benefit, 1. Of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, 1. Officers, 2. Members Common. 2. Of the order and ordinances, diſcipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Societies, where we have all civil helps to further our Religious Ends.</p>
               <p>So much for the Outward Means, Only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that I am not now ſpeaking of theſe as commanded and made due: for ſo they are not given by Chriſt as Legiſlator; but as beſtowed and diſpoſed of eventually which is by Chriſt as a free benefactor, proprietary or <hi>Dominus abſolutus;</hi> ſo far as he doth it without pre-obligation and differently.</p>
               <p>2. Next, the Inward Means which Chriſt giveth thus are, 1. The diſpoſal and ordering of the temper of the Humours and parts of the Body, ſo as may be more or leſs fit to receive or retain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. 2. The advantitious helps are, 1. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of good Angels. 2. Above all the Holy Ghoſt, to work in that ſeaſon, manner and meaſure as to his Wiſdom ſeems meet.</p>
               <p>So much of the Benefits which Chriſt giveth as free Benefactor and as <hi>Dominus</hi> by way of <hi>Means.</hi> 2. Laſtly, He alſo <hi>ſucceedeth</hi> theſe means variouſly as he pleaſe. 1. To ſome for the Endowing them only with Common Gifts, 1. Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as working Miracles. 2. Ordinary, as 1. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, in the knowledge, 1. Of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; 2. Or of more Divine Truth. 2. Or Moral,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59524:15"/>
either, 1. In Civility and common Honeſty toward Men; with excellent quallifications, as Meekneſs. Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Or Religiouſneſs or Piety toward God; which is of divers degrees. ſome having leſs, and ſome more, even a taſte of Gods word and the powers of the World to come, with ſome real Faith, Love, Joy, Cleanſing from former filthineſs, and Sanctification by the Blood of the Covenant, which yet are not ſaying. 2. To others he giveth his Spitit to work in ſuch ſeaſons, manner and meaſure, (accompanied with congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous providential occurrences and removal of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and hindrances) as ſhall infallibly prevail, 1. For to bring them to Faith; and 2. To further Sanctification and Perſeverance. In a word he uſeth ſuch means with all his Elect as ſhall infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly ſucceed, to bring them to Faith and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; and ſo much with all the World, as ſhall leave them all without excuſe. In all this you may ſee that thoſe benefits which Chriſt gives as free benefactor and as <hi>Dominus abſolutus</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for all men alike, nor for all the Elect alike; nor for ought we can know, for any two perſons alike in degree; and therefore if Chriſt may not be ſaid to Die for any man except he give him all that he gives to others without the accuſation of being an imperfect Saviour; then he could not be ſaid to Die for moſt of the Elect. Alſo you may ſee in this Scheme how far Chriſt Died for all men, and how far not; and that the main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality is not in the Mercies which he gives as Legiſlator, (till their own Faith or Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief make the difference) but in the Mercies which he gives as abſolute Lord, which flow from his ſecret <hi>Decree de rerum Eventu.</hi> And leſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59524:15"/>
you ſhould think that all this Power and Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſcribed to the Mediator is derogatory to the Father; underſtand that as the Father and Son are one; ſo the Mediators Power being but the Supream Derived Power, and not the Supream Primitive Power, it ſtill ſuppoſeth the Primitive Power and Operation of the God-head. And therefore both the obtaining and conveying of theſe benefits to us is ſtill expreſſed to be as from Chriſt indeed, but in dependance on, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation from God. And ſo 1. As they are at firſt procured by Chriſts ſatisfaction, they are ſaid to be by Purchaſe or Redemption. 2. And as they are continued, or daily given out from the continued Moral Vertue of that ſatisfaction in Gods acceptation, they are ſaid to he procured by Chriſts interceſſions; which being but the ſaid continued force of his ſatisfaction and purchaſe in producing the remote effects; I need not ſpeak of it any further.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a Scheme of the Nature, Order and Difference of the Effects of Chriſts Death, in the beſt manner that at preſent I can learn from the Word. And though in this you may ſee my whole ſence of the point in hand, and all the diſtinctions are here couched which I intend to make uſe of (or at leaſt implyed:) Yet becauſe ſome of them need a fuller explication, I will next proceed to that.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Some further neceſſary Diſtinction.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IN the next place as I told you that it was Eſſential to Chriſts Puniſhment in Specie that he ſuffered <hi>noſtro loco;</hi> ſo becauſe here lies the firſt and greateſt point of the Controverſie in hand, <hi>quorum loco,</hi> in whoſe ſtead Chriſt ſuffered, and whoſe ſin or guilt did lie upon him. And alſo becauſe the right or wrong underſtanding of this point hath ſo great an influence into moſt of the conſequent points in the Body of Divinity, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much to help us, or quite to overturn all; I think it exceeding neceſſary, that we here carefully diſtinguiſh of the <hi>Phraſe Noſtro loco,</hi> or <hi>in our ſtead.</hi> Underſtand therefore that a thing may be ſaid to be done or ſuffered [<hi>In our ſtead</hi>] in theſe two ſences, 1. When he that doth or ſuffereth it, doth therein <hi>Legally Perſonate</hi> us, or <hi>Repreſent our Perſons,</hi> or do it in <hi>our Name;</hi> ſo far that though <hi>Naturally</hi> the Agent or Patient be <hi>another perſon:</hi> yet <hi>Legally</hi> Morally or <hi>Civiliter</hi> he is <hi>not another.</hi> Thus a Deputy, Delegate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Vicarius whom I ſend in my Name to pay a Debt, is herein <hi>Legally my ſelf:</hi> What he payeth I pay <hi>Civiliter</hi> or in Law ſence. I ſhall ſhew you when I come to my Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions how intollerable and deſperate an Error it is, overthrowing the very frame of Chriſtianity, to affirm that Chriſt did thus Die or Satisfie <hi>Noſtro loco</hi> in our ſtead, or any Mans ſtead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or one is ſaid to Do or Suffer <hi>Loco alterius</hi> in anothers ſtead, when it is done to ſave another
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59524:16"/>
from doing it that was obliged to do it; or that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that which another was obliged to ſuffer toward the freeing him from it, being <hi>materially</hi> the ſame, but not formally from the ſame Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from the Obligation of a voluntary Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and being not done or ſuffered in the Name or in Repreſentation of the Perſon of the other: But in a Third Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Perſon of a Mediator, Redeemer or Friend. I ſay, when a Mediator or Sponſor conſenteth to bear the Puniſhment deſerved by the Offendor, and ſo far to have his faults imputed to him; this is to ſuffer in his ſtead. And thus I ſhall anon prove that Chriſt ſuffered in the ſtead of all Mankind, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Puniſhment on him which all mens ſins deſerved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt alſo diſtinguiſh between Chriſts Dying <hi>Loco noſtro</hi> in the foreſaid ſence, and his Dying <hi>In noſtrum Beneficium:</hi> Or between his Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us <hi>Subrogative</hi> and <hi>Effective:</hi> The former being the preſuppoſed ground of the latter. Chriſt is conſiderable firſt as Dying for our <hi>Sins as the pro-cauſa Meritoria,</hi> before he is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as Dying for <hi>our Benefit,</hi> In regard of the order of Execution, as the Efficient Cauſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end obtained. I ſhall after ſhew that he Dyeth <hi>Loco omnium aequaliter;</hi> all mens Sins, except the after excepted, being equally the Cauſe of his Sufferings; but not <hi>In omnium Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num aequaliter,</hi> not to procure equal Benefits for all, or for ought we can prove, for any two.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt diſtinguiſh between the Sins whoſe Guilt Chriſt took upon him and bore on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59524:17"/>
the Croſs; and thoſe which he never took upon him or bore: That is, the final non-performance of the Conditions of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And ſo we muſt diſtinguiſh between, 1. That Law whoſe Curſe Chriſt took upon him, and bore, that he might deliver men from it who were obnoxious to it, and obliged to bear it; that is, the firſt Law of Works. And 2. That Law whoſe Curſe he never took upon him nor bore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ever freeth any man from who is once properly, Actually and I eremptorily obliged to bear it, or whom it doth actually condemn as guilty of the threatned Penalty: That is, the Law of Grace, which is his own New Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the finally Impenitent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We muſt alſo diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> which is when it attaineth its moſt immediate or neareſt Ends: And the <hi>ſatisfaction to the Law-maker for not fulfilling it.</hi> It is fulfilled either, 1.

Much leſs did God require ſatisfaction <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as a <hi>Creditor</hi> for a Debt: Though <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically</hi> our Sins and our Puniſhment are called <hi>Debt;</hi> and ſo we are called Debtors and God the Creditor; And ſo ſatisfaction is the <hi>Redditio equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valentis vel Tantidem, non Ejusdem.</hi> Yet without a metaphor, puniſhment may be called <hi>Debitum, Due:</hi> But it is Due <hi>to us from God,</hi> and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>to God from us;</hi> much leſs due to God as a Debt to a Creditor, or Goods and Poſſeſſions to a Proprietary.</p>
               <p n="7">7, We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuffering <hi>ex obligatione Legis &amp; merito peccati,</hi> as we ſhould have done if we had ſuffered our ſelves; and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>ex obligatione ſolius ſponſionis propriae;</hi> as Chriſt did without any Merit or Legal obligation; His own Sponſion being inſtead of both, and our Sin and Obligation being but the <hi>Occaſion,</hi> or <hi>Loco Cauſae meritoriae &amp; Obligatoriae.</hi> Theſe Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are chiefly to ſhew <hi>what Christ did,</hi> which muſt be known before we can clearly diſcern <hi>for whom:</hi> The uſe will be after manifeſt. More
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59524:18"/>
Diſtinctions are neceſſary, eſpecially about his Obedience or Fulfilling the Preceptive part of the Law, (and not the commination) and that in his own perſon, as obligatory to himſelf, (for the Precept obliged him, though the threatning did not) and not in <hi>Perſonâ noſtrâ</hi> or as obliging us: But I will proceed to thoſe Diſtinctions which concern the Effects.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We muſt further diſtinguiſh between Chriſts Death as <hi>ſatisfactory to Juſtice,</hi> and as a <hi>Price meritorious</hi> to purchaſe further Benefits: For I ſhall manifeſt that the former is the immediate next Effect; and that it could not be <hi>Purchaſing, meritorious,</hi> no nor <hi>accepted,</hi> but as it is firſt <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory;</hi> and that Chriſt did not Merit or <hi>Purchaſe</hi> further Benefits <hi>Loco noſtro,</hi> ſo far as he did ſuffer <hi>Loco nostro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. We muſt diſtinguiſh between Gods accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Chriſts ſatisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Acquittance and Justification of him</hi> thereupon, as having diſcharged <hi>all</hi> that he undertook; and Gods Acquittance, Juſtification and Acceptance of <hi>Sinners</hi> themſelves. God proclaimeth himſelf well pleaſed in his Son, as having done all his work perfectly; when yet he is not well pleaſed with and in men themſelves till Chriſt be formed in them: nor perfectly, till Chriſt be perfectly formed in them, and till he have preſented them perfectly ſanctified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and juſtified to his Father without ſpot or blemiſh, and fit for him to take full delight in.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We muſt diſtinguiſh between that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind, which Chriſt procured
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59524:18"/>
immediately by his ſatisfaction; [<hi>viz. That all ſhould be ſaved from that legal neceſſity of periſhing, and God ſhould Remit his Right of Puniſhing, and the advantage which his Justice had against man, into the Power and diſpoſe of the Redeemer;</hi> and that Mankind ſhould be all delivered up to Chriſt as their Lord and Ruler, to be dealt with hereafter upon terms of Mercy and not upon the old terms of the Law of Works in meer rigor of Juſtice] And that full recovery which Chriſt afterward maketh by the giving out of his Grace and Benefits. And ſo (as part of this) we muſt diſtinguiſh beween Mercy and Life <hi>Given to Christ for men,</hi> and Mercy and Life <hi>Given by Christ to Men themſelves</hi> directly. For as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and not <hi>we</hi> did <hi>make the ſatisfaction</hi> to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the Actual benefits are given <hi>first to Christ,</hi> and not directly <hi>to us;</hi> and ſo <hi>by Christ to us:</hi> Not that Pardon or Juſtification <hi>formally</hi> is given to Chriſt; but <hi>Power to pardon and justifie;</hi> to be exerciſed on the terms which we ſhall afterwards expreſs: God having not directly and fully forgiven the Sinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but remitted his Right of Puniſhing as he is Rector according to the old Rigorous condemning Law; delivering the Obligation into the hands of the Redeemer (as we do the Debtors Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the of hands of the ſurety for his ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;) to be put in ſuit only in Caſe of rejecting of his conditions of Grace.</p>
               <p n="11">11. We muſt as is ſaid before diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt (and the Father in him) <hi>as Rector per Leges or Legiſlator,</hi> and as <hi>Dominus Abſolutus.</hi> And ſo we muſt diſtinguiſh between thoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which Chriſt as <hi>Rector giveth by his Laws;</hi> and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59524:19"/>
thoſe which as meer Benefactor and <hi>Abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary</hi> he giveth, though not <hi>contrary</hi> to his Laws or Covenant; yet <hi>over and above</hi> what by Covenant or Law he giveth. Alſo we muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Event</hi> and Nature of things as ſuch; and the Right to, and Dueneſs of of things as ſuch. And conſequently we muſt moſt carefully diſtinguiſh between <hi>Gods Will de Rerum Eventu,</hi> and his <hi>Will de Debito,</hi> as ſuch. The clear diſtinguiſhing of theſe two is a ſingular Key to the opening of the ſence of Scripture, and in particular of this Controverſie. For indeed, it is to diſtinguiſh between our Phyſicks and our Ethicks. Gods will about Natural Beings as ſuch ſtands at the top of Phyſicks, as the firſt Cauſe. Gods <hi>will de Debito</hi> as ſuch, ſtands at the top of our Ethicks, as the firſt Cauſe. And you may eaſily conceive, how the confounding of our Phyſicks and Ethicks muſt needs blind us and loſe us in our Divinity, as it would do in Philoſophy. I joyn all theſe Diſtinctions together, for in ſome they all come to one, or are of neceſſary conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration joyntly that any one of them may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Our Divines uſually with the Schoolmen diſtinguiſh between <hi>voluntatem ſigni</hi> and <hi>Beneplaciti.</hi> But in the ordinary School Senſe, that is not the ſame diſtinction with that which I here intend. Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> oft uſeth the diſtinction between <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem propoſiti &amp; praecepti,</hi> and meaneth in effect the ſame that I do: But he oft ſpeaks of it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but <hi>Metonymically Gods will,</hi> and not properly; by which I muſt conclude that he meant <hi>quoad Eventum,</hi> and not <hi>quoad Debitum;</hi> for God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly willeth that this ſhall be Mans Due or Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59524:19"/>I ſhall therefore a little further explain this Diſtinction, and then ſhew you the ſoundneſs of it, and then the exceeding uſefulneſs and neceſſity of it; both in this and many other Controverſies. 1. For the Title, I chooſe rather to denominate it from the Object than the Act; becauſe the Diverſity is in the Object, but none in the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Act naturally conſidered: <hi>Debitum</hi> and <hi>Natural Being</hi> are two diſtinct things; but [<hi>To Will</hi>] one, and [<hi>to Will</hi>] the other, is all one as to the Nature of Willing. God doth <hi>as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Will Duty,</hi> as he wills Natural Beings: Yet if I muſt denominate it from the Acts, I would diſtinguiſh between Gods <hi>Directive Will,</hi> and his <hi>Legiſlative.</hi> For to call it <hi>volunt as Praecepti</hi> is too narrow a term; for the <hi>Precept</hi> is but one part of <hi>Gods Law,</hi> and determineth only of one ſort of <hi>Right;</hi> that is, of the dueneſs of obediential Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or forbearance of forbidden Actions. But there is alſo a <hi>Debitum praemii, &amp; Beneficii-purè vel abſolute-dati, &amp; Debitum Poenae,</hi> which the reſt of the Law, Teſtament or Covenant of God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth of; which muſt all be here included as well as the former. In ſum, the Law determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, 1. What <hi>Shall be due from us;</hi> 2. And what <hi>Shall be due to us,</hi> and on <hi>what terms.</hi> I call it therefore, <hi>The Will of God de Eventu, &amp; de Debito,</hi> as ſuch. I ſay. [as ſuch] for elſe they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident: For Gods <hi>Will de rerum Naturâ, vel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtentiâ</hi> determineth <hi>de Debito quatenus evenit eſſe Debitum,</hi> but not <hi>quâ Debitum.</hi> And his Will <hi>de Debito</hi> determineth of the <hi>Dueneſs</hi> of ſome Events, not as eventual but as due: Or to avoid all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity call it Gods will <hi>de ente mere naturali;</hi> and his will <hi>de debito Morali;</hi> or <hi>Legiſlative</hi> or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59524:20"/>
2. And for the Nature of the diſtinction, underſtand further, that there are two Acts which I call <hi>Gods will de Debito.</hi> The firſt is that imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Act of his Will by which he ſtrictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly willeth what ſhall be due. This alſo is twofold; 1. Productive or Inſtituting dueneſs: 2. And approbative or taking complacency in Duty. The former of theſe I principally intend, but exclude not the latter. God doth eternally will every Due, but it is not therefore eternally or from Eternity Due: For he willeth from Eternity (to ſpeak vulgarly) only that this ſhall be due at ſuch a time, and by ſuch a means. I ſay by ſuch means: For though Gods will produce all dueneſs, yet only <hi>by means</hi> doth he produce it. That means is, the <hi>Revelation of his will.</hi> 2. This <hi>Revelation of Gods will de Debito,</hi> we call <hi>his Law.</hi> This therefore is the ſecond thing which I call <hi>Gods will de debito,</hi> or his <hi>Legiſlative</hi> will; that is, <hi>the Law</hi> as it is <hi>ſignum voluntatis Divinae,</hi> that is, <hi>formally as a Law.</hi> This I call <hi>Gods will de Debito,</hi> only <hi>Metonymically,</hi> as it is the ſign of his will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed. If the proper will of God were ſeparated from this, it would then be no produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of <hi>Dueneſs or Right</hi> at all; for it would be <hi>no Law</hi> no <hi>ſignum;</hi> it would loſe its Nature as Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Laws do.</p>
               <p>Alſo obſerve, that you muſt here carefully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between <hi>Gods Act in making a Law,</hi> and the <hi>Moral Act</hi> of that <hi>Law,</hi> or of his will by that Law when it is made. I call not <hi>Legiſlation</hi> it ſelf [<hi>Gods will de Debito</hi>] or, [his <hi>Legiſlative</hi> will.] His ordaining the ſign it ſelf, or making the Law which is his inſtrument, is an Act of his will <hi>de rerum Eventu vel Naturae</hi> For it only maketh
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59524:20"/>
that inſtrument or ſign by which Right ſhall be after produced; but doth not directly thereby produce that Right. But it is the ſignification and <hi>Moral Act</hi> of that Law, which floweth from its Nature which doth produce Right, and which we here intend. The Scribe that writes a Statute, and the Sovereign himſelf, in compoſing the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Order and Terms, doth but make that <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num or Inſtrument,</hi> which being made doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Inſtitute Right, becauſe it ſignifieth the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns will to inſtitute it. So much for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of my meaning in this Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>2. Next I ſhall ſay ſomewhat to prove the ſoundneſs of it, which is therefore neceſſary, becauſe ſome ignorant perſons laugh at it; as if we feigned two wills in God, and one of them contrary to the other. Otherwiſe, to men of underſtanding it is not very needful: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall ſay but this briefly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not two Wills in God, as two diſtinct Eſſences or Faculties that I aſſert; but only two diſtinct Acts: Diſtinct, I ſay, in regard of their diſtinct products or Effects, and ſo to mans apprehenſion, though in God, we ſay there, is no diverſity or diſtinction. Yet as we cannot hanſomely conceive of his will to ſave <hi>Peter,</hi> and his will to damn <hi>Judas,</hi> as one act, having ſuch different Effects; ſo it is here. Who knows not that Naturality and Morality. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks and Ethicks, <hi>Event and Right</hi> are different things, and conſequently we may and muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Gods willing them accordingly. When a Man ſaith, [<hi>You ſhall do this,</hi>] preceptively, he doth only ſay [<hi>It ſhall be your duty to do it</hi>] but ſaith not that <hi>eventually</hi> you ſhall do it. Nor are his words falſe if you never do it. He that ſaith
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59524:21"/>
                  <hi>prophetically</hi> or by <hi>prognoſtication</hi> [<hi>you ſhall do this</hi>] means that it ſhall <hi>ſo come to paſs;</hi> and if it do not his words are falſe: But he doth not ſay, [<hi>It is or ſhall be your Duty.</hi>]</p>
               <p n="12">12. Accordingly we muſt diſtinguiſh between the antecedent and conſequent Acts and Will of Chriſt as Ruler of Mankind. For the underſtanding of which and avoiding miſtakes, obſerve, 1. That we ſpeak not now of Eternal Decrees, but of the will of Chriſt in this Relation as he is the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the World and Church, and as he is the conveyer of his mercies according to and by his Covenant, and as he judgeth the World accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto. 2. That by his Antecedent will, and acts, we mean only that which in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Antecedent to Mans Obedience or Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; which is principally Legiſlation, and and making his new Covenant; and alſo the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Preachers, and other acts, which are the firſt part of his Adminiſtration. And by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Acts and Will, we mean only that ſecond part of Government, which findeth Man Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or Diſobedient, and is commonly called <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Execution.</hi> And when we ſay that by his Antecedent Acts and Will Chriſt giveth Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Juſtification and Right to Glory, equally to all; we mean that as Legiſlator and Promiſer, he hath antecedently made an Univerſal Act of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blivion or Deed of Gift Conditionally Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all, and no farther than Conditionally Pardoning any. And when we ſay that he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently juſtifieth and ſaveth none but true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and in that Sence dyed for no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his conſequent will, we mean that as Judge of Mankind he will give Juſtification
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59524:21"/>
and Salvation to Believers and to no others; nor ever intended to do otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>(Let the Reader know, that the foreſaid Scheme of the Effects of Chriſts Death, is more accurately, and yet more briefly done in my <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodus Theologiae:</hi> And therefore let him that diſlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Number</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> of Diſtributions paſs it by: But I have not time to reform it here.</p>

All Mankind <hi>immediately</hi> upon Chriſts <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> are redeemed and Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that Legal neceſſity of Periſhing which, they were under, (not by remitting Sin or Puniſhment directly to them, but by giving up Gods <hi>Ius puniendi</hi> into the hands of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; nor by giving any Right directly to them, but <hi>per meram reſultantiam</hi> this happy change is made for them in their Relation; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaid remitting of Gods Right and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Juſtice againſt them,) and they are given up to the Redeemer as their owner and ruler, to be dealt with upon terms of mercy which have a tendency to their recovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XX. In Law-ſence, or in reſpect to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative will of God, Chriſt Dyed for all men. This will be explained in the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXI. Neither the Law whoſe curſe Chriſt bore, nor God as the Legiſlator to be ſatisfied, did diſtinguiſh between men as Elect and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, or as Believers and Unbelievers <hi>de preſenti vel de futuro;</hi> and ſo impoſe on Chriſt, or require from him ſatisfaction for the Sins of one ſort more than of another; but for <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXII. Chriſt hath made <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to God as Legiſlator; and accordingly his Legal Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59524:23"/>
Juſtice is ſatisfied, for the Sins of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as they are condemned, and were to be judged directly, primarily, ſimply by that Law; and hath not ſatisfied the Legiſlators Juſtice for ſome men only as Elect, or for one more than another, but equally for all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXIII. Chriſt hath by his Redemption of all obtained a <hi>Novum jus Imperii</hi> over all, and is <hi>Rector derivativè Supremus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXIV. As thoſe thoſe that know not God nor his Creation, are yet Gods Subjects as Creator, and he their Lord: So thoſe that know not Chriſt nor his Redemption, are yet his Redeemed, and his Subjects as Redeemed, and he their Lord-Reedeemer as to his Right and Law, and their Obligation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXV. God the Father, and Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator now dealeth with no man upon the meer rigorous terms of the firſt Law: [<hi>Obey perfectly and Live, elſe thou ſhalt Die;</hi>] But giveth to all much Mercy, which according to the tenor of that violated Law they could not receive, and calleth them to repentance in order to their receiving further mercy offered them. And accordingly he will not judge any at laſt according to the meer Law of works, but as they have obeyed or not obeyed his conditions or terms of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVI. Though God hath been pleaſed leſs clearly to acquaint us, on what terms he deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with thoſe that hear not of Chriſt, yet it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59524:24"/>
being moſt clear and certain that he dealeth with them on terms of Grace, and not on the terms of the rigorous Law of works; this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may evince them to be the Mediators Subjects and Redeemed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVII. The Law of Nature ſince the fall, is part of the Mediators Law, by which in part he governeth: For it, with all things is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVIII. Man without Scripture may find that he is a Sinner, and that Sin deſerveth Gods wrath, and his deſtruction; and in the Creatures and Providences, providing for him, preſerving, maintaining, delivering him, he may find abundance of Mercy; which being given to one that deſerveth miſery, muſt needs evince that it comes from a moſt gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, and tends to recovery, and to further mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXIX. Hence all Nations of the World have known themſelves Sinners, and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have had a Hope of obtaining mercy in the pardon of their ſins; and thence it is that all (who acknowledge a God) have had ſome kind of Religion; and expreſſed it in Sacrifices or Prayers for pardon and mercy; which could never have been, without the ſaid Hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXX. Though it be very difficult and not very neceſſary to know what is the condition preſcribed to them that hear not of Chriſt, or on what terms Chriſt will judge them; yet to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59524:24"/>
me it ſeems to be the Covenant made with <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. which they are under; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, their taking God to be their only God and Redeemer, and ſo expecting mercy from him, and loving him above all, as their end and chief good; and repenting of Sin and Sincere Obedience according to the Laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate to them, to lead them further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXI. As the rigorous Law of works is ſo far taken down to all men, that they are no longer under its impoſed neceſſity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to ſalvation; ſo the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonial Law, is Abrogated totally, and ſo the Obligation deſtroyed for all that were under it, without difference of Elect or Non-Elect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXII. God the Father and Chriſt the Mediator hath freely without any prerequiſite condition on mans part enacted a Law of Grace, of Univerſal extent in regard of its tenor, by which he giveth, as by a Deed of Gift, Chriſt himſelf with all his following benefits which he beſtoweth (as Benefactor and Legiſlator) and this to all alike, without excluding any; upon condition they Believe and Accept the Offer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXIII. By this Law, Teſtament or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>All men are Conditionally</hi> Pardoned, Juſtified and Reconciled to God already, and no man Abſolutely; nor doth it make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, nor take notice of any, till mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59524:25"/>
or non-peformance of the condition make a difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXIV. This Law or Covenant Chriſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth Heraulds to Publiſh, and commandeth them to Preach it to every Creature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth every man in his place to publiſh it; without excepting or excluding any from the Priviledge of receiving it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXV. As a Sovereign is not bound to cauſe every particular man infallibly to hear of his Laws, ſo he maketh a convenient publick Declaration of them; ſo Chriſt as Legiſlator is not bound to provide that every man hear of his Law whom it doth concern: Men that by Nature may be convinced that there is a God, and how neceſſary it is to know him and their Duty concerning him, and how little they do know of him are bound to make all poſſible enquiry after the further Revelation of his will, though it were by travelling into other Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXVI. When we ſay God and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator give pardon and Salvation to all men conditionally; we do not mean that there is any condition of his <hi>Making the Grant,</hi> but of his <hi>performing it,</hi> or of <hi>our receiving the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi> He abſolutely maketh a conditional Deed of Gift. He makes the <hi>Deed,</hi> and we are conditionally pardoned whether we believe or not. But we ſhall not be actually pardoned till we belive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59524:25"/>
                  <hi>Prop:</hi> XXXVII. The condition of this La Grant is nothing unreaſonable nor of Natural proper impoſſibility, (it is an Eaſie Yoake, and Commands that are not grievous) it being not the leaſt <hi>repenſum,</hi> price or requital; but only [the Hearty Acceptance of the offered Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit according to its Nature and uſe:] It is therefore proper enough to ſay (as Scripture doth) that <hi>all men are reconciled,</hi> the <hi>Worlds ſins taken away,</hi> and they forgiven; though yet none of this is <hi>Actually</hi> done, nor ever ſhall be to the final Rejecters; becauſe in a moral ſence, that is ſaid to be done: which being highly beneficial and neceſſary, may be done if we will, all the other impediments being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and nothing but the refuſal can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Men of the benefit, the Law ſuppoſing that he that is <hi>compos mentis</hi> will accept ſo great an offered benefit. Chriſt having done all his part or <hi>quantum in ſe, as ſatisfier</hi> and <hi>Legiſlator</hi> and given himſelf with his benefits to every man that will accept him; ſo that nothing but their own wilful refuſal can deprive them of them; in Law ſence he may well be ſaid, not only to Die for them, but to have procured them Pardon, Juſtification and Life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if the condition had either been a thing of proper Natural Impoſſibility, or unreaſonable, or unhoneſt, or if it were long of Chriſt that it is not performed, than it were improper to ſay that Chriſt and Life is given them, or that Chriſt Dyed for them to procure this gift.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXVIII. Chriſt hath given Faith to none by his Law or Teſtament; though he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59524:26"/>
that to ſome he will as Benefactor and <hi>Dominus Abſolutus</hi> give that Grace which ſhall infallibly produce it. And God hath given ſome to Chriſt that he might prevail with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: Yet this is no giving it <hi>to the Perſon,</hi> nor hath he in himſelf ever the more Title to it; nor can any lay claim to it as their due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXIX. It belongeth not to Chriſt as <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfier,</hi> nor yet as <hi>Legiſlator</hi> to make wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers to become willing and receive him and the benefits which he offers; therefore he may do all for them that is fore-expreſſed though he cure not their unbelief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XL. Faith is a fruit of the Death of Chriſt, (and ſo is all the good which we do enjoy): But not <hi>directly</hi> as it is <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to <hi>juſtice;</hi> but only <hi>Remotely,</hi> as it proceedeth from that <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us Dominii</hi> which Chriſt hath received, to ſend the Spirit in what meaſure and to whom he will, and to ſucceed it accordingly; and as it is neceſſary to the attainment of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends of his Death, in the certain gathering and ſaving of the Elec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that moſt directly it floweth from the good pleaſure of God and the Redeemer, which we call Praedeſtination. So that it is an unmeet Speech (and ſuch as Scripture never uſeth) to ſay, that [<hi>Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to purchaſe us Faith</hi>] though it be a <hi>Fruit of his Purchaſe.</hi> As if a Prince ſhould Ranſome or Buy a condemned Malefactor, agreeing and reſolving that yet he ſhall not be ſaved, if he will ſpit in his Redeemers Face and refuſe him and his kindneſs. And if it be known that this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59524:26"/>
Malefactor is ſo deſperately wicked, that he will thus reject and abuſe his Redeemer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his kindneſs, except the Prince ſend a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Friend to perſwade him, who is the moſt powerful unreſiſtable Orator in the World: If the Prince becauſe he is reſolved neither to loſe the Man, nor his Price of Ranſom, doth ſend this Orator with a Charge that he ſhall take no denial, nor ceaſe till he have procured the Malefactors conſent; is it a convenient Speech to ſay, that he gave his Ranſom Mony to purchaſe the Malefactors conſent to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered? Or to cure his wicked nature? No: Yet it is true that his Price was a ground-work and Preparative to this effect; ſo is it in our preſent Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XLI. The Reſurrection of the Bodies of all Men is a Benefit procured by the death and Reſurrection of Chriſt: (For though the Soul it ſelf ſhould everlaſtingly have ſuffered, yet the Body ſhould have remained in its ſtate of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, if Chriſt had not reſtored it) which Reſurrection in it ſelf is a mercy to all, (and it is a means to Gods further Glory by his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) though the wicked turn it to be the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance of unſpeakable miſery to themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XLII. There is no mercy which any Man enjoyeth by Right of Law from God, but it is from the Covenant or Law of Grace, and ſo from the Blood of that Covenant: For from the old riolated rigorous Law it cannot be; therefore it muſt be from the Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59524:27"/>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XLIII. Chriſt by his Law of Grace, hath made it every Mans duty that hears it, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and accept him, as our Saviour that hath made ſatisfaction for their Sins, and ſo dyed for them, and is their Redeemer: And to be highly thankful to him for this his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XLIV. Chriſt by his Law hath made a far ſorer puniſhment than before belonged to them, to be due to all thoſe that believe not in him as one that hath ſo ſatisfied, and are not thankfull for it, and do not take him for their Redeemer. And for refuſing their Lord-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, ſhall they be condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XLV. The conſciences of the damned in Hell (which will be Gods executioners) will everlaſtingly torment them for refuſing that Pardon and Salvation that was ſo dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for them, and that Redeemer that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſo much Love to them, and for not performing ſo reaſonable and eaſie a condition, as Faith. They ſhall not then have the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of an impoſſibility in the condition, or that Chriſt never died for them, and never was their Redeemer, and conſequently that it was no Sin of theirs to refuſe a Redeemer, that was not their Redeemer, and ſatisfaction that was none for them, I ſay, they ſhall not have ſuch diſcoveries to eaſe their conſciences, and leſſen their torments, and make Hell as no Hell to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59524:27"/>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XLVI. A Chriſt-Redeemer, that hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied juſtice, is the object of Commanded Faith, and preſuppoſed to it: Annd he that commandeth all Men to believe in Chriſt a one that hath redeemed them or ſatisfied for their Sins, doth hereby aſſert the truth of this ſuppoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XLVII. The conſtitution of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom containeth many great univerſal mercies, Antecedent to thoſe that are given conditionally by his Covenant or Law of Grace; Such as are the giving of the Covenant it ſelf, and the Inſtitution of Sacraments, Ordinances, Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore as to be a ſubject is Antecedent to the being of an <hi>Obedient</hi> or a <hi>Rewarded</hi> Subject; ſo Chriſts Antecedent mercies of Redemption, extend to more than his conſequent mercies do, which ſuppoſe the performance of the conditions of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XLVIII. The foundations of Chriſts Kingdom being firſt laid in his undertaking, Performances, Death, Reſurrection, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation or Covenant-making; ſo there are three diſtinct ſtates of his ſubjects: 1. The Antecedent ſtate (Antecedent to any act of their own) is to be <hi>ſubditi obligati obliged ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> 2. The mediate ſtate is to be <hi>conſenting obedient ſubjects,</hi> or <hi>rebellious</hi> and <hi>diſobedient.</hi> 3. The conſequent ſtate is to be <hi>juſtified re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded ſubjects,</hi> or <hi>Condemned Subjects.</hi> And it will not follow that Chriſt never brought men
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59524:28"/>
into the firſt condition, becauſe he never brought them into the laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> XLIX. Accordingly the Kingdom of Chriſt the Mediator, in its largeſt extent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all Mankind as redeemed, and made his obliged Subjects, though moſt prove Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells. But in a limited ſenſe it containeth only the faithful, obedient, and juſtified part of the univerſal Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> L. It is this ſecond conſenting Part of his ſubjects only who are his <hi>Church,</hi> and are by Baptiſm engaged to him. So that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt as Redeemer is larger than his Church; and they are not words of the ſame ſignification, unleſs when the word Kingdom is taken in the narrow ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> LI. God hath not divided the World into two Parts, and put one Part only under the Government of Chriſt, and Governeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately himſelf only as meer Creator: But Chriſt is Adminiſtrator General over all Mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> LII. They that ſay that God giveth, all the mercies which the ungodly have, according to the firſt Covenant of Innocency; muſt make that Covenant another thing than indeed it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> LIII. They that feign God to continue the Covenant of Innocency, as to the Promiſſory Part, and to Covern thoſe that are born in ſin
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59524:28"/>
and miſery, by that Law which ſaith [<hi>Be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and Live</hi>] do expoſe Gods Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment falſly to reproach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> LIV. They that hold that Heathens and Hypocrites are under no Covenant or Law that hath conditional promiſes, do deny a great Part of Gods Government of Mankind, and give them more excuſe for their neglect of all means for their Salvation, than is true, or than God will allow of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> LV. They that ſay that all the mercies beſtowed on Heathens, or Hypocrites are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them without the purchaſe of Chriſt, by the meer will of God not reſpecting any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler or Propitiation, do Sin againſt the Scripture reaſons of Chriſts Office, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and do open a Gap for the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of them who plead againſt the neceſſity of Chriſts death for the Elect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> LVI. Though Chriſts Dominion over inanimates and Bruits do not prove that he dyed for them; Yet his dying for Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, procured his Dominion over them; which is joyned with his Empire over the ſame Perſons, which he exerciſeth by ſuch Laws as have a tendency to their repentance, Pardon and Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> LVII. All this conſidered, It is (<hi>de nomine</hi>) a proper Speech much uſed in Scripture, to ſay that Chriſt dyed for all Men, and is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World, and is the Lamb of God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59524:29"/>
that taketh away the Sins of the World, and is a propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, and taſted Death for every man, and that if one Died for all then were all Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Seeing all the foreſaid Benefits of his Death, are actually given them.</p>

                     <hi>Prop.</hi> II. It was not the Law it ſelf that Chriſt ſatisfied (if we ſpeak properly) but the Law-giver. Though improperly the Law it ſelf may be ſaid to be ſatisfied when its <hi>Ends</hi> are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; that is, the Ends of the Legiſlator in giving the Law. The Law knows no proper ſatisfaction. To admit of ſatisfaction inſtead of fulfilling and execution, is beyond the power of the Law, and is the act of the Legiſlator as he is above the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> III.

                  <p>

As the nature of the Law is to conſtitute <hi>Debitum, Dueneſs;</hi> ſo it conſtitutes to all <hi>Men,</hi> 1. The <hi>Dueneſs</hi> of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> that they <hi>accept</hi> Chriſt <hi>offered</hi> them. 2. The <hi>Dueneſs of the Benefit, if they accept him</hi> (a conditional due.) 3. And the <hi>Dueneſs of the puniſhment</hi> if they <hi>reject him.</hi> So that in Law Senſe Chriſt dyed for all.</p>

nor a <hi>Mercy</hi> to them, then the <hi>Damned</hi> ſhould not <hi>periſh</hi> for rejecting their Redeemer, nor for refuſing the mercy of Redemption; Nor their conſciences accuſe them for it. But undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly <hi>for this</hi> will be their deſtruction, and <hi>for this</hi> their conſciences will accuſe them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXV. It being not the ſatisfaction it ſelf that is tendered to Sinners, but the <hi>Fruit</hi> of it, It cannot by any Miniſter, nor will not by Chriſt, be offer'd (in thoſe Fruits) to Men, if it were not firſt <hi>given</hi> and <hi>accepted for them</hi> as well as others (in Law Sence) by God, from the Redeemer. The <hi>Rector</hi> or <hi>Creditor</hi> muſt firſt <hi>receive the ſatiſfaction,</hi> before a <hi>diſcharge</hi> can be offered to the offendor or Debtor, on conſideration of that ſatisfaction made and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: Much more, before Men can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned juſtly for refuſing it. If the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were given and accepted for the Elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it could not in the Benefits which wholly preſuppoſe it, be ſo offered to the Non-Elect, and they judged for refuſing the benefit of a ſatisfaction never made for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXVI. Chriſts dying for Men, is Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to their believing in him: Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving preſuppoſeth his dying for them: His Death ſaveth them becauſe they believe; but he did not die for them becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but they muſt believe becauſe he dyed for them. The <hi>Act</hi> both as performed and commanded here preſuppoſeth the Object. The <hi>Command</hi> therefore of <hi>believing</hi> preſuppoſeth that Chriſtdyed for Men.</p>

                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXVII. No Mans name or Deſcription (ſo as to difference him from others) being in the offer and promiſe conditional, but it being made alike to all, it will follow that no Man could have any true ground to believe or accept Chriſt if he knew not that he is one of thoſe, to whom he is univerſally offered, and conditionally given; and conſequently for whom he ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXVIII. If the condition on which Chriſt is given to all (and Life in him) were ſomething of natural proper impoſſibility, or unreaſonable, or if it were long of Chriſt that the condition is not performed by them, then it were leſs proper to ſay, that Chriſt is given them, or that he dyed for them, in reſpect to this conditional gift. But ſeeing the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nothing of natural proper impoſſibility, nor unreaſonable, being but their hearty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Chriſt as he is offered them and not the leaſt <hi>Repenſum;</hi> requital, price, or repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and nothing but their own wicked diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and obſtinacy can cauſe their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance; ſo that they may have Chriſt and Life if they will; therefore it is proper to ſay that Chriſt is given them, and conditional Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Life in him; and that Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dyed for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXIX. It is Gods Law or Covenants which conſtitute the Right or Dueneſs of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, rewards, and puniſhments, and it is not Election or the meer Decree of God that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59524:34"/>
doth any of theſe. We have no Right to Chriſt upon Election, till the Covenant or Law give us Right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XL. Elect and Non-Elect therefore have equal Right to Chriſt, till believing difference them: That is, all have a conditional Right, and none an actual and abſolute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XLI. The Covenant berween the Father and Mediator (commonly ſo called) gave Chriſt a full Power to confer pardon and Life; but gave not to Men any Right ot Title to the benefits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XLII. Nor did that Covenant or promiſe which God made to fallen mankind of ſending a Saviour to Redeem them, give this Right actually to theſe benefits.</p>

Nor doth that promiſe or Covenant which God hath made, of giving a new and ſoft Heart to the Elect, give any Man an actual Right to Remiſſion, Juſtification or Glory: No nor to renewing Grace: it being but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction what God reſolveth to do for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſome, known only to himſelf and ſo a diſcovery of his purpoſe, and not a conferring of Right.

Of the other (the viſible Church) all profeſſed Chriſtians are members: Theſe he ruleth by his Law of Grace, and Spirit, but differently. Of the third (which is the Souls of believers) only true believers are members: Theſe only Chriſt ruleth to Salvation; but the reſt alſo, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>

It ſeems an injurious feigning of Chriſt to ſuffer much in vain, to ſay that he paid a Price ſufficient for all the World, when yet it ſhall be no way efficient: Unleſs they think that Chriſts ſufferings are no greater for all Men, than if he had ſuffered but for one or few; and that <hi>minima guttula ſanguinis Chriſt i ſufficit ad redimendum mille mundos,</hi> which our Divines diſclaim, as a dangerous Error. They therefore that think it, a making Chriſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in vain, to ſay, <hi>He dyed for ſome that periſh;</hi> do themſelves make him much more, to ſuffer in vain, in ſaying, he paid a Price for ſome, which was ſufficient for all, but ſhall be no way effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them.</p>

The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between ſuffering by our ſelves or our delegate, ſubſtitute or Vicar, and a Mediator ſuffering for us, 2.

terms the accepter pleaſeth, and not <hi>ipſo facto;</hi> and a <hi>not refuſable payment,</hi> (ſuch as the firſt is) God accepted the ſatisfaction on thoſe terms only, that no final Rebel ſhould partake of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefit. If it be a wrong, it is either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, or the Sinner, Not to the <hi>Sinner,</hi> for he ſuffereth but once: And the former ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, was not in perſonation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of his perſon, nor as his ſubſtitute, nor appointed or procured by him: But by a third Perſon, in the Perſon of a Mediator ſent by God, and voluntarily undertaking it. Nor to Chriſt is it any wrong: For 1. He is willing: <hi>Volenti non fit injuria.</hi> 2. It was the agreement, it ſhould be ſo: 3. Yea it is he that <hi>doth it.</hi> He as Judge condemns them for ingratitude and Rebelling againſt himſelf and conſequently leaves all the reſt of their Sins upon them.</p>

Nor is it any more abſurd that Chriſt ſhould ſatisfie for thoſe that were in Hell, when he ſufferd, then that he ſhould do it for thoſe that were in Heaven at his ſuffering. He paid the Price which he had agreed to pay, which became effectual upon the agreement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking (before the payment:) And was then offered to Mankind: Of whom ſome ſuffered for rejecting it as others were ſaved upon the accepting it, even before his death.</p>

Even as Gods Creation and preſervation of Men, is not to be called Vain, or no mercy, becauſe he gives not all Men Hearts to repent, and ſo ſome periſh. For as Creation laid the ground of the Creators Dominion, Rectorſhip, Legiſlation and Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Judgment (if the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had ſtood in force as it was at firſt): So did Redemption by ſatisfaction do in reſpect of the Redeemer, and Covenant of Grace:</p>

Now will any ſay, that becauſe he appointeth the Wild Beaſts to death, and yet ſatisfied not for them, nor Redeemed them, that therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed not the Rebels neither?

Thoſe that dare ſay, that Chriſt is an imperfect Redeemer if he do not procure Faith it ſelf for every Man that he Dyeth for, (which is their Maſter Argument) may as well ſay, that God is an imperfect Creator, becauſe he maketh not Worms to be Men; or that he is an imperfect Conſervator becauſe he preſerved not man from Mortality, Damnation and Antecedent Calamities; eſpecially from

It is true that no puniſhment is due to the Elect, and none is properly forgiven them now ſince Chriſts Death: But Chriſts aſſuming their Perſons in ſatisfying, was a Remiſſion to them: Or God did in one inſtant remit it to them and transfer it on Chriſt. Reply. 1. Chriſts aſſuming our Perſons, is not remiſſion of Sin. 2. If God did remit it to us, when he transferred it on Chriſt, and yet we <hi>Legaliter,</hi> ſuffered in Chriſt, then God did both remit the whole debt to us, and receive ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Law-Sence from us, at the ſame time: But that is a contradiction.

               <p>The Major is alſo plain. It is injuſtice to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe to whom no puniſhment is <hi>due:</hi> But no puniſhment is due to them that have fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for all Sin: Therefore to puniſh them that have ſo ſuffered is injuſtice. I know God is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Lord of the Creature, and therefore may in that regard uſe them as he pleaſe: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, as <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> that he may without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice torment or afflict the moſt innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (ſuppoſing him not to have promiſed the contrary, and to be only <hi>Dominus, &amp; non Rector</hi>): But (ſaith <hi>Twiſſe</hi>) he cannot puniſh the innocent: For that is a contradiction and ſo impoſſible. For all puniſhment is for ſin. Affliction is but the matter of puniſhment and not the form. Beſides; God being Rector of the reaſonable Creature, and having expreſſed in his Laws, that he will not puniſh Men that deſerve it not, it is not to be charged on him. If any ſay, God is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of injuſtice, if you ſhould ſuppoſe the breach of his promiſe? I ſay, 1. as <hi>Abraham Gen.</hi> 18. 25.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59524:42"/>
that be far from thee to do after this manner, to ſlay the Righteous with the wicked, and that the Righteous ſhould be as the wicked; that be far from thee: Shall not the judge of all the Earth do Right? 2. We cannot ſuppoſe God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile contradictions: Such it is to puniſh the Innocent.</p>

If any on the old grounds ſhall ſay, that beſides the Righteouſneſs Negatiue, (which is not guilty of puniſhment) there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite a poſitive righteouſneſs, to give Right to the reward, and this they want. I reply 1. One righteouſneſs, doth both, I think. 2. If it were not ſo yet Chriſts ſatisfaction is meritorious of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. 3.

that in him we fulfilled the Law 4.

But this Doctrine ſaith, conſequently, His friends ye are whom you never obeyed; and that the Elect before converſion, who obey the Devil, and ſo are his Servants, and never had obedience unto Righteouſneſs, are yet Righteous, as having paid all their debt.</p>

               <p>11. <hi>Arg.</hi> Chriſt ſuffered and ſatisfied in the Perſon of Mediator; therefore not in the Perſon of the Elect or Offender: Becauſe a mediator is a middle perſon, and Chriſt ſuſtained not two perſons as a ſufferer.</p>

               </p>
               <p>13. <hi>Arg.</hi> That Doctrine is not tollerable which makes Man his own Redeemer, or to have ſatisfied or ſuffered for his own Sins: But ſuch this ſeems therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if the Law ſay, that we ſatisfied in Chriſt, then in Law Sence, we ſatisfied for own Sins, and conſequently redeemed our ſelves.</p>
               <p>As for their Objection, that no other way but repreſenting our perſons could ſuffice to ſave us by the ſatisfaction of another; it is a groſs miſtake and naked affirmation without proof.</p>
               <p>And for them that ſay, Chriſt <hi>ſuffered</hi> in <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona noſtrâ,</hi> but not <hi>ſatisfied or merited</hi> ſo: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. They ſpeak inconſiſtencies: Satisfaction and Merit are neceſſary reſults from the nature of the ſuffering conſidered with the Dignity of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59524:43"/>
the Perſon, and the Divine acceptance. Now if Chriſt ſuffered not in his own perſon, whoſe dignity was to communicate a value to his ſufferings, then his ſufferings are defective in their value. And if we did in Chriſt or by him ſuffer all that was due, it is impoſſible but God ſhould take that ſuffering for ſatisfactory, in the larger Sence, it being <hi>ſolutio ipſius debiti,</hi> in ſtrict Sence. So that if the Law or Law-giver ſay, the Elect ſuffered in Chriſt; they muſt needs ſay, the elect ſatisfied in Chriſt, or rather paid the debt of the due puniſhment. And this God could not but accept, (<hi>conſequenter ad Leges</hi>) For who can refuſe the proper debt? Or deny an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance to him that diſchargeth it? But from a ſponſor he might have refuſed it.</p>
               <p>I might add many more Arguments, were it needful. As from the diſhonour that this will caſt on Gods Law, in threatning thoſe that have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied it already; in offering pardon and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation on conditions, to thoſe that were juſtified without pardon, 1600. years ago. For a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuſpendeth the benefit till it be performed: But no juſtice can ſuſpend his juſtification who hath diſcharged all the debt. What can be required more then all? Alſo that the Covenant or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be Gods Deed of Gift, or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conveying Right, to that which is our own already, 1600. years ago. Alſo the Goſpel ſaith, our Life is in the Son, and all is delivered, into his Hands; but this putteth our Rights in our own Hands, even when we have no being. Alſo according to this Doctrine Men were juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were Men, and acquitted from all Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were born or had committed Sin: And
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59524:44"/>
ſo Sinners that were no Men and conſequently no Sinners, were acquitted from Sin that was not, and conſequently was no Sin.</p>

theſe as I can ſee any ground but of probability to encourage me: Though yet I know how hard it is, for them that ſay, by [Death] in the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tning, was meant, Death, Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal, to prove that the loſs of Gnds Image was none of the penalty; (for I hope none will ſay, that Chriſt loſt Gods Image) or that Chriſts temporary ſufferings, were the <hi>Idem</hi> with our Eternal, <hi>quoad quantitatem;</hi> and not the want of duration made up by the intenſion, or dignity of the perſon, as being Aequivalent: (Which is our ordinary Doctrine, and I think ſound): Or yet that the Eternity of the puniſhment was not in the threatning, but was accidental: Either, as ſome Schoolmen think, for want of power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver or overcome; or as others (and with them <hi>Parker</hi> and <hi>Sanford,</hi> I think, not ſoundly) becauſe of the everlaſtingneſs of Sinning. I think none of theſe much worth the diſputing, comparatively: Nor 2. is it <hi>de perſonâ naturali,</hi> who he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally that paid the debt, or made the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is not therefore <hi>de materia debiti,</hi> that we enquire, but <hi>de formâ:</hi> Whether it were the ſame formally which we owed, and the obligation required? Or only the Value, and not the ſame full debt? Alſo you muſt know that, though we may well uſe the word [debt] in this Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture doth, yet we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it but a Metaphor, and the proper terms are, whether Chriſts ſufferings were the ſame thing that the Law in its threatning required, <hi>i. e.</hi> obliged unto, and made due? And ſo a fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that threatning? And this with great averfeneſs I deny. The queſtion is determined on the determination of the former, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59524:45"/>
dependance on it, and being <hi>tantum non</hi> in Sence the ſame. And therefore all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which I uſed for the former will ſerve to this; and therefore I need not repeat any of them, but refer you to them, deſiring you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe them and apply them to this; for all the ſame abſurdities (or neer all) do follow upon this as on the other. Indeed theſe two together (that Chriſt paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> the debt it ſelf and not the value, by perſonating us in his ſufferings, ſo that in Law Sence, we ſatisfied in him) are the very foundation of the whole frame of that Religion commonly called <hi>Antinomian,</hi> but much more fitly Anti-evangelical. To touch again on ſome few. It is evident that this Doctrine ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyeth all poſſibility of pardon of Sin, and conſequently all repenting and believing, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for pardon, all thankfulneſs for it, all Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental or Evangelical Conveyance of it by the promiſe, all Goſpel and Miniſterial tenders of pardon; all Sacramental exhibition and obſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pardon; and a Chriſtians enquiries, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and ſeekings after pardon, and his comforts living or dying in aſſurance of pardon; and inſtead of all, aſſerteth us ſo righteous, that we need no pardon. You will ſure confeſs, that if this will follow, then almoſt all Religion is overthrown at a blow. And that it follows, ſeems to me paſt doubt. For what can any Law in the World require or any Lawgiver, in exacteſt juſtice, but that the Law be perfectly fulfilled? What can any creditor require, but the <hi>Idem,</hi> the very debt it ſelf which the obligation did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? Can he have all his debt, and remit it too? Is the obligation fulfilled, and remitted or relaxed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59524:45"/>
too? Doth the Judg execute all the penalty; and yet forgive it? Is not he unjuſt that denieth him an acquittance and the cancelling of the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who hath fully paid him all his due? If any ſhall conceive, with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that the ſame inconveniences will follow, upon the aſſerting of Chriſts full ſatisfaction for us, I anſwer, Not one of them: Nay there is no way, I think, but this that I now maintain to confute a <hi>Socinian,</hi> and defend Chriſts ſatisfaction. Were it well uſed, it is a Key into a great part of the Body of Divinity, and helpeth to reſolve ſolidly and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily a multitude of difficult objections, which without this admit not of ſolution (though Mr. <hi>O.</hi> call it my <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) The <hi>Idem,</hi> or full debt or ſuffering, is <hi>ſolutio non recuſabilis</hi> the Value in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind or way, is <hi>ſolutio recuſabilis, (ſtricte dicta ſatisfactio</hi>) more plainly, the proper penalty, which is <hi>ſupplicum delinquentis,</hi> is all that can be required to ſatisfie the Legiſlator or Law: But that an innocent perſon ſhould ſuffer for our Sins, is <hi>quid Recuſabile;</hi> the Legiſlator may refuſe it. If therefore we had paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> the very debt we had been acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or to be acquitted <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> as preſently righteous, without Remiſſion; but when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pays it (even the Son of the Law-giver ſent by his own Love aud Mercy, who is neerer him then us) theſe two things follow, 1. That the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Rector may accept it on what terms he pleaſe, or not accept it: And that accordingly God did accept it on terms moſt fitted to his bleſſed ends in governing the World: Among others, that Man ſhould have the ſpecial benefits of this ſatisfaction conveyed to them only in a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal way, in time, on ſuch and ſuch terms or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59524:46"/>
as he ſaw meet, and as is expreſſed in the tenor of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay it was the deſire of Chriſt the ſatisfier, that theſe Benefits ſhould only thus be conveyed to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: That ſo though the Impetration were wholly by him, and abſolutely wrought, yet the Application might be in part by themſelves and conditional; and the mercy might not croſs Gods ends by making them independent and ſecure, but might further his ends, in drawing them to him, and engaging them to repent, believe, ſeek, ſtrive, fear, care, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Idem,</hi> were paid, that is, the delinquent himſelf had ſuffered, there had needed no New Covenant, to apply the Benefits, or convey them: But now there doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be the <hi>Idem,</hi> the full due, though not <hi>per eundum,</hi> by the ſame perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Diſtinguiſh (as before) between the <hi>Idem Materialiter</hi> and <hi>Formaliter,</hi> alſo between the full debt and a Part. And ſo, if it were a debt of Money or the like 1. It may be fully the ſame materially, and not formally: As a Man may ſteal that ſame Money which you owe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and pay it to that other as his own debt: 2. Here you muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>Perſonam Naturalem &amp; Civilem vel Legalem:</hi> If you pay all that was in the obligation, by your Servant, Friend or any Delegate or Vicar, the Law will ſay, you have paid it your ſelf. It was your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates perſon naturally, but yours Legally or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Inſtrument, Becauſe the obligation required but the thing to be paid in your Name,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59524:46"/>
by what hand ſoever; and ſo you are acquitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without remiſſion: For you have diſcharged the proper debt, and the Creditor can demand no more.</p>
               <p>But now in Criminals its otherwiſe: Becauſe the very Perſon offending is in the obligation as the ſubject of the penalty: <hi>Noxa Caput ſequitur.</hi> So that <hi>formaliter</hi> it is not the ſuffering which was due to you, which another ſuffers for you. This I add as a main Argument for my propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>If the Law do require only <hi>ſupplicium ipſius delinquentis,</hi> then Chriſts ſufferings were not the <hi>Idem,</hi> the ſame thing which the Law required: Nor is the Law fulfilled thereby. But the Law doth require only <hi>ſupplicium ipſius delinquentis:</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Major, or its conſequence it needs no proof; for Chriſt was not <hi>ipſe delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens;</hi> He was made Sin, that is, one puniſhable and puniſhed for Sin; but not really, nor in Law a Sinner. The Law never took any Man for a Sinner that did not Sin. Of this more anon. The Minor is proved from the words of the Law [<hi>In the Day thou ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

They add to Gods Law, out of their own Brain, 2. They make the Law to know a ſurety before Sin; 3. They confound hereby Law and Goſpel: For it is only the Goſpel that revealed a ſurety. 4. They make the Law to Curſe the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nocent, and to threaten Chriſt for our Sin dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly 5. They make Chriſt a ſurety <hi>â parte ante,</hi> and not <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> and ſo corrupt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59524:47"/>
of his Office. Let them therefore prove it before they affirm it. I conclude therefore in this caſe (as <hi>Grotius, Eſſenius,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Dum alius ſoluit, ſimul aliud ſolvitur.</hi> And therefore Mr. <hi>O.</hi> and others that grant <hi>alius ſoluit,</hi> muſt needs grant that <hi>aliud ſolvitur.</hi> It was us and not Chriſt that the Law threatned, and therefore it is not Chriſts ſufferings that is the <hi>Idem,</hi> the thing threatned, but ours; nor that is a proper fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the commination in the execution. So that the obligation is not <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> in juſtice void on Chriſts ſatisfaction, as it would have been on our payment (had ours been poſſible,) and on the payment of the proper Debt.</p>
               <p>Again I argue, as before; that is not true Doctrine which denyeth Chriſts proper ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But ſo doth the oppoſed Doctrine directly. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For <hi>ſatisfactio (ſtrictè ſumpta) &amp; ſolutio ſtricte ſumpta,</hi> are thus different; <hi>ſatisfactio</hi> is <hi>ſolutio tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem, &amp; ſolutio stricte ſumpta eſt ejuſdem.</hi> He therefore that affirmeth that Chriſt paid our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Debt, denyeth him to have made proper ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for our non-payment.</p>

The ſuffering of the penalty may be called ſatisfaction of the Law, as to the Precepts; that is, the Law is ſatisfied for our violation of its commands; but as to the threatning, it is properly the fulfilling of it. 4. Chriſt did fulfil the precept of the Law in his own perſonal perfect obedience, and ſo was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Righteous <hi>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt did not fulfil the threatning of the Law as to himſelf, for it did not threaten him. 6. Chriſt did not fulfil the threatning of the Law, as to us; for that had been nothing elſe but to Damn us all. 7. Chriſt might improperly be ſaid to ſatisfie the ends of the Law: I mean the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59524:48"/>
remote Ends which are not Eſſential to it; but not the immediate neareſt end, which entereth its difinition; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>terminus:</hi> The <hi>Debitum Poenae pro comminationem Conſtitutum.</hi> God made Laws to rule men, and therein by threatnings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth his hatred of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is as fully expreſſed in the ſufferings of Chriſt, as if the threat had been fulfilled. 8. Chriſt did not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Law it ſelf. (I mean the ſence of the Law,) but the Legiſlator. This is it which I muſt prove, having firſt removed this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The end of Law, is the Law: But Chriſt ſatisfied the End of the Law: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The next end, called the <hi>terminus,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the definition in Relations. This Chriſt did not ſatisfie. The Law did conſtitute the dueneſs of our perſonal puniſhment (which is remitted) but not Chriſts puniſhment (which was ſuffered) The remote ends of the Law, are not truly the Law but proverbially ſo called by ſome. The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſence, is the Law, and not thoſe ends. Now that Chriſt ſatisfied not the Law, I prove thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. If the Law know no ſatisfaction, (or be capable of none) but the fulfilling of it, (which is not ſtrictly ſatisfaction) then Chriſts ſufferings were no ſatisfaction to the Law. But the Law knoweth no other, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We doubt not of his fulfilling the Precept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that is not ſatisfaction to the Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59524:49"/>
and properly for anothers violation of it. The Major is unqueſtionable if we prove that Chriſt fulfilled not the threat: And that I have done already.</p>
               <p>1. If Chriſt was not threatned by the Law, (or if it threatned none but <hi>ipſum delinquentem;</hi>) then Chriſts ſufferings were not the fulfilling of the threat: (for he was not the <hi>delinquent</hi>) But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. If Chriſt therefore ſuffered to relax the Law, and that its threatning might not be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then his ſufferings were not the fulfilling of the Law. But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prob. Min.</hi> that the Law knoweth no other ſatisfaction, but fulfilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. Satisfaction ſtrictly (as diſtinct from fulfilling) is <hi>Redditio aequivalentis.</hi> But the Law, (as continuing the ſame) cannot commute or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the <hi>aequivalens vel tantundem,</hi> for the <hi>Idem</hi> or proper Debt.</p>
               <p>2. It is eſſential to the Law to conſtitute the <hi>Debitum vel officij vel Poenae.</hi> But it conſtitutes not the <hi>Debitum alterius ſpeciei, vel tantidem;</hi> (elſe it ſhould confound the <hi>ipſum debitum</hi> with the <hi>aequiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens.</hi>) The Law never impoſed it on Chriſt to ſatisfie for our ſins: This was the obligation of his own Sponſion.</p>
               <p>3. Satisfaction which is the giving of the value for the proper Debt, implyeth a relaxation of the Law to its acceptance: But the Law cannot relax it ſelf. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. To admit of ſatisfaction, is the Act of the Lawgiver or Rector, as he is above Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59524:49"/>
it is no act of the Law. As to make a Law, to pardon an Offender, to abrogate a Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are acts of one above the Law, ſo is the relaxing of the Law in pardoning the Sinner, and taking Chriſts ſufferings for ours. Can any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſſolve or remit it ſelf?</p>
               <p>5. If the Law did neither threaten Chriſt in the firſt enacting of it, nor hath power to change it ſelf ſince, by aſſuming another ſenſe, then Chriſts ſufferings were neither a fulfilling nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Law. <hi>At verum prius Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> If the name of Chriſt were put into the threatning after the Law was made, then the Law was changed, and ſo is not the ſame; and it could not change it ſelf. Indeed if another for you pay a Debt, the Bond is ſatisfied, becauſe it was the <hi>ipſum debitum.</hi> But if another will bear the Death that you deſerve, the Law that threatens you is not ſatisfied nor fulfilled; But the Law-giver is ſatisfied, and the ends of the Law attained. But here note, that this relaxation and non fulfilling of the Law, is not total and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; nor ſuch as derogateth at all from the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Law or Lawgiver; but it is a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon ſuch terms as preſerve both fully; the full weight of the threatned Puniſhment being born or undertaken by the Son of God, before God would relax his Law.</p>
               <p>6. To this and the two former together, I add: If the Laws Commination be fulfilled, or if Chriſt ſuffered the ſame that was threatned, or if we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied fully in Chriſt, then we are not by that Law obliged to obedience during this Life. But the conſequent is falſe <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59524:50"/>The reaſon of the conſequence is this. The Law obligeth <hi>aut ad obedientiam, aut ad poenam,</hi> disjunctively <hi>pro eodem tempore,</hi> and not <hi>&amp; ad obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam &amp; ad poenam.</hi> Now Chriſt hath ſatisfied for our ſin not only againſt the Law of Works by <hi>Adam,</hi> but againſt all Laws of Nature or Grace ſince, except the non performance of the condition of the new Covenant, and this to our Death. So that if we have in Chriſt fully ſatisfied the threatning for all ſin in this Life, then we cannot be bound by the Precept after ſuch ſatisfaction, till after this Life be ended. To ſay we are not obliged to the ſame Ends, is no anſwer: For that Law can oblige us to no ends, which is fulfilled alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and which did never oblige but <hi>aut ad obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam, aut poenam propter obedientiae defectum.</hi>

And therefore when I ſay he bore the ſufferings due to us, I mean it <hi>materialiter</hi> only; ſuch ſufferings for kind and weight he bore; but his obligation to bear them was only from his own Sponſion, and not the Law. The Law by conſtituting the Dueneſs of puniſhment to us, was the occaſion of his ſuffering it, but not the obliging cauſe. I add, that [accordingly he hath ſatisfied for all:] For this will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, if the firſt be proved. For he ſatisfied by ſuffering what the Sinner deſerved: And in whoſe ſtead ſoever he ſuffered, for them he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall think it meet to ſtand the longer on this point, becauſe the deciſion of the main Queſtion [Whether Chriſt dyed for all men?] dependeth mainly on it. For the ſtricteſt ſence in which he is ſaid to die for men, is, to die in their ſtead; or to Die for their Sins as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Cauſe, on his own undertaking. Yield this once, and we ſhall much eaſilier agree on the ſecond Part, <hi>Pro quorum beneficio,</hi> or what the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits be which Chriſt hath procured to all. At leaſt, no man will think it unmeet to ſay, that [Chriſt died for all men] if we can prove
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59524:51"/>
that he dyed for the ſins, and in the ſtead of all, and ſatisfied Gods Juſtice for all. And if he dyed for them, it is certain that he ſatisfied for them (as is ſaid) becauſe God doth neither require nor accept the Death of his Righteous Son, but as it is necſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſatisfaction of his juſtice for Sin</p>
               <p>Laſtly, remember that I put the word [all] as contradiſtinct from the Elect: pleading ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally againſt them that would confine Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction only to the Elect: Not that I doubt of Chriſts ſufferings for all, in the utmoſt univerſality, but I think it far ſafer to diſpute it as to all that hear the Goſpel: For God hath plainlier ſhewed us how he dealeth with theſe than the reſt; and it is not fair nor profitable to carry the diſputation into the obſcureſt part, to loſe it rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it: And if any agree with me in this that I prove: [That Chriſt ſatisfied for all that hear the Goſpel.] I will not trouble them with diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it about the reſt, but willingly let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their opinion, (though contrary to mine) as judging it to be to us of far leſſer moment My Arguments ſhall be firſt from the ſcope of Scripture Doctrine; and 2. From ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Texts, which expreſly aſſert Univerſal Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or Chriſts Dying for all: And then I ſhall anſwer the contrary Arguments.</p>
               <p>This Firſt Argument ſhall be <hi>A conditionali remiſſione, &amp; Jure ad Regnum caelorum omnibus per Teſtamentum Chriſti donatis.</hi>

                  <p>If all men have a Conditional Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Juſtification, Adoption and Right to Glory, given to them by the New Teſtament, then Chriſt ſuffered and ſatisfied for all. But the Antecedent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59524:51"/>
is true, therefore ſo is the conſequent. I add by way of Explication, that the Condition is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural impoſſibility, or unreaſonable thing; but Faith in Chriſt, or the accepting of the good that is beſtowed and offered them; which is ſuch a condition that many Learned Divines (who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the <hi>Antinomian</hi> way) ſay it is no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it is equivalent to an abſolute gift; and that it is ſo Naturally neceſſary that in the moſt abſolute gift, acceptance is ſtill ſuppoſed; and that it is all one to ſay [I will give thee this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit] and [I will give it thee if thou wilt take it.] I am not of their mind, as to the caſe in hand; but hereby it may appear how reaſonable Gods condition is, when Learned Men do take his gift to be abſolute or equivalent.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is proved by multitudes of expreſs Texts of Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That whoſoever believeth,</hi> &amp;c. 1 John 5. 10, 11. <hi>He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not God hath made him a Lyar, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the reccord that God gave of his Son.

                  <p>Where note that theſe are in ſeveral reſpects called a Gift, a Promiſe, and an Offer. They are Chriſts Teſtament, and ſo properly his Deed of Gift, and do confer Right to the mentioned Benefits, conditionally firſt, and actual, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute when the condition is performed. And this is the principal conſideration of them, that they are the Premiant act of the New Law, and the Teſtament of Chriſt, and his Deed of Gift. They are an Offer of Chriſt and theſe benefits, when they are applyed by promulgation to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sinners: And this Application or Offer is either by the mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> terms of the Written Deed of Gift in Scripture; or elſe by the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation by Chriſts Miniſters and Officers. In the former ſence, the Gift and the Offer are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially the ſame; but formally it is firſt Gods Conveyance or Deed of Gift, and then afterward in order of Nature, it is his Offer. It is Gods Written Inſtrument conſtituting a Conditional Right to Chriſt and his Benefits; but ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is a proper Conveyance or Deed of Gift. And the conditional Right muſt be conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted before it can be offered: Or elſe the Offer
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59524:52"/>
ſhould be an act without its Object. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Actual Abſolute Right, the offer is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, and ſuppoſeth the thing offered not to be his to whom it is offered; but that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Acceptance muſt firſt be performed. Yea every man that is the owner himſelf who doth ſeriouſly offer a benefit to any man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any meritorious or retaliating condition, but meerly to be accepted, doth <hi>Eodem actu,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey or give Right to that Benefit on the ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Now God doth offer his Son, 1. By his Written Inſtrument or Word, which muſt needs be his own act, and conſequently his Gift as well as offer. 2. By his Meſſengers, whoſe act is morally his own act, in that he hath bid them ſay what they ſay, and commanded them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it to every Creature. It is called a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, not in reſpect to the Conditional Right but the Abſolute, becauſe it promiſeth them that if they will accept Chriſt he ſhall be theirs with his benefits. And it doth not Promiſe that God will perform any other Natural Act for Conveiance of the benefit; but that by that ſame promiſing Inſtrument the Right ſhall be conveyed.</p>
                  <p>2. It is undeniable that this gift, offer or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe [If thou wilt believe thou ſhalt be ſaved] or [Whoſoever will, let him take, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] is, made to unbelievers, as the Subject. We may not ſay to a Believer [If thou wilt believe thou ſhalt be ſaved] Except we ſpeak of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or renewal of Faith. It is properly to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers that God offers or gives Chriſt, ſo be it they will accept his gift. Now if it be to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, then it muſt needs be to all, Elect, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59524:53"/>
Non-elect: For the Promiſe makes no difference, nor the Miniſter knows no difference: God ſaith not [Thou Elect perſon ſhalt be ſaved if thou believe] For then no Man could apply the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor know whether he have warrant to believe, as not knowing whether he be Elect: But he ſaith to any Man [If thou wilt believe thou ſhalt be ſaved.]</p>
                  <p>3. Either Chriſt and his benefits are given conditionally (on condition of believing) to all or to none. To the Non-elect, or not to the Elect. But rhey are given to ſome, even to the Elect: Therefore to all. The Major is evident in the tenour of the promiſe. 1. It is Univerſal, [Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will] [Whoſoeve believeth] It is no where limited to the Elect. 2. If it were limited to the Elect, it were uſeleſs, becauſe none could know before believing whether he be Elect. Indeed the thing promiſed is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Elect, and ſo is the Effectual, Actual, Donation, or Conveyance of Right by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: But that is not (as to the Senſe of the promiſe) as they are Elect but as believers, or performers of the condition: And in this Sence only Believers are Heirs of the promiſe, that is, its effectual conveying act, and ſo to the thing promiſed.</p>
                  <p>But the Great doubt is of the <hi>Minor</hi> with ſome. For they deny that Chriſt is given condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to any Unbeliever Elect or not Elect; but only is decreed for the Elect before time, and given to Believers in time. The Sence is; that there is no conditional promiſe or deed of Gift, but all abſolute. For if it be made only to Men that do believe, their firſt believing cannot
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59524:53"/>
be the condition; and if it be made on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dtion of Firſt believing, it is made to Men that do not yet believe. But the main Scope of the Goſpel proves the Minor, by proving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Gift, or promiſe: As the Texts even now cited, among others. Where note (to put it out of doubt) 1. That the time of Gods en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting this <hi>Law,</hi> or making this Teſtament, Gift or promiſe, was before we were born and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before we believed. 2. that in its nature, it firſt ſpeaks to unbelievers as its Subject. For who will offer a gift to us to be accepted that it may be ours, if we have accepted it already? Nay how can it be accepted before it is offered? And how can we conſent to have Chriſt and ſo be united to him, except he firſt give himſelf to us on condition that we will conſent? 3. Note, that the promiſe is made in moſt proper condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional terms [If thou confeſs with thy Mouth and believe in thy heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.] That whoſoever believeth ſhould not periſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. And alſo note that faith hath here the Definition of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition agreeing to it, <hi>i. e.</hi> It is an Arbitrary act on which the free Donour hath ſuſpended the efficacy of his Teſtament or Deed of Gift. (It is Arbitrary conditions that we have here to ſpeak of, which ſome call Poteſtative: And not caſual, or mixt.) So to ſuſpend the effect of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>hoc poſito efficiet, &amp; donec ponatur non efficiet,</hi> that upon the doing or not doing, the Effect ſhall follow or not follow, and this by the Poſitive ordination of the Donor is the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Condition in Law-ſence. And ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Faith. And what Divine, except <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> doth deny Faith to be the Condition? And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59524:54"/>
if it be ſo, then the Promiſe or Conditional Gift, muſt needs be made to Unbelievers (that it may become effectual when they believe:) For it can be no condition in this proper ſence, if it be paſt already. And therefore it muſt needs be made to all Unbelievers ſeeing Scripture limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it not to any, but ſpeaketh; univerſally. Inded it is a very hard queſtionhow far the promulgation may be ſaid to be Univerſal, and how far not: But that is nothing againſt the Univerſality of the Tenor of the Law or Gift. And the command to the Promulgators is, [<hi>Go into all the World and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next let us prove the conſequence of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> Propoſition; and that thus. <hi>The thing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally given is Pardon purchaſed by Chriſts Blood, ſhed for the Sinner to whom it is Given: Therefore the gift preſuppoſeth the ſhedding of his Blood for that Sinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent hath two branches to be proved. 1. That the Pardon conditionally given to all, is a pardon purchaſed by Chriſts Blood. 2. That it is by Chriſts blood as ſhed for him to whom that pardon is given. For the firſt, there is no Pardon given any other way but by Chriſts blood ſhed, therefore this is from his Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                  <p>1. If there be Remiſſion which is not purchaſed by Chriſts blood ſhed, then there are two diſtinct ways of Remiſſion; one by his blood, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without. But the conſequent is falſe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

If Chriſts Death were not neceſſary to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal pardoning of the Non-elect, (but that God doth it without Chriſts Dying for them; then it was not neceſſary for the conditional pardoning of the Elect, but God might have done it without Chriſts Dying for them: But the Conſequent is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59524:56"/>
Non-elect; but not Actually. I Anſwer. 1. Then Chriſt ſhould Die only to purchaſe Faith: (which is falſe.) For God doth perform no new act to make the conditional Gift become actual, but only the giving of Grace to believe and ſo perform the condition. 2. Then God might have made this new Law and Covenant of Grace, [Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and be pardoned and ſaved] or [<hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will let him take the Water of Life freely</hi>] with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any expiatory Sacrifice or Satisfaction by Chriſt; which, 1. So contradicteth it ſelf, (ſeeing the thing given is a Dead revived Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our with his Benefits; and therefore it cannot be given which is not.) 2. And ſo ſubverteth Chriſtianity it ſelf, that I think I need not ſpend more words on it.</p>
                  <p>Only I add this (which is of conſiderable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) that on the contrary, the great neceſſity and ends of Chriſts Death are in reſpect to God as <hi>Rector per leges,</hi> and not as <hi>Dominus abſolutus,</hi> or <hi>benefactor merè arbitrarius:</hi> God received no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Love, or Goodwill, nor of Wiſdom, or Natural Power by Chriſts Death: But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Reparation of his honour as Legiſlator, and a Moral Power (conſiſting in <hi>Convenient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that the proper uſe of Chriſts Death was to be an Expiatory Sacrifice for Sin, offered to God as the offended Rector. And therefore the New Law or Covenant of Grace which followeth hereupon (giving Chriſt and Pardon to all that will Receive him) muſt needs be the proper effect of Chriſts Death. Whereas Faith is given rather by God as <hi>Dominus Abſolutu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

arbitrarily doing good to his Creature, then as Legiſlator; and is ſaid to be purchaſed by Chriſts Death but in a more remote ſenſe (as ſhall anon be ſhewed.): ſo that to deny this Conditional Gift, Covenant or Promiſe to be the fruit of Chriſts ſatisfaction, is to deny a very great part of the fruit of it; and <hi>tantum non</hi> to make Chriſt to dye in vain.</p>

                  <p>The Conſequent is proved thus. 1. The Pardon offered is either a Pardon purchaſed by Chriſts Satisfaction for them to whom it is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>1. Not without Chriſts Blood as is proved.</p>
                  <p>2. Not by Chriſt's Blood as ſhed for others, as is proved.</p>

Believing is not the Condition of Chriſts Dying for us; but of our participation of the benefits thereby purchaſed: not of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration, but of part of the Application. Chriſt never ſaid, If men (or this man) will Believe, I will dye for them; But, [If thou Believe thou ſhalt be juſtified and ſaved, by him that hath died for thee.] Belief is not preſuppoſed as the Qualification of the ſubject for whom Chriſt muſt dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is required after, and given freely to his choſen, for the further Application of his Death.</p>
                  <p>2. His dying for them that will Believe, was either for certain determinate perſons who ſhould Believe; or elſe without a determination of the perſons. If the latter only, then he died certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for none. If the former then his dying for one man would not procure pardon for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>2. God doth not offer that which he cannot give (for his offer is a gift, on condition of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: and we muſt not dare to charge God with illuſory or ludicrous actions.) But God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give Pardon and Juſtification and Right to Salvation, to any ſinful man for whom Chriſt never ſatisfied: When I ſay [God cannot]
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59524:57"/>
I mean not, that he cannot for want of Power, but becauſe of his Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice, He cannot (being Rector of the World) do that which is ſo Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and ſuch a Monſter in Government, and ſo deſtructive to the ends of his Government: All grant that <hi>quoad potentiam ordinatam</hi> now he cannot: that is, He will not.

For the Queſtion now is, Whether God can give Pardon to a Man for whom Chriſt hath not ſatisfyed? And it is hereby anſwered, that He can if that man Believe? To which I reply, that he cannot, or will not, ſuppoſing that ſuch a Man ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. For it is Chriſts Death that is principally requiſite, and that before Believing, without which all the Believing in the World will do no good. But ſome will ſay, It may not be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that a Non-Redeemed man ſhould Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.

                  <p>3. Contradictions are not to be charged upon God: But to offer pardon to one for whom no

The ſatisfaction muſt be given to God and Accepted by him, before the fruits of that ſatisfaction can be (ſeriouſly and in plain dealing) offered to the Sinner, that by Acceptance they may become his.</p>

offered to pardon any Man without ſatisfaction for his Sins firſt made. So that the contrary makes Chriſt either to be offered to Men not as a Redeemer and Saviour, or as one to redeem and ſave them without dying and ſatisfying for them both which are untrue and unſufferable Conſequents.</p>

Underſtand, that I ſpeak not of a deliverance from all neceſſity of periſhing, even for their Sin againſt the Law: For there may be <hi>neceſſitas Conſequentiae</hi> which is but <hi>neceſſitas Logica vel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſionis à praemiſſis Praeſcientiae &amp; Lecreti Divini,</hi> which may remain; <hi>&amp; neceſſitas ex rejectione reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii,</hi> follow, 2. And I ſpeak not of actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Mens Sins againſt the Law, as if Chriſt had pardoned all. But I ſay, all Men are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that neceſſity of Periſhing, which the Tenour of the firſt Law (as ſtanding alone <hi>ſine lege remediante</hi>) did impoſe. If Men periſh now it ſhall not be meerly, becauſe they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59524:59"/>
obey: Whether you reſpect <hi>Adams</hi> Sin imputed to them, or any Sin of their own conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered meerly as againſt the Law of Works: Whether this liberation be by a proper Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the firſt Law: upon ſatisfaction under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken) (as my Reverend Friend Mr. <hi>G. Lawſon</hi> maintains in ſome Papers to me) or only by a Relaxation and Remiſſion <hi>Per Legem Remediantem, i. e.</hi> an Act of Oblivion or Grace, (as I judg) the matter is of no great Moment, nor fit now to be debated: But that God condemneth no Man in the World, directly or meerly becauſe he did not perfectly obey, and becauſe the Law remains without remedy, which ſaith [obey per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and live] or [he that ever Sinneth ſhall dye] is plain from all that hath been ſaid already, and from many other plain Texts of Scripture, 1. If Chriſt command his Goſpel to be preached to all (every Creature in the World <hi>viz.</hi> Rational) that is, Pardon and Life to be offered them, then they remain not under that Legal neceſſity of perſhing, (<hi>viz,</hi> becauſe all that Sin muſt dye,) But the Antecedent is proved <hi>ergo, &amp;c.</hi> 2. If God have given by his New Teſtament or Law, a conditional pardon to all, then they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that meer Rigorous Law <hi>ſine remedio:</hi> But <hi>&amp;c, ergo, &amp;c.</hi> 3. It is impoſſible that Men ſhould be under the precept of the Goſpel, and the meer remedileſs rigor of the Law of Works both at once: But multitudes of Non-Elect are under the precept of the Goſpel <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is undeniable: It is their duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. The Major is as plain: For the remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs rigor of the Law, (I mean the terror of the Law as ſtanding alone, without the Law of Grace
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59524:59"/>
to remedy its obligation) ſaith, <hi>Curſed is he that doth not all things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Curſed is he that once Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:</hi> The Goſpel ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is he that believeth though he hath Sinned a thouſand times: Or, he that believeth though a Sinner, ſhall not dye, nor come into Condemnation:</hi> And it commandeth Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt as a Saviour, and ſo to believe that they may not periſh. 4. Gods merciful dealing with the very Pagans ſhews that they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meer rigor of the Law of Works: 1. The mercies themſelves, 2. The uſe and end of them ſhews this, 1. It is not denied (by any that fear to deny God the acknowledgment of his mercies) but that wicked Men even Pagans, have many and great mercies from God. And its undeniable that all thoſe mercies are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the rigorous execution of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the firſt Law: And therefore that Law is not rigoronſly executed on them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is relaxed to them. And God will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxe or diſpenſe with his Law, but upon a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſideration, by which the ends of the Law may be attained. 2. And the end and uſe of theſe mercies (<hi>viz.</hi> the uſe that God requires them to make of them) is to lead Men to repentance, and to return to God from whom they are faln. And ſuch mercies were never given according to the Covenant of Works, but only according to the Covenant of Grace, which is founded in Chriſts Blood. I do but touch on this becauſe I think anon to ſpeak of it more largely. 5. All Gods deſcriptions of Judgment in Scripture ſhew that no Men are under the meer Law of Works, as remedileſs. Men are not then examined meerly whether ever they Sinned, nor accuſed meerly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59524:60"/>
as Sinners: But the Queſtion will be of that Sin in <hi>Specie</hi> which conſiſteth in refuſing to repent or believe, or abuſing that mercy which ſhould have led them to repentance. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. It is for not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Talents (which is not the legal reaſon, as the Law of Works is alone) or for not loving and cheriſhing Chriſt Jeſus in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: It is for not knowing God, nor obeying the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is true that all their Sins alſo againſt the Law ſhall cauſe their condemnation; for they were never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: But that is conſequentially becauſe they abuſed the Grace that ſhould have recovered them; and ſo the Wrath of God abideth on them, that would not yield to his means for removing it.

And inded it hath divers Acts in each faculty: For as it is more then one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Truth or exunciation which is the object of Aſſent, and therefore muſt have divers Acts of Aſſent; ſo it is in more then one ſhape and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable reſpect that the Goodneſs of the object is preſented to the Will, and therefore it muſt there have ſeveral Acts, as conſent, affiance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now let us firſt enquire after the Acts of the underſtanding; where I will meddle with none but what is ordinarily by Divines aſſerted to be juſtifying or prerequiſite thereto. And 1. I will let that paſs which Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> makes the firſt Act, <hi>viz.</hi> To believe Gods word to be true: For if it be not known what that word is here is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial object of Faith; but the formal object
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59524:61"/>
alone. 2. I will paſs over the duty of repenting, which Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſaith is next required (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the uſual Doctrine) though it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that repentance it ſelf as a means to remiſſion, cannot be required but on ſuppoſition of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for Sin. The common anſwer to the <hi>Arminians</hi> [<hi>Quicquid tenemur credere verum eſt,</hi> &amp;c.] Is, We are all bound to believe that Chriſt died for all that will believe in him. See what <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſaith againſt this Anſwer in <hi>Piſcator Vindic. de promiſs. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. <hi>Page</hi> 475. (<hi>Vol. Parv.</hi>) 1. Men are not ſuppoſed firſt to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and then Chriſt to dye for them; nor hath died at random without determining <hi>in quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Loco,</hi> in whoſe ſtead, and left it to their Faith to determine afterwards. He hath not ſaid, either, if thou believe I will die for thee? Or if thou believe, that Death which I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone ſhall be <hi>tui loco,</hi> in thy ſtead, or for thy Sins, Mans Sin being the <hi>loco cauſae meritoriae</hi> of Chriſts ſufferings, it muſt be determined whoſe Sins he ſhould ſuffer for before he ſuffer: For the meritorious cauſe is before the effect. And therefore Chriſt died for them, before they are believers; for elſe how did he procure them grace to believe. Not only <hi>Davenant</hi> hath well cleared this (in his diſſert <hi>de redempt</hi>) but <hi>Twiſs</hi> (<hi>ubi ſuper P.</hi> 474.) could ſay, <hi>Neque enim hujus propoſitionis veritas</hi> [<hi>Chriſtus eſt Redemptor Noſter</hi>] <hi>eſt veritas conſequens fidem noſtram: Nec ejus falſitas eſt falſitas conſequens infidelitatem noſtram ſed antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: Antecedens inquam natura in genere cauſae mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis, nempe meritoriae; non autem in genere cauſae Phyſicae: Quod eo tantum addo, quoniam quod eſt prius natura in genere cauſae Phyſicae, impoſſibile eſt ut
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59524:61"/>
ſit poſterius tempore, eo quo prius eſt natura: At quod eſt prius natura in genere cauſae moralis &amp; meritoriae, preſertim ex libera Dei conſtitutione proficiſcens, poteſt eſſe poſterius tempore etiam eo quod eſt prius naturâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. There muſt therefore be ſome former conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of thoſe for whom Chriſt died, Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent (<hi>Moraliter</hi>) to his Death: And that can be nothing, but for Sinners as ſuch: It is therefore for all Sinners, or only for ſome. And the Doctrine of thoſe that contradict me, is, that it was not indeterminately [for all that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve] but determinately [to theſe particular Elect Perſons, [that they may believe] for whom Chriſt ſatisfied. Now then according to this Doctrine, all Men where the Goſpel is preached are bound to believe that Chriſt ſatisfied for the Elect to procure them Faith and conſequently juſtification, that by ſo believing themſelves may be juſtified: But, if they ſhould ſo believe, this Faith would not juſtifie them for whom Chriſt Died not? ſo that here is a juſtifying Faith Commanded, without a juſtifying object; as I ſhall fullier ſhew anon. 2. And whereas Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſaith, It is only the penitent that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to believe on Chriſt for juſtification, I Anſwer 1. Then the Impenitent ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for not believing in Chriſt for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which is falſe) for the omiſſion is not ſo much as a Sin, much leſs damning, if faith be not commanded them. 2. It is nevertheleſs their duty, becauſe other duties (as ſuppoſe repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) are firſt to be performed. God may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute many duties at once, though they are not to be performed at once but in order. 3. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a change of the Mind from Sin to God
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59524:62"/>
and duty. To repent or to turn from unbelief, is the ſame thing with Faith. 4. If this repentance which he ſaith goes before Faith be ſincere and ſaving, then ſure it is not in an unbeliever and unjuſtified Man; if not; how comes it to give them a peculiar Right, and occaſion their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar duty, of reſting on Chriſt. 5. I ſhall ſhew anon that even repentance can be no duty (tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pardon) if Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for them.</p>
                  <p>3. Others with great confidence ſay, that this is it that all are to believe [that there is no other name under Heaven whereby Men muſt be ſaved but only by the name of Chriſt made known in the Goſpel] and Men periſh for not believing the neceſſity of a Redeemer and that Jeſus is the Redeemer [Or more fully] 1. Men are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the Goſpel to be the word of God to contain his Will, and that Jeſus Chriſt therein revealed is the Wiſdom and power of God to Salvation. 2. That there is an inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble connexion between Faith and Salvation, by Gods appointment; Goſpel faith carrying a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner quite out of himſelf and from off his own Righteouſneſs. 3. That there be a particular conviction by the Spirit of the neceſſity of a Redeemer to their Souls in particular, whereby they become weary, heavy laden and burdened. 4. A ſerious full recumbency, and rolling of the Soul upon Chriſt in the promiſe of the Goſpel as an al-ſufficient Saviour, able to deliver and ſave to the utmoſt them that come to God by him; ready, able and willing through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of his Blood, and ſufficiency of his Ranſome to ſave every Soul, that ſhall freely give
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59524:62"/>
up themſelves to him for that end, amongſt whom he is reſolved to be] ſo Mr. <hi>Owen Page.</hi> 304. 305.</p>
                  <p>Sure it is, many Acts that are expreſſed in all theſe words. But 1. As I have ſaid, every Man that hears the Goſpel is obliged to all theſe; though to be performed in order, and not all at once. 2. A <hi>Judas</hi> may believe the neceſſity of a Redeemer. 3. And that Jeſus is the Redeemer. 4. That there is no other, is an excluſion, which is neceſſary to the Faith which juſtifieth; but will not juſtify it ſelf. 5. As to that of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I have anſwered before. 6. The Devils believe that Chriſt is the Wiſdom and Power of God to Salvation. No Man can believe that Chriſt hath Power to ſave him, that firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not that he hath ſatisfied for him. 7. The Devils may believe truly that there is an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable connexion between Faith and Salvation. But this is too general a Speech. It muſt be known in what reſpect and to what uſe Faith is ſo connexed to Salvation: And what Faith it is. No Faith is by God annexed to Salvation, but that which ſuppoſeth Chriſt to have ſatisfied for the believer. 8. <hi>Judas</hi> was convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Redeemer, and was weary and heavy laden. If it be ſpecial godly ſorrow and hatred of Sin, that is meant, then ſuch are juſtified al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and therefore were before obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to juſtification. 9. The recumbency men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is an Act of the Will of which we ſhall ſpeak anon. 10. The promiſe is made to none that Chriſt died not for: For it is a promiſe of the benefits of his Death. 11. Chriſt is a ſufficient Saviour, able and willing to ſave only thoſe that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59524:63"/>
he died for. Suppoſing that he ſatisfied not for any Man, he is not ſufficient or willing to ſave that Man though he ſhould believe. How can it be ſaid that by the ſufficiency of his Ranſome he is able to ſave them, for whom it is no Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? Indeed the ſufficiency of Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is one principal object of that part of Faith which conſiſteth in Aſſent. But I ſhall ſhew anon, that if any Man be bound to believe Chriſts ſatisfaction ſufficient to juſtifie him for whom it was never paid, he is bound to believe an untruth.</p>
                  <p>2. But the main anſwer given by Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> and others, is, that the object of juſtifying Faith is not true, but good. It is Chriſt, whom they are bound to reſt upon for Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The truth is here are ſeveral Acts of the will requiſite. The firſt is conſent. Chriſt is offered to all where the Goſpel is publiſhed, and it is their duty to conſent to the Offer. Now if they ſhould conſent it would be an Act meerly frivolous, ſuppoſing Chriſt had not ſatisfied for them. For it is certain that he conſents not to be the Head and Saviour of any ſuch. And Mans conſent without Chriſts, would do no good. They are commanded therefore (according to this Doctrine) to do that which if it were done would do no good.</p>
                  <p>2. The next Act is that Affiance, which ſome make the only juſtifying Act. Now according to this Doctrine this would be to many a vain Act: To reſt upon Chriſt to ſave Men by his Blood which was never ſhed for them, is to reſt on an inſufficient Ground, which would deceive them. But (according to this Doctrine) Men
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59524:63"/>
are bound to reſt on Chriſt to ſave them by his Blood which was never ſhed for them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to this Doctrine. Men are bound to reſt on an inſufficient Ground, which would deceive them.</p>
                  <p>Let none ſay, God knows they will not reſt on Chriſt: For we are ſpeaking now but of the Duty. God will never make it any Mans duty to reſt for Salvation on that Blood that was never ſhed for him; or that ſatisfaction which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made for him.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this reacheth but to thoſe that have heard the Goſpel, the next argument ſhall reach further.</p>

                  <p>If Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for all, then God hath appointed Men to uſe thoſe means for their recovery and Salvation, which would do nothing to recover and ſave them if they were uſed. But God hath not appointed Men to uſe ſuch vain and deluſory means. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> Here I ſuppoſe that God hath appointed to all the World ſome means which they are to uſe for their recovery. I avoid the Remonſtrants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream: I ſay not that all have ſufficient means or Grace to believe, or to Salvation. And I avoid that fouler extream, which ſaith that Heathens are under the meer Law of works as it ſtands without remedy, and have no Means appointed them, or helps afforded them towards their recovery. I ſhall after prove that they have much mercy from Chriſts Blood: But now I am to prove that God hath not ſo left them remedileſs, but that he hath appointed to all Men ſome means of their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59524:64"/>
recovery. And 1. It is apparent they have much of the Light and Law of Nature: They have the Book of the Creatures wherein they may read much of God. 2. They have teaching pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, Mercies and Judgments. By theſe they may know that there is a God, and that he is the governor of the World, true, Juſt, Merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That we owe him perfect obedience; that Sin deſerves his wrath. By experience they may eaſily know that they are Sinners, and ſo liable to miſery: By Gods Judgments, Sickneſs, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they may know that God will puniſh: That the Soul is immortal, and puniſhments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are ſpecially in the Life to come, moſt <hi>Pagans</hi> do acknowledg. Gods abundant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to them may acquaint them that he deals not with them in rigorous ſeverity, and on terms of meer juſtice, but in mercy: And his not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Judgments on them according to deſert, but ſhewing ſo much mercy to them, is ſome kind of pardoning them. Hence they may ſee that ſome way God hath for ſhewing mercy to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving, and for pardoning Sinners, without any wrong to the Honour of his Juſtice, and Holineſs, or to the ends of his Government. And hence they may ſee that they are not certainly help leſs, and remedileſs nor their condition deſperate Though they diſcover not the meritorious cauſe they may diſcern Gods mercy, the principal Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient moving cauſe. Natural ſelf-love bindeth Men in miſery to ſeek out after remedy, and to diſcover what it is, and how they may attain it. All this the Heathens have manifeſted to us unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably, in that all ages and Countries of them have confeſſed Gods being and Soveraignty, the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59524:64"/>
Duty of our obeying him, and that they were Sinners and deſerved his Wrath, in this Life and that to come; eſpecially for greater Sins; and that their condition was not hopeleſs, but Gods mercy had a way to help them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they plyed him with their Prayers and Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If thoſe that never heard of Chriſt are bound to take their caſe for deſperate, then they are bound to believe an untruth; (for Chriſt may be diſcovered to them, and they ſaved.) But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. If they are bound to judge their caſe remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, then they are bound to contradict the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods merciful dealing with them; (which are an actual remedy to part of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and may give them hope of more from the ſame cauſe, if they will ſeek it.) But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c,</p>
                  <p>3. If they are bound to judge their caſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs, or not to judge that there is ſome remedy; then they ſhould not be bound to uſe any means, (Praying, Repenting. ſending abroad to enquire after the Remedy in more knowing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for the attaining Remedy. But the conſequent is falſe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If a Star appearing brought the wiſe men ſo far to ſeek Chriſt, and if men, will travail all over the World for Riches by way of Merchandize; How diligently ſhould men that find themſelves miſerable, enquire far and near for a remedy? And if it were not their duty to uſe means for recovery, then it is not their Sin that they do not uſe them. But he that dare tell them ſo,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59524:65"/>
let him, for I dare not; but the contrary I dare tell them.</p>
                  <p>4. If all ſuch men are not bound to judge their caſe remediable, and cureable, but hopeleſs; then God ſhould loſe all that common honour and ſervice that he hath from them, and the World would be as Hell, full of nothing but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God, and blaſpheming him, and ſinning to the utmoſt without any ſelf-reſtraint. For he that hath no hope, will uſe no means, nor forbear any evil, but hate God as his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>5. The <hi>Ninevites</hi> diſcerned a remedy and ſome hope, and Repentance and Humiliation was Gods means, by which they were actually reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, I am ſure, from under ſome of Gods wrath, which elſe would have broke out on them; whether from eternal wrath, I know not; but its moſt probable; <hi>For they believed God,</hi> Jonah 3. 5. <hi>and Repented,</hi> Mat. 12. 41. Luke 11. 32. Yet there is no intimation that <hi>Jonah</hi> Preached Chriſt to them, or that they ever heard of him. Men therefore that hear not of Chriſt are bound to uſe means for remedy. And indeed the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt is of greater neceſſity to mans Salvation, than our knowledge of Chriſt, or Faith in him: God can ſave them that never knew Chriſt, if he will, (witneſs the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; and elſe there were but few ſaved before Chriſts coming) but morally we may ſay, he cannot ſave them without Chriſts ſatisfaction for their Sin.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. It is the duty of all <hi>Pagans To ſeek the Lord, if happly they might feel after him and find him.</hi> And doubtleſs this is to ſeek the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59524:65"/>
of his favour, and not to ſeek it in deſpair, as the Devils.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 17. Gods giving rain and fruitful ſeaſons, and filling mens hearts with food and gladneſs, and doing them good, is his witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And ſure it witneſſeth his mercy to them, and conſequently their duty.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. The Holy Ghoſt expreſly telleth us that men ſhould know that the forbearance, long-ſuffering and goodneſs of God leadeth to Repentance; that is, is a help thereto, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth it to be their duty to Repent: And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this Repentance is not a helliſh deſpairing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; (for Judgments are fitter to move to that than Mercy,) but a Repentance which is to be uſed as a means to recovery.</p>
                  <p>9. It is the deſcription of wicked men, that they ſeek not after God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 2 God looks to ſee if there be any that ſeeks him.</p>
                  <p>10. Many Texts in the Prophets ſhew it to be all mens duty to ſeek the Lord, in order to their finding mercy; (and to deny it, is to turn out the remnants of obedience, or all ſeeds of Religion from the World:) And that God calls them all to Repentance, and to that end that they may not Die, but eſcape his wrath and be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And that he hath ſworn <hi>That he hath no pleaſure in the Death of him that Dieth, but rather that he Repent and Live.</hi> So that I think it is clear that God appointed even to thoſe that hear not the Goſpel, certain means toward their Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Much more evident is it of all thoſe where the Goſpel is preached.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59524:66"/>I ſay not that he commandeth all the former, or any directly to believe in Chriſt; but it muſt be underſtood, that all men are many degrees diſtant from Chriſt, before he draweth them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to himſelf. Now the Pagans are more degrees from him than profeſſed Chriſtians (moſtly:) It is not Chriſts way to bring men to himſelf <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> but by thoſe Degrees of Recovery, which are the particular cure of their degrees of diſtance. One wicked man knows of Chriſt and doth half entertain him, but ſticks at ſome pleaſing Sin. Another knows not that he is miſerable by ſin, nor ever conſidered how to be recovered, nor ever prayed God to ſhew him a way to eſcape his wrath, nor ever heard of Chriſt: This latter muſt receive much of Chriſts mercy before he be brought ſo near to Chriſt as the former. Chriſt loved one wicked man as not being far from the Kingdom of God; and ſome with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> are almoſt perſwaded to be Chriſtians. Thoſe that be not come ſo far muſt (ordinarily) by degrees be brought to this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can go further. If you be in a higher room, and call your Servants to you, you intend they ſhall come up the ſtairs ſtep by ſtep; and if one be two ſtories diſtant from you, and another but one, the former muſt go up all the firſt ſtairs before he come as near you as the latter is. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> that believed not, are further off, and more ſtrangers to God than the common <hi>Jews</hi> were. Now God hath not given them that hear not of Chriſt ſufficient means or help to Believe (nor hath he given any believer ſufficient Grace for Salvation, till he ſaveth him.) But he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth ſome means to all men in the World
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59524:66"/>
which they are to uſe, to bring them nearer Chriſt and Faith, and to remove impediments: As to conſider of what the Book of Nature and daily providences teach them of God: To ſtudy him in his mercies and Judgments. To ſtudy their own hearts till they find their Sin and miſery: To uſe all their intereſt and utmoſt endeavours to enquire what remedy God hath revealed to the World: To continue in Prayer, faſting and Alms deeds as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, and to break off their Sins by repentance. Theſe are their duties: And for not doing theſe, in the improvement of their Talents, they ſhall be condemned by Chriſt the Redeemer at the Bar of grace, (as oppoſed to that of Juſtice according to the ſole Law of works.) And (though that belong not to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie) I doubt not but they have ſufficient help which is not effectual to the doing of more in theſe means then they do; and ſo they will be left unexcuſable at Judgment. Even as the Ignorant and ungodly where the Goſpel is preached, have ſufficient power (which is not effectual through their own wilfulneſs) to hear the word, to come into better company and to uſe more means to get Faith then they do, though they have not power or grace ſufficient to believe. And the duty of hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Goes in order before that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
                  <p>All this being thus evinced (That God hath preſcribed to all Men, means of recovery) I come to the Argument. And for the <hi>Minor</hi> I think I need not ſtand to prove it (That God hath not appointed Men deluſory means, which if uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to his appointmennt would not do any thing towards the attainment of the end)
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59524:67"/>
ſo apparently is ſuch a conceit injurious to the Wiſdom, goodneſs and faithfulneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>And for the Major it ſeems to me as plain, (That no means can do any thing to the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Salvation of that Man, for whom Chriſt made not ſatisfaction by his Death) Suppoſing this means were uſed never ſo rightly.) For 1. The uſe of all means is but to apply or convey the benefits of Chriſts Satisfaction. Therefore where Chriſt hath made no ſatisfaction for a Man, there it is impossible that any means ſhould give him to participate of the benefits of his ſatisfaction: At leaſt of Pardon and Salvation. 2. Elſe you make a Saviour of the means, or make them more neceſſary then Chriſts Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: For if by means that Man may be ſaved that Chriſt dyed not for, then he is ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſts Death. And if God might do ſo by all the Non Elect, why not by all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay, It is certain that they will not uſe the means rightly and therefore will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; I anſwer 1. This ſhall be anon further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered 2. That is nothing to the matter. The queſtion is, Why theſe Men are not ſaved? Whether it be not for want of a right uſe of the means? But according to the Doctrin oppoſed, it is not: For no means could ſave them, if they were never ſo well uſed. 1. No Prayer can be heard if ſatisfaction be not firſt made for the Sins of the Petitioner. 2. Repentance can be no means, but only a Concomitant of deſperation if ſatisfaction for Sin go not before it. 3. Faith is but reſting for Salvation on one that never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the Perſon, and ſo cannot ſave him, if ſatisfaction for that Perſon go not before it.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59524:67"/>
4. Hope would be wholly ungrounded, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful like the hopes of the wicked, if there were no ſatisfaction. 5. Love to Chriſt as our Redeemer, and gratitude for ſatisfaction, would be a miſtaken Act, as being for a mercy never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. 6. Nay ſhould the Non-redeemed live as holily as any Saint on Earth, yea as innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an Angel, it would not ſave him; becauſe of the guilt which he hath already contracted. So that by this Doctrin all the means which God hath appointed moſt Men for their pardon and Salvation, would be deluſory and vain if never ſo well performed: Which is not true, nor tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

                  <p>There is nothing here requires any proof but the conſequence of the Major propoſition: And that is proved thus. God would not nor could give pardon and Life to any Man for whom Chriſt hath not ſatisfied. Therefore the conſequence is good. 1. Elſe God ſhould give pardon and Life without a Redeemer: Which he will not. 2. And he ſhould do that which in the Judgment of moſt Divines he cannot do: (Not through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, but becauſe of the inconvenience and unfitneſs of the thing:) For though he can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59524:68"/>
the nature of the Creatures, and ſo make that to be fit which now is unfit, yet <hi>stante rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ</hi> he cannot make thoſe things fit, which <hi>ex natura rei</hi> are unfit: Nor can God do that which is unfit. And if it had not been unfit for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Rector of the World to pardon Mans Sin without ſatisfaction, God would not ſo dearly have ſatisfied his own juſtice. Yea all ſay, that <hi>quoad potentiam ordinatam,</hi> God would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sin without ſatisfaction, whatſoever he might have done <hi>quoad potentiam abſolutam.</hi> Now how groſs is it, for any Man to imagine, that God ſhould make ſo ſolemn a promiſe, in form of a Law of Grace, that he will pardon and ſave Men if they will believe, when if they could and ſhould believe, he neither would nor could pardon or ſave them, for want of ſatisfaction to his Juſtice! Yea that he ſhould require his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſo importunately, and unweariedly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat Men in his name to believe and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him, and to tell them from him Man by Man [If thou wilt believe thou ſhalt be ſaved] When yet if he did believe he ſhould not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But if he ſhould believe then he is one that Chriſt ſatisfied for; and therefore ſhould be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Perſons are determined of long ago for whom Chriſt ſatisfied. Either he hath ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for me or he hath not, before my Faith. If he have not, then my Faith will not cauſe him to ſatisfie for me, either by ſuffering again, or
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59524:68"/>
by making that ſatisfaction to have been paid for me, which was not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it is a thing that never will be, for one to believe for whom Chriſt did not ſatisfie: And therefore it is a thing not to be ſuppoſed.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Things may and muſt be ſuppoſed in diſpute that never will be. That the Elect ſhould have the deſert of their Sin, or be unredeemed, or be forſaken of God, or deprived of any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which God will give them, are all things that never will be: And yet a Chriſtian may argue on ſuppoſition they had been or ſhould be, to raiſe his thankfulneſs: What if God ſhould have denied me his Grace? Or his Redemption? Or let me periſh in my Sin, and State of nature? What a Caſe would my Sin have brought me under.</p>
                  <p>2. If it be a thing not to be ſuppoſed in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that a Man ſhould believe for whom Chriſt ſatisfied not, then it is becauſe it implieth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I ſhall take it as a groundleſs fancy till it be proved, that Chriſt purchaſed Faith to be eventually certainly given to all thoſe for whom he ſatisfied. 2. If he had, this argument
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59524:69"/>
is not from ſatisfaction as ſuch, but as it is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of Faith. 3. ſtill it is no contradiction, becauſe it implyeth no contradiction for a man to believe without that Grace which Chriſt hath purchaſed; though it be a thing that will never be done. 4. They that will ſtill affirm the contrary do the more deſtroy their own Cauſe. For they then aſſert, that all Gods commands by his Laws and Miniſters to the unredeemed, (as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them) for believing in Chriſt, do require meer impoſſibilities, and ſuch contradictions as are not to be ſo much as ſuppoſed in diſpute, which I think few ſober men will grant; but rather avoid that opinion that is the ground of ſuch an aſſertion. 5. And (which is more) the ſame abſurdity will follow, as to all other means whatſoever, (as well as Faith) which God hath preſcribed to ſuch men for pardon and ſalvation; (as they are means) and ſo bring this reproach on the whole New Law, as made to all ſuch Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But the ſame may be ſaid against Gods Foreknowledge or Decree. For if God Fore-know or Decree that men ſhall certainly periſh, then it may as well be ſaid, that though they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, God neither would nor could ſave them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As to the Power of God, it is not ſtraitened by his Decree.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a vicious Argument. There's more in the concluſion than in the premiſes. No more will follow but this, [therefore he will not believe and be ſaved whom God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] not [it is impoſſible] for God never foreknew or decreed that it ſhould be impoſſible for him to believe and be ſaved, but only that he <hi>would not</hi> eventually believe and be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>2. When I ſpeak (before in the Argument) of Gods will, it is not of his will of Decree, but of his will as he is in the relation of <hi>Rector per Leges</hi> and ſo giveth that Salvation as executor of his Laws and Sentence, which by his Laws he firſt gave Right to. God as Rector and Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor neither will nor can give Salvation to any that Chriſt dyed not for, if they ſhould believe: But God as Legiſlator or Rector would give ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all that Chriſt Dyed for if they believe, though it were ſuppoſed that he had foreknown or decreed that ſuch men would not believe.

                     </gap> cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mean not the meritorious cauſe, for that no doubt muſt be ſome ſin of Man:) And I ſuppoſe that Unbelievers are not condemned according to the firſt Law of works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſtanding without Remedy, that is, not meerly becauſe they did not perfectly obey; but at the Redeemers bar, becauſe they believed not, and would not have Chriſt to Reign over them, or becauſe they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved not their Talents of Grace, (that is, of mercy given contrary to deſert) And of thoſe that hear the Goſpel, this is undenyable; (and I think it is certainly true of all others.) So that it is periſhing in reference to a Goſpel Judgment at the Mediators Bar that we mean; and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a comparative ſence: And by [cauſe] I mean, the Reaſon of their periſhing to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: So that if you ask, ſeeing all are equally condemned by the Law of works, and mercy hath found out a Remedy, what is the reaſon that this man is condemned at the Redeemers Bar, when that is acquit? Or that this Man (<hi>Judas</hi>) is not delivered and ſaved as well as that (<hi>Peter?</hi>) Is it becauſe Chriſt Dyed only for one, or that one only believed and the other refuſed Chriſt? Here according to the Doctrine which denyeth Univerſal Satisfaction, it muſt be ſaid that either the only or the principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that men periſh when others are ſaved, is for want of an expiatory ſacrifice, or ſatisfaction for their Sin; <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe they had no Redeemer when others had, or no Chriſt to Die for them.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59524:71"/>
But this is contrary to the Scripture. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is evident, that it is more principally, the want of a Saviour or ſatisfaction then the want of Faith that is the reaſon of their periſhing, if Chriſt ſatisfied not for them. 1. Becauſe ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is prerequiſite to the efficacy or uſefulneſs of Faith: <hi>Sed non è contra.</hi> 2. Satisfaction hath the greateſt work to do, and is the greateſt cauſe: And faith hath a far and a lower work; and is a leſſer cauſe, or indeed no cauſe at all, but a meer condition. 3. God could not fitly ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners without ſatisfaction: But he could, if he had pleaſed, have ſaved them for that ſatisfaction, without a perſonal Faith as he doth Infants, and as he ſaved the Church before Chriſts Incarnation, without that Faith which now juſtifieth. <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that this Jeſus is the Chriſt; and without believing in any Articles of our Creed. If two Men be mortally ſick, and one be healed, and the other not, becauſe one had a coſtly Cordial, and the other had none prepared for him, but only a nonimal offer without the thing; though this Man refuſe that nominal or feigned offer, yet the chief cauſe why he was not healed was the want of the medicament, rather then his refuſal.</p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Minor,</hi> its plain through the whole New Teſtament that the cauſe of Mens periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not for want of an expiatory Sacrifice, but for want of Faith to receive the Redeemer and his benefits, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. <hi>How oft would I have gathered thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ye would not,</hi> Iſa. 5. 4. <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 24. 4. 5. <hi>Tell them which are bidden, behold I have prepared my dinner.

                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:59524:72"/>The conſequence of the Major propoſition is acknowledged by our late moſt rigid <hi>Anti-Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who on that reaſon do deny the <hi>Minor.</hi> For our new Divines have utterly forſaken the old common opinion, and in ſtead of ſaying that [Chriſt died for all Men <hi>ſufficienter</hi>] They will not ſo much as ſay that [His Death was <hi>ſufficiens pretium pro omnibus</hi>] But only that [It is ſufficient to have been a price for all.] For all our former Divines (and the moſt of theſe times; ſo far as I can diſcern) who acknowledg that Chriſt died for all Men <hi>quoad ſufficientiam pretii,</hi> and for the Elect <hi>quoad efficaciam;</hi> they ſay the ſame, and as much as I; and therefore I need not ſay much more to them. For Chriſt cannot dye for Men <hi>ſufficienter</hi> and yet not die for them at all, or not ſatisfie for them. I may well take up with this one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If Chriſts Death be a <hi>ſufficient price</hi> for all, then it is a <hi>Price</hi> for all: But Chriſts Death is (by their confeſſion) a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Price for all: Therefore it is a Price for all. Here underſtand that it is firſt in order of nature a Sacrifice expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or a ſatisfaction, before it is meritorious of further benefits, or is a Price for them. Had it not been to ſatisfie Juſtice, God would have been ſo far from taking his Sons Death for meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that he would have been utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed in it: For he delighteth not in the Death of him that dieth; how much leſs of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and leſt of all of his only Son.</p>
                  <p>Note here alſo in what ſence we ſay, Chriſts Death is ſufficient, and in what ſence it is called effectual: There is a double effect of Chriſts Death, and ſo a double efficacy, and ſo a double ſufficiency to thoſe effects. The firſt effect is to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59524:72"/>
be a ſatisfaction to the offended Juſtice of God, and a demonſtration of his legal Juſtice. The ſufficiency to this effect was in the dignity of the Perſon, and greatneſs of the ſuffering, ſuppoſing Gods voluntary Acceptation of it, inſtead of the Sinners own ſuffering. The efficacy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed the ſuffering: Yea it went long before it, upon the undertaking and the acceptation as in Moral Cauſes it is not unuſual. The 2d. ſort of effects, are more remote, even the actual good of the Sinner: Of theſe ſome are general and common, (as the freeing of all Men from that neceſſity of periſhing, which lay on them by the Curſe of the firſt Law as it ſtood without remedy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And ſo Chriſts Death is ſufficient for all and effectual too. Some fruits of his Death are ſpecial and follow the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the condition impoſed on us (Faith and Repentance) ſuch are Pardon, Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification, Glorification. Theſe being the main effects of Chriſts Death which Scripture moſt frequently mentioneth, and to which the reſt are but general preparatives, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Divines uſe to call theſe peculiarly [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption] and [the Effects of Chriſt Death] and they ſay his Death is effectual, when theſe effects are produced. And ſo I conclude that as to the firſt effect of ſatisfaction to God, Chriſts Death is both ſufficient and effectual for all: Or elſe he could not be ſaid to die for all, <hi>quoad ſufficienciam pretii.</hi> For it is impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould intend it as a Price, and make it a ſufficient Price, and yet that God ſhould not accept it as ſuch: Seeing Chriſt is God; and the will of the Father and the Son is one. And the like I
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59524:73"/>
ſay of the General Common benefits. And as for the great particular ſpecial benefits of Pardon and Sanctification and Glory. I ſay Chriſts Death is ſufficient for all; but effectual only for the Elect. And this muſt needs be the meaning of our forementioned Divines. For the ſufficiency to Juſtification and Salvation, containeth the efficacy and effect in point of ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But our new more rigid Divines will make me more work: And therefore to them I muſt forme my Argument otherwiſe, or elſe they will ſay, I beg the queſtion: With them therefore I argue thus.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſts Death be ſufficient for all, then Chriſt ſatisfied for all: But Chriſts Death is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe terms they uſe to acknowledg the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> propoſition themſelves. And as to the ſeveral effects, 1. They frequently ſay that Chriſts Death is ſufficient for the Pardon and Salvation of all Men in the World, if they will believe. Where the Words [if they will believe] muſt needs be referred to the effect [Pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation] and not to [ſufficient:] For Mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief addeth not to the ſufficiency of Chriſts Death. Nor will Faith make it ſufficient, if it were not ſo before. The ſufficiency goes before Faith: But that which is ſufficient to juſtifie men, ſhall not actually do it till Men believe 2. They ſay, that Chriſts Death is ſufficient <hi>ut eſſet pretium pro om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> to have been a Price for all. But then they ſay, that it is not <hi>ſufficiens pretium</hi> a ſufficient price for all, becauſe no price for all. Now I ſhall prove that both their conceſſions do warrant my conſequence; and, 1. That If Chriſts Death be ſufficient for the Pardon of all, if they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59524:73"/>
then he hath ſatisfied for all; and it was all Mens Sins that procured his puniſhment, and which he bore on the Croſs: Or that Chriſts Death is inſufficient to the Pardon of any one for whom he hath not ſatisfied. 1. That which hath not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied offended Majeſty, is not ſufficient to the pardon of Mans Sin though he ſhould believe. But Chriſts Death (As theſe Men ſay) Hath not ſatisfied the offended Majeſtie: Therefore it is not ſufficient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that denieth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence muſt hold, that Sin may be pardoned without Chriſts ſatisfaction 2. That which leaveth the great impediment of Mens Remiſſion unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and not removeable by Faith, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the Pardon of Men, though they ſhould believe. But Chriſts Death, if it be not ſuffered for Men, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>The impediment I mean, is in a word all that which did neceſſitate or require ſatisfaction: That Faith, cannot ſatisfie God inſtead of Chriſts Death, is undeniable: Nor yet can it make that ſatisfaction or be mine that was never made for me. There is neither in the nature of Faith, nor in the Office which God hath appointed it, any ſufficiency to be inſtead of a Redeemer, or ſatisfaction. And therefore it is not merely nor chiefly for want of faith that ſuch would periſh, but through the inſufficiency of Chriſts Death. If they ſhall ſtill ſay, that it is not to be ſuppoſed that the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redeemed ſhould believe: I Anſwer: Do not they ſuppoſe it themſelves when they ſay that,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59524:74"/>
the Death of Chriſt is ſufficient for the Pardon and Salvation of all Men, if they would believe.</p>
                  <p>3. That which leaveth the ſtrongeſt Faith (ſuppoſing it were) both without ground, and uſe or profit. is not ſufficient to remiſſion or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, though Men ſhould believe: But ſo doth Chriſts Death, if it be not ſuffered for Men, and have not ſatisfied for them: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> 1. If all the Faith in Chriſt that is in all Men in the World were confined to one Man, it would not do the leaſt good to his Juſtification or Salvation, if Chriſt have not ſatisfied for him as is already proved. 2. Nay indeed ſuch a Faith would be but an ungrounded fancy or preſumption. To expect pardon from a ſatisfaction that was never made for me, is a vain expectation.</p>
                  <p>4. If Chriſts Death have no more conducibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or virtue for any Mens remiſſion and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then if he had never died at all; then it is not ſufficient to Pardon thoſe Men if they will believe. But if Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for Men, his Death hath no more conducibility or vertue for the Remiſſion of thoſe Mens Sins, or for their Salvation then if he had never died at all: Therefore his Death is not ſufficient to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or Salvation of thoſe Men, though they ſhould believe.</p>
                  <p>The Major is clear: The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, in that ſatisfaction is the firſt and great effect of Chriſts Death, and where that is not made, there is nothing done by it that can any way Conduce to the Remiſſion of Sin: And if that ſatisfaction be not already made, it never will be; for there is no more Sacrifice for Sin. So that methinks I may confidently conclude, that they deny the Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59524:74"/>
of Chriſts Death for the Pardon of all Mens Sins though they ſhould believe, who ſay, he did not ſuffer and ſatisfie for all.</p>
                  <p>And that this is unſound Doctrine I will now prove only by their Judgments who are the owners of it: 1.

The Scripture alſo to this purpoſe is exceeding full and frequent in ſetting forth the Excellency and Dignity of his Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] And <hi>Page</hi> 174. [But its true worth conſiſts in the immediate effects products and Iſſues of it, with what in its own nature it is fit and able to do,] Is it not therefore ſtrange that this Author ſhould (<hi>Page</hi> 175. 176) ſay, [1. That this fulneſs and ſufficiency of the merit of the Death of Chriſt, is a foundation for the general publiſhing of the Goſpel to all Nations, with the right that it hath to be preached to every creature; becauſe the way of Salvation which it declares is wide enough for all to walk in: There is enough in the remedy it brings to light to heal all their diſeaſes, to deliver them from all their evils, If there were 1000 Worlds the Goſpel of Chriſt might on this ground be Preached to them all, there being enough in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59524:75"/>
Chriſt for the Salvation of them all, if ſo be they will derive vertue from him by touching him by Faith; the only way to draw [refreſhment from this Fountain of Salvation] [2. That the Teachers of the Goſpel in their particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may from hence juſtifiably call upon every Man to believe, with aſſurance of Salvation to every Man in particular upon his doing. knowing and being fully perſwaded of this, that there is enough in the death of Chriſt to ſave every one that ſhall ſo do.] To all which I briefly reply 1. I have diſproved this in what is ſaid before; and ſhewed that Chriſts death cannot be affirmed ſufficient for any Mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for whom it never ſatisfied, though he ſhould believe 2. How can he ſay [there is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient merit] where there is no merit at all. The Death of Chriſt hath no merit as to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Devils, or any for whom it was never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. 3. How can he call any thing [a way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wide enough] which preſuppoſeth not Chriſts ſatisfaction for the perſon? Can Men walk to Heaven by Faith without a Redeemer? Or is there ſuch a true Faith? 4. How can he truely ſay [there is enough in the remedy] Which is as to them no Remedy? Is there enough in that remedy to heal the Devils if they believed? 5. How can there be enough in it, or how can it be any remedy, to heal all diſeaſes, and deliver from all evils, before it have made ſatisfaction? Muſt it not do that before it can heal any other diſeaſe? 6. How can he ſay, [There is enough in Chriſt for the Salvation of them all, if ſo be they will derive virtue from him by touching him by Faith?] Muſt not the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59524:75"/>
application be firſt to God by ſatisfying him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be made to Man by believing? Is not the Salvation of Men the Fruit of Chriſts dying for them? And can there be the effect without the cauſe? Hath Chriſt virtue to be derived for the ſaving of any that he died not for? Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving make Chriſt to die for them that he hath not died for already. 7. In plain truth your ground of preaching Chriſt to all, is your foreknowledge that only the Elect will believe, and not the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Chriſts Death, knowing that there is nothing in Chriſts Death to ſave any man that he did not Die and Satisfie for, though he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve never ſo ſtrongly.</p>
                  <p>2. But let us come to the firſt effect of Chriſts Death, and ſee whether it were ſufficient to that, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a ſatisfaction for the Sins of all: And here they do maintain that it is only materially or aptitudinally ſufficient, (as the money which my rich neighbour hath in his purſe, is ſufficient to pay my debt, which he reſolveth never to pay: Or as the Ranſome paid for one man, was enough to have redeemed another alſo, if it had been paid for him.) And what the better is he for whom it was never paid? And what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (as to their ranſome) between moſt men, and Devils? For the form of a ſatisfaction or Price for all, they affirm, that Chriſts Death hath it not ſufficiently or at all. Theſe men muſt once more therefore new moddel their Doctrine, or reform their expreſſions, and give over ſaying that [Chriſts death is ſufficient for the pardon of all if they would believe,] for that is notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe (according to them;) ſeeing the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſatisfaction, is that wherein the ſufficiency
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59524:76"/>
of it lyes as to remiſſion: But they muſt hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſay only that [Chriſts Death was ſufficient to have procured pardon for all men, if he would have ſuffered it for all.] And I will give them this encouragement ſo far to innovate, <hi>viz.</hi> Though they ſpeak not only againſt Scripture and the Primitive Fathers, and the Church of Chriſt in all Ages, and the generallity of our moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Proteſtant Divines; yet becauſe, 1. It is againſt <hi>Arminius,</hi> an adverſary: 2. And tendeth to extreams. 3. And ſo is agreeable to Nature; they ſhall perhaps with applauſe, at leaſt with far leſs wounding of their Reputation, raiſe up theſe novelties, than a Sober, Moderate, Judicious Divine ſhall beat them down again, or revive any one Truth which extreams have clouded, laid by and trodden under foot.</p>
                  <p>But I will not ſtay here to ſhew the abſurdity of mens ſo confident aſſerting Chriſts death to be aptitudinally ſufficient for ſo many for whom it was never ſuffered, ſeeing I ſhall deal on this purpoſely in the next Argument: But how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this ſufficiency is, and no foundation at all for our general offer of Chriſt and mercy to all if they will believe, may be ſeen in what is ſaid before. And how uſeleſs and inſufficient it is to encourage any man to believe, we ſhall yet further have occaſion to ſhew anon. In the mean time, I think the unſoundneſs of their Doctrine, who deny Univerſal Satisfaction is manifeſt hence, in that it fully overthrows the ſufficiency of Chriſts Death for the pardon of all mens ſins if they ſhould believe, which yet the generality of our Divines do maintain.</p>

                  <p>For, 1. No Reformed Divine doth deny but that as one part of the value of Chriſts ſufferings was from the Dignity of the perſon, ſo the other (and a neceſſary part) was from the greatneſs of his ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>2. And all conclude that there was more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering neceſſary for the expiation of the ſins of all the World than for one particular ſin, or then for one mans ſins; and ſo more neceſſary to expiate the ſins of all men, then of the few only that are choſen: And conſequently, if Chriſt ſuffered no more than was ſufficient for the Redemption of the Elect, then it was not ſufficient for the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all. And if it were ſufficient for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all (materially) then it was more than was ſufficient for the Redemption of the Elect.

                     <hi>John Geodwins</hi> conceit, of the ſufficiency of Chriſts meer willingneſs and readineſs to ſuffer, without any actual ſuffering. They that ſay, the ſame degree of ſuffering is ſufficient for a thouſand men as for one may, as well ſay next, that one ſigh or groan, or one drop of Chriſts Blood had been ſufficient for all: And next they may as well ſay, it had been ſufficient though he had only been willing to ſuffer; and next, that his ſuffering was needleſs. <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> if not Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, may eaſily creep in at this Gap.</p>
                  <p>3. And as thus it is evident that Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome, had been enough to have redeemed all, doth make him to ſuffer in vain as to the proper end of his ſuffering (<hi>viz.</hi> Expiation of Sin) ſo they that go this way, have not yet ſhewed us, to what other end or uſe, ſuch great ſufferings of Chriſt were neceſſary: And till they have done that we muſt take it as if they charged Chriſt with ſuffering in vain.</p>
                  <p>4. Moreover, the conſequence is fully granted by themſelves. For they accuſe thoſe that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Univerſal Satisfaction, as making Chriſt to ſuffer in vain, if he ſuffered for thoſe that after periſh (though we can eaſily repel that vain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by ſhewing them many excellent ends and effects of thoſe his ſufferings.) How much more evidently do they themſelves make him ſuffer in vain, that feign him to have ſuffered the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Puniſhment, even enough for all the World; when yet (they ſay) he ſuffered it not ſo much as in the ſtead of all, nor as any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for their ſins. We ſay his Death was for all, in ſome kind, and therefore not vain. They ſay, it was for them in no kind, and yet enough

                  </p>
                  <p>I mean, all Men that hear of Chriſt, are bound to love him as Redeemer, and be thankful to him for making ſatisfaction for them, and thoſe that never heard of him are bound to love <hi>Deum Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recordem,</hi> God as merciful to them and to be thankful for thoſe mercies which are the Fruits of Chriſts Death.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent hath two Parts, 1. That all are bound to love and gratitude 2. That they owe theſe for Chriſts dying for them. And as to the debt it ſelf. I hope few Chriſtians will deny it: For if they do, 1. They will deny a great part of the Law of Chriſt, and if ſuch a curſe be denounced againſt him that addeth or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth, as to the Law of ceremonies, what ſhall be due to him that wipeth out ſo great a part of the Goſpel at a daſh? 2. It is plainly High Treaſon, to diſcharge ſo many of Chriſts Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Allegiance, or of the chief part of their duty, even Love and Gratitude: His Subjects I may call them, though Rebellious; becauſe though they acknowledg him not, or not ſincerely, yet he is their rightful Lord. 3. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious compliance with Satan, to ſay, Duty is no Duty, and that ſo great Duties as theſe; and that Sin is no Sin, and that ſuch hainous Sins.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59524:79"/>
4. If tendeth moſt deſperately to the Damnation of Souls, by drawing them to neglect theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and hardening them in impenitency when they have done. For if it be no duty to Love Chriſt for Redeeming them, and to be thankful for it, then it is no Sin not to love him, and not to be thankful, and if it be no Sin, they need not repent of it. 5. They will wickedly juſtifie Men from the Accuſation of the guilt of theſe Sins, at the Bar of Chriſt, and dare any that now boldly maintain this cauſe in diſpute, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to juſtifie and vindicate them at Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and prove, that it was never their duty to love Chriſt, or be thankful to him for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming them, and therefore that it was not their Sin, that they did it not? This will be a harder task, then it is now to find a flouriſh of words which ſeem to prove it. 6. And worſe then all this, They will condemn Chriſt for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them for theſe Sins. When he hath ſentenced them, [Go you curſed] For not lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him and ſhewing it to his Members, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. And pronounced that Man <hi>Anathema Maranatha</hi> that loves not the Lord Jeſus; if theſe Men can prove that it was none of their duty, then they muſt accuſe Chriſt and his Law of injuſtice, and condemn his condemnatory ſentence.</p>
                  <p>2. And as they owe Chriſt this Love and Gratitude, ſo the thing that they owe it for, is his Redeeming them, or dying in their ſtead, or ſatisfying for their Sin: For 1. It is doubtleſs that they owe it him, not only as Creator but as Redeemer, and if ſo, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Redeeming others, or themſelves. Not only for Redeeming others: For 1. The nature
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59524:79"/>
of gratitude is to reſpect ſome benefits that our ſelves receive, (either in our own Perſons, or in thoſe whoſe welfare is part of ours) And 2. Man is naturally ſo near to himſelf, and the love of himſelf, ſo deeply rooted by God in his nature, that he naturally looks at himſelf before others, and values things as they reſpect himſelf. 3. Others good is no mercy to us, further then we participate with them in the benefit; Yea Divines generally conclude, that it will be ſo far from comforting the damned to ſee that the Godly are in Heaven, that it will encreaſe their torment. 4. Elſe it would lay no greater an obligation on theſe Men to love Chriſt and be thankful to him, than it doth on the Devils, that Men are redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or than they owe God, that the good Angels are preſerved while themſelves are condemned. 5. Scripture not only alloweth Men to love and be thankful in reference to our ſelves, even for that which is good to us, but ſhews it to be our duty, and the nature of thoſe affections; and that for our own mercies received, we are obliged hereto, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10 Men are forſaken and damned for not receiving the love of the Truth that they might be ſaved. How oft are the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> (all of them) Commanded to love the Lord with all their Hearts, as their Redeemer from <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was both an effect and Type of Chriſts work of Redemption. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 5. and 10. 12. and 11. 1, 13, 22. and 19. 9. and 30. 16. 20.

This [becauſe] is not meant only <hi>Effectivè,</hi> but alſo <hi>objectivè,</hi> as to Gods love. The firſt love of the Soul to Chriſt cannot be moved from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſts ſpecial love to the Soul: (For 1. Love accompanieth juſtifying Faith in the ſame moment, (And indeed in ſome Senſe is part of it) And doth not ſtay till the Soul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his own believing, and thence diſcern Gods ſpecial love. 2. There is a love of deſire, which goes before the knowledg of Gods ſpecial love 3. Many a poor Chriſtian loves Chriſt long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they know the ſpecial love of Chriſt) And therefore this firſt ſincere love muſt needs be raiſed from the apprehenſion of Chriſts excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as to us, and his general love to mankind: Which can be no other then that which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in their Redemption.</p>

He that loveth not truly, believeth not truly. And how can any Man prove Gods

If the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Aſſent that they mention be proper to the Regenerate, and ſo be a true note of Gods ſpecial love 1. Then it will follow that other Graces go before that Faith which unites us to Chriſt, (Which few will grant) 2. Then Men muſt find ſpecial Marks Antecedent to Faith that from thence they may gather a warrant to believe: Which is falſe Doctrine, I think, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all 2. But if theſe Antecedent Acts be common and ſuch as reprobates alſo may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, then either every Man that performs them is bound to love Chriſt as his Redeemer (And to reſt on him for pardon) Or only ſome: If eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, then ſome reprobates are bound to love Chriſt as their Redeemer (And to reſt on him for pardon by his Blood-ſhed for them) And to be thankful for his ſatisfaction: And then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Chriſt did Redeem them by ſatisfying for them. If but ſome, then how ſhall any Man know that he is one of them. So that I think I may conclude, that they that deny univerſal ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by Chriſts bloodſhed, do leave Men no ground for their firſt ſpecial love to Chriſt as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59524:81"/>
Redeemer: For that firſt love, muſt be raiſed upon the knowledg of Chriſts general love and mercy, or be groundleſs, Seeing there is no knowledg of ſpecial love and Mercy Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> But how can the knowledg of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon love cauſe in us a ſpecial love to him. Then we muſt love him firſt with a ſpecial love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt hath a ſpecial love to us, before we have a ſpecial love to him: But we cannot know it, and therefore cannot love him for it. His ſpecial love is the efficient cauſe of our love to him, but not the objective or moving cauſe of our firſt love. The love of Chriſt is not the leſs becauſe its manifeſtation is general. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that glorious mercy of general ſatisfaction, though common, not only may be, but is, the ground or motive of our firſt ſpecial love, if it be orderly and rightly raiſed: though Chriſts ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love be the efficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> Then none do love God a right at firſt but thoſe that hold Univerſal Redemption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Yet they may love him ſincerely, though they are brought to it (through the fault of their Teachers) in a diſadvantageous and diſorderly way, 2. Young Converts are not uſed ſo ſoon to be troubled with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy of Univerſal Redemption. 3. I have known few in my obſervation, but at their firſt cloſing with Chriſt, they have had the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Univerſality of Chriſts ſatisfaction
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59524:81"/>
(ſo as to be ſufficient for all Sinners and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only their own Faith to make it effectual to Remiſſion) which I plead for. 4. It is the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way of Preachers in their popular Sermons to ſpeak far more ſoundly in theſe points then in their diſputations: And indeed their way of Preaching for the Converſion of Sinners, doth plainly intimate Univerſal ſatisfaction; For they uſe to lay all the blame on the Wills of Sinners (and juſtly) as that only which can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of the benefits of Chriſts ſufferings, and to urge them to accept him, and to let them know that their caſe is not left remedileſs and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate: Yea and to tell them plainly that Chriſts Death is ſufficient for all, to pardon all their Sins be they never ſo many or great, and if they will believe they ſhall have the Fruits of it: Which is in other words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſay [Chriſt hath ſatisfied for all] So that upon theſe right grounds they uſe to bring Men to believe and love Chriſt at the firſt, and then they muſt have ſome longer time before they can pervert them again, by working out theſe apprehenſions, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for all, but for the Elect only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> Mens firſt love to Chriſt, is not to him for what he hath done, but for what he can do for us, and as he is to us a deſirable good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is but <hi>Amor Concupiſcentiae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is alſo a love of gratitude: And all the good that we can expect from him for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or deſire him for, is but the fruit of what he hath done for us already, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59524:82"/>
it: And he that looketh for Mercy from Chriſt as not procured by his ſatisfactory ſufferings, knows not the Goſpel nor what he expecteth. The Goſpel at its firſt Preaching is glad tidings, and brings news firſt of what Chriſt hath done for Men, and next, of what he will further do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> But it is not for Dying [for me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular] that I am firſt obliged to love Christ; but for paying a ſufficient price.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If by [For me in particular] you mean [more for me then others] I grant it: But it is for dying and ſatisfying for fallen Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, of whom I am a Member. 2. I have ſhewed that according to this New Doctrin, Chriſts Death is not ſufficient to pardon all, if they did repent; nor formally a ſufficient price but only materially or Aptitudinally, ſufficient to have been a price. Now that this can engage any to love or thankfulneſs is paſt my reach to apprehend: For it is not a benefit, (to ſuch as for whom it was no price.) If 100 Men lie in Priſon for debt, and one ſhall pay as much for the debt and diſcharge often of them as was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have ſatisfied for the debts of them all, and yet would not pay it for them, but rather give it ſuperfluouſly then that they ſhould have any benefit by it, how doth this oblige theſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to love and thankfulneſs to this Man? At leaſt, not as any Redeemer or Friend of theirs? Rather they will think him envious and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to them, that would rather caſt away his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59524:82"/>
(Giving for one that which was ſufficient for all) then they ſhould have any benefit by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> But it is not for his Death, that Men are bound at firſt to love Chriſt and be thankful, but for the free and general offer of himſelf and his beneſits to them in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The negative is wicked and Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian 2. The part affirmed is a contradiction to their denial of Univerſal ſatisfaction. For Chriſt is offered to Men as their Redeemer only. And the Word [Redeemer] ſignifies 1. One that hath paid a price for them already 2. One that will recover them by the effectual convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his benefits, if they accept his offer. And the later always implies the former: The effect cannot be without its cauſe. He is no Redeemer to them for whom he ſuffered not. And he cannot be a Redeemer to them by Pardon and Salvation, for whom he hath not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a Redeemer by ſatisfaction. And he doth not offer to ſatisfie for them <hi>de futuro,</hi> a new, and therefore the offer certainly proves a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſatisfaction, as is ſhewed before. 3. And if Chriſt offer himſelf to any Men, as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer whom he never did Redeem, no nor can Redeem by Remiſſion and Salvation, becauſe he hath not firſt Redeemed them by price and ſatisfaction, charging the refuſal upon them to their deep damnation, doth this oblige Men to love and gratitude? If he procure by his Death no poſſibility of their Salvation, but induce a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of their deep condemnation? If he offer them the benefits of a death never ſuffered for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59524:83"/>
them, (that is effects without their cauſe) and which he cannot give them, and deſtroy them for not receiving them; Is this all the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> But it is the Law of God that obligeth them to love and gratitude: And therefore they are obliged, though Chriſt be none of their Redeemer, and though his Death were not a benefit to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Theſe are duties that reſult <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> viz. <hi>boni oblati, &amp; beneficii <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ollati,</hi> and ſo from the Law of nature, and not from a meer poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law. Love and gratitude are not ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and therefore where the nature of the thing obligeth not, there is no obligation. 2. There muſt be an objective cauſe of love and gratitude, as well as an efficient, and exemplary cauſe; And therefore our queſtion is only of the objective cauſe. God doth not alter the nature of love and gratitude by commanding them; He doth not command love that hath not good for its object (for there is no ſuch thing <hi>in rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura</hi>) nor doth he command a gratitude that is not for a benefit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> But it is unknown to them whether Chriſt died for them or not, For ought they know he did, And therefore they are bound to love and gratitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. An unknown benefit bindeth not to love and thankfulneſs. 2. It is Real favours and not feigned, that Chriſt obligeth Men by: As it
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59524:83"/>
is real love and thanks and not feigned that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth from them. 3. Elſe that common love and thankfulneſs which the Non-elect do give Chriſt as their Redeemer, would be a miſtake. 4. And when their Eyes were opened in Hell, they would repent that they loved Chriſt at all, and were thankful to him at all, ſeeing they would then diſcern it was upon a miſtake, and for a benefit that was never given them or for them: Whereas contrarily they will be convinced then of their Sin and folly in loving Chriſt no more, and being no more thankful.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, that theſe Men are bound to love and gratitude to Chriſt as their Redeemer, I will add ſome more Scripture proof. 1. If the Non-elect are not bound to love Chriſt for Redeeming them or not dying for them, then the Elect are not bound to it, till they know themſelves to be Elect; But the conſequent is falſe, therefore ſo is the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. He that dare ſay, No Man in the World is bound to love Chriſt and be thankful to him for dying for him, till he know he is Elect (That is, have aſſurance of Salvation which ſo ſo few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to at all, or at leaſt ſo many Chriſtians want) Dare ſay that which I dare not, <hi>Rom</hi> 5. 8. <hi>But God commended his love to us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chrift died for us. Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever,</hi> &amp;c. 1. If Gods love to the World and Sinners before Converſion, in his Redeeming them by Chriſt, be propounded to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unconverted Sinners, then it is to manifeſt that they owe him love again and thankfulneſs for it: But the Antecedent is true, therefore ſo is the conſequent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:59524:84"/>Theſe Texts and many other do propound the conſideration of Gods love, in Redeeming them, to Men before Converſion (as might abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be proved) and that muſt need intimate their duty of love and gratitude, or elſe the Law of nature is abrogated, which bindeth us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn love and thankfulneſs for love and benefits. 2. Let me add one other Argument for the Minor (<hi>viz.</hi> that the Elect are bound to love and gratitude to Chriſt as their Redeemer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they know themſelves to be Elect) and it is ſuch a one, as I think, makes the caſe ſo clear, that it will be hard for the moſt prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced not to diſcern it, if they will conſider it.</p>
                  <p>If the Elect are not bound to love and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for Chriſts Redeeming them, before they know themſelves to be Elect, then they are never bound to it at all, (and ſo never ought to perform it) But the conſequent is intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſequence is proved thus. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know themſelves to be elect (unleſs by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Revelation) till they firſt know their love and gratitude to Chriſt for Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; Therefore if they are not bound to love and gratitude before they know themſelves Elect, then they are never bounnd to it. The reaſon of the conſequence is, that the ſame thing cannot be, [Before] and [Not before] before their knowledg of Election, and not before it. If it muſt go before the knowledg of Election, then they were obliged to it before (for that we are not obliged to, is no duty and that which is no duty, is no Mark of Election:) but it muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:59524:84"/>The Antecedent is proved thus, There is no other ſign without this love and gratitude which is ſufficient to diſcover a Man to be Elect; Therefore no Man can know himſelf to be elect (by ordinary means) without the knowledg of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Two things will be replied, to this. 1. That Faith is before love and gratitude, and a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſign. 2. That it may be known without ſigns by the Teſtimony of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>To theſe in order. And 1. For Faith, as it is in the will and is the acceptance of an offered Chriſt, is the ſame thing with love, as love is in the rational appetite, as I have elſewhere fully proved; <hi>&amp; Aquinas</hi> oft expreſſeth this love to be but <hi>velle bonum.</hi> 2. If love be diſtinct (as it is exerciſed on the ſame object, for elſe there's no queſtion of it) Yet it is certain that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, and doth not in one moment of time come after Faith: Much leſs ſo long as that a Man muſt firſt by reflection diſcern his Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be obliged to love. 3. Faith is no true Faith that is not accompanied with love, and a falſe faith can be no true ſign of Election, as is ſaid before. The Acts of Juſtifying Faith in the Will are principally theſe two. 1. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt as he is offered; Now he is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Redeemer, <hi>i. e.</hi> 1. As one that for the time paſt hath paid the price of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. And for the time to come will give us the benefits of it, on his own terms. Now Chriſt cannot be received as a Redeemer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to both. He that receiveth him to pardon and ſave him any other way then by the price of his Blood already ſhed, doth not receive
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59524:85"/>
him as he is offered, nor as the Redeemer; And if it be neceſſary that he muſt be received in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to what he hath done for us, as well as what he will do, then it is as neceſſary that he be loving and thankfully received. For as <hi>bonum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur volendo,</hi> which is our love; and cannot poſſibly be received <hi>qud bonum</hi> but lovingly; ſo <hi>bonum preteritum</hi> is the object of this <hi>Amor Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis,</hi> (The benefit may remain, but the act of the benefactor is paſt) as <hi>bonum futurum</hi> is the object of <hi>Amor Concupiſcentiae, &amp; Bonum Preſens,</hi> of <hi>Amor Complacentiae.</hi> So that no Man living can know that he hath received Chriſt as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, if he do not know that he hath lovingly and thankfully received him. And no Man can know the good that Chriſt will do for the future, nor receive it, without knowing the good that he hath done in his Sacrifice for the time paſt, and thankfully acknowledging it. 2. After ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of an offered Chriſt, the next Act, is affiance (which moſt Divines make the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and ſome the only juſtifying Act) And this preſuppoſing the loving conſent, acceptance, the <hi>Velle,</hi> before mentioned, I do not need to prove, that affiance is no certain Mark of Election, without love; Nay moreover, as it preſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth love, ſo it containeth love in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as every Act of the will toward goodneſs, muſt needs do. I reſt on Chriſt as one to do me good for the future by virtue of his ranſome already paid; and ſo here is ſtill the double good, paſt and preſent, which affiance doth reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or elſe it is not in Chriſt as Redeemer that we have affiance. 3. The like I might eaſily ſhew in reſpect of deſire after Chriſt: An early Grace,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59524:85"/>
and before which none finds a diſtinct certain ſign of his Election: Yet goodneſs is its object, and love is in its nature; from whence we uſe the term of <hi>Amor Concupiſcentiae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you ſaid before, that the Faith and Love of Young Converts that hold not Univerſal Satisfaction may be ſincere, though not rightly ordered, grounded or raiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, for if one ſhould conceit that Chriſt Dyed but for <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> or for a very few at leaſt, and that he is one of thoſe few, he might truly love Chriſt for dying for him; though yet he grounded his apprehenſion amiſs of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt. But ſtill here is no certainty of Faith, without certainty of Love: Nor certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or any knowledge of Election, without the knowledge of both Faith and Love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Then a <hi>Socinian</hi> can have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ertainty of Election: For he that believeth not Chriſts Satisfaction can have no Love or Thankfulneſs for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No wonder if he have no certainty of Election, who can have no grounded hope of Salvation. If it be not only ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or Terms or Law-notions; but the ſubſtance of this Doctrine, which any Man ſhall deny, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt hath taken away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf, and having made Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſins, is aſcended, <hi>&amp;c. And hath by one Sacrifice perfected for ever them that are ſanctified, and became a Curſe for us, to free us from the Curſe,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59524:86"/>
and ſo hath taken away the Sins of the World</hi> (quoad pretium,) <hi>And hath born our tranſgreſſions, that we might be healed by his ſtripes, and hath Dyed for us, the juſt for the unjuſt, ſo that now we muſt be juſtified by his Blood:</hi> I ſay, he that believeth not this, I think is no Chriſtian. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. and 10. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 1. 3. and 10. 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 4, 5. <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and 5. 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. and 13. 12. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>I know nothing more of moment that can be here objected and therefore will go to the next Reply.</p>
                  <p>2. Which was, that men may know their Election by the Teſtimony of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. The Spirit ſheweth to us the things gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of God, of which Love to Chriſt is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.</p>
                  <p>2. The Spirit witneſſeth our Election medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and not immediately (that I know of.) 1. By giving thoſe graces that will prove it, and do flow from it. 2. By exciting them. 3. By illuminating us to ſee them, and try by them. 4. Filling the Soul, with thoſe ſweet affections, which are a kind of taſt of the Love of God: But all affections are raiſed <hi>mediante intellectu,</hi> and therefore knowledge goes before them. Who can know that he rejoyceth Spiritually, and that his Joy is a fruit of Election, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not why he rejoiceth.</p>
                  <p>3. However, it is deſperate Doctrine to teach poor Chriſtians, that they have no ground to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59524:86"/>
Love or Thank Chriſt for Redeeming them, till the Spirit have without any ſigns revealed their Election to them (which I think it never doth.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Spirit witneſſeth with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Now our Spirit witneſſeth only from evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we are Gods Children, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and therefore whether the Spirit be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring witneſs in the ſame Teſtimony, or its Teſtimony be a concomitant Teſtimony, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from though conjunct with that of our Conſcience, (I think the former) yet alls one to the point in hand, ſeeing they witneſs together.</p>
                  <p>So much for the <hi>Minor, viz.</hi> that the Elect are bound to love and thankfulneſs for Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before they know themſelves Elect. Now for the conſequence of the Major, it it clear from what is ſaid, that the Elect could not be bound to this, except the Non-Elect are alſo: Becauſe (as is proved) no Man can know whether he be Elect or not, before he know himſelf ſo much as obliged to love and gratitude for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. For Elect and Non-Elect are not to to be diſcerned till Faith and love do put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. And therefore, methinks, I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude confidently, that the Non-Elect are bound to love and thankfulneſs for Redemption, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and therefore they are redeemed or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed for.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall make the common objection, <hi>viz.</hi> The Non-elect, or the Elect not yet converted are bound to love and gratitude to Chriſt for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying for all that will believe, I have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this oft already.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59524:87"/>1. The Doctrine which I oppoſe is that Chriſt hath not only died for Men if they will believe, but died only for the Elect that they might believe; ſo that it is determined by name for whom he Died, and the reſt he Died not for at all; and therefore his Dying for another, is not that which obligeth a man to Thankfulneſs: And their Ignorance that they are excluded, I have ſhewed, can add no obligation.</p>
                  <p>2. Mens believing will not cauſe Chriſt to Die for them, nor is it a condition of it, as if Chriſt would Die for Men if they will believe; Believing preſuppoſeth Chriſts Dying for us, and what then can be their meaning that ſay Chriſt Died and Satisfied for all men if they will Believe? When they ſay abſolutely withal, that he Died not for all at all, but only for the Elect, that they might believe. Will they ſay that he Died for the Non-elect, if they will believe? Then either they muſt mean that he underwent the Penalty, and left it undetermined <hi>quorum loco,</hi> in whoſe ſtead and for whoſe ſins it ſhould be, till their believing determine it: But 1. This is as much denyed by thoſe whom I oppoſe, as by me. 2. And it is a contradiction. For it is Eſſential to Puniſhment to be <hi>propter peccatum;</hi> that Relation is its formal Nature, as it differs from Affliction in general; And therefore Chriſt ſuffered no Puniſhment, if it were not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for Sin: And the meritorious cauſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as before the effect, and not after it; Or elſe if they ſpeak of [Believing] not as any condition on mans part, but a Divinely-infuſed Character of thoſe for whom Chriſt Died, then the ſence of their words is but this [Chriſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

for the Non-elect, if they be Elect] or [Chriſt ſatisfied for all men, if all men be Elect] or [Chriſt Died in ſtead of all, if he will give Faith to all.] And who ſees not that theſe words are a plain Negation, and all one with theſe [Chriſt ſatisfied not for all] <hi>q. d.</hi> [I leave in my Will ſuch a Legacy to <hi>Titus,</hi> if <hi>Titus</hi> be not <hi>Titus,</hi> but <hi>Sempronius</hi>] what Lawyer knows not that is a denyal, or an illuſory nothing!

                  <p>If I could bethink me of any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Objection I would anſwer it: But I cannot.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore for the Antecedency of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to love, mark how Chriſt maketh it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his own Love and his Fathers (as in a greater degree, and as manifeſted) <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>He that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> Chriſt Loveth Men before they Love, as he is <hi>Dominus Abſolutus</hi> and a free Benefactor, (and as a Natural Lover of his own Workmanſhip) But he loveth man after his Faith and Love to him as <hi>Rector per Leges,</hi> as putting on the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of goodneſs, and juſtice in civil Senſe, and as he now ſtands in that Relation to them, in which he is by his own Law, as it were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do them good: Note this difference of Chriſts love, <hi>Prov. 8. 17. I love thoſe that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> So <hi>ver. 21. Luke 7. 47. Many ſins are forgiven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> If it be meant [therefore ſhe loved much] yet it would not make againſt this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:59524:88"/>From <hi>John</hi> 3. 19. I argue thus. If men are condemned for loving darkneſs rather than Light, (and Chriſt is this Light) then they were obliged to love Chriſt the Light. But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And I have ſhewed it is as Redeemer that he muſt be loved: For to Love Chriſt as an excellent Prophet only, that a <hi>Turk</hi> may do, for <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſo confeſſeth him to be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. It is Chriſts condition propounded to all, <hi>That if they love not him better than Father, Mother, Houſe, Land or Life they cannot be his Diſciples;</hi> So that thoſe that are not yet his Diſciples, are obliged at once to love him above all, and become his Diſciples. 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 22. If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt let him be</hi> Anathema, Maran-atha.</p>
                  <p>And then more ſpecially for Gratitude (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have hitherto inſiſted on the other ſpecies, Love) there are many Parables in the Goſpel that ſhew that wicked men are condemned for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to their Redeemer, <hi>Mat. 21. 37, 40. &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt convinceth his Auditors, that thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful Husband-men, that refuſed to pay the Fruits, and killed the Son that was ſent to them; (he was ſent to be entertained as Redeemer) would deſervedly be deſtroyed with a miſerable deſtruction, and the Vineyard let out to others, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the Kingdom of God ſhould be taken from them and given to a Nation bringing forth the Fruits thereof. And what is that Kingdom (here meant) but the Goſpel? The proclaiming and offer of Chriſt as Redeemer, and of mercy in and with him? <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 8. It is unthankful refuſal of the feaſt prepared, when all things were ready, and they invited which was the <hi>unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59524:88"/>
that there is mentioned, which ſhut out thoſe Gueſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 32. Unthankfulneſs is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated as part of the Sin of that wicked Servant, who took his fellow Servant by the throat for 100. Pence, when himſelf had been forgiven 10000 Talents: [<hi>I forgave thee all the debt</hi>] ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth ſuch a mercy as Men may have that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh (as is plain <hi>verſe</hi> 34. 35.) and yet certainly preſuppoſeth Chriſts dying for them, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to thankfulneſs: If any ask the ſenſe of the Text, I ſhall give it after by it ſelf more fitly.</p>
                  <p>Let me therefore conclude thus. That Doccrin which ſubverteth a very great part of Religion is not of God: But ſo doth this which denieth Univerſal ſatisfaction: Therefore it is not of God. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from what is ſaid: It deſtroyeth the ground of all Mens firſt love to Chriſt for Redeeming them: It juſtifieth all the Non-Elect in their ingratitude and not loving Chriſt as their Redeemer: Beſides what was ſaid before of its deſtroying the uſe of repentance and all Means. But we ſhall recollect more of theſe conſequences in the end, and ſhew you more fully the face of the Doctrin which I diſpute againſt.</p>
                  <p>I have proved that all Men that hear the Goſpel, owe Chriſt love and thankfulneſs for Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by dying for them. I ſhould next ſhew that all Men in the World do owe God love and thankfulneſs for thoſe mercies which are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Chriſts ſatisfaction: But eſpecially thoſe within the Church who have in the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, made over to them a conditional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Sins, and adoption, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, <hi>viz.</hi> If they will accept Chriſt with his benefits: Thoſe that are ſanctified with

the Blood of the Covenant, and are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghoſt and were eſcaped from the pollutions of the World through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and and have taſted the good word of God and the Powers of the World to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly theſe have received the fruits of Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for which they were bound to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

                  <p>If Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for the Sins of all, then no Man hath a ſufficient ground for his firſt juſtifying Faith: (All Men are left at an utter uncomfortable uncertainty whether they may believe to Juſtification or not) But the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is falſe: Therefore ſo is the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>That which is ſaid before doth ſhew ſo much of the grounds of this Argument, that I ſhall be the ſhorter in it now.

God commandeth no Man to believe a falſhood to make it become true by believing it, nor to truſt to a perſon or promiſe that is not to be truſted, as being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallible, but certainly will deceive. As for the Act of affiance or recumbency, commonly called the juſtifying Act, no Man can groundedly or

comfortably reſt on Chriſt for juſtification by his Blood, who doth not firſt know that his Blood was ſhed for him, and hath ſatisfied for him: Elſe he muſt reſt on that which he knows not to be ſufficient for him to reſt upon: For it hath been proved that Chriſts death is not ſufficient to juſtifie any for whom it was not ſuffered, though they ſhould believe. He ſuffered not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly, as I have ſhewed: Take the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a Divine that for fear of Arminianiſm joyned Hands with the Antimonians, <hi>Maccovius colleg. diſp. de juſtif. diſp.</hi> 5. §. 22. <hi>Quoad ſubſtantiam poenae nihil olus perpeſſus eſt Chriſtus quam per legem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebatur: Ne<expan>

And if ſo, then either he ſuffered as <hi>Sponſor</hi> for all: Or elſe circumſtances did make that Death ſufficient for all, which yet <hi>quoad ſubſtantiâ poenae</hi> (as he calls it) had none of that which the Law required, and was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the <hi>Sponſor</hi> to undergo. And thus I think (with that added which is ſaid before) it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that none have ground to reſt on Chriſts Blood to juſtifie them, or on Chriſt to juſtifie
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59524:90"/>
them by his Blood, till they know that his Blood was ſhed for them ſeeing it is ſufficient for no more. But no Man before juſtifying Faith knows that Chriſts Blood was ſhed for him any more then for others that ſhall never be juſtified by it, therefore no Man hath ground thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And for the intellectual Act of Faith, if it be that which <hi>Maccovius</hi> ſaith it is <hi>ibid. diſput.</hi> 3. §. 17. <hi>Fides in Chriſtum quae requiritur a nobis ad noſtri juſtificationem eſt, ut credamus pro redemptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; ſanguinem nos juſtificari &amp; ſalvari,</hi> then moſt Men are bound to believe an untruth, if they are bound to believe to juſtification. If it be ſaid that, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> believe that Chriſts Death is ſufficient to pardon him if he believe, I anſwer that no Man can truly believe that neither, but he that firſt knows that he died for him, which none can do but he that knows that he died for all. I marvail how ſuch Divines (as <hi>Twiſs</hi> and <hi>Maccovius</hi> who hold the main Antimonian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) who ſay that Faith juſtifieth only as we are aſcertained, or receive the knowledg of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication already paſt at Chriſts death, can tell how to Salve this. How can they chooſe but ſay, that either God doth not command all where the Goſpel comes to believe to juſtification, or elſe, that he commands moſt Men to believe a falſhood: Or elſe, that all Men are juſtified by Chriſts death.</p>
                  <p>Let me add here (for I will not make another Argument of it, being built on the ſame grounds with the former) that if Chriſt died not for all, then not only all Men at their firſt invitation, but even all true believers whenever they looſe the fight of their evidences, that is, of their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59524:90"/>
own Faith and other Graces, have no ground left them to renew an Act of juſtifying Faith, nor to caſt their Souls with any confidence on Chriſt: For as long as he knows not himſelf to be Elect and a true believer, he cannot tell whether, Chriſt died for him, and conſequently he knows not whether he may reſt on him as a ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, as not knowing whether he ſatisfied for him or not. If any ſay, he muſt believe that he may know, I anſwer 1. It muſt be a revealed truth before it is believed. 2. Believing will not make it true, if it were not true before. We are not to believe that Chriſt may die for us, but to believe that he did die for us. Hear <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covius</hi> his confeſſion of that alſo, <hi>Ibid diſp.</hi> 9. §. 16. <hi>At toto caelo errat Haereticus</hi> (Socinus) <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que enim fidem requiri ad hoc dicimus, ut pro nobis ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfiat; ſed ut pro fidem ſatisfactio iſta Chriſti quae perac to eſt ante fidem nobis innoteſcat</hi> (ſo that when God commandeth Men to believe, he commandeth them to take knowledg of Chriſts ſatisfaction for them before made: And ſurely men cannot know that which is not true, unleſs it be to know it to be falſe.) And thus it ſeems plain to me that many, if not moſt true believers will be left without any ſufficient ground to believe, through a great part of their lives. For I think, aſſurance is not ſo common a thing as ſome imagine, nor ſo conſtant with them that have it: Though <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covius</hi> ſaith (as one Error draws on another.) <hi>Ibid. diſp.</hi> 9. §. 11. <hi>Reſpondeo, (ſalvo aliorum judicio) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gando ſenſum illum (qui in nobis oritur ex agnitione noſtrae Iuſtificationis) aliquando tolli penitus in homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne:</hi> Our Divines that teach poor Souls to uſe their Faith of Adherence when they want evidence,

                  <p>If Chriſt ſatisfied not for all, then the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg or aſſurance that we have juſtifying Faith muſt go before juſtifying Faith: But that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible as being a contradiction, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>If it be the great aggravation of all Mens Sins committed againſt that mercy which tendeth to their Recovery, that they are againſt the Lord that died for them, then Chriſt did die for all ſuch Men: But the Antecedent is true, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only the Antecedent requires proof; That wicked Men do partake of Mercy tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their recovery, (as to the nature of the mercy, and in Gods legal Ordination) I think I need not prove among Chriſtians; And that they Sin againſt ſuch mercy, is a thing that needs as little proof; The main proof of the Antecedent [that theſe mens Sins are aggravated, in that they are againſt Chriſt that died for them] will be from ſeveral Texts of Scripture which do thus aggravate ſuch Mens Sin, which becauſe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to handle particularly, I will refer you thereto, and now paſs them by. Further, 1. It is confeſſed that theſe Mens Sin is aggravated in that they are againſt the Blood of Chriſt as offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them in its Fruits, and as againſt Chriſt himſelf offered to them as Crucified and as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and as againſt the offers of pardon, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation, which are all Fruits of Chriſts ſatisfaction. But all theſe imply ſatisfaction for them to whom they are offered, as is proved already, <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi> Many of our Divines (as <hi>Perkins Reform. Cathol. of Juſtif.</hi> and others) ſay that in this we differ from the Papiſts, that they make Chriſts ſatisfaction to be but the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of our Righteouſneſs, but not our Righteouſneſs it ſelf as we affirm it (I do not now
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59524:92"/>
judg of theſe words, but) if Chriſts ſatisfaction be our very Righteouſneſs or any part of it, then certainly Chriſt ſatisfied for all to whom he offers his Righteouſneſs: But that he offers his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to all without exception is beyond doubt: And he would never offer them a <hi>Non-ens,</hi> that which is not: He doth not offer to one Man the ſatisfaction made only for another and not for him, for that would be no Righteouſneſs for him: But it is Righteouſneſs that Chriſt offers, and therefore it is ſatisfaction for that ſinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which is offered to that ſinner, to be his Righteouſneſs. Now the offer ſuppoſeth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the thing offered, except it were only an offer to do or give ſomething hereafter, which is not the caſe here. And for them that ſay, [Chriſt is only offered to Men if they will receive him, or believe] it is idle: For Chriſt is offered to Men whether they will receive him or not, but none but receivers do enjoy him. God doth not make our receiving the condition of his offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to ſay [I will offer thee Chriſts ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if thou wilt receive it] but he makes it the condition of our attaining the good offered <hi>q. d,</hi> [Chriſt with his benefits offered to thee ſhall be thine if thou wilt receive him.]</p>
                  <p>2. If it be only the Blood of Chriſt ſhed for others, and not for them which unbelievers ſin againſt, then the ſin of Devils might (as to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) be as well aggravated from the Blood of Chriſt ſinned againſt as theirs: But the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is palpably abſurd, <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Conſider what hainous conſequents will follow, if you deny this aggravation of the Sins of unbelievers. 1. You harden them in the moſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59524:92"/>
deſperate impenitency: For they cannot repent of that which they know not to be a Sin, and they cannot know that they have ſinned againſt him that dyed for them, till they know that he did die for them; and who dare ſay to all the World, that yet know not that they are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, [you ought not to repent for any Sin as being committed againſt him that died for you.] <hi>Perkins Treat.</hi> of repentance, and multitudes of our godly Engliſh Writers when they preſs Men to repentance, do uſe this as the greateſt motive, to conſider what our Sins did coſt the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, They coſt him Blood, and ſhould they not coſt us tears? and ſhould we make light of that which lay ſo heavy on him? Such arguings are common in almoſt all Writers and Preachers: Now if Chriſt did not bear all Mens Sins, and if all Mens Sins did not coſt Chriſt ſo dear, then this Argument or Motive to repentance can be uſed to no Man, nor by any Man but only thoſe that have got aſſurance of a ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt. 2. Hereby you deny that God may juſtly aggravate Mens Sins, or condemn Men for Sinning againſt Chriſt that died for them. 3. Hereby you perſwade Men that their conſciences ſhall not thus agravate them in Hell, nor tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them for Sinning againſt him that ſuffered for them, all which I ſhall ſhew anon, to be falſe. 4. Hereby you forbid Miniſters from thus aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating their Peoples Sins, and ſo from uſing the moſt effectual motive to draw them to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And hereby you condemn almoſt all the moſt powerful Preachers in <hi>England,</hi> who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally take this courſe. And you reject the moſt powerful Books and Sermons which God
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59524:93"/>
hath bleſt to the Converſion of many Souls. I mention this, the rather becauſe ſome ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that thoſe who are againſt Univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſucceed as much in their Miniſtry to the Converſion of Souls, as thoſe that are for it: The reaſon is, becauſe they commonly Preach for it, or on grounds that ſuppoſe it, in their practical Sermons, when in their diſputes they ſpeak againſt it. That you may ſee I wrong them not, I will inſtance in one, learned, Holy <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins:</hi> who hath writ more confidently againſt Univerſal Redemption then he?

ſtood guilty as a Malefactor for them, and ſuffered the very Pangs of Hell: And that his ſufferings are as much in acceptation with God as if thou hadſt born the curſe of the Law in thy own perſon eternally.

He that finds himſelf ſo dull and hardened that the Paſſion of Chriſt doth not humble him, is in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable eaſe, for there is no Faith in the Death of Chriſt effectual in him as yet. (Theſe words ſhew that <hi>Perkins</hi> ſpeaks not this only to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.) 2. The meditation of the paſſion of Chriſt is a moſt notable means to breed repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reformation of Life in time to come. For when we begin to think that Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, by ſuffering the firſt and 2d. Death hath procured to us remiſſion of all our Sins paſt, and freed us from Hell. Death and damnation; then if there be but a ſpark of Grace in us we begin to be of another mind, and to reaſon thus with our ſelves, what? hath the Lord been thus merciful to me that am of my ſelf but a firebrand of Hell, as to free me from deſerved deſtruction, and to receive me to favour in Chriſt? Yea; no doubt he hath, His name be bleſſed therefore: I will not therefore Sin any more as I have done, but rather endeavour hereafter to keep my ſelf from every evil way.] 3. The right knowledg of our ſelves ariſeth from the knowledg of Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in whom, and by whom we come to know five ſpecial things of our ſelves. The firſt, how grievous our Sins are, and therefore how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we are in regard of them. If we conſider our offences in themſelves and as they are in us,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59524:94"/>
we may ſoon be deceived, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if Sin be conſidered in the Death and paſſion of Chriſt whereof it was the cauſe, and the vileneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of meaſured by the unſpeakable torments endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Son of God; and if the greatneſs of the offence of Man be eſteemed by the endleſs ſatisfaction made to the juſtice of God; the leaſt Sin that is, will appear to be a Sin indeed, and that moſt grievous and ugly. Therefore Chriſt Crucified muſt be uſed by us as a mirror or Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs in which we may fully take a view of our wretchedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And before [and for our Neighbors, thoſe ſpecially that are of Chriſts Church, they are to be known of us on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: When we are to do any duty to them, we muſt not barely reſpect their Perſons, but Chriſt Crucified in them, and them in Chriſt.] And <hi>Page</hi> 631.] The 5th. point is that we owe to Chriſt an endleſs debt, for he was Crucified only as our ſurety and pledg; and in that Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his paſſion we muſt conſider our ſelves as the chief debtors, and that the very diſcharge of our debt, that is, the Sins which are inherent in us, were the proper cauſe of all the endleſs pains and torments that Chriſt endured, that he might ſet us moſt miſerable Bankrupts at liberty from Hell. Death and damnation. For this his unſpeakable goodneſs, if we do but once think of it ſeriouſly, we muſt needs confeſs that we owe our ſelves our Souls and Bodies and all that we have as a debt due unto him. And ſo ſoon as any Man begins to know Chriſt Crucified, he knows his own debt and thinks of the payment of it.] And that you may be ſure that <hi>Perkins</hi> ſpeaks not only of the Elect, ſee <hi>Page</hi> 631. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. [The
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59524:95"/>
common Proteſtant likewiſe cometh ſhort here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for 3 Cauſes. 1. Whereas in word they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg him to be their Saviour (this he blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in them) that hath redeemed them from their evil Converſation, yet indeed they make him a patron of their Sins. The Thief makes him the receiver: The Murderer makes him his refuge, The Adulterer (be it ſpoken with reverence to his Majeſty) makes him the Bawd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus Chriſt that came to aboliſh Sin is made a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer thereof, and the common Packhorle of the World to bear every Mans burden. 2. Men are content to take knowledg of the merit of Chriſts paſſion, for the remiſſion of their Sins, but in the mean ſeaſon, the virtue of Chriſts Death for the mortifying of Sin, is little regarded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Men uſually content themſelves generally and confuſedly to know Chriſt to be their Redeemer (it ſeems then, that it is true) never once ſeeking in every particular Eſtate and condition of Life, and in every particular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God to feel the benefit of his paſſion. What is the cauſe that almoſt all the World live in ſecurity never almoſt touched for their horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sins? Surely the reaſon is becauſe they did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſeriouſly conſider that Chriſt in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lay grouling upon the Earth, ſweating Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Blood <hi>for their</hi> offences. (Can a Man ſpeak plainer for Chriſts dying for all?) Again <hi>all ſuch</hi> as by fraud and oppreſſion or any kind of hard dealing ſuck the Blood of poor Men, never yet knew that <hi>their Sins</hi> drew out the Heart Blood of Chriſt! And proud Men and Women that are puffed up by reaſon of their attire, which is the badg of their ſhame, and never ceaſe hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59524:95"/>
ſtrange faſhions, conſider not that Chriſt was not Crucified in gay attire, but naked, that he might bear the whole ſhame and curſe of the Law for us. Theſe and ſuch like, whatſoever they ſay in word, are flat Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, and tread his precious Blood under their Feet. Now then conſidering this ſo weighty and ſpecial a point of Religion is ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, O Man or Woman, high or low, young or old, if thou have been wanting this way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin for very ſhame to learn, and learning to know Chriſt Crucified: That thou mayeſt attain to this, behold him often, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. Look on him as a glaſs or ſpectacle in which thou ſhalt ſee Gods Glory greater in thy Redemption then in thy Creation. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Thou muſt behold him as the full price of thy Redemption and perfect Reconciliation with God: And pray earneſtly to God that he would Seal up the ſame in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by his Spirit. 3. Thou muſt behold Chriſt as an example to whom thou muſt conform thy ſelf by Regeneration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Read the Hiſtory of Chriſts paſſion: Obſerve all the parts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof, and apply them to thy ſelf for thy full Converſion. When thou readeſt that Chriſt went to the Garden as his cuſtom was where the Jews might ſoon attack him, conſider that he went to the death of the Croſs <hi>for thy Sins</hi> willingly, and not of conſtraint and that therefore thou for thy part ſhouldeſt do him all ſervice freely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3.

                     <hi>if thou wilt believe</hi> in him: When thou readeſt that in the Garden he prayed lying grovling on his Face, ſweating Water and Blood, begin to think ſeriouſly, what an unſpeakable meaſure of Gods wrath was upon thy bleſſed Saviour, that did proſtrate his Body upon the Earth, and cauſe the Blood to follow; and think that <hi>thy Sins</hi> muſt needs be moſt hainous that brought ſuch bloody and grievous pains upon him. Alſo think it is a ſhame for thee to carry thy Head to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with haughty looks, to wallow in thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to draw the innocent Blood of thy poor brethren by oppreſſion and deceit, for whom, Chriſt Sweat Water and Blood; and take an occaſion from Chriſts agony to lay aſide the pride of thy Heart, yea, even to bleed for thy own offences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When thou readeſt that Chriſt was taken and bound, think that <hi>thy very Sins</hi> brought him into the power of his Enemies, and were the very bonds wherewith he was tied: Think, that thou ſhouldſt have been bound in the very ſame manner unleſs he had been a ſurety and pledg for thee: Think alſo that thou in the ſame manner art bound and tied with the Chains of thy own Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Laſtly think and believe that the bonds of Chriſt ſerve to purchaſe thy liberty from Hell, death and damnation When thou heareſt that he was brought before <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> think, it was meet that <hi>thy ſurety</hi> and pledg who was to ſuffer the Condemnation due to thee ſhould by the High Prieſt as by the Mouth of God, be condemned: And wonder at this that the very Coeſſential, and Eternal Son of God, even the Soveraign judg of the World; ſtands to be judged, and that by wicked Men, perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> whoſe words I have thus largely ſet doown, both as a pattern for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters how to Preach the Doctrine of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſhew the neceſſity there is that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People do ſee (and diſcover to others) their Sin in this great aggravation, [as they were the crucifiers of Chriſt] and to ſhew you what Engliſh Miniſters Preach to the People whatever they ſpeak in Diſputes; and what kind of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is which hath ſucceeded ſo in <hi>England</hi> for the converſion of Souls! If this be not a plain Preaching of Univerſal Redemption or Satitfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to all that hear the Goſpel (whom he requires ſo oft to conſider that <hi>Their</hi> ſins crucified Chriſt) then I know not what is. And if any quirke may be produced to wreſt ſo plain words to a contrary ſenſe; I am ſure the poor ſinners to whom it is Preached know not ordinarily thoſe evaſions, but receive it in the plain ſenſe. I could fill a Volume with the like paſſages as this, out of our moſt powerful and ſucceſsful Preachers.</p>
                  <p>Here then are two diſtinct aggravations of ſin, both neceſſarr to every penitent Soul, both which are denyed by the denyal of Univerſal ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; The firſt is that our ſins killed Chriſt as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of his Death. Is not a man bound to mourn over him whom his ſins have pierced
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59524:97"/>
before he knoweth himſelf to be Elect? How few then of the Elect themſelves ſhould do it? 2. The ſecond aggravation is that all our ſins againſt recovering mercies, are committed againſt him that Died for us: He that denyeth both theſe aggravations of ſin doth not a little wrong Chriſt and mens Souls.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I argue thus; If without thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned aggravations of ſin, no man can truly and ſavingly Repent, then all men are bound thus to aggravate their ſins (in their ſelf accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.) But without theſe there can be no ſaving Repentance, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is proved, in that all men are bound truly to Repentance, even with that which is called Repentance unto Life.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent or <hi>Minor</hi> is proved.</p>
                  <p>1. In that elſe it can be but a Legal Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and not an Evangelical if it be not for ſin as the crucifier of Chriſt, and for ſin as againſt our Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>2. From the deſcription of true Goſpel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced, and mourn over him,</hi> &amp;c. Or if it were proved that there is beſides this a true Repentance foregoing, yet it is but part of that great work, ſeeing this Evangelical Repentance muſt go cloſe with it. And if any ſay tha tmen are bound firſt to believe before they are bound to this evangelical repentance for ſinning againſt the blood of Chriſt. I anſwer. 1. They are bound to both at once; and the Apoſtles preſt both at once on men, <hi>To Repent and Believe.</hi> 2. Moſt Divines make Repentance with Faith to go before Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59524:98"/>
3. Some have writ whole Volumes to prove that it goes before Faith it ſelf. 4. All acknowledge that it goes before aſſurance or knowledge of our Election. And if Chriſt died only for the Elect, then no man could repent of his ſins as that which killed Chriſt. or as againſt his blood, till he firſt knew himſelf to be Elect, and then many true Chriſtians ſhould never ſo repent in this Life, and always the Goſpel Repentance would not only follow Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but even the knowledge of Juſtification: Whereas <hi>Ameſius</hi> and moſt of ours do make it with Faith, go before both Juſtification and Sanctification.</p>

                  <p>If Chriſt have a new Dominion and Empire over all men, grounded (<hi>quoad meritum</hi>) on his redeeming of all, (or ſatisfying for all,) then he did Redeem (or make ſatisfaction for) all: But the Antecedent is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I might have uſed theſe as two diſtinct Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums; but for brevity I will conjoin them, and argue ſpecially a <hi>jure imperii,</hi> which in order of Nature followeth the <hi>jus Dominii,</hi> and is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it: Man being made a rational Creature, there was a neceſſity he ſhould have a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Moral according to his Nature; and God being his Lord and Owner it was therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he ſhould be his Supream Rector: For the right of diſpoſure belongs to him that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Owner, or full Propietary: And Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is part of the diſpoſure of the reaſonable
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59524:98"/>
Creature. So then the <hi>neceſſit as regiminis paſſivè conſiderati,</hi> is founded in the Nature of Man; but the <hi>jus imperii</hi> is founded in the <hi>jure Dominii</hi> (in our preſent caſe.) So that where ever God hath as Redeeemer the <hi>jus imperii,</hi> it is neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate conſequente &amp; Conſequentiae,</hi> that he have the <hi>jus dominii:</hi> And wherever he hath the <hi>jus dominii,</hi> it is neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate Antecedente &amp; conſequentioe</hi> that he have the <hi>jus imperii;</hi> if ſo be that the Creature be capable of Government Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, elſe not; for the <hi>jus</hi> ſuppoſeth that capacity. And therefore Chriſts Dominion is larger than his Empire. I ſtill here take the term [<hi>Domini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As Gods Rectorſhip is founded in his Propriety, ſo his Legiſlation preſuppoſeth his Rectorſhip: So that in natural order he is firſt <hi>Dominns Abſolutus</hi> and then ſecondly, <hi>Rector Supremus;</hi> and then <hi>ex jure imperii,</hi> he is <hi>Legiſlator.</hi> Now God at firſt was owner of the World as Creator, and thence had a right to Govern the World as Creator; and thence made them that perfect Law fitted to the ſtate of a perfect Creature, and expreſſing the perfection of the Creator, Ruler and Law-maker. Upon the breach of this Law, and the ruin of the World thereby, the maker becomes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairer; Chriſt redeemeth the World: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hath firſt a <hi>novum jus Dominii,</hi> a new Propriety in it. 2. <hi>A novum jus imperii,</hi> a new right to Govern it. 3. And hence he is <hi>novus Legiſlator,</hi> he doth make new Laws, even the Laws of Grace and Faith. Now as Gods Creation of all was the ground of his right of Governing of all
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59524:99"/>
and that Right was the ground of his actual Government of all, So Chriſts redeeming of all is the ground of his new Right to Govern all, and that Right is the ground of his actual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And as God had not a propriety in one Man, or a Right to govern him, becauſe he made another Man, but becauſe he made that Man, ſo Chriſt hath not his new propriety in Reprobates or his new Right to govern them, meerly from his redeeming other Men, <hi>viz.</hi> The Elect, but from his redeeming all Men, and them among the reſt: And as God had his <hi>jus imperii</hi> by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over the Rebellions as well as the obedient (for God loſt not his right when <hi>Adam</hi> did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel) ſo hath Chriſt by Redemption his <hi>jus impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii</hi> over Unbelievers, as well as over the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And as, if God had let the World go on, under the meer Regiment of the Law of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would not follow that God would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſave all Men, becauſe he made all (for then the Devils would be ſaved, and none could be damned) ſo under the Adminiſtration of Chriſt according to the Law of Redemption, it will no more follow. that Chriſt will ſave all, becauſe he redeemed all. For Gods Creation had gracious or favourable ends for the Creature, as well as his Redemption: And he might as truly be ſaid to create them to Life, as to Redeem them to Life: Nay, he gave all Men in our firſt Parents actual poſſeſſion of Paradiſe, of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Holineſs and the favour of God, which is Mans happineſs, and yet he permitted them to loſe it: So Redem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion obligeth not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to ſave all the redeemed: nor doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infer their future Salvation. Yet here
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59524:99"/>
is no ground for that charge which is laid on the <hi>Arminians,</hi> to be laid on this Doctrin, <hi>viz.</hi> that then Chriſts Blood might be loſt; for Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees will ſee to that. Gods foreknowledg de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominates the Salvation of the Elect, infallibly certain: His decree of Predeſtination makes their Salvation future: Redemption is a part of the execution of that Decree; and it is (as Creation was) not a part peculiar to the Elect, and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from Salvation, but a general part, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, and laying the neceſſary ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work for the more ſpecial parts of execution.</p>
                  <p>And therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith [whom he foreknew them he did Predeſtinate to be conformed, <hi>&amp;c. And whom he did Predestinate, them he called; whom he called, them he juſtified: And whom he justified, them he Glorified, Rom.</hi> 8. 30.] he never ſaith, [whom he died for, or whom he redeemed them he called, or juſtified or glorified] no more then [whom he Created] ſo that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption as preſuppoſing the Predetermination of Election is an infallible means of attaining the Salvation of the redeemed that were ſo Elect; the infallibility and futurition being not properly from Redemption as ſuch, but from Predeſtination and foreknowledg, and ſo from Redemption as joyned thereto; (that is, from Gods Intention, or purpoſe <hi>de hoc eventu.</hi>) But Redemption doth not preſuppoſe all the redeemed to be Elect by decree, and therefore doth not neceſſarily infer the Salvation of all the redeemed. They do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſorely miſtake that ſuppoſe Redemption hath this for its direct end, <hi>viz.</hi> The Salvation of the redeemed; or that it is its end at all, that all the redeemed ſhall be infallibly, eventually ſaved:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59524:100"/>
But Redemption layeth firſt the ground of Chriſts new Empire, and Adminiſtration to all the World: Upon this groundwork is the whole Government of the World built, and all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial proceeding, and execution at the laſt day: And therefore they that deny Univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion know not what they do: They deny the Foundation of Gods Dominion as Redeemer, and of his new Empire, and Legiſlation, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Redemption now, is neceſſarily Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Condemnation of periſhing Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as well as cauſal of the Salvation of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> In the ſame Sence as one is ſpoken, the other may be ſpoken truly: For if it be ſpoken of Gods Legiſlative Will, or legal ordination, then as it is true that [God by his Law hath made the day of evil, that is, of puniſhment, for wicked Men] or that [God when he had Created Man, ordained by his Law that the wicked ſhould be puniſhed] ſo the ſame may be ſaid of the Redeemed [When he had Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Men, he ordained that all that reject ſo great Salvation ſhall undergo a far ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment] or if the meaning be of Gods Decretive will <hi>de eventu</hi> [God when he made Man, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deſtroy the Non-Elect for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs] ſo it is as true of Redeemed ones [God Redeemer when he Redeemed Man, did intend
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59524:100"/>
to deſtroy the Non-Elect for their rejecting of his mercy] But as it is not the meaning of the Text, that [Mens damnation was Gods end in creating them] (as <hi>Twiſs</hi> hath fully proved) ſo is it not true, that Mens damnation was Chriſts end in Redeeming. It is no effect therefore of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but an accidental conſequent: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſaith he came not into the World to condemn the World, but that the World though him might be ſaved: that is, the Salvation of all was, 1. The end of Chriſts Legiſlative will, that is, the end propounded to Man, 2. And Redemption hath the nature of a means (ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in <hi>ſuo genere</hi>) for all Mens Salvation, and ſo God might be ſaid, not to Create the World that he might condemn it, but that the World through him might be ſaved: Though yet even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually they are not ſaved: Chriſt intended in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Mans Sin, that his ſatisfaction ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that great impediment of their Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> The diſſatisfaction of the offended Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as he was Rector according to the firſt Law: And that it ſhould be the ground of his New Law whereby he gives freely Remiſſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all Men, on condition they will accept himſelf and his benefits with him. So that as it would be intollerable deluſion of Mens Souls, for any Preacher to tell Men, that all that are Created ſhall be ſaved, ſo is it to tell them that are Redeemed (as to the price and ſatisfaction made) ſhall be ſaved: For then when they find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Chriſt died for all, and is a propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they ſhall certainly be ſaved.</p>

                  <p>To proceed to the Argument; It muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that we ſpeak not here of the old right of Dominion and Government, which Chriſt as God Creator and one with the Father, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sin of Man; And then that which I have to prove is 1. That Chriſt hath a new right of Dominion and Government, and that over all Men whatſoever. 2. Yet this right is founded in his work of redemption, and the Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering all to him as in the relation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. 3. That his right to Dominion and rule over all, is not meerly from Redemption of the Elect, but of all, even of each perſon to whom he hath this right.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt, I hope few Chriſtians will deny it, if any do I prove it thus. 1. If Chriſt have not as Redeemer a right to govern all, then he may not make Univerſal Laws for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all, But Chriſt hath made ſuch Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Laws, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> His Laws command all Men every where to repent, and all that hear the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to believe: And promiſe and threaten ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> never heard his Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That reſtriction is <hi>ex parte promulgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> for want of publication, but not <hi>ex parte le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem ferentis</hi> for want of Enacting a Univerſal Law; The Law excludes none in the tenor of it but
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59524:101"/>
commands all to believe without exception. 2. The Officers or Heralds of Chriſt have authority to publiſh it to all the World. 3. Chriſt hath more Laws then the written or publiſhed Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in fulneſs. The diſpenſation of all things by, providential diſpoſal, are Chriſts Law, that is, they are the ſigns and diſcoveries of mercy and Mans duty: They ſhew the World 1. That they are not left under that helpleſs, remedileſs caſe that they were in by the deſert of their own Sin: For the rigid Law of works never allowed to them that had violated it, and were curſed by it, ſo great mercies as all Men now enjoy, and daily find flowing in upon them <hi>â Deo Miſerecorde,</hi> and that to ſuch ends as their repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. 2. Theſe mercies and other works of Chriſt, do ſhew the World the duty of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that the mercies of God lead them to repentance. Now repentance is not here taken for helliſh deſpairing repentance, as the Text plainly ſhews: But for that which hath a tendency to recovery, and is joyned with ſuch a hope as excludeth utter deſpair, and may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage to the uſe of means as means and that which thus revealeth Chriſts mercy and Mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and means, is ſure Chriſts Law.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Arg.</hi> If Chriſt as Redeemer hath not a right to Govern all Men, then he may not command his Meſſengers to go into all the World and preach the Goſpel to every Creature: But he hath ſo commanded them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 15, 16. Where Chriſt hath not Authority to Rule, there he hath not Authority to bid his Meſſenger Rule under him, or publiſh his Laws, or command Men to obey him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:59524:102"/>3. <hi>Arg.</hi> If Chriſt as Redeemer have not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to rule all to whom the Goſpel comes, then all ſuch are not bound to take him for their King and Lord; But all ſuch are bound to take him as their King and Lord, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> (4.) If Chriſt as Redeemer have not right of governing all that hear the Goſpel, then there are no Rebels (for Rebellion is only againſt a rightful Power) nor do they Sin in actual diſobeying him when he commands as Redeemer. But the conſequents are wicked and intollerable, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c. Luke 19. 27. Thoſe mine Enemies that would not I ſhould Reign over them, bring hither and ſlay them before me.</hi> (5.) If Chriſt have not this right over all the World then all the World is not guilty of Sinning againſt him; But all the World is guilty of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the Redeemers Laws, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> They Sin againſt thoſe mercies which lead to repentance (6.) A multitude of plain Texts prove Chriſts Univerſal Dominion and Empire. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. All power is given to me in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 3. All things are delivered unto him of the Father: delivered into his Hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>The Father judgeth no Man; but hath given all judgment to the Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. 8. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9.</p>
                  <p>2. That this Right is founded on Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is proved by all that is ſaid in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Arguments and Texts; and I think few Chriſtians will deny it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>For this end he both died, roſe and revived, that he might be Lord, of the dead and of the living.</hi> If it were the end of his death and reſurrection to obtain this Dominion, then ſurely this Dominion is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59524:102"/>
in that Death and Reſurrection, and belongs to him as a Redeemer, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. he became obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs: Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And that it is not Chriſts dying only for the Elect that is the ground of his Dominion and Empire over all, I prove thus. 1. The Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt and his <hi>Jus Imperii</hi> over the Non-Elect is of the ſame kind with his Dominion and <hi>Jus Imperii</hi> over the Elect, and therefore hath the ſame cauſe. It is not ſuch as his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over Devils or Brutes, as we ſhall further ſhew anon. I ſay not that Chriſt exerciſeth his Imperial power in the ſame way over all, but the relation of <hi>Rex</hi> or <hi>Imperator</hi> which Chriſt hath rightfully over all, is the ſame to all: And the relation of Subjects to Chriſt, which all ſtand in to him <hi>quod debitum veljus,</hi> is the ſame relation; all Men as well as the Elect, to whom his Laws are promulgate, are bound to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg him their King and Lord in the ſame ſence as the Elect are: And are bound to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him as his ſubjects in the ſame ſenſe as the Elect are, and with a ſubjection of the ſame kind: For the New Law which conſtituteth the duty, is general, and diſtinguiſheth not, as to this, between Elect and Non-Elect. 2. It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that Chriſts Blood cannot be <hi>purchaſing</hi> of Dominion or <hi>Empire</hi> immediately, but only <hi>meante virtute ſatisfactoria,</hi> as it is a placament or propitiatory Sacrifice to the offended Majeſty; For were not Chriſts Blood firſt neceſſary to this expiatory uſe, it would be ſo far from being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing or meritorious of any further benefit,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59524:103"/>
that it would not be acceptable to God at all: For he is not bloodthirſty, he takes not pleaſure in the Blood of the innocent, Nay, he is averſe from it. So that Chriſts Death muſt needs be firſt ſatisfactory to Juſtice in order of nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it purchaſe Dominion or <hi>Empire.</hi> Now if he may have this right to a peculiar Dominion and <hi>Empire</hi> over moſt of the World without ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying for them, then either his right over moſt is immediate without flowing from ſatisfaction (which is evidently falſe) or elſe it is founded in his ſatisfaction for others, <hi>viz.</hi> the Elect: And if ſo then why might not he as well have right of Dominion and Empire over the Elect without ſatisfying for them, as over all others without ſatisfying for them? And if ſo, then he might do all that which now he doth as Lord and Rector, without ſatisfaction Antecedent. And if ſo, then he might make his New Law which now he hath made, wherein he Repeals the bondage of Ceremonies and provideth a remedy againſt the curſe, and whereby he gives pardon, and glory to all if they will receive him; But this may not be granted.</p>
                  <p>3. It is alſo proved hence, that Chriſts rule over all Men is founded in his ſatisfaction of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of thoſe ſame Men; becauſe when he is offered to them and they commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, it is in the Relation of Lord Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: All are commanded to take him for their Lord Jeſus Chriſt, no Man is commanded to take him as Lord and King only, and not as Redeemer and Saviour: Nay, our Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make the act of juſtifying Faith to confiſt only in receiving Chriſt as Redeemer or ſatisfier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59524:103"/>
Saviour, as ſaving us by his Blood from guilt; excluding the reception of him as King and Lord from being the juſtifying Act of Faith (wherein yet I am forced as zealouly to contradict them as in almoſt any one point) only they confeſs it is of abſolute neceſſity that Chriſt at the ſame time be received as Lord, when he is received as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Now all Men are bound (that hear the Goſpel) to believe to juſtification, that's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted: And if ſo, then all Men are bound to receive Chriſt as their Lord-Redeemer, and not as Lord to them and Redeemer to others: And if ſo, then doubtleſs Chriſt is their Lord-Redeemer. Now Redemption hath two parts, the firſt is the paying of the Price that is, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by dying for us: The 2d. is, applying or conferring the benefits of that ſatisfaction, by actual delivering or Redeeming from the guilt and power of Sin: The firſt is that chief part of Redemption from whence the whole is chiefly denominated. Now the firſt part is paſt and done whether Men believe or not and is not offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done on any condition, nor to be done for our Sins: Chriſt doth not ſay, I will pay the price of thy Redemption, if thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> take me for thy Redeemer, it is paid already, but it is the 2d. part of Redemption that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on condition. The firſt is general and abſolure: The ſecond is generally given on condition; and ſpecial as to the actual Collation by Chriſt and fruition by Man. So that when Chriſt ſaith to a Man, [take me for thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer] it is as much as to ſay, [take me for one that hath made ſatisfaction for thy Sins and if thou wilt receive me I will pardon and ſave
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59524:104"/>
thee thereby] now if Chriſt did not Redeem Men, by ſatisfying, and yet require them to take him as their Redeemer, then he requires them to take him to be that which he is not, and to have done that which he hath not: For Chriſt cannot be a Redeemer to any Man that he hath not paid the paid the price of Redemption for: Which if it be not done, Faith will not cauſe it to be done, So that it being certain, that the Lordſhip and Empire of Chriſt which he hath right to over all, and which all are commanded to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and ſubmit to, is inſeparably conjoyned with his Redemption, he being offered to no Man as Lord, to whom he is not alſo offerd as Redeemer, it is evident that his <hi>Jus novum Dominii &amp; imperiii,</hi> his new right of propriety and Rule over all Men, doth preſuppoſe his Redeeming all, as to the price and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But if that be ſo, then he Redeemed or died for Bruits, Devils and good Angels: For he hath a Right of Dominion and Rule over theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection, though otherwiſe ſcarce worthy to be taken notice of, hath been ſo enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, yielded to and confidently managed by ſome, that it is become neceſſary to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of its vanity. 1. Chriſt hath not a proper Empire or Rectorſhip over Bruits: For they are not capable of being Subjects of a Kingdom. 2. His Dominion over them is but as they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his ends for Man, and as they are Mans Servants and Utenſils. 3. Chriſt hath not (that I can find in Scripture (any <hi>novum jus Dominii,</hi> any new propriety as Redeemer, in Devils or in good Angels: But having an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59524:104"/>
propriety in them as being their Creator he uſeth them accordingly for his Redemption ends. 4. Nor do I find that he hath purchaſed any new proper abſolute <hi>jus imperii</hi> or Rectorſhip over them, but only a power of uſing them for his Church, and for ſervice about Man he ſhall ſend them on. 5. And therefore I ſay, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Chriſt over Angels is not of the ſame kind with that which he hath over Men, and which we uſe in the Argument to prove that he died for Men. if both ſhould be called by the ſame title of a <hi>novum jus imperii,</hi> yet the difference of the Subjects ſufficeth to ſhew the different Sence of the ſame attribute as ſeverally applied: I find not that Chriſt any where proclaims himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King of Devils or Angels, nor requires them to take him for their King, nor hath made any new Laws to govern them by, as he hath done for Men, nor hath reſtored any forfeited mercy to them, nor offers them pardon of any Sin upon condition of repentance, nor will judg them on ſuch terms. So that if it ſhould be proved that the good Angels are part of his Kingdom as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, yet it would be but as their confirmer, and not as a Redeemer of them: For he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offered to them as a Redeemer, nor did they need any, for ought I know: He took not on him the nature of Angels, but of the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> He is Head over all things, to his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. That is, He is ſuperior to Angels and all things, and hath the diſpoſal of them for his Churches uſe, but he is only Head of his Church <hi>de facto</hi> as to proper Kingly Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the reſt of the World <hi>de jure</hi> who ſhall ſuffer as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels for not acknowledging his Title, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

they would not that he ſhould reign over them, <hi>Luke</hi> 39. 27. But ſo ſhall not Bruits or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; So that the Argument will hold good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A Man would think that thoſe Men that do ſo vehemently contend that Chriſt is the Head of the viſible Church, and the King of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Kingdom which comprehendeth good and bad, ſhould eaſily yield to this Argument.</p>

                  <p>If Chriſt give to all Men thoſe mercies which are the effects of his dying for them, then Chriſt died (or ſatisfied) for all Men: But Chriſt doth give to all Men thoſe mercies which are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his dying for them, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> only requires proof, and here I have theſe three things to prove. 1. That Chriſt giveth mercies to all. 2. That theſe mercies are the effects of his Death and ſatisfaction. 3. That they are the effects of his Death for thoſe Men to whom they are given. For I look to meet with three ſorts of oppoſers. 1. Such as ſay, wicked Men have no mercy (<hi>viz.</hi> The Non-Elect) for all is given them in judgment and wrath, and ſhall but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their condemnation. 2. Such as ſay, They have mercies, but it is from Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providence, and not from Chriſts Blood. 3. Such as ſay, their mercies are from Chriſts Blood, but only as ſhed for the Elect, and not for them.</p>
                  <p>1. For the firſt, It is ſo openly blaſphemous againſt God and his providence, for Men to ſay, that God is merciful to none but the Elect, that one would think no Chriſtian ſhould ever own
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59524:108"/>
ſuch an Aſſertion. 1. If none but the Elect have any mercy from God, then none elſe are obliged by mercy to repentance: But the mercies of God lead others to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. Even thoſe that by hardheartedneſs and impenitency do heap up wrath againſt the day of wrath and Revelation of the righteous judgment of God. 2. Elſe none but the Elect ſhould be obliged to love and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for mercy, which is falſe and wicked. 3. Elſe none but the Elect ſhould be guilty of ſinning againſt mercy, or ſhould need to confeſs any ſuch Sin, or need pardon of ſuch, or can be accuſed, condemned or puniſhed for any ſuch, which are all falſe. 4. Their own words do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute themſelves, for whereas they ſay, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates have no true mercy becauſe all do but encreaſe their condemnation and miſery; It is evident that if they were not real mercies, no Mans condemnation or puniſhment could be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by the abuſe or rejecting of mercy, <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> do well conclude, that Gods mercies muſt not be denied or accounted leſs becauſe wicked Men yet periſh through their abuſe of them.</p>
                  <p>2. And that theſe mercies are the effects of Chriſts Blood and ſatisfaction, is proved thus. 1. Of ſome of them it is expreſly affirmed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. [hath counted the Blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified an Unholy thing] 2. God cannot according to the tenor of the Covenant of Works (<hi>voluntate ſaltem ordinatâ</hi>) give Men ſo much mercy as they all receive: For that Covenant curſeth them, and ſentenceth them to Death, and leaveth no proper mercy, at leaſt none that hath a conducibility to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and recovery: Dare any Man think that all the mercies temporal, and the offers of Chriſt and Grace, and the Word and other means, and the common gifts of the Spirit, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal pardon of the Non-Elect, and the patience, and long-ſuffering of God inviting and beſeeching them to be reconciled to him, promiſing them Life and Glory if they will believe, that all theſe are given according to the Law of Works? If not, then it muſt be according to the Law of Grace and the New Covenant, or according to no Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the former, then none will queſtion, I think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it muſt come from Chriſts Blood: For the New Law and Teſtament is founded in his Blood,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59524:109"/>
and Sealed by it: If the later, then at leaſt the Law of Works muſt be firſt relaxed, and they ſo far pardoned, ſeeing according to that Law they ſhould have lived, not among theſe mercies, but in miſery: And Scripture aſſures us, that it was the Blood of Chriſt that delivered us from the Curſe of the Law, and that on the Croſs he took down the hand writing that was againſt us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And without his ſuffering there is no Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws obligation. They that ſet open ſo wide a door of mercy to all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Jeſus Chriſt, do not lightly wrong him and do dangerouſly deceive themſelves and others: I am ſure Chriſt will expect repentance, thanks and obedience for theſe mercies, and condemn Men for not improving theſe Talents which he committed to them; however Men may now tell Sinners that all comes but from common providence and not by the Blood of Chriſt. 3. Yea, that which they call common providence is the diſpoſal of things by the Redeemer: For all things are delivered to him of the Father, and all power given him and to that end he died, roſe and revived that he might be Lord of the Dead and Living: And therefore if Men have any mercy now, it muſt come through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers Hands, and conſequently is a fruit of his Blood. But this will yet further be proved in the next which is.</p>
                  <p>3. That it is Chriſts dying for thoſe ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom he gives theſe mercies, that is the ground of them: And this further is proved thus. 1. Some of the mercies given are ſuch as could no other way be procured and given, as is ordinarily granted: Such as are, the Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59524:110"/>
Juſtification, Adoption, and gift of Chriſt himſelf on condition that Men will accept them; Chriſt given as Redeemer ſuppoſeth his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to paying of the price to be paſt; With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blood there is no Remiſſion neither conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal not abſolute (as is proved in the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:) But a conditional Remiſſion to all, is given in the New Teſtament, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The Remiſſion alſo of their puniſhment for the time of this Life, or at leaſt of ſo much of it, is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al (though not plenary) Remiſſion, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men partake of that; Of one of theſe two Chriſts ſpeaks in the parable of the ungrateful unmerciful Servant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 27. 32. 35. [<hi>The Lord of that Servant was moved with compaſſion, and looſed him, and forgave him the debt, &amp;c.</hi> His Lord ſaid, O thou wicked Servant, I forgave thee all that debt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe ſhall my Heavenly Father do alſo by you, if ye from your Hearts forgive not every one his Brother their Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes.] But of this Text more hereafter. So that God doth remit to the Non-Elect moſt of the temporal puniſhment of their Sin actually, and all the Eternal puniſhment conditionally. That he remitteth the temporal puniſhment, is further proved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 38. [<hi>But he being full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for gave their iniquity and deſtroyed them not: Yea many a time turned he his anger away and did not ſtir up all his wrath</hi>] He that reads out the reſt of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> will not believe that all theſe diſſembling <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Elect. So for the legal forgiveneſs of Sin upon the uſe of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, See <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 26, 31, 35. and 5. 10, 13, 16, 18. and 6. 7, and 19, 22. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 25, 26, 28. <hi>It ſhall be forgiven all the Congregation of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59524:110"/>
Children of Iſrael,</hi> and the Stranger that ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth among them, ſeeing all the People were in ignorance] but all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not Elect, <hi>Numb. 14. 19. Pardon I beſeech thee the iniquity of this People, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy, and as thou haſt forgiven this People, from Egypt, even until now. 20. And the Lord ſaid I have pardoned according to thy Word, Dev. 21. 8. Pſal. 85. 2. Iſa.</hi> 40. 2. So the Example of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the <hi>Ninevites, &amp;c.</hi> Shew clearly: For that which God did in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in reſpect to their humiliation, was ſome kind of Remiſſion. 2. And further I prove it as by theſe expreſs Texts of Scripture, ſo by this Scripture reaſon: Either God remitteth much of the temporal puniſhment, or elſe he ſhews them no mercy: (And conſequently they are not beholden to him, nor owe him any thanks) but God doth ſhew them mercy, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> He that remitteth none of the puniſhment due, ſheweth no mercy, in this caſe: And he that ſheweth mercy remitteth part of the puniſhment, for it was part of the puniſhment to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the mercies which wicked Men enjoy: Who dare once imagine, that Health, Strength, Friends, Liberty, Peace, Riches, Honour, Food, Raiment, Houſes, Accommodations, Cattel, all Creatnres to ſerve us, Publick Peace, Sun, Rain, Fruits of the Earth, proſpering of our Labours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Knowledg, Parts, Motions of the Spirit, excellent means, and offers of Grace, Godly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and Examples, Admonitions, Taſt of the good word of God and the powers of the World co come, Illumination, Partaking of the Holy Ghoſt, working Miracles, caſting out Devils, hearing the word with joy, believing for a time,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59524:111"/>
clean eſcaping the pollutions of the World by the knowledg of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to be ſanctified with the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to be loved of Chriſt (as the man was <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 21.) to have the eaſieſt place in Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who dare ſay that none of all theſe are Mercies? Or that the enjoyment of theſe may ſtand with the full execution of the ſentence of the Law? If the Curſe lay in the deprivation of theſe, then the enjoyment of them is a remiſſion of that curſe or Penalty: But <hi>&amp;c. Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> read <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>Now that this Remiſſion is granted to none, but by virtue of Chriſts dying for him, I will now but refer you to the whole multitude of Reformed Divines, in their Writings againſt the Papiſts about Purgatory, Indulgences, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Satisfactions, where they argue with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Zeal, and many Arguments, that temporal puniſhments are remitted only for Chriſt's Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: even the ſame men that deny Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Satisfaction; not remembring how this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth their own cauſe. The reaſon, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is, that here the evidence of truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth them; but in the denial of Univerſal Redemption, they conſtrain themſelves to it, meerly becauſe they have not found out the way of reconciling Univerſal Satisfaction, with Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Predeſtination, and therefore think they are neceſſitated to deny the former (though againſt the clear light of many expreſs Texts of Scripture) for fear of contradicting the later.</p>

Is not puniſhment due to them both in this Life and that to come? And therefore to remit one is true remiſſion. 2. No Scripture intimateth that God will lay ſo much the more on them in Hell, meerly becauſe he puniſhed them not more on Earth, but for their abuſe of Mercy on Earth. 3. Doth not Chriſt himſelf expreſly ſpeak of not forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin in this life or that to come? 4. Many have ſo much remiſſion here, as tends to the great abatement of their everlaſting torments: for Chriſt gives them that freedom from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and ſuch means, and common Grace, as brings them to be almoſt Chriſtians, and almoſt Saved, and ſuch as the man whom he is ſaid to have loved, and ſaid to him, <hi>thou art not far from the Kingdom of God.</hi> Whereas doubtleſs the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous execution of the Curſe of the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that men be wholly forſaken of God, as to any ſuch Grace or Mercy, and conſequently given up to the prevalency of their own Luſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:59524:112"/>And it is a doubt whether they that make all this Remiſſion and Mercy to the Non-Elect, to befal them without the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, do not wrong Chriſt ſomewhat more than the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves (who in their vile Doctrine of Satisfaction and Indulgence) do aſcribe all to Chriſt radically and remotely, and to man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; ſaying that for temporal puniſhments Chriſt ſatisfieth in and by man, to whom he hath procured that power by his own immediate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Theſe give Chriſt ſome part of the honour, but the other none at all.</p>
                  <p>And that a conditional remiſſion of the eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is given in the Goſpel to the Non-Elect, under Gods hand, is ſo plain, that he that knows it not, knows not the plain tenour of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if it be ſaid that all this can be given to the Non-Elect without Chriſts ſatisfying for them, then it would follow that it may be given to the Elect alſo without Chriſts ſatisfying for them, but all our Divines call that Impious and blaſphemous (in their diſputes againſt Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Indulgences, and humane Satisfactions.) Nay mark well, that the ſame conditional deed of Gift of Chriſt and his Benefits, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to Unbelievers, becauſe they perform not the condition, is the ſame that becomes effectual to the Juſtification and Adoption of Believers, and that without any new additional real act of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Satisfaction for one man will not ſerve to the remitting of any part of the Debt of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that I may conclude that Chriſt ſatisfied for All, ſeeing all receive the fruits of that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.

                  <p>The Conſequence of the Major Propoſition I prove thus: The Law of Works, as given to man in Innocency, required nothing that was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for man in that ſtate to do: But (if Chriſt ſatisfied not for all) the Law of Grace ſhould require Impoſſibilities, and condemn men for want of them, and ſo ſhould contain much harder terms than the Law of Works; Yea the Law of Works as given to fallen man (if ſo it were) contained nothing contradictory, and ſo impoſſible in it ſelf, though man through ſin was diſabled to perform it: But the Law of Grace, ſhould, if this Doctrine oppoſed were true. If the Law of Grace require men to take him for their Redeemer, and reſt on him as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that never redeemed them, it ſhould contain a contradiction. If according to this Law, men muſt be everlaſtingly condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not receive him as their Lord-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that never paid for them any price of Redemption; and becauſe they did not receive and apply to themſelves the effects and benefits of a ſatisfaction, which was never made for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo could not poſſibly be a cauſe of ſuch effects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe they did not reſt on Chriſt to Juſtifie and Save them by his Blood which was never ſhed for them; theſe are impoſſibilities, and far harder terms than thoſe of the Law of Works. Yea, if when man is already condemned, the Law of Grace ſay, that he ſhall undergo a far ſorer puniſhment, and it ſhall be eaſier for <hi>Sodom</hi>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:59524:113"/>
and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in the day of Judgment than him, except he will do theſe impoſſibilities, this is ſtill harder. It is not all the believing in the World (ſuppoſing it were performed) that would make Chriſts Death, which is paſt, to be ſuffered for thoſe that it was not ſuffered for. This makes Chriſt to come into the World to condemn the World, and that to a far ſorer puniſhment than the Law of Works did oblige them to, without procuring them any poſſibility of eſcaping; For there's no poſſibility of that mans eſcape, for whom no price of Redemption is paid. Nay it lays an abſolute neceſſity <hi>ab extra,</hi> and unavoidable, on men of periſhing under this double damnation. For he that before I am born makes a Law, that I ſhall dye except I have part in a payment that was made 1000 years ago and that only for others and not at all for me, he doth neceſſitate my Death by that Law: For it is impoſſible that I ſhould ever have part in it, if it were not paid for me. Now I know our Divines ſpeak of Gods neceſſitating mans Damnation by Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and Decree, which they call only <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas Antecedentis, non Cauſae:</hi> But who ever affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Chriſt in giving the New Law [<hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned</hi>] did neceſſitate and that Cauſally, and that <hi>Antecedenter ad Culpam,</hi> the far greater damnation of miſerable wretches that were condemned already.</p>

His ſervice is a reaſonable ſervice: His Commandments are not grievous: His tender mercy is over all his Works. He is kind to the unthankful and unjuſt. His mercies lead men to Repentance: He delighteth not in the death of him that dyeth but rather that he Repent and Live: He calleth all men every where to repent and ſeek after God: All the day long doth he ſtretch out his hand to a froward and gain-ſaying generation: He deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not with us after our ſins: He inviteth the Non Elect to the Wedding Feaſt and telleth them that all things are ready: and ſome of them he compelleth to come in: as he did him that had not on the Wedding Garment: he chargeth his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to beſeech men in his ſtead to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God: He would gather under his Wings even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens, thoſe that Will not be gathered. All theſe with a multitude the like, are the Scripture expreſſions, of Gods gentle and merciful dealing with men under the Law of Grace. And ſo much of the execution as we ſee is anſwerable.

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 20. A Legis Moſaicae Abrogatione.</head>
                  <p>If all men (that were any way under it) are freed by the blood of Chriſt, from the Bondage of the Moſaical Law of Ceremonies, then Chriſt died for All ſuch, (and conſequently not only for the Elect:) But the Antecedent is certain. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Divines ſay, that All the World were thus far ſubject to the Jewiſh Law, that they could not be ſaved without knowing it, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it in obedience, becauſe God had then no other Church nor ſtabliſhed way of Worſhip. If this be true, then all the World hath a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Abrogation of that Law. Others ſay, that it obliged only the Jews and Proſelites; and that others at the remoteſt diſtance ſhould not have been obliged by that Law, if they had known it. If that be ſo, then it was only the Jews and Proſelytes (ſuch as had opportunity to incorporate with them, or joyn to them) that had this deliverence. However, it is evident it was to all the Jews, and ſo to more than the Elect: and then almoſt all the Arguments againſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Satisfaction are hereby overthrown, for they are built on this, that Chriſt died only for the Elect.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt prove, 1. That <hi>Moſes</hi> Ceremonial Law is abrogate. 2. That it was done by the ſhedding of Chriſt's Blood for thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. 3. That it is abrogated to All.</p>
                  <p>1. And for the firſt, it is ſo generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and the Scripture ſo expreſs in it, (ſpecially <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and all the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi>)
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59524:115"/>
that I may ſpare that labour, only ſome doubt whether the Moral Law as part of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law be abrogate. But as long as we acknowledge. 1. That the ſame Moral Law ſtandeth as it was part of Chriſt's New Law (which moſt confeſs) 2. And alſo as part of the Law of Works or Nature given to <hi>Adam</hi> (as moſt think) we need not much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the former; Though I think that all <hi>Moſes</hi> Law is Abrogated. 1. Becauſe the Matter cannot ſtand as part of that Law when the Form ceaſeth (for with the form, the eſſence and name is gone) and moſt (if not all) confeſs that the form of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law (as it is ſpecifically diſtinct from the Law of Grace) is abrogated. 2. The Apoſtle expreſly ſaith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 11.) that [The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of death, written and engraven in Stones, was glorious (and that was only the Decalogue) ſo that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſtedfaſtly behold the Face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the glory of his Countenance, which was to be done away. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious] ſome ſay, it was the Glory and not the Law that was done away, but it was not the glorious which <hi>ver.</hi> 11. is called glorious, but the Law, from the manner of delivery, and therefore it was not the Glory only, but the Law that is done away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But it was only the manner of delivery then that is done away, and not the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That was a tranſient act, and ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the time, and was not done away by Chriſt. The Moral Law therefore as part of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law is abrogated, becauſe it is impoſſible the matter
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59524:116"/>
ſhould remain without the Form, as part of that <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> But the ſame Moral Law is in force as much as ever, as it is the matter of another <hi>Compoſitum, viz.</hi> the Law of Chriſt proper to the Goſpel times. The Law is in force ſtill <hi>quae fuit materia Legis Moſaicae; ſed non quâ materia Legis Moſaicae.</hi> But for this, if any think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I will not contend with them. It ſufficeth to my preſent purpoſe that it is granted that the Law of Ceremonies is abrogated. And that this Law was a burden and bondage is plain; even ſuch as the Church was not able to bear, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. &amp; 21. &amp; 4. 21. &amp; 5. 3. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. And that it was Chriſts dying for men, that freed them from the Law, is proved <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. When we were Children we were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under the Elements of the World, but when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent his Son, made of a Woman, made under the <hi>Law,</hi> to <hi>Redeem them</hi> that were under the Law &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. Chriſt hath Redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. Blotting out the hand writing of Ordinances which was againſt us, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15, 16. But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt, for he is our peace who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle Wall of Partition between us: having aboliſhed in his Fleſh the enmity, even the Law of Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, contained in Ordinances, for to make in himſelf of twain one new man, ſo making Peace.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59524:116"/>
And that he might reconcile both unto God in one Body, by the Croſs, having ſlain the Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereby.</p>
                  <p>3. And for the 3d. point that Chriſt hath abrogated <hi>Moſes</hi> Law to all, Elect and Non-Elect without difference, is evident, in that all are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to keep it: And that which is abrogated is abrogate to all, becauſe the Word ſignifieth the total nulling of it, and deſtroying of its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and that which is not, doth not bind. 1. Elſe the Non-Elect <hi>Jews</hi> (at leaſt) ſhould ſtill be bound to offer all the Sacrifices, and uſe all the Ceremonies preſcribed by the Law: But I never yet heard or read any Divine Preaching ſuch Doctrin, and I hope never ſhall do. He that reads, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and the <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to the <hi>Gal.</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> ſure will not believe it to be true Doctrin, if he underſtand what he readeth. 2. Nay the very curſe is ſo far taken away for all, that it now lyeth not on them as the unremedied curſe of the Law, but is put into the power of the Lord-Redeemer, who hath by the tenour of his Teſtament or New Law, taken it away from all Men, on condition they will accept him: And this may be ſaid alſo of the Law of Works as given to <hi>Adam;</hi> So that he that ſaith, Chriſt died only for the Elect, muſt needs ſay, (<hi>I</hi> think, if he will not contradict himſelf) that all the Non Elect muſt turn <hi>Jews,</hi> and be circumciſed, and keep all the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And conſequently that all the Elect themſelves muſt do ſo, till God aſſure them that they are Elect and ſo that Chriſt died for them, Becauſe they cannot avoid the duty upon a ground that is wholly to them unknown.</p>

                  <p>If the whole or main work of the Preachers of the Goſpel do ſuppoſe Chriſts Univerſal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as its ground, then Chriſt hath ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for all: But the Antecedent is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo is the conſequent.</p>
                  <p>It is only the Antecedent of the Major propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that requires proof. To which end let us enumerate the parts of the Work of Preaching: And the enumeration is to be taken from the enumeration of the parts of the New Law, for that is the ſubject which we muſt preach of: Now the Law, is, firſt a Declaration of the Occaſion, or Narration of the matter of Fact, as an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the more eſſential parts. 2. Thoſe parts themſelves which are 1. The precept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting duty: To which I joyn the prohibition, as one part of it, being but <hi>preceptum de non agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> 2. The conſtitution of the <hi>debitum premii vel beneficii.</hi> 1. By an abſolute promiſe. 2. By a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſe or gift. 3. The conſtitution of the condition as ſuch. 4. The conſtitution of the <hi>debitum Poenae,</hi> by the threatning. This much <hi>quoad materiam.</hi> And then <hi>quoad finem,</hi> the Preacher muſt manage all theſe. 1. To the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of God for the great work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. For the winning of Souls to Chriſt, and confirming them in the Faith: This is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Work.</p>
                  <p>Now. 1. For the Narration or Declarative part of the Goſpel, which is matter of Aſſent; I have already ſhewed that if his Univerſal ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59524:117"/>
be not declared, the main part is left out, that ſhould honour the Redeemer; and there is nothing declared that can groundedly encourage a Sinner to believe, and reſt on Chriſt as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Saviour. 2. The precept is, that Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt and reſt on him as their Redeemer, for juſtification by his Blood: And the contrary unbelief and diſtruſt is forbidden. Now what ground can a Miniſter have to preſs all Men to believe in Chriſt as their Redeemer, when they know he redeemed but the ſmalleſt part? Or to charge them to reſt on his Blood for Remiſſion, when he knows it was ſhed for the ſmaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and will profit none but thoſe whom it was ſhed for? Yea how can he urge any to reſt on Chriſt at all? For till they know they are Elect, they know not that Chriſt died for them (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the oppoſed Doctrin: And till they know that Chriſt died for them, they cannot reſt on him as their Redeemer, nor on his Blood as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to procure their pardon, ſeeing (as is confeſſed) it is but materially and not formally ſufficient, to pardon them if they ſhould believe. And they cannot know that they are Elect or that Chriſt died for them, till they reſt on him: And therefore I ſee not how any Miniſter can preſs Men groundedly to reſt on Chriſt, by a juſtifying Faith, or to accept him as their Lord-Redeemer. And then for the duties of repentance, Love and Thankfulneſs to Chriſt for redeeming them, I have ſhewed before how this Doctrin evacuates them all, and ſo that no Miniſter can groundedly preſs them. 3. And for the promiſe, how can any Miniſter in Chriſts Name aſſure a ſinner of pardon by that Blood which was never ſhed for
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59524:118"/>
him, on condition he will believe. As if you ſhould ſay to a Debtor, believe that ſuch a Man hath paid thy debt or truſt him, and then thy debt ſhall be diſcharged, when you know he hath not paid it, or know not that he hath? Indeed a Man may come off with ſome kind of truth in his words, if he certainly know that the Party will not believe. But the certain knowledg that Men will not believe, is not the reaſon why God calls them to believe, and offers them Chriſt and Life. 4. And for the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with what Heart can a Miniſter tell Sinners, [Chriſt is a Redeemer but to the Elect, yet all the reſt of you ſhall periſh for not taking him for your Redeemer, and for not reſting on that Blood that was never ſhed for you.] And that as to the ends of preaching. 1. How will the divulging of theſe, glorify God? When he hath purpoſely deſigned the glorifying of Love and Mercy directly, and juſtice accidentally, by this great work of the Redemption of the World; and hath unhinged the Sabbath which was for Commemoration of the work of Creation, to the firſt day of the Week for the Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Work of Redemption, which he will now have admired as his moſt glorious work, which (as <hi>Ameſ.</hi> in the place cited in Argument 18. ſaith) is to the works of Grace the ſame that Creation is to the works of Nature, and ſo is the ground of Gods New Right of Dominion and Empire, and of his governing and judging the World: And how is this glory eclipſed by the oppoſed Doctrin? 2. And for Mans Conveſiron to the Faith, I have ſhewed how unfurniſhed a Miniſter is, rightly to endeavour it on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59524:118"/>
grounds. Whereto let me add this: The Soul is never cloſed to Chriſt ſincerely, till it cloſe in Love: (Love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eing, as all Divines ſay, at the ſame moment of time as Faith, produced: And as <hi>Maccovius</hi> before-cited truly ſaith (and ſo doth <hi>Chamier</hi> and many more) Love to the Redeemer the object of Faith, is of the Eſſence of juſtifying Faith it ſelf.) Now it is Love that muſt cauſe Love, I mean objectively, and not only <hi>efficienter.</hi> He cannot cloſe in Love with Chriſt that knoweth nothing of Chriſts Love to him, though he know it to others, (ſo near is Man to himſelf; and Chriſt is to be received as my Redeemer, and not only as another Mans.) Now no Man can know that Chriſt loveth him with a ſpecial love, before he know that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loveth Chriſt (that's paſt queſtion.) And yet no Man can ſoundly love Chriſt as Redeemer, that knows not Chriſts love to him: What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore but that it muſt be Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon love in redeeming the World, and making the conditional gift of pardon and Life, and this offered to me in particular among others, that muſt firſt cauſe my grounded love to Chriſt. Let us ſee what Scripture ſaith of the ground of Miniſterial duties, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. The work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters was to invite the Gueſts, and compel them to come in: And the ground was, all things are ready: Elſe might not the Gueſts have ſaid. [If we ſhould come, there is nothing for us, we may go as we come You do but take this advantage to jeer us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know our minds that we will not come] 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20. The work of Preachers is, the Miniſtry of teconciliation: And wherein lies it? <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Now then we are Embaſſadors for
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59524:119"/>
Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye Reconciled to God,</hi> ſo then the work of the Miniſtry is, to beſeech Men in Chriſts ſtead and Gods name to be reconciled to God. But on what ground is this? <hi>verſe</hi> 19, 21. <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf not imputing their Treſpaſſes to them, and hath committed to us the word of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi> (which Text we ſhall afterwards further explain and vindicate.) Is there not an abſolute neceſſity that the price of Reconciliation be firſt paid to God and accepted by him, before any Sinner can be intreated to be reconciled to God on the ground of that price paid and accepted? Let me deſire Miniſters ſeriouſly to conſider, with what Face they can ſtand up in the name of the Lord Jeſus to beſeech poor Sinners to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, and tell them that elſe they ſhall be doubly miſerable, when yet there is no price paid for making them way to God, nor Gods juſtice ſatisfied for their Sin, which is ſuppoſed before any of their own endeavours can do any thing towards Reconciliation. Let me imagine ſuch a Dialogue as this between ſuch a Teacher and a Sinner?</p>
                  <p>Miniſter, <hi>Sinner I beſeech thee in Chriſts ſtead be reconciled to God.</hi>

                     <hi>Sinner,</hi> Did you not tell me he ſatisfied only for the Elect, and that determined by name? Either
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59524:119"/>
he hath ſatisfied for me before I believe or not? if not my believing will not ſatisfie, nor cauſe him to do it now. If he have, how ſhall I know it?</p>
                  <p>Min. <hi>You muſt believe firſt, and then you ſhall know it afterwards: For God hath ordained inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble connexion between Chriſts dying for Men, and their believing: And therefore for all my beſeeching you to believe, if you be not one that Chriſt died for, you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will nor can believe, for none is able but thoſe for whom he purchaſed it: But if you can believe it will be a ſign to you</hi> ab effectu <hi>that Chriſt died for you.</hi>

                     <hi>Sinner,</hi> Alas! Then all that are not redeemed (and I, if I be one of them) are far worſe then hopeleſs and remedileſs: For they have neither any price paid for them, nor any one hath redeemed them, nor are they able, nor can be able to believe, and yet their torment muſt be multiplied for ever becauſe they did not believe, and take him for their redeemer that never paid one farthing of their debt: But what is it that you would have me believe?</p>

                  <p>Only the <hi>Minor</hi> requires proof, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Major is evident: For he that hath no expiatory Sacrifice or ſatisfaction made for his Sin, is left utterly remedileſs: To ſay, he is not remedileſs, becauſe Chriſt is offered him, is but to deride him, while they ſay withal, that he is offered only an intereſt in the ſatisfaction that was never made for him, that ſo by not believing as by a ſign he might manifeſt that it was not made for him, and ſo that Chriſt did not purchaſe him Faith; And can the Devils be left worſe then remedileſs.</p>
                  <p>Now that Chriſt hath not left the Non-Elect as remedileſs as the Devils appears. 1. Chriſt ſpeaketh of his coming into the World and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his office, as having ſuch ends to all Men, as they had not to the Devils, as he was the 2d. <hi>Adam,</hi> and took on him our nature and not the nature of Angels; ſo he never ſaith that he came into the World to ſave Devils, but he ſaith that he came into the World, <hi>not to judg the World but to ſave the World,</hi> of whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth unbelievers to be part <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 47. 48.

Giving Chriſt (though but on condition of acceptance to any one,) implieth and preſuppoſeth, giving him on the Croſs for them. God entreateth wicked Men daily to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt that they may live, but he never did ſo by the Devils.

So that I may well conclude, that the Doctrin is not ſound which makes Chriſt to have died no more to expiate the Sins of the Non-Elect, then of the Devils but left them equally remedileſs: But ſuch is the Doctrin now oppoſed, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>If Chriſt Died not for all, (that hear the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) then Gods dealing with the Non-elect part of fallen Man is much harder than his dealing with the Devils, but the Conſequent is falſe, therefore ſo is the Antecedent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I think I need not prove, all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it that ever I heard or read, on this ſubject: If they ſhould think that God dealt alike with the Non-elect and the Devils, yet ſure none will ſay that he deals far hardlier with the Non-elect: Hell is prepared for the Devil and his Angels, they are reſerved in Chains of Darkneſs

                  <p>And for the Conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, I prove it thus; by comparing both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. When the Devils had fallen from their firſt eſtate, God leaves them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy or hope of recovery. But when man is fallen, (according to the Doctrine which I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) God doth not only leave him remedileſs but alſo makes a new Law that ſhall oblige him to ſuffer a far ſorer puniſhment, except he will believe in a Redeemer that is not his Redeemer, and truſt for ſalvation to that Blood that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhed for him, and accept the benefits of a ſatisfaction that was never made for him, even effects without a cauſe: Yea and cauſeth his Son to make a ſatisfaction materially ſufficient for the ſins of all; and yet had rather it were ſuperfluous and vain, and meerly loſt, then that it ſhould be paid for him: As if he would rather when three Men owe 100 <hi>l.</hi> a piece, pay 300 <hi>l.</hi> for one of the three, than the other 200 <hi>l.</hi> ſhould be tendred for the reſt; And when he knows that Chriſt never ſatisfied for any of the Non-elect, yet doth he follow them with daily ſollicitations by his Word, Spirit and Embaſſadors, beſeeching them to come in and accept of Chriſt, ordaining and reſolving that all theſe beſeechings, ſhall harden them, or at leaſt aggravate their ſin and and miſery, that it may be eaſier with <hi>Sodom</hi> and

                     <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in the day of Judgment than with them that refuſe theſe Offers. And thus Chriſt ſhall neceſſitate them cauſally by his Law to a far greater torment, as if their miſery were not ſad enough before without procuring them any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of eſcape, (for there is no ſuch poſſibility without ſatisfaction to God's juſtice,) If God ſhould make a Law, that the Devils who are miſerable already, ſhould have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If then this would be harder dealing with them, than thoſe are hardlier uſed than the Devils with whom God ſo deals, and therefore he dealeth ſo with none.</p>

                  <p>And for the minor, its evident in each part. 1.

And that it is an unavoidable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59524:123"/>
appears, 1, In that God made the Law whether Man will or not, Man could not hinder that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. And it is an impoſſibility which the Law is feigned to require: To accept a Redeemer that never Redeemed them, to reſt on a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for their juſtification and pardon which is no ſatisfaction, for as to them it is none: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maintain'd by them whom I oppoſe, that it is none, and that it is only materially ſufficient, that is, matter (of ſuffering) ſufficient to have made a ſatisfaction if God would; but not formally ſufficient; that is, indeed it is no price or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (as to their debt) at all; for if my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and I owe each of us 20 <hi>l.</hi> he that pays his debt, though he over-pay, doth no more thereby to the diſcharge of mine, than if he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. I have proved before, that here is no ſufficient ground for that faith, ſuppoſing Chriſt ſatisfied not for the Believer. And even thoſe whom I argue againſt, will not endure to have it ſuppoſed that any Man ſhould believe for whom Chriſt dyed not. Or if they will let us ſppoſe ſuch a thing, then it is undeniable that ſuch a Man would be never the more pardoned or ſaved, becauſe there is no Salvation withont a Saviour, and no Remiſſion without ſatisfaction: And as in thoſe that are pardoned and ſaved, the efficacy of Chriſt's ſatisfaction is before all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of any power or ſncceſs of Man's Faith: So in thoſe that periſh (if they had no price of ſatisfaction paid for them) the want of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer would be the firſt want, concluding their damnation and non-deliverance from former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and the want of Faith could be but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary conſequential want, which Faith if it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59524:124"/>
were preſent would not ſatisfie or ſave, no more than believing now would ſave the Devils. And thus it is evident that on the grounds oppoſed, the Goſpel would cauſally <hi>per <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now for the Minor (that the Goſpel is not ſo,) I prove from Scripture; it is called the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Kingdom of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>The Conſequence of the Major propoſition is plain, in that the ſtate of all men that Chriſt dyed not for muſt needs be utterly hopeleſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs, for there is no other ſatisfaction to be hoped for beſides that made by the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and that is nothing to them, nor is there any hope or poſſibility that ever they ſhould have part in a ſatisfaction that is no ſatisfaction for them; without blood there is no remiſſion: If they ſhould believe, and repent, and pray for mercy night and day, it would be but as the Rich Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in Hell pray'd for a drop of water, all in vain,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59524:125"/>
for betwixt God and them is ſo great a gulf or diſtance by ſin, that nothing without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer can do them any good, as to the leaſt hope of Salvation. If you ſay, it is not to be ſuppoſed that they can believe, repent, and pray, I anſwer, that is (in your own ſenſe) becauſe it is ſuppoſed they are not redeemed, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of their not repenting and believing ſhews the more fully the impoſſibility of their Salvation. And the reaſon why they do not actually deſpair, is not becauſe they have any more remedy than the Damned, or cauſe to hope; but only becauſe they are yet ignorant of the hopeleſneſs of their own Condition, and as ſoon as they know the truth they will fully deſpair. So that there is no more poſſibility that a Man for whom Chriſt dyed not ſhould be pardoned or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, than that the Damned ſhould, for both are equally impoſſible; If any ſay that God can find out another remedy beſides and without Chriſts ſatisfaction, though he will not, and therefore it is not impoſſible.

                  <p>And for the Minor, (that the ſtate of moſt men even in the Church, is not ſo hopeleſs, deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and remedileſs as is the caſe of the Damned) I prove it thus.

God offers them pardon and Salvation, but God offers no other Pardon or Salvation but what is purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſt's Blood: He that tells us there neither is nor can be any other Remiſſion or Salvation, but what Chriſt purchaſeth, will not offer any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to men, and urge them to accept it, yea, Pardon and Life (as purchaſed by Chriſt) are in Gods deed of gift, together with Chriſt himſelf,

Is all this ſo with thoſe in Hell? Chriſt is neither given, nor Pardon and Life offered to them; they are not commanded to repent and believe to this end, that they may be juſtified and ſaved: But thoſe on Earth are, and therefore their Pardon and Salvation is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for God will not command them to ſeek or to accept of an impoſſibility, and then Condemn them for not ſeeking and not accepting it. If the Damned could repent or believe, it would not ſave them, but it would ſave them on Earth. Nor is their belief it ſelf ſuch an impoſſibility, as is the Damneds believing. Moreover, Chriſt ſaith now, how oft would I have gathered you? But he would not gather the Damned. God would have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, but he ſaith not that he would have the Damned to be ſaved. This Life is called the day of their Viſitation, the day of grace, the acceptable time, the day of Salvation; and they are called on to hear the voice of God, <hi>to day, while it is called to day, and not to harden their hearts, leaſt he ſwear in his wrath that they ſhall not enter into his reſt;</hi> that is, leaſt their caſe become deſperate, and their Salvation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, therefore it was not ſo before.

is impoſſible to renew them by repentance, who tread under foot the blood of the Covenant, and do deſpight to the Spirit of Grace, implying, that before it was not impoſſible; and alſo that they might have had (if they had not) a ſhare in that blood and that Spirit. They have a promiſe left them of entring into his reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4 1. and a Salvation proclaimed to them, and if they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, it will be for neglecting ſo great Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2. They are invited to come in becauſe all things are ready; they are commanded to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near: None of this is ſo with the Damned, God is not near them, nor may be found of them, nor have they any day of Grace, Viſitation or Salvation, where the word is preached, it is [that they might be ſaved,] 1 <hi>Theſ. 2. 16.

Why do we intreat them to be reconciled to God? Do we not tell them daily (and truly) that yet there is time, yet there is hope, and adviſe them to take

We beſeech them that they receive not the Grace of God in vain: for behold, now is the accepted time: behold, now is the day of Salvation.

I have proved before that theſe Talents are Grace (<hi>i. e. Miſerecordiae contra meritum, effectus</hi>) and procured by Chriſts ſatisfaction, and not given without Chriſts ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence therefore of the <hi>Major</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is evident. For ſhall any man dare, (without better proof) to affirm that Chriſt will ſit as Lord-Redeemer in Judgment, and condemn moſt of the World to everlaſting flames, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing a Redeemer that was not their Redeemer? and for not believing in him to ſave them by his death, who never died for them? and for not reſting for Salvation, on him that never made the leaſt ſatisfaction for them, and therefore was not a ſufficient ſtay to reſt on; and for not believing, where, if they had believed, Faith would do no good. And where it is objected (as before) they ſhould have believed, that it might have been a ſign to them that Chriſt died for them. I anſwer (beſides what I anſwered before) 1. It being firſt granted that Chriſt did not dye for them, then if they had believed it would have been no ſign that he died for them, for it cannot be a ſign of that which was not. And Chriſts dying or not dying for them, for it cannot be a ſign of that which was not. 2. Never Judge did paſs ſentence upon a ſign inſtead of a cauſe: or make the want of a ſign to be the cauſe of condemnation. Then the principal cauſe ſhould be [<hi>non Redimi:</hi>] that Chriſt died not for us,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59524:128"/>
and the ſignal (which is our not believing) muſt be the leſs principal, And ſo the Sentence ſhould paſs thus [I adjudge thee to Hell Fire, for not being redeemed by my blood, and conſequently for not having that faith which might have been a ſign that I redeemed thee.] But who dare feign Chriſt Jeſus to paſs ſuch a Sentence; Saith <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> far be it from thee, to deſtroy the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with the Wicked! ſhall not the Judge of all the World do righteouſly?</p>
                  <p>Alſo how could Chriſt condemn Pagans or any for not improving his Talents of Mercy, if they had none? And if Chriſt died not for them, they had none. For I have proved, it could not come any other way: Grace, as I ſaid, proper to the Goſpel, is [Mercy contrary to Merit] as Grace to the firſt man new created, was, [Mercy without Merit] now common or ſpecial Goſpel Grace (contrary to merit) comes all from Chriſts Blood, and can come no otherwiſe. The Law came by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt, of his fulneſs we all receive, and Grace for Grace. All the gifts in the Church, of Tongues, Miracles, caſting out Devils, Healing, Propheſying (all which, thoſe may have that ſhall periſh) are yet from one and the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, even the Spirit of the Son, procured by his Blood. In him it is that God bleſſeth us with all ſpiritual bleſſings (common or ſpecial.) Now if men have none of the Talents which Chriſt's Death hath purchaſed them, how can he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for abuſing that which they had not?</p>
                  <p>I know, ſome reply, that God may condemn and torment his Creature without any fault, if
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59524:128"/>
he pleaſe, and that juſtly, becauſe his Will is the rule of Juſtice. To which I anſwer as he is <hi>Dominus Abſolutus</hi> he may do with his own as he pleaſe, and therefore may torment the Creature as he pleaſe (at leaſt he might have done, before he undertook to diſpoſe of them as Rector ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Laws) but as he is Ruler of the Rational Creature, he will not, and therefore cannot condemn or puniſh any but for ſin; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every puniſhment is eſſential <hi>for a fault.</hi> And therefore if God ſhould torment the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Creature, it would be but an Affliction or meer Suffering (which is the matter of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without the form) but no puniſhment: And therefore it would be neither juſt nor unjuſt, being not capable of either Title: But to ſay that God as Judge can condemn or puniſh a man without deſert, is plain Blaſphemy.</p>

                  <p>If Chriſt died not for all, then the condemned would not be left without any juſt excuſe, But the condemned ſhallbe left without a juſt excuſe, therefore Chriſt died for All.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is plain in Scripture. <hi>All mouths ſhall be ſtopped, and all the World be guilty before God, Rom.</hi> 3. 19. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>They have no Cloak for their ſin.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And for the conſequence of the <hi>Major,</hi> there is enough ſaid to prove it before. And further let me add for explication a few words. Excuſe is contrary to Accuſation: As there are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divers ſorts of Accuſation, ſo is there of Excuſation: Men may be Accuſed at the Bar of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59524:129"/>
God. 1. Upon the grounds afforded in the Law of Works. 2. Or according to the Mediators new Law, or the Law of Grace. According to the Law of Works men may be accuſed. 1. Of violating the Precept. 2. Of being liable to the penalty: For the firſt of theſe no man on Earth hath any juſt excuſe, for all have ſinned, and muſt confeſs it, <hi>and he that ſaith he hath no ſin is a lyer.</hi> 2. If any man be accuſed of being liable to penalty according to the tenour of the Law of Works, this alſo muſt be confeſſed and hath no excuſe: no not for them that Chriſt died for in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, or that are Juſtified. 2. And for Accuſation in the reference to the Law of Grace, either men will be accuſed, 1. Of not performing the duties of that Law, as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. Or of not performing the condition of it, as it is a condition. 3. Or of being liable to the penalty, 1. Privative. 2. Poſitive. 1. For the firſt, all men muſt confeſs that they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For though in the Law of Nature the Duty commanded, and the condition, were the ſame, yet in the Law of Grace, the Duty commanded is of larger extent than the condition. For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience is commanded, though only faith and ſincere obedience be the condition: Only the Duty commanded is the matter about which ſincere obedience, which is part of the condition is exerciſed. Now here no man can excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſaying that he hath done all that Chriſt commanded him: But the non-redeemed may excuſe themſelves for not doing it: For againſt every part of the Precepts proper to the Goſpel, they have excuſe, as will appear anon, when we ſpeak of the conditions. 2. The condition of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59524:129"/>
the new Law or Covenant is, Faith working by Love, Repentance. Thankfulneſs and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He that performeth not theſe muſt periſh. Now if an unredeemed perſon ſhall be accuſed for not performing theſe, though he muſt confeſs the non-performance, yet he hath theſe reaſons to give for his excuſe. 1. Where there is no gift, there can be no condition, in proper ſenſe, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining: But Chriſts blood was not given to us, and conſequently not the proper fruits of it. Therefore 2. How could we believe in, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt as our Redeemer, who never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us? Or truſt to his Blood for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was never ſhed for us? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not have been ſufficient to ſave us, had it been poſſible for us to have believed in it, or had we actually believed? Moreover believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Juſtification, is but the accepting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt as an offered Saviour and Head, or as conditionally given us, <hi>viz.</hi> if we will receive him (this is commonly confeſt:) now how can there be a receiving or accepting without a giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Is there any contradiction more palpable? We therefore to whom Chriſt was not given could not receive him: and if he were not given for us, he could not be given to us: ſeeing the latter doth preſuppoſe the former. 3. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Life preſuppoſeth ſome hope of Life gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (I mean, <hi>ſpem poſſibilitatis, &amp; probabilitatis, &amp; ſi non ſpem certitudinis.</hi>) But there is no hope given to any, but in and by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſhed for them: for there is no other name by which they can be ſaved; without this hope we might have an Infernal deſpairing tormenting Repentance, but could not poſſibly have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59524:130"/>
unto Life, or ſuch as could be to us any means of our recovery (as all Goſpel Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is.) And it was not in our power to give hope to our ſelves by cauſing Chriſts blood to be ſhed for us, had we been never ſo willing. 4. How could we love God as merciful in Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, or love Chriſt as our Redeemer when we knew him not to be our Redeemer; and it now appears he never was our Redeemer. 5. How could we love the Brethren as our members of the ſame body, and our fellow-redeemed ones (which is the new commandment) when they were none of our Brethren in that ſenſe, nor could we prove that they ſhould be ſo? 6. Why ſhould we be thankful to Chriſt for Redeeming us, when he did not at all redeem us, Should we be thankful for nothing? 7. How could we obey Chriſt as our Lord-redeemer, who was not our Lord-redeemer? How could we hear him as ſuch, and call on him as ſuch, or truſt him as ſuch,? If his offices are all of equal extent, and it be certain that he was no Prieſt to us, as not offering himſelf a ſacrifice for us at all; then he could be no King or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to us. And why then ſhould we obey a King that is not our King? Or, Why then ſhould we hear that Prophet who was no Prophet to us?</p>
                  <p>3. And then as to the laſt accuſation; if men be accuſed as being lyable or obliged to the penalty, for non-performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or for want of a Saviour: Every true Believer hath two things to anſwer for his full Juſtification: 1. That Chriſt hath ſatisfied for him (and therefore the Laws obligation
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59524:130"/>
is juſtly diſſolved.) 2. That he hath himſelf performed the condition of the new Covenant? (and therefore hath part in Chriſts ſatisfaction, and is not to be condemned as an Unbeliever) or ungrateful Rebel, and therefore ought not to be deprived of the reward or benefit given, (which is deliverance from the Curſe of the Law and the guilt of ſin and deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with a greater ſuperadded glory:) Nor yet to ſuffer the poſitive penalty (which is both the Non-liberation from the foreſaid miſery, and the greater torment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to unbelievers.) Now the unredeemed may all plead that the ſaid penalties are not due to them. 1. Becauſe no redeemer did ever ſatisfie for them; and they could not ſatisfie for themſelves, nor cauſe Chriſt to ſatisfie for them; which is ever preſuppoſed to their own believing; ſeeing believing is but to give them a right to the ſatisfaction and benefits of Chriſt, and not to be our righteouſneſs as of worth in it ſelf; now all the believing in the World would not make that ſatisfaction to be for me, which was never made for me, but only for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, no more than believing that another man hath paid my debt, would make it true; or make a payment to be for me which was only for another: As Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith [and leaſt any ſhould imagine that the very act of Faith in apprehending Chriſt juſtifieth, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that Faith doth not apprehend by power from it ſelf, but by virtue of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: If a man believe the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> to be his, it is not therefore his: Yet if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt and the Kingdom of Heaven by
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59524:131"/>
Chriſt to be his, it is his indeed: Not ſimply becauſe he believes, but becauſe he believes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſe and commandment; for in the tenor of the covenant God promiſeth to impute the obedience of Chriſt to us if we believe.] <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>True Gain. page</hi> 662. So that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer hath this excuſe, that his believing ſuppoſed the Gift and Promiſe, and he could not by believing have made ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice (Faith having no ſuch worth, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained to that end) nor yet could he get intereſt in a ſatisfaction never made for him: Nor would God have imputed ſuch a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or obedience to him, had he never ſo much believed. Indeed he deſerves the miſery threatned by the firſt Law for ſin againſt the Creator, or for ſin as ſin; but not the penalty proper to the new Law; either privative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in non-liberation, or poſitive, as in ſorer puniſhment. 2. Beſides he is excuſed by the former reaſons which excuſe him for non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the conditions; for then he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be puniſhed for that non-performance. If the Devils were accuſed for not believing in Chriſt as their Redeemer, and conſequently being obliged to the penalties of the new Covenant, would not they have all this excuſe?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Argument ſeems to me ſo clear that I need not ſay much in confirmation of any part of it.</p>
                  <p>1. For the <hi>Minor</hi> it is generally granted,</p>
                  <p>1. That the Torment of Hell lieth much in the Horrors and Accuſations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>2. And that this is a right judging, and not an erring Conſcience. It is not melancholy miſtakes that torment poor Souls in Hell (as to think they have ſinned when they have not) but the apprehenſions of real evils in and upon them.</p>
                  <p>3. Conſcience will never torment men for that which never was in their power to avoid, (directly or indirectly, in it ſelf or in the means) though he had been never ſo willing. Did you ever ſee a rational man wounded in Conſcience for not being an Angel, or not ſeeing God face to face, or not redeeming his own Soul? But it is for wilful ſinning that mens Conſciences ſcourge them. When there was a poſſibility of being ſaved, yea a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity put into our hands, yea a certainty if we would yield to Chriſts conditions; and yet men did negligently and wilfully ſlight all, this will wound them everlaſtingly: This will feed the never-dying Worm, and make them cry out againſt themſelves for ever, O what a fool, what a wilful wicked ſelf-hater was I, that had
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59524:132"/>
a price in my hands, but had not a heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it! That had a Redeemer offered me that ſuffered for my ſins, and had not a heart to receive him: That had his blood tendered me for the waſhing of my Soul, and the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Wounds, and had not a will to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it! That might have had Chriſt, and Pardon, and Adoption, and Salvation, and would not! I thought my pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits better than Chriſt and Glory! I choſe dung and droſs before the Crown of Life. How juſtly am I now excluded from that bleſſedneſs, which I ſet ſo light by, and endure that miſery which I wilfully run into. (See more of this in the Third Part of my Book of Reſt, in the aggravations of the Damneds Torments.</p>
                  <p>But if the damned ſhould then truly know that there was never any poſſibility of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; and that Chriſt never died at all for them; nor was their Redeemer; and that if they could have or had believed, it would not have ſaved them; yea that Chriſt being never given for them, could not conſequently be given to them, and conſequently could not be accepted or received as being not an object ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prble of being received; yea that God could not give them pardon and Salvation as purchaſed by that Blood that was never ſhed for them, had they believed never ſo much; will not this take of all the accuſations of conſcience, and turn all their clamors againſt God himſelf? And ſo make Hell thus far to be no Hell? If a great Man come to a poor Priſoner, and ſay, take me for the payer of thy debt, (as having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done it) and thou ſhalt be free, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59524:132"/>

And thus with the <hi>Minor</hi> I have alſo confirmed the Major Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Chriſt told the <hi>Jews,</hi> If he had not come and ſpoak to them (and done the Works that no Man elſe could do) they had not had Sin (in not believing on him) but now they had no Cloak for their Sin. But if Chriſt had not redeemed Men nor been an object for their Faith, then much more evidently may it be ſaid that they had not had Sin who had not believed in him or taken him as their Redeemer: For defect of an object will more excuſe then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of evidence. If the Works of God diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his inviſible things, leave Sinners (Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, as moſt Exſpoſitors judg) without excuſe; and ſo they had been excuſable but for thoſe works; much more excuſable would unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers be, if they had no Redeemer to believe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59524:133"/>
in, whatever proclamations of him were made to the World: And conſequently conſcience would excuſe the damned, and ſo would not torment them, for an excuſing conſcience tormenteth none. But whatever Men may ſay now, I am certain that thoſe miſerable damned Souls will have no ſuch alleviation of their miſery: They ſhall not be able then to ſtop the Mouth of conſcience by all the Arguments againſt their Redemption that now ſeem ſo ſtrong; nor to ſay, what ſhould I vex my ſelf for that which I could never help, if I would; and torment my ſelf or accuſe my ſelf for not accepting a Redeemer that never was given me? Or for not redeeming my own Soul.</p>

                  <p>If Chriſt died not for all (but only for the Elect) then the puniſhment of the damned ſhould not at all conſiſt in a Privation of the But Fruits of Chriſts Sacrifice (or ſatisfaction.) the puniſhment of the damned (at leaſt many, if not all) will conſiſt in a privation of the Fruits of Chriſts ſatisfaction, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding of the force of this Argument you muſt know, 1. That there may be a Privation of that which we are but in a poſſibility or probability of enjoying, much more if we have a certainty on ſome eaſie, and reaſonable condition; ſpecially if the condition be but the accepting of a free gift; as well as there may be a Privation of what is actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59524:133"/>
2. Though ſome that underſtand not the nature of the New Covenant or Law do deny that it hath any peculiar penalty, yet it is a clear truth beyond doubt. For 1. It is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire law, and therefore doth promiſe and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and conſequently doth <hi>premiare &amp; punire</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and puniſh. 2. It is that Law by which we ſhall be judged at the Redeemers bar, and therefore it doth reward and puniſh, that is, conſtitute the dueneſs of rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: elſe it could not poſſibly be <hi>Norma judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii</hi> in Abſolution, and condemnation. 3. It is ſaid expreſly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. Of how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy that tread under Foot the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the puniſhment of unbelievers in the New Teſtament is expreſſed to be in unquenchable Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels, whereas the puniſhment of the old Law was expreſſed but by the name of Death, or at leaſt not ſo hideouſly as the other. Not that I am any whit of their opinion that think, there was no actual everlaſting pain threatned by the old Law, but only annihilation: Nor will I conteſt againſt any Man that ſaith, it is only a puniſhment gradually different (as to the poſitive part, and much of the privative) from that of the firſt Law which is threatned by the ſecond: For a gradual natural diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may conſtitute a moral ſpecifical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: It is but in degree of pain that a prick with a pin differs from <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſtabs in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Houſe, or from the pulling of a Mans Fleſh of his Back with Nails or hot Pincers. Yet ſome of the privative, and objective of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59524:134"/>
poſitive torments of the two Laws do differ <hi>in ſpecie.</hi> For as to the poſitive, the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the damned ſhall torment them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting a Redeemer, and pardon, Adoption, and Glory with him: But according to the firſt Law, conſcience ſhould only torment Men for caſting away that Life that <hi>Adam</hi> did enjoy (or if more were promiſed, for not obeying perfectly that they might attain it.) 4. And it is undeniable that this New Law hath a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment privative ſpecifically diſtinct in <hi>Natura rei</hi> from that of the old Law. That is, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Chriſt as their Head, and of pardon, juſtification by him, Adoption by him, and Salvation from deſerved miſery, beſide, the loſs of a greater promiſed glory, yea and a ſecond loſs of their firſt happineſs. If any therefore ſhall ſay, that becauſe Men are condemned already and the Goſpel doth only <hi>Non-liberare</hi> not ſave unbelievers; therefore it is a meer promiſe, and not a Law, and ſo hath no proper penalty of its own; I anſwer. 1. I have ſhewed it hath a ſorer puniſhment as its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive penalty. 2. The denial of a greater glory, which Chriſt giveth by the New Law, above what the old Law gave, is a proper and grievous puniſhment. 3. The denial of thoſe bleſſed Relations of [a Member of Chriſt and in him an adopted Son of God, and Heir of Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] is a ſore and proper puniſhment. 4. The Privation even of that Life which was given by the firſt Law, is a proper penalty of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, becauſe the New Law, doth reſtore to all Men their loſt right to Life, on an eaſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and therefore as the Privation of Life
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59524:134"/>
is firſt given or promiſed in the firſt Law, was the penalty of that Law, ſo the Privation of the ſame Life as redeemed and reſtored by the Mediator, is the penalty of the new Law: So that it is a recovered happineſs that they this way loſe, and ſo are <hi>twice dead,</hi> as <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks. 5. The very <hi>Non-Liberation</hi> of the new Law, in denial of Remiſſion and Salvation, is a great and proper penalty: As the Non-continuation of <hi>Adams</hi> happineſs in paradiſe was a penalty of that Law (and the not-giving of a greater, if that Law did promiſe a greater.) If a Prince make an Act of pardon and oblivion for a company of impriſoned condemned Malefactors in theſe terms, that if they will repent and thankfully accept his favour, they ſhall all be pardoned, and alſo dignified to be Princes and his Favourites: If they will not, none of them ſhall be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but all ſhall die by a more cruel Death. Here this Law of Grace hath as its peculiar pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. 1. Their Non-liberation, and ſo their firſt deſerved Death, not as firſt deſerved, but as confirmed, and peremptorily adjudged to them for their ingratitude; and ſo. 2. The loſs of Life, as it was conditionally reſtored, and was in Law, as it were, a new Life. 3. And the loſs of the promiſed offered dignities. 4. And the ſorer kind of death, ſo is it in the caſe in Hand.</p>
                  <p>For the confirmation of the <hi>Minor,</hi> I need not to ſay much more, ſeeing for ought I know it is generally granted. I never met yet with any, that durſt ſay that all the Non-Elect do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go none of the fore deſcribed penalties of the new Law; but only the meer penalties of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59524:135"/>
firſt Law: Doubtleſs God is offended ſpecially at their unbelief, and will deſtroy them as Chriſts Enemies becauſe they would not that he ſhould Reign over them, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 27. and Chriſt will come in flaming fire rendring ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to them for not knowing God, and not obeying the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7. 8. 9. and he will damn them all that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Truth (of the Goſpel) but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10. 11. 12. And this is the condemnation that Light is come into the World and Men love darkneſs rather then light becauſe their deeds were evil: And becauſe when Chriſt came to his own, his own received him not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 10. 21, 11. For it ſhall come to paſs that every Soul that heareth not the voice of this Prophet ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 23.</p>
                  <p>And they that believe not Jeſus is the Chriſt ſhall dye in their ſins; And except men repent, they ſhall all periſh, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 3, 5. yea <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth not ſhall be damned, Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>For he is the Author of Eternal Salvation to them</hi> (only) <hi>that obey him, Heb.</hi> 5. 9. So that as men ſuffer for ſin againſt the new, ſo alſo from the obligation of that Law binding them over to Judgment: and therefore they are judged by that Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. yea I doubt not but all the World ſhall be judged by the Redeemer, for miſimploying his Talents of Grace (thoſe that periſh) and not only for not perfect fulfilling the Law of Works: none is condemned meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that. And if it be ſo, then the ſame Law of Chriſt muſt needs conſtitute the penalty to be executed. Nor did I ever meet with
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59524:135"/>
any that durſt ſay that it was no puniſhment to Unbelievers, to be denied Pardon and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Salvation from their deſerved dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which were all offered to them in the Goſpel, and which Believers do receive: much leſs ſhould any ſay, that the additional torments of ſuch, and the loſs of the greater promiſed glory are no puniſhments. Yea even in this life the non-elect receive of the puniſhments proper to the new Law, <hi>viz.</hi> non remiſſion and non reconciliation, and the forſaking of God, when he caſts them off, and gives them up to themſelves becauſe they would none of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11, 12. and leaves them deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late becauſe when Chriſt would have gathered them to him in tender mercy, they would not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37, 38. and gives them over to believe lyes becauſe they received not the love of the Truth that they might be ſaved, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11. and takes his holy Spirit from them, becauſe they grieved and quenched it.</p>
                  <p>And all this will be out of doubt if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the definition of Puniſhment, which is a natural evil inflicted becauſe of a Moral: or the hurt of our perſons inflicted for ſin. Now there is no doubt but all theſe forementioned are evils to us, or hurtful to mens perſons; and no doubt but they are inflicted for ſin: and then as to the ſpecies; They are inflicted for ſins againſt the Law of Chriſt, by force of the obligation of the commination of that Law, and the ſentence paſt by Chriſt as Redeemer and Author of that Law. Yea what if I ſaid that ſtrictly and directly men ſuffer not at all the penalty of the Law of Works? For all are
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59524:136"/>
delivered from that penalty on condition they Repent and Believe, and ſo the obligation of that Law is ſuſpended to all, (though not ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abrogated) and transferred, and as it were ſequeſtred into the hands of Chriſt to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by him, (inflicting or not inflicting it) as men deal with him according to his terms of Grace, ſo that now, the penalty is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrictly the penalty of the Law of Chriſt, as it doth both <hi>non-liberare</hi> and peremptorily bind men over to it; and it is properly the loſs of a Life recovered by Chriſts blood, which is the puniſhment; though remotely it be alſo from the obligation of the firſt Law, which being but ſuſpended by Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally diſſolved, remaineth in force upon the non-performance of the condition, as ſoon as the time of performance is expired. So that it is undeniable that the damned ſuffer the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the fruits of Chriſts death and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: yea and of his ſatisfaction for them in perticular. For as it is certain that there is no remiſſion without blood, and no Juſtification or Salvation without Chriſts ſatisfaction; ſo it is as much beyond doubt with all ſober men, that Chriſts ſatisfaction for one man will not procure Pardon and Salvation for another. So that the <hi>Minor</hi> is fully clear.</p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Major</hi> propoſition it is as clear. For there can be no effects without a cauſe: As no man can receive the effects of Chriſts Death, but thoſe for whom he died; ſo no man can loſe or be deprived of thoſe effects, but thoſe for whom he died; for the cauſe is preſuppoſed. A Negation is no Puniſhment.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59524:136"/>
It is not a puniſhment to a Stone that it is not a Man, that it is mute, liveleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor to a Beaſt, not to be ſaved, nor to an Angel not to be Redeemed, nor to the Devils, not to be partakers of Chriſt, and of Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him. Now its true, the Pardon of the Damned, and their Salvation was not actually effected, but the meritorious cauſe was full and perfect in Chriſts ſatisfaction (and moral cauſes go long before the effects ſometimes, and may do all their part, and yet the effect not follow through the defect of ſome other,) and the effects were conditionally given or produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the New Covenant, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not only poſſible and probable, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain if the condition were performed: So that here is a proper privation, and not a bare Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Nor is it the meer matter of ſuch effects that men are deprived of, but formally as they were effects conditionally granted, and were to have been effects actually of the death of Chriſt. They ſhould have been ſuch effects, if they had done their part to procure them by performing the condition as Chriſt did in the Cauſe; for he required not them to effect it as concauſes, but only ſuſpended the effects of his own full ſufficient (but Moral) cauſe, on their condition, which all Lawyers, and all that know what a Moral Cauſe is, or what a proper condition is, know to be moſt uſual. Now if you ſuppoſe that Chriſt died not, and ſatisfied not for theſe men, then the loſs of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Adoption, Memberſhip of Chriſt, final Abſolution, Salvation, beſides all the greater Glory, and all the Spirits Graces and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59524:137"/>
in this life, cannot poſſibly be puniſhments to them, for they cannot be Privations. For there was never any cauſe to procure them, and therefore they were never poſſible, much leſs due: and Mans Faith was not required by God to be the meritorious cauſe, or to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, nor yet to procure Chriſt or any other to ſatisfie it, nor yet to make that ſatisfaction to be now for us, which was made for others and not for us: to none of theſe ends was Faith requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but only to be the condition of our enjoying Chriſt, and the fruits of his ſatisfaction; on performance whereof the Moral Cauſe which was long before in full being, ſhould produce its effect, or elſe not (as to us) ſo that ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Cauſe is neceſſarily ſuppoſed to Faith as the condition, ſeeing the office of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, that on it the effect of the cauſe be ſuſpended, till that condition be performed: And therefore there can be no condition where there is not firſt the Moral Cauſe: I mean there can neither be condition conſtituted by Law, Teſtament, Deed of Gift, or Covenant, nor yet condition performed, for it cannot have the form of a condition. Or if that be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as to any other caſe, I am ſure it is not in the caſe in hand; No man will ſay that the non-remiſſion, non-ſalvation of the Devils by the Blood of Chriſt, is a Puniſhment to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> That is becauſe it was never offered or conditionally given them by Covenant, as it was to the Unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:59524:137"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nor could it have been given ſo to Unbelievers, if Chriſt had not died for them. Could God give them Chriſt as a Satisfier and Redeemer, who never had ſatisfied for them or redeemed? Or could he make over to them effects which had no Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the effects of his dying for them, when he did not dye for them? Would the New Covenant ſerve to pardon men without Chriſts Sacrifice and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction? Nay is it not beyond all doubt that this which I call the New Covenant or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. is the Redeemers Law and Teſtament, and preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth his Death and Satisfaction, <hi>in eſſe Morali</hi> at leaſt: It is the New Teſtament in his Blood, he firſt buyeth men to be his own by ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then dealeth with them as his own by Promiſe and Legiſlation: Only the Promiſe of God to give Chriſt for a Redeemer to the World, and his Propheſies of him therein, are in order of nature before the Moral being of Chriſts death, but ſo is not the Law of Grace. I know nothing that hath any great ſhew of Reaſon that can be ſaid againſt this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſo clearly evinceth the truth of Univerſal Redemption, and for vain objections, I will not trouble my ſelf and the Reader with them.</p>

                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:59524:138"/>2. It maketh God either not to offer the effects of Chriſts ſatisfaction (Pardon and Life) to all, but only to the Elect: or elſe to offer that which is not, and which he cannot give.</p>
                  <p>3. It denieth the direct object of Faith, and of Gods offer, that is <hi>Chriſtum qui ſatisfecit,</hi> [a Chriſt that hath ſatisfied.]</p>
                  <p>4. It either denieth the Non-Elects delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from that flat neceſſity of periſhing, which came on man for ſinning againſt the firſt Law, by its remedileſs unſuſpended obligation, (and ſo neither, Chriſt, Goſpel or Mercy, had ever any nature of a remedy to them, nor any more done toward their deliverance then towards the deliverance of the Devils:) Or elſe it maketh this deliverance and remedy to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſatisfaction by Chriſt for them.</p>
                  <p>5. It either denieth that God commandeth all to believe (but only the Elect: Or elſe maketh God to aſſign them a deceiving Object for their Faith, commanding them to believe in that which never was, and to truſt that which would deceive them if they did truſt it.</p>
                  <p>6. It maketh God, either to have appointed and commanded the Non-Elect to uſe no means at all for their Recovery and Salvation, or elſe to have appointed them means which are all ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly uſeleſs and inſufficient for want of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite cauſe without them, yea which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a contradiction.</p>

                  <p>10. It maketh Chriſt to have ſuffered much in vain, enduring as much for the ſins of the Elect only, as if the ſins of all men had layen on him.</p>
                  <p>11. Or elſe it dangerouſly extenuateth and denieth the ſufferings of Chriſt, as if he did not ſuffer as much as was due for the ſins of all and it extenuateth his love, as if he took on him only the ſins of the Elect.</p>
                  <p>12. It either denieth that any but the Elect ſhould love Chriſt or be thankful to him as their Redeemer (yea or any Elect that have not the knowledg of their Election) and ſo ſhould not repent of the want of this love and thankfulneſs, or elſe that they ſhould love him and be thankful for that which never was true, and never was done for them or given them.</p>
                  <p>13. It maketh God to have inflicted more on Chriſt then was due, even as much for the Sins of the Elect only, as was due for the Sins of all the World.</p>
                  <p>14. It leaveth all the World, Elect as well as others, without any ground and object for their firſt juſtifying Faith, and in an utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty whether they may believe to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or not.</p>
                  <p>15. It maketh the knowledg that we have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith to go before the having of that Faith.</p>
                  <p>16. It denieth the moſt neceſſary humbling
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59524:139"/>
aggravation of Mens Sins, ſo that neither the Miniſter can tell wicked Men that they have ſinned againſt him that bought them, nor can any wicked Man ſo accuſe himſelf, no nor any Man that doth not know himſelf to be Elect: They cannot ſay, my Sins put Chriſt to Death, and were the Cauſe of his ſufferings: Nay a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter cannot tell any Man in the World certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,] thy Sins put Chriſt to death] becauſe he is not certain who is Elect or ſincere in the Faith.</p>
                  <p>17. It ſubverteth Chriſts new Dominion and Government of the World, and his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral legiſlation, and Judgment according to his Law, which is now founded in his Title of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, as the firſt Dominion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was on the Title of Creation.</p>
                  <p>18. It maketh all the benefits that the Non-Elect receive, whether Spiritual or corporal, and ſo even the relaxation of the curſe of the Law (without which relaxation no Man could have ſuch mercies) to befall Men without the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and ſo either make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as to all thoſe mercies, needleſs, or elſe muſt find another Satisfier.</p>
                  <p>19. It maketh the Law of Grace to contain far harder terms then the Law of Works did in its utmoſt rigor.</p>
                  <p>20. It maketh the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> either to bind all the Non-Elect ſtill to all Ceremonies and bondage-ordinances (and ſo ſets up judaiſm) or elſe to be abrogated and taken down, and Men delivered from it, without Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them.</p>
                  <p>21. It deſtroys almoſt the whole work of the Miniſtry, diſabling Miniſters either to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59524:140"/>
Men by the chiefeſt aggravations of their Sins, and to convince them of ingratitude and unkind dealing with Chriſt, or to ſhew them any hopes to draw them to repentance, or any love and mercy tending to Salvation, to melt and win them to the Love of Chriſt; or any ſufficient object for their Faith and affiance, or any means to be uſed for pardon or Salvation, or any promiſe to encourage them to come in, or any threatening to deter them.</p>
                  <p>22. It makes God and the Redeemer to have done no more for the remedying of the miſery of moſt of faln mankind, then for the Devils, nor to have put them into any more poſſibility of pardon or Salvation.</p>
                  <p>23. Nay it makes God to have dealt far hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier with moſt Men then with the Devils; making them a Law which requireth their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in one that never died for them, and taking him for their Redeemer that never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them, and that on the meer foreſight that they would not believe it, or decree that they ſhould not; and ſo to create by that Law a neceſſity of their far ſorer puniſhment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out procuring them any poſſibility of avoiding it.</p>
                  <p>24. It makes the Goſpel of its own Nature to be the greateſt Plague and Judgment to moſt of Men that receive it, that ever God ſendeth to Men on Earth, by binding them over to a greater puniſhment, and aggravating their Sin, without giving them any poſſibility of remedy.</p>
                  <p>25. It maketh the caſe of all the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Elect as deplorate, remedileſs and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as the Caſe of the damned, and ſo denieth them to have any day of Grace, Viſitation or
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59524:140"/>
Salvation, or any price for happineſs put into their Hands.</p>
                  <p>26. It maketh Chriſt to condemn Men to Hell Fire for not receiving him for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer that never redeemed them, and for not reſting on him for Salvation by his Blood, which was never ſhed for them, and for not repenting unto life, when they had no hope of mercy, and Faith, and repentance could not have ſaved them.</p>
                  <p>27. It putteth ſufficient excuſes into the Mouths of the condemned.</p>
                  <p>28. It maketh the torments of conſcience in Hell to be none at all, and teacheth the damned to put away all their ſorrows and ſelf accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>29. It denieth all the privative part of thoſe torments which Men are obliged to ſuffer by the obligation of Chriſts Law, and ſo maketh Hell either no Hell at all, or next to none.</p>
                  <p>30. And I ſhall anon ſhew how it leads to Infidelity and other Sins, And after this, what Face of Religion is left, unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? Not that I charge thoſe that deny Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſatisfaction with holding all theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but their Doctrin of introducing them by neceſſary conſequence: It is the opinion and not the Men that I accuſe.</p>
                  <p>2. Next let me give you ſome expreſs Texts of Scripture, which I ſhall anon run over more fully and vindicate, and ſee which opinion is the truth of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 20, 21. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the People, even
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59524:141"/>
as there ſhall be falſe teachers among you, who privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift destruction, 20. 21. And as Jude hath it. 4. There are certain Men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly Men, turning the Grace of our God into laſciviouſneſs, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Tim. 2. 5. 6. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to be testified in due time. 1 Job. 2. 2. He is the Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo for the Sins of the whole World, Rom. 5. 18. Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all Men to condemnation, Even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all Men to juſtification of Life, Heb. 2. 9. That he by the Grace of God ſhould taſt Death for every Man, Tit. 2. 11. For the Grace of God that bringeth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath appeared to all Men, 1 Tim. 2. 3, 4. Who will have all Men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledg of the truth, Joh. 3. 17. 18. God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved. He that believeth on him is not condemned, But he that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the Condemnation, that light is come into the World, and Men loved darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then light, becauſe their deeds were evil. 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we thus judg, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59524:141"/>
but unto him which died for them, and roſe again. 1 lim. 4. 10. We truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour of all Men, ſpecially of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Mat. 22. 2, 3, 4. The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King, which made a Marriage for his Son. And ſent forth his Servants to call them that were hidden to the Wedding, and they would not come. And he ſent forth other Servants, ſaying tell them, that are bidden, behold, I have prepared my dinner, my Oxen and Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: Come unto the Marriage. And verſ. 8. Then ſaid he to his Servants, The Wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</hi> Add verſ. 12. 13. So 2 <hi>Cor, 5. 18, 19, 20, 21. And all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation. Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did heſeech you by us, We pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be reconciled to God. For God made him ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Joh. 4. 42. <hi>This is indeed the Christ the Saviour of the World.</hi> 1 Joh. 4 14. 15. <hi>And we have ſeen and do teſtify that God ſent his Son to be the Saviour of the World: Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 9. 10, 11. <hi>For this is the Witneſs which he hath teſtified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the Witneſs in himſelf. He that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son. And this is the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59524:142"/>
Record, that God hath given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son: He that hath the Son, hath Life, and he that hath not the Son hath not Life.</hi> Heb. 6. 4, 5. 6. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the Heavenly Gift, and were made partakers of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the World to come, if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again to Repentance, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame.</hi> Heb. 10. 26, 27. 28, 29. <hi>For if we ſin willfully after that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledg of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for ſins, But a certain fearful look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for of judgment and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries. He that deſpiſed Moſes Law, died without mercy, under two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: Of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Govenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing, and hath done deſpight unto the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 4. 1. 2. Let us therefore take heed leſt a promiſe being left us of entering into his reſt any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it. For unto us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them: But the Goſpel preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it. <hi>Heb. 2. 3. How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. 12. 47, 48. <hi>And if any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man hear my words and believe not, I judg him not: For I came not to judg the World, but to ſave the World. He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words he hath one that judgeth him: The word that I have ſpoken the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59524:142"/>
ſame ſhall judg him at the laſt day.</hi> Luke 13. 39. <hi>How oft would I have gathered thy Children toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Hen gathereth her Brood under her Wings, and ye would not. Behold your Houſe is left unto you deſolate, &amp;c.</hi> Mar. 16. 15. <hi>Go ye into all the World and Preach the Goſpel to every creature: He that believeth and is baptiſed ſhall be ſaved but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> Act. 13. 38. 39, 40, 41. <hi>Be it known to you therefore Men and Brethren, that through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of Sins: And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes. Beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaſt that come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold ye deſpiſers and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Verſe.</hi> 46. <hi>Seeing ye have put it from you, and judged your ſelves unworthy of Everlaſting Life,</hi> &amp;c. Mar. 18. 27, 32, 34, 35. <hi>Then the Lord of that Servant was moved with compaſſion, and looſed him and forgave him the debt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then his Lord, after that he had called him ſaid unto him, O thou wicked Servant, I forgave thee all that debt, becauſe thou deſiredſt me, ſhouldſt not thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have had compaſſion on thy fellow Servant even as I had pitty on thee; And his Lord was wroth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him to the tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him. So likewiſe ſhall my Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do alſo unto you if ye from your Hearts forgive not every one his Brother their Treſpaſſes. Joh.</hi> 6. 51. <hi>I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven: If any Man eat of this Bread he ſhall live for ever: And the Bread that I will give is my Fleſh which I will give for the Life of the World. So verſe</hi> 33. 34, 35. Joh. 1. 29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sin of the World</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 21, 22. <hi>For as by Man came Death, by Man came alſo the Reſurrection of

                  <p>1. There is not one Text of Scripture that ſaith Chriſt died not for all, or Chriſt dyed only for his Choſen, or any thing equivalent. The Texts commonly alledged, are, John 17. 9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the World, 19. and for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf,</hi> Joh. 10, 11, <hi>The good Shepherd giveth his Life for his Sheep,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. <hi>He that ſpared not his Son, but gave him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 18. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting to them their Treſpaſſes,</hi> Rom. 5. 8, 9, 10. <hi>For if when we were Enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life,</hi> John 11. 51, 52. <hi>That Jeſus ſhould dye for that Nation, and not for that Nation only, but that alſo he ſhould gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one the Children of God that were ſcattered abroad,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. <hi>for he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins,</hi> Joh. 15. 13. <hi>Greater Love hath no man than this, that a man to lay down his life for his friends,</hi> 1 John 3. 16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us,</hi> Rom. 8. 34. <hi>who is he that condemneth?

                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:59524:145"/>Nor is there any ill conſequence following the Doctrine of <hi>Univerſal Satisfaction,</hi> but all that terrifies men from it, is ſeeming ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences for want of right underſtanding it: moſt men think (who go that way) that <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Redemption</hi> is inconſiſtent with abſolute Election, and with ſpecial differencing Grace, and with Chriſts ſpecial intention of calling and ſaving his Choſen, whereas indeed it is ſo far from being inconſiſtent, that it is neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant and ſuppoſed, and they may as well think that Univerſal Creation is inconſiſtent with Election and ſpecial grace. Indeed God hath in admirable wiſdom laid Univerſal Grace as a ground work, and built ſpecial grace (as to the executive part) thereupon, and to deny the Univerſal Common grace, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ground-work of ſpecial grace. If this were well underſtood, there would few ſober Divines be againſt Univerſal Redemption, and therefore I ſtill ſay, that it is a clear explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that muſt do more here (and is more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) than argumentation.

                  <p>That Election and Redemption are not of the ſame extent, and not all Elected that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, but Redemption is Univerſal, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſpecial may be ſtrongly evinced by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring

And would not the perfect holy word of God have given marks of this, or bid men make ſure of this, and try it if it were needful, and were not unqueſtionable becauſe univerſal.</p>

We find the Saints (as <hi>David</hi>) complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's hiding his face, and ſeeming their Enemy, and writing bitter things againſt them, and groaning under that burthen of Sin, and crying for Pardon, and ſaying God had forſaken and forgotten them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we never find any Man good or bad (that believed Gods word to be true) to doubt whether Chriſt dyed for him, or whether he were Redeemed, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59524:146"/>
of his danger for want of a Redeemer, or Expiatory Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>3. We find God ordinarily ſaying of Chriſt Jeſus, that he is the Saviour of the World, and came not to condemn the World, but to ſave the World, and took away the ſins of the World, and is a propitiation for the fins of the whole World, and dyed for all, taſted death for every man, and was a ranſom for all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we have no one word in Scripture that ſaith he predeſtinated all to Salvation, or decreed to ſave the whole World: Nay, the very term of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection contradicteth Univerſality, for it is no chuſing if it be all, and if ſome be not left.</p>
                  <p>4. We find Wicked Men condemned, and their ſin aggravated for denying the Lord that bought them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. But never for denying the Lord that Elected them.</p>
                  <p>5. We find Chriſtians by the Apoſtles war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they deſtroy not their weak Brethren for whom Chriſt dyed; and ſaying, through thy knowledge ſhall he periſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea ſaith, deſtroy not him (or by thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall he periſh) whom God hath Elected: but contrarily, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>if it were poſſible they would deceive the very Elect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. We find them that fall away deſcribed to be ſuch as were ſanctified by the blood of the Covenant, but never to be ſuch as were Elected to Salvation. And their Sin is aggravated, as being a treading under foot the Son of God, and putting him to open ſhame, but not as tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under foot Gods Election. And their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is in this, that there is no more Sacrifice for Sin, but a fearful looking for of Judgment,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59524:147"/>
and Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But not that there is no more Election.</p>
                  <p>7. Men are warned to ſee that they refuſe not Chriſt that ſpeaketh and threatned that they ſhall not eſcape if they neglect ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they ſhall ſpeed worſe at Judgment than <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrhah:</hi> But none are ſo threatned for ſinning againſt Election, nor are they warned to take heed of rejecting it; nor is it ſaid, how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great a mercy as Election. Alſo men that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily receive the Sacrament are ſaid <hi>to eat and drink damnation to themſelves, and to be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord:</hi> But no Man that is not Elect, is ſaid either to be the cauſe of his own <hi>Non Election,</hi> or to be guilty of abuſing or rejecting his Election.</p>
                  <p>8. Alſo I find men warned on pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to receive Chriſt as their Redeemer, Be they never ſo wicked, it is our office to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to this; and therefore to preach the Goſpel to every Creature. But we are not to command men to take God for their Elector; I may not go to all the ignorant prophane men men in the Countrey and charge them to take God for their Elector.</p>
                  <p>9. We muſt command all men to love Chriſt as their Redeemer, and be thankful to him, and in thankfulneſs to obey him; and we may ſay to them, <hi>You are not your own, you are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God with your Bodies and Spirits for they are his.</hi> But we cannot perſwade all men to love God as their Elector or to be thankful to him for Election;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59524:147"/>
or to obey God becauſe he hath choſen them.</p>
                  <p>10. We find Scripture telling us, how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fleſh and blood will digeſt the Doctrine of predeſtination, and how they will quarrel at Gods choſing one and not another, and how God ſtops their mouths with an anſwer drawn from his abſolute Lordſhip and Propriety over them, as the Potter over the clay, he may make them veſſels of honour or diſhonour, and do with his own as he liſt. But we never find any murmurrings of Fleſh and Blood that Chriſt ſhould die for one man and not for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nor do we find God ever acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuch thing much leſs giving them a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from his Abſolute Dominion.</p>
                  <p>11. Beſides we find God uſeth to give the reaſon why men be not ſaved by Chriſt, from their own wilfulneſs and rebellious rejecting him. This is the cauſe given why his blood is not applyed to them. But when it comes matter of Election or Non-Election, the Anſwer is, <hi>Oh Man! Who art thou that diſputeſt againſt God?</hi> So that all theſe things laid together and conſidered, it ſeems to me clear, that Redemption is a Univerſal Cauſe, as Creation is, and not a thing proper to the Elect only, as Gods Election is; and that on this Univerſal Ground of Redemption, Chriſt is entitled the Redeemer of the World, and hath founded his <hi>jus Dominii &amp; imperii,</hi> his right of Propriety and Government over all (even thoſe <hi>That will not that he ſhould Reign over them,</hi>) as God was called the Creator of the World becauſe he Created them, and on
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59524:148"/>
that ground did found his firſt Title of Dominion and Empire over all the World. And that Redemption hath no more an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble connexion to the Salvation of all the Redeemed as ſubſequent, than Creation hath with the Salvation of all the Created: But both Creation and Redemption as they are the means between Election and its End, have an infallible connexion with the conſequent of the Salvation of the Elect.</p>
                  <p>2. It is a rule of great uſe, and approved ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by Divines, that when texts ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory one to another, or ſeveral interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and opinions are contradictory indeed, that we muſt ever reduce uncertainties to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and not contrarily certainties to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties: and we muſt interpret obſcure texts by reducing them to the plain ones, and not the plain ones by reducing them to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. This rule Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> preſſeth well: And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid excellently, [Shall we deny that which is plain becauſe we cannot comprehend that which is hid and ſecret? Shall we ſay that is not ſo which we ſee to be ſo, becauſe we cannot find why it is ſo? <hi>Aug. l. de bono perſever. c.</hi> 14] O that this rule were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſerved! When God telleth us as plain as can be ſpoken, that Chriſt died for and taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death for every man, men will deny it, and to that end ſubvert the plain ſenſe of the words, meerly becauſe they cannot ſee how this can ſtand with Chriſts damning men, and with his ſpecial Love to his choſen. It is not hard to ſee
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59524:148"/>
the fair and harmonious conſiſtency: But what if you cannot ſee how two plain Truths of the Goſpel ſhould agree? Will you therefore deny one of them when both are plain? Is not that in high pride to prefer your own underſtandings before the wiſdom of the Spirit of God, who indicted the Scriptures? Should not a humble man rather ſay, doubtleſs both are true though I cannot reconcile them. So others will deny theſe plain truths, becauſe they think that [All that Chriſt died for are certainly Juſtified and Saved: For whomſoever he died and ſatisfied Juſtice for, them he procured Faith to Believe in him: God cannot juſtly puniſh thoſe whom Chriſt hath ſatisfied for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] But doth the Scripture ſpeak all theſe or any of theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of theirs, as plainly as it ſaith that Chriſt died for all and every man? Doth it ſay, as plainly any where that he died not for all? Doth it any where except any one man, and ſay Chriſt died not for him? Doth it ſay any where that he died <hi>only</hi> for his Sheep, or his Elect, and exclude the Non-Elect? There is no ſuch word in all the Bible; Should not then the certain truths and the plain texts be the Standard to the uncertain points, and obſcure texts.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Divines generally make it a rule for the Interpretation of Scripture, that we muſt not leave the moſt obvious plain ſenſe of the words, without neceſſity, and clear compelling evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; Now then let them be viewed by any unprejudiced man, and let him tell us what is the plain and obvious ſenſe of theſe foreſaid words? And for my part I ſee no neceſſity of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59524:149"/>
going from that plain ſenſe. Some here will tell me, then we muſt ſay Chriſt is a Door, a Way, a Vine, and the Bread is his Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is nothing to what I am ſpeaking of: For I did never ſay that we muſt take the literal ſenſe in oppoſition to the figurative, but only the plain obvious ſenſe in oppoſition to a wyer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn extorted ſenſe. Some figurative ſpeeches are ſo uſual, or plain and well known, that he that ſhould interpret them literally would be derided by any Plowman: And every ignorant man uſeth figurative ſpeeches in his common talk, and uſe makes the true ſence as plain and obvious as if they were not figurative. You can ſcarce hear three ſentences from any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, but will convince you of this. If any man of common reaſon had heard Chriſt ſay; [<hi>I am the way to the Father</hi>] would he have thought his plain obvious ſenſe to be [I am an Earthly or other Material way to be trodden on by the Feet of them to come to God?] What will not the luſt of contradicting perſuade men to? Now I would know of any man, would you believe that Chriſt died for all men if the Scripture plainly ſpeak it? If you would, do but tell me, what words can you deviſe or would you wiſh more plain for it than are there uſed; Is it not enough that Chriſt is called the Saviour of the World? You'l ſay, but is it of the whole World? Yes, it ſaith, He is the propitiation for the ſins of the whole World? Will you ſay, but it is not for All men in the World; yes it ſaith he died for All men, as well as for all the World. But will you ſay, it ſaith not for every man? Yes that it doth, he
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59524:149"/>
taſted death for every man. But you may ſay, It means all the Elect, if it ſaid ſo of any Non-Elect I would believe. Yes, it ſpeaks of thoſe that denied the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction. And yet all this ſeems nothing to men prejudiced.</p>
                  <p>3. Furthermore, it deſerves conſideration, whether men can conſiderately go againſt the plain light of ſo many expreſs Texts of Scripture without ſome reluctancy and regret of Judgment? And then, whether uſing a mans Judgment to ſuch a courſe, to bear down the evidence of of many expreſs texts of Scripture, be not a matter of a dangerous nature, both ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and effectually. Doth it not ſignifie a defect in our belief of the truth of Scripture? Or at leaſt of our reverend eſteem of it, when we dare uſe it as a Leaden rule, and Noſe of Wax (as the Papiſts preſumptuouſly call it.) He that can think it will endure ſuch bending, is in danger of thinking it may endure breaking. Hath it not too plain a tendency to infidelity and diſobedience? It is the truth of this word that muſt preſerve us from both. And he that thinks ſo meanly of the Scripture, as that it will patiently endure ſuch violence and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is in great danger of being drawn to queſtion whether it be Gods Word or no, and of ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring over its bounds in practicals, in caſe of temptation. For what have we to perſuade us that Chriſt is the eternal God but plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And is it plainer in this than in its affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt died for All? All tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable Chriſtians ſhould be as fearful to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59524:150"/>
againſt the plain meaning of Scripture in the matter of Faith, as to adventure againſt its plain precepts and prohibitions in matter of practice. And therefore I conclude that when God ſaith ſo expreſly that Chriſt died for All, and taſted death for every man, and is the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fom for all and the propitiation for the ſins of the whole World, It beſeems every Chriſtian rather to explain in what ſenſe Chriſt died for All men, then flatly to deny it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt text of Scripture ordinarily uſed, and which I ſhall inſiſt on, is <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi> Here it is plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed that the giving of Chriſt proceeded from Gods Love to the World as the principal efficient, and that it was to this end, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of this World believe in him ſhould be ſaved. One would think all were plain here, yet men have found or made almoſt as many knots as words. If a King had his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my prove falſe to him and turn to the Enemy; and when they are in his power the Enemy Impriſoneth them, and maketh them Slaves, in this miſery the King ſaith of them [I ſo love my Army that I give ſo much money or my own Son in Ranſom, that whoſoever will thankfully accept my kindneſs, and return to his Allegiance, ſhall not remain in ſlavery but be delivered fully into my favour and their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities] would not ordinary men eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this ſpeech? Would ſo many doubts be raiſed, whether he mean the whole Army or part? What is meant by [Love] by [Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever]
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59524:150"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet here we have ſuch a duſt raiſed in as plain a caſe, or as plain words as ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine myſteries could well be expreſſed by.</p>
                  <p>1. It is doubted what is meant by [the World.]</p>
                  <p>2. And then what is meant by [Loved.]</p>
                  <p>3. And what is meant by [Whoſoever.]</p>
                  <p>The 4. What is meant by [Believeth in him] we need not here ſtand on.</p>
                  <p>And for the firſt ſome ſay by the VVorld, is meant the Elect part of the VVorld: ſome ſay (as Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> and others) it is meant of Mankind as diſtinct from Angels, excluding none, and not of the Elect only; and withal that it ſpeaks only of the ſufficiency of Chriſt's Satisfaction; which if it were not ſufficient for All, there were no place for the General Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Whoever believeth ſhall be Saved.</hi> There is more truth and ſoundneſs in this expoſition, than will ſtand with ſome other contradictory paſſages in the ſame Authors. For my part I ſtand to this expoſition of Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> (as you may find him induſtriouſly explaining this text, <hi>Vindic. Grat. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>part.</hi> 2. § 7. <hi>pag. (mihi)</hi> 203.) I will repeat part of his words, [<hi>Ad locum illum</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16.) <hi>quod attinet, negamus ex his evinci poſſe [Mundum] eo in loco ſignificare [Electos] in mundo degentes.

His hunc in modum conſtitutis, apparet fieri poſſe ut quaedam loca Scripturae de Chriſto mediatore tractent, quoad pretii ipſius ſufficientiam, alia vero quoad mortis ejus efficaciam.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding of this, it muſt be remembred that there is a double efficacy of Chriſts death.</p>
                  <p>1. Its ſatisfying God's Juſtice for the Sins which Chriſt bore.</p>
                  <p>2. The effecting of Pardon, Juſtification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and Salvation of Sinners. It is only of this latter that ſolid Divines ſpeak, when
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59524:151"/>
they diſtinguiſh the efficacy of Chriſt's death from its ſufficiency: But the former (the effecting of ſatisfaction) is preſuppoſed to the ſufficiency (as being the proper immediate end of Chriſt's death) for there is a double ſufficiency.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a ſufficiency material, antecedent to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction (paſſive as we may call it) by which it is ſaid to be ſufficient to ſatisfie God for all Men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſufficiency of this price and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ſo made for the pardoning and ſaving of all that will believe. It is the latter ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency which is to be diſtinguiſh'd from the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter efficiency, and that implies ſome efficiency as neceſſary to that ſufficiency, <hi>viz.</hi> The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of ſatisfaction. And the Doctor can be underſtood no otherwiſe here than according to this interpretation.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe he makes it the neceſſary ground of the general promiſe, without which it could have no place. Now leave out the efficiency of ſatisfaction to Juſtice from Chriſt's death, and it is no more a ground for an Univerſal promiſe, than if he had not paid a ſatisfaction materially ſufficient at all: For it is not ſufficient to pardon all men, if they did believe, except Juſtice be firſt ſatisfied for them.</p>
                  <p>2. He expreſly makes it to be <hi>ſufficientia pretii,</hi> and not <hi>ut ſit pretium,</hi> (though I know elſewhere he contradicts that.)</p>
                  <p>3. He makes it the interpretation of thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of Chriſts dying for all, which cannot be if he ſatisfy'd not for all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:59524:152"/>4. He makes a general promiſe and invitation to be grounded on it: But ſurely Chriſt is not with his Salvation given ſo much as conditionally to any but whom by ſatisfying for them he hath purchaſed that mercy to.</p>
                  <p>5. Yea he expreſly in his Reaſon ſhews, that by the efficacy of Chriſts death, he means that which conſiſteth in the Spirits efficacy in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith.</p>
                  <p>Others ſay, that by [the World] is meant only the Elect, but not as Elect, but as they are <hi>Gentiles</hi> who are called the World in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction to the <hi>Jews.</hi> This cannot be true, for</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Then no Elect <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be included, but it ſhould run thus, <hi>God ſo loved the Gentiles, that he gave his only Son,</hi> &amp;c.] whereas Chriſt was ſent to <hi>Jews</hi> as well as <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that firſt in ſome reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This way croſſeth themſelves alſo, for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> conſiſt of Elect and non-Elect, and therefore according to their Doctrine it ſhould only run thus [<hi>God ſo loved part of the World</hi>] if the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be the World, or elſe they muſt ſay, that by [the World] is meant the Elect part of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But I ſhall prove further that this is falſe, by proving that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the Non-Elect alſo. By [the World] it is evident is not meant the containing World, the Air, Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor Angels, or unknown Superiour Creatures, nor yet brute Beaſts, but the Men living on Earth. It is granted that the uſual obvious ſenſe of words is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied without evident cauſe, and when there is cauſe of denying that ſenſe, we muſt go but to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59524:152"/>
the next obvious and uſual ſenſe, and not to a remote unuſual improbable one. Now it is known that the word [World] uſed for Men, doth moſt directly and obviouſly ſignifie Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, without excluding any. Next to that it ſignifieth the greater part or common ſort of the World. Next that it ſignifieth the generality or greater part of ſome Country where the ſpeaker then is; not to ſpeak of more remote ſignifications. If therefore we be forced to forſake the firſt ſignification, it muſt be proved that we are alſo forced from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond before we muſt take the third, and both ſecond and third muſt be diſproved, before we can take the World for the Elect only.</p>
                  <p>2. The effects of that love, and giving of Chriſt here mentioned, are undoubtedly ſuch as are given to all, and not only to the Elect (as to the Tenor of the Law or Deed of Gift, they are given to all Mankind, and as to the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, they are given to all thoſe that hear the Goſpel.) Therefore the World here mentioned is all, and not only the Elect. I think none will deny the Conſequence, and for the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, it is evident through all the Scripture as well as this Text. The effect of the giving of Chriſt here expreſſed, is the conditional gift of Salvation: But the conditional gift of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to all, and not only to the Elect, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> [<hi>That whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh</hi>] is a plain giving of Salvation on condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; it being uſual in Scripture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech, to make [whoſoever will] and [if you will] equally conditionally. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take the water of Life freely,</hi> is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59524:153"/>
to this [it ſhall be yours if you will take it.] If you beat up the Drum for Souldiers, you proclaim [whoſoever will come to ſuch a place and liſt himſelf under ſuch a Commander, ſhall have Entertainment and Pay,] here [whoſoever will come and liſt himſelf,] is equivalent to [if any or all of you will come and liſt your ſelves] So that where they put the queſtion, whether the word [whoſoever] be diſtributive? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, no, not directly, it is but the univerſal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the Conditional Promiſe, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the conditionality; but conſequently it is diſtributive, though Antecedently and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly it be not. As in the former Compariſon, when you ſay [whoſoever will liſt himſelf, <hi>&amp;c</hi>] the word [whoſoever] is not directly diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for you offer all that hear you that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and all may accept it if they will, and then there would be no diſtribution: But becauſe all will not, and this is foreknown, therefore conſequently it is diſtributive. So here; and that it is diſtributive is from the will of Man, and the event, and other exteriour differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing Cauſes; but not properly from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or deed of gift at all, except by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>3. The next words ſhew what [World] it is that is here ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> That which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth men that believe, and ſo are not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and thoſe that believe not (which Conſideration is conſequential, and not antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Chriſt's dying for them) and ſo are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe they have not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>&amp;c. v.</hi> 18. They that will affirm a greater reſtriction in the ſenſe of the word, muſt prove
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59524:153"/>
it. For (though I have proved here the larger ſenſe) yet indeed it belongs to them to prove their aſſertion, who recede from the commoner and more extenſive ſenſe. I ſhall briefly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what they ſay to that end.</p>
                  <p>Only I muſt intreat the Reader, that if they compare my Writings with any Book which contains the Reaſons which I confute, that you would not expect that I ſhould take any notice of any of thoſe ſtrangely-confident, Juvenile, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Expreſſions which ſome do abound with, but that I draw out only the pith of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſet Reaſon againſt Reaſon, and let the heaps of Worldly Rhetorical Gloryings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: Much more muſt I expect that you will not take me to be engaged to defend any <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> miſinterpretations and weakneſſes, and to confute what any man ſaith againſt them, but only that which ſeems of force againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations or aſſertions that I my ſelf do maintain.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Reaſon they give for proving that it is only the Elect that here are called the World, is drawn from the Love which is here ſaid to have the World for its object, which cannot be common to all, but is proper to the Elect. This we deny, and they attempt to prove by theſe five Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>1. Say they, it is the moſt tranſcendent and remarkable Love, and therefore proper to the Elect. I muſt deſire the Reader to ſee this anſwered afterward in my anſwer to their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It is an Eternal act of God's will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:59524:154"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But what that is to the purpoſe I know not.</p>
                  <p>3. It was the cauſe of ſending Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's true, it was one cauſe, but how follows the conſequence?</p>
                  <p>4. They ſay that Love which is the cauſe of giving Chriſt, is always the cauſe of beſtowing all other good things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Love which cauſed the giving of Chriſt for the Elect, is the cauſe of giving them all things with him; but that love which cauſed the giving of Chriſt for all, ſhall not eventually give them all things. I refer you to what I ſhall ſay anon to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. for the full anſwer to this.</p>
                  <p>5. They ſay this Love is an aſſured Fountain of Salvation to all that are beloved with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny it, if they mean by [aſſured] ſuch as ſhall eventually be ſaved; but, ſay they, the iſſue of this Love being <hi>not periſhing but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Eternal Life,</hi> happens only to the Elect, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Text ſpeaks of no other effect of this Love, but the giving of Chriſt, and the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Eternal Life on Condition of believing. Now for the former, there is a twofold giving of Chriſt; Firſt, giving him on the Croſs for us. Secondly, Giving him in the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to us.</p>
                  <p>The Text ſeems to comprehend both. He is given on the Croſs for all, he is given in the word conditionally to all, and ſo is Eternal Life with him.</p>
                  <p>Now, though the actual right to Eternal Life and fruition of it be not the portion of all, yet
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59524:154"/>
that makes no alteration or differencing nature in this Univerſal Conditional promiſe, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one believed, and another did not. The Promiſe antecedently to the performance or non-performance of the Condition, gave Chriſt alike to the Elect, and non-Elect, and Life with him. But that ſome believed rather than others, was not from the gift of this Univerſal Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Promiſe, but from another cauſe, even Gods ſecret decree of Election.</p>
                  <p>Their ſecond Reaſon for proving that by [the World] is meant only the Elect, is becauſe it is the ſame World that Chriſt came to ſave, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. but that is only the Elect, elſe God ſhould fail of his intention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is to pervert one Text by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting another, as I ſhall ſhew anon, when we come to that Text.</p>
                  <p>Their Third Reaſon is, that its uſual to call the Elect the [World.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was a very Pious Judicious Grave Divine that ſaid [I profeſs I cannot find any one clear place where [the World] muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be taken for the Elect only. <hi>Ezek. Culverwell</hi> in his Anſwer to Objections againſt his Treaty of Faith.]</p>
                  <p>They alledge for what they ſay theſe Texts, <hi>John</hi> 4. 42. where Chriſt is called <hi>the Saviour of the World,</hi> a Saviour of Men not ſaved, is ſtrange.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> So are all things ſtrange to Men till they underſtand them. It's no more ſtrange than that God Created all Men to Life (that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the firſt Covenant promiſed) who yet did dye for Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:59524:155"/>The Second is <hi>John</hi> 6. 33, 57. which ſhall be vindicated anon.</p>
                  <p>The Third is <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid by Faith to be Heir of the World, which <hi>ver.</hi> 11. is called to be [the Father of the Faithful.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A bold interpretation, but here's no proof, nor appearance of any that the Father of the faithful is all one with (Heir of the World) is too unlikely a thing to be received on a Mans bare word: Eſpecially conſidering that it is proper to <hi>Abraham</hi> to be (Father of all them that believe) <hi>verſe.</hi> 11. But to be Heir of the World, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. is not proper to him: For it is ſaid, (the promiſe, that he ſhould be Heir of the World, was not to <hi>Abraham</hi> or to his Seed, through the Law.) I never read where <hi>Abraham</hi> is called (Heir of the Faithful) nor can he ſo be conveniently called: But he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Heir of the World: Therefore by the World is not meant only the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>The Next is <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>If the fall of them be the Riches of the World, and the diminiſhing of them the riches of the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is more than the Elect Gentiles that ſhall be and are enricht by Chriſt (though not as the Elect) others are enriched with that Church ſtate viſible, which <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks that the <hi>Jews</hi> were broken off from: As alſo with the Goſpel, and ordinances, and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal gift of Chriſt and juſtification and glory; beſides many other mercies.

                  <p>3. Were theſe <hi>Coloſ.</hi> all Elect to whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks?</p>
                  <p>4. It is a known truth that the Goſpel comes to more than the Elect; for many are called, but few choſen; next they alledge 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. which makes ſufficiently againſt their whole cauſe as ſhall be ſhewen anon, when we come to it.

                  <p>2. It is plain that this Text ſpeaks of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Chriſts viſible Kingdom, which contains more than the Elect. The Net of the Goſpel brings Fiſhes good and bad.

                  <p>Theſe are all the Texts that I find urged to to prove that by the World is ſignified only the Elect.</p>
                  <p>2. And what if it were ſo in ſome places?</p>
                  <p>1. It follows not that it is ſo here.</p>

                  <p>Their 4th. Reaſon to prove that by the [World] is here meant [the Elect only] is this. If every one in the World be intended, why doth not the Lord in the purſuit of this Love reveal Chriſt to all ſo loved?</p>

                  <p>2. That God's Love towards innumerable is fruitleſs and vain.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Son of God is given to them that never hear word of him, and have no power granted to believe in him.</p>
                  <p>4. That God is mutable in his Love, or elſe he ſtill loveth thoſe that be in Hell.</p>
                  <p>5. That he gives not all things to them to whom he gives his Son.</p>

                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:59524:156"/>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To the firſt I thought no <hi>Antiarminian</hi> Divine ever denied it. God hateth all the Workers of iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 5. You will not ſay, that he hated them not from Eternity: Many of the Workers of iniquity are Elect, and ſo loved from Eternity. God's Love is ſpoken, ſay Divines, <hi>ab effectu, potius quam ab affectu.</hi> God from Eternity ſo loved Men, not Elect, as to give them on Creation Everlaſting Life in <hi>Adam,</hi> on condition of fulfilling the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and to give them everlaſting life in Chriſt on condition of believing according to the ſecond Covenant: And yet he decreed not to give any Men Grace to perform the condition of the firſt covenant; nor to give all men Grace to perform the condition of the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>To the 2d. Conſequence I ſhall anſwer fully by it ſelf anon among the contrary Arguments.</p>
                  <p>To the 3d. alſo I ſhall there anſwer.</p>
                  <p>To the 4th. I ſay (for it is not worth a fuller anſwer.)</p>
                  <p>1. All Divines that I know ſay that God lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe in Hell, as his Creatures and as Men: <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the reſt of the Schoolmen have it frequently: Yea <hi>Urſine, Rob. Baronius</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Proteſtant Divines ſay, that he pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſheth thoſe in Hell ſhort of their deſerving, and ſo ſheweth ſome mercy there; that I will not meddle with.</p>
                  <p>2. If you ſpeak of God's Love as it is <hi>in effectu</hi> and not <hi>in affectu,</hi> then it is certainly mutable. He gives Men thoſe mercies, which for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>buſe he removeth or turneth to judgments. He gives to all a conditional Pardon, and Life: And after condemneth moſt to Death for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59524:157"/>
the condition. To the Elect themſelves theſe Effects are changeable.</p>
                  <p>3. If you ſay, God's Love is but his <hi>Velle bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num alicui;</hi> and therefore he cannot be ſaid now Men are in Hell to continue to will them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Pardon and Life: Therefore God's Love muſt be mutable. I anſwer, Let thoſe Owls that love to blind themſelves by gazing on the Sun of God's undiſcernable Infiniteneſs, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to tell what God's Love is, and what his Will is, and how he Wills that which is paſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For my part I pretend not to a capacity of diſcerning any ſuch things.</p>
                  <p>2. You may enforce your objection as ſtrongly concerning God's Love to the Elect: He once willed their Creation, then he willed to redeem them by Chriſt, then he willed to call them, and to give them their firſt juſtification, to deliver them from this ſickneſs and that danger, then he willed that they ſhould die, and then that they ſhould riſe again: If you will tell me how God after the Reſurrection, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to all Eternity, to will to create Man, to redeem him, to call him, juſtifie him, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, raiſe him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then I will tell you how God will Eternally will the giving Chriſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Salvation conditionally to all. If you ſay, he Wills them as <hi>preterita,</hi> and not as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia vel futura;</hi> you may ſay ſo by this. If you ſay, that there is no <hi>preteritum vel futurum</hi> with God, but all preſent, and therefore he willeth them as <hi>preterita ſic dicta quoad hominem vel fidem menſuram humanam, ſed ut preſentia quoad Deum;</hi> the like you may ſay here alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:59524:157"/>To the 5th. Conſequence I muſt anſwer anon by it ſelf when we ſpeak of their Argument from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
                  <p>To the 6th. It is a naked affirmation, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily denied. Dare Men ſay, that it was no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or love of God, to give mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> Eternal Life on condition of keeping his Law, becauſe God foreknew or foredecreed, they would not or ſhould not keep it? And ſo not attain the fruit of that Govenant thereby? Dare theſe Men (pretending to preach the Goſpel) tell their hearers, that to all of them (except the Elect) the preaching, the Goſpel (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the offer and conditional gift of Chriſt, Pardon, Juſtification and Salvation is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor from any love of God to them? And ſo that in rejecting it they never were guilty of rejecting or ſinning againſt any love or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?</p>
                  <p>Having examined what they ſay, to prove that by [the World] is meant [the Elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] I find it needleſs to examine the reſt about the Senſe of the word [loved] and [whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver] partly becauſe what they ſay requires not much confutation, and partly becauſe enough is ſaid on occaſion of this. I affirm that by love is not meant a meer natural affection, nor yet a meer Act: (But if we muſt ſpeak of God after the manner of Men) it is an Act proceeding from the goodneſs of God's nature. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not this Act to be free: And therefore take not natural, For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phyſical</hi> (as if God loved us as the Fire burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>quantum in ſe</hi>)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:59524:158"/>2. Nor yet Conſtrained: And it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that both the Text, and thoſe that thus interpret it, ſpeak only of God's Love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind or the World, and not directly to the [Salvation of the World.] The conditional gift of Salvation to the World is the Effect of that love to the World; and it is true love, though it infallibly procure not that Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>And for the other words [whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] as I have ſaid before, they are primarily and directly the conditional expreſſion, and to all: But ſecondarily and accidentally diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, becauſe all perform not the condition. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13. Whoſoever ſhall call on the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved: Which <hi>verſe</hi> 9. is conditionally thus expreſſed [if thou believe and if thou confeſs] and <hi>verſe</hi> 11. It is put in equipollent terms, <hi>whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> So <hi>Rom. 9. 33. Joh. 11. 26. Act. 10. 43. Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins. Act. 2. 21. Joh. 12. 46. Mar. 10. 15. Mar. 8. 34, 38.

                  <p>The 2d. Text that I ſhall alledg, is the next <hi>Verſes, Joh. 3. 17, 18, 19. For God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him is not condemned, but he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not is condemned already; becauſe he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men loved darkneſs rather than Light, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:59524:158"/>Here 1. It is expreſly ſaid that Chriſt came into the World, that the World by him might be ſaved: And therefore he died for them.</p>
                  <p>2. Yet this World is diſtributed into ſuch as believe and are not condemned, and ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not and are condemned: And therefore it is not only the Elect.</p>
                  <p>3. This condemnation is for not believing; which, as I have proved, preſuppoſeth Chriſt's dying for them.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee what they bring to prove that by the World here is meant only the Elect. They tell us here of a notable <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as if by the Word [World] were meant ſeveral things, when here repeated: But for proof of what they ſay, you muſt take their words. Is it not good Senſe and true to ſay [<hi>God ſent not his Son into the World,] viz.</hi> into the World of mankind, or among Men, [<hi>to condemn the World] viz</hi> of Mankind [<hi>but that the World</hi>] of Mankind [<hi>through him might be ſaved.</hi>] But what if their various acception were granted? Still the World that Chriſt was ſent to ſave, is divided into Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers eventually ſaved, and Unbelievers even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually condemned.

to promiſe to Man on certain conditions, when thoſe conditions are not performed. His purpoſe ſhall undoubtedly ſtand: But when will it be proved that God did purpoſe or reſolve even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and actually to ſave that World that is here meant? As God hath a Will <hi>de rerum eventu,</hi> and a Will <hi>de debito,</hi> which I call Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative: So each act of his Will hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end (as we may aſcribe any end to Gods Will, diſtinct from himſelf by improper ſpeech.)

The end of his Law is the fulfiling of its conditions, and Mans attaining the reward thereby: This may be called God's end.</p>
                  <p>1. In that God preſcribeth it to Man to be by him intended; and ſo ſending Chriſt into the World to ſatisfie his juſtice, he hath bound the World to ſeek and accept Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in and by him.</p>
                  <p>2. In that God hath made Chriſt and Faith to have the nature of a means, in reference to that command: And all Men are bound (that hear the Goſpel) to take Chriſt by believing in him, as a means of Salvation provided by God.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe God hath truly made to all Men a deed of gift, or a legacy of Chriſt and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him to all that will take him, and therefore he may well be ſaid, to have given Chriſt that the World through him might be ſaved: Having given them Salvation in Chriſt they will have it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:59524:159"/>4. He therefore giveth Chriſt to the World of Unbelievers, that conditionally they may be ſaved: That is, if they will: That is, if they will have Salvation in and with Chriſt. And</p>
                  <p>5. In ſo doing God doth all that belongs to him to do as Legiſlator: For it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that here he ſpeaks thoſe words [<hi>that the World by him might be ſaved</hi>] not as abſolute Lord meerly or properly, but as <hi>Rector per Leges.</hi> And it belongs to him as Legiſlator, only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Salvation, to Man as his end: And to promiſe it on his conditions, and preſcribe thoſe conditions and command Man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them: And to threaten him with the loſs of that end (of Salvation) if he perform them not. But to give Faith, which is the condition it ſelf, doth not belong to God as Legiſlator. (No Man living can claim the firſt Act of Faith, or effectual Grace thereto, from God by any promiſe that he hath made): But he giveth it as <hi>Dominus abſolutus,</hi> and as one that may do with his own as he liſt. So that it is <hi>Finis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptus &amp; conditionaliter datus,</hi> that is here ſpoken of; aud not <hi>Finis Decretus</hi> to be by God eventually infallibly accompliſhed. It is the end of Gods Law, and Legiſlative Will, and ſo of God as meer Legiſlator or <hi>Rector per Leges:</hi> And not of his decretive Will <hi>de eventu,</hi> and of God as abſolute Lord above Laws, without them diſpoſing of his own. (The prediction of Events doth collaterally and <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> belong to his Law: But not <hi>per ſe</hi> and directly.)</p>
                  <p>And 6. Conſider, that if it be never ſo much denied that God hath properly a conditional Will <hi>de rerum eventu,</hi> yet it is beyond all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59524:160"/>
true, that he hath a conditional Will <hi>de debito,</hi> (<hi>officii, Praemii &amp; Poenae</hi>) and ſo his Law is contidional moſt commonly. He hath conſtituted the <hi>Debitum praemii,</hi> the dueneſs of Salvation on condition of believing, loving and ſincerely obeying Chriſt. And therefore they muſt not deny conditional promiſes and threatnings, though they deny conditional, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. This I add, becauſe I know they here uſually anſwer that God intendeth no end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, but where he intendeth alſo the condition it ſelf, that ſo it may be equivalent to abſolute: But he intendeth as Legiſlator that Faith ſhall be the preſcribed means to Glory, and Glory the end promiſed to all that perform that condition; and ſo conditionally giveth it.</p>
                  <p>7. Conſider alſo that even in regard of Gods Will <hi>de Eventu,</hi> our Divines generally with the Schoolmen confeſs and maintain that God hath a conditional Will in this Senſe.</p>
                  <p>That is, that he willeth ſuch a thing ſhall be a condition of the accompliſhing, giving or event of another thing; and ſo that he willeth Faith ſhall be a condition of Salvation: Though nothing be the condition of Gods Act of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. So that <hi>ex parte voliti</hi> it is conditional, though not <hi>ex parte actus volentis.</hi>

                  <p>8. And laſtly, Let it be conſidered that Chriſt being man, we may the better ſpeak after the manner of man concerning him; and ſo aſcribe to him a Velleity, or a VVill which attains not the thing willed in a ſenſe beyond all thoſe ſenſes before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>All this I have laid here together that it may ſerve when the like queſtion or text falls again in our way, and ſo I muſt take leave to refer you hither.

                     <hi>Did he ſend his Son that they might be ſaved?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is anon to be anſwered by it ſelf as a great argument againſt Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and I am loath to repeat one thing
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59524:161"/>
oftener than needs I muſt. Only I ſay, when Chriſt died Millions of Men were actually ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Did God ſend his Son to ſave them that were ſaved already? yes, no doubt: even to do that which he had undertaken to do preſently on the fall, to pay a ſufficient ſatisfaction for the ſins of all, whether ſince that undertaking they be ſaved or damned.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They ſay, Chriſt was appointed for the fall of ſome, therefore not that all and every one might be ſaved, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 34.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Themſelves will faſten no other ſenſe on that of <hi>Luke</hi> but this [God hath decreed to permit many through their own wilfulneſs to ſtumble and fall on Chriſt: and ſo he ſhall by accident, or as an occaſion, be their ruine] Now this is no whit inconſiſtent with Gods ordaining him to be <hi>per ſe</hi> and directly a means for all mens Salvation, in the ſenſe before fully opened.</p>
                  <p>4. They ſay, the end of God in ſending Chriſt was not contrary to any of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; which were eternally fixed concerning the condemnation of ſome for their ſins: Did he ſend his Son to Save ſuch?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. As it is no contradiction for God to command an action, and to decree the non-futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of that action; ſo it is no contradiction for God as Legiſlator by his Law or Teſtament to ordain that Salvation ſhall be to every man the end preſcribed him when he is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe; and faith a means to that end; and to give him Salvation under his hand in his Teſtament on condition of believing; and to purpoſe accordingly that he ſhall be ſaved if he will believe; and yet at the ſame time either
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59524:161"/>
not to Decree to give him Faith, or to Decree not to give him Faith, and conſequently not actually <hi>de eventu</hi> to ſave him.</p>
                  <p>2. Do not theſe men know that they vent all theſe confident zealous inſultings, directly againſt the Scripture expreſſions, as well as againſt ours? Doth not Chriſt ſay to <hi>Hieruſalem, How oft would I have gathered thee, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not?</hi> yet did not God decree their not being ſo gathered? Are you ſure that all thoſe Jews were Elected and Saved to whom <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt. To you firſt God ſent his Son Jeſus to bleſs you, in turning every one of you from his Iniquities?</hi> Or rather, is it not ſpoken of the end of Gods Legiſlative Will, and ſo is meant of a conditional gift? God will ſo bleſs you, if you are willing or reject it not? For by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Iniquity there is meant the work of Sanctification following the firſt act of Faith, and perhaps of Juſtification too. Multitudes of ſuch expreſſions may be found in the Scripture, which I am loath needleſly to tire my ſelf and the Reader with the recital of.</p>
                  <p>The third Text which I ſhall alledge is that of the ſame importance with both the former, <hi>John</hi> 12. 47, 48. <hi>And if any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge the World, but to ſave the World. He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have ſpoken, that ſame ſhall Judge him at the laſt day.</hi> An ordinary wit would think that Chriſt had ſpoken here ſo plain and full as to ſtop the paſſage againſt all ſober exceptions; For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:59524:162"/>1. In the 46 <hi>verſe</hi> Chriſt ſaith, I am come a Light into the World, thereby ſhewing that he is an Univerſal Cauſe, as the Sun is of Light, which is the ſame in its ſhining to all, though ſome are blind, and therefore ſee not by its Light, yet that is not either for want of Light in the Sun, or becauſe it ſhineth differently to one and to the other, but becauſe their Eyes are not capable of enjoying and uſing its Lights ſo is Chriſt as a Satisfier and as the object of juſtifying Faith; though <hi>efficienter</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Faith by his Spirit, he worketh diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</p>
                  <p>2. It is the World into which and among whom Chriſt is ſaid to come as a Light.</p>
                  <p>3. The end of his coming is the conditional Illumination of all. <hi>That whoſoever believeth on me ſhould not abide in darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. This World containeth ſuch as [hear Chriſts words and believe not.]</p>
                  <p>5. Leſt any ſhould have a pretence to think, that the World, which he came to be a Light to, was only the Elect, and thoſe that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not were no part of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he repeateth all again more plainly, ſaying, he came not to judge the World but to ſave the World.</p>
                  <p>6. To put all out of doubt that Unbelievers were part of this World that he came to ſave, he addeth the cauſal conjunction [For] proving that, or giving it as a reaſon why, he would not Judge Unbelievers, becauſe he came not to judge the VVorld (what force was in that reaſon, if they were none of that VVorld) but that to ſave the VVorld. VVas it any proof that he would not judge Unbelievers
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59524:162"/>
becauſe he came not to judge but to ſave the Elect?</p>
                  <p>7. Yet that there might be no place for doubting left, he again ſheweth that Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are part of this VVorld that he came not to Judge but to Save, ſaying, <hi>He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words, hath one that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him,</hi> which is plainly oppoſed to the former negation, <hi>I judge him not,</hi> and, <hi>for I came not to Judge the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not what can be ſaid againſt this, but the former objection, that it is only the VVorld of the Elect that Chriſt came to ſave: But I have ſaid enough in anſwer to that, and ſhall, ſay more anon. As for their feigned <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> here are expreſſions plain enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it: and were it granted, it would do them no good; except withal they prove not only that by the VVorld, <hi>v.</hi> 46. is meant the Earth (which yet is unſound) but that by the VVorld in both parts of the 47. <hi>v.</hi> is meant only the Elect; which they will, I think, never be able to prove. And indeed their pretended <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth make Chriſts reaſon to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, and ſo contradicteth the Text.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Text to the ſame ſenſe is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 32, 33, 35, 36, 40, 51, 64, 66. compared; where note,</p>
                  <p>1. That the perſons he ſpake to were many unbelieving murmuring Jews, yea and many of his own Diſciples which yet believed not, <hi>ver.</hi> 60. 61, 64. that is, ſuch as followed him and profeſſed to be his Diſciples; &amp; yet did not hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and firmly believe, and therefore they then
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59524:163"/>
went back and walked no more with him, <hi>v.</hi> 66.</p>
                  <p>Yet 2. Note, That to all theſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. My Father <hi>giveth you</hi> the true Bread from Heaven. For the Bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven and giveth Life to the World; yet <hi>ver.</hi> 36. he tells them, that they believe not, and <hi>ver. 51. I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven. If any man eat of this Bread he ſhall Live forever, and the Bread that I will give is my Fleſh, which I will give for the Life of the World.</hi> Where note, not only that the gift is univerſal for the Life of the World; but alſo that he puts the giving his Fleſh for the VVorld.</p>
                  <p>1. As that which he will do abſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any condition.</p>
                  <p>2. And which he puts in order of nature, before the ſecond act, which is the giving his Fleſh to men to eat (which is the application of the benefits of his death.)</p>
                  <p>3. And then comes their eating or not eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo living or not living after both theſe. At leaſt it is undeniable that Chriſt here gives his Fleſh to more than do take and eat it, even to them that believe not, but forſake him from that day. And therefore the Jews ſay, <hi>ver. 52. How can this man give us his Fleſh to eat?</hi> Now what is ſaid againſt this? The anſwer I find in theſe words in one VVriter [<q>That the VVorld here cannot ſignifie All and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that ever were or ſhould be, is as manifeſt as if it were written with the beams of the Sun, and that becauſe it is made the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Chriſts intendments to purchaſe for them, and beſtow upon them Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59524:163"/>
Now I ask, Whether any man, not bereaved of all Spiritual and Natural ſenſe, can imagine that Chriſt in his Oblation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to purchaſe Life and Salvation for all them whom he knew to be damned many ages before? or who dares affirm once that Chriſt gave himſelf for the Life of them, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that, by his diſappointment do come ſhort of it to eternity? ſo that if we had no other place to manifeſt that the word [VVorld] doth not always ſignifie All, but only ſome of all ſorts, as the Elect are, but this one produced by our Adverſaries, to the contrary, I hope with all equitable Readers our defence would receive no prejudice.</q>]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this be true, I muſt confeſs my ſelf, bereaved of all Spiritual and Natural ſenſe; which yet I am not willing to do, ſeeing by one I ſhould confeſs my ſelf no Chriſtian, and by the other, not a man, at leaſt to have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in exerciſe. This is a heavy charge on all the Fathers, and later Divines and Godly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that differ from this Author. Specially unleſs his Reaſons were ſtronger; for I confeſs his Sun-beams are wholly clouded to me. His firſt reaſon is anſwered briefly already, and muſt be fully afterward by it ſelf. The fleſh of Chriſt was Morally given preſently on the fall, before any of the VVorld was in Hell: and therefore it muſt be phyſically given on the Croſs in time, according to that undertaking which was the moral gift and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>2. His ſecond Reaſon is alſo anſwered fully before, and ſhall be after. If Chriſt give Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all on condition they will receive it
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59524:164"/>
in him, then we may dare to affirm that this is the fruit of the giving himſelf on the Croſs: may we not dare to affirm that God created all mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> that they may live to him and ſo be bleſſed, (as <hi>Urſine</hi> and multitudes of our Divines do affirm) though yet, he knew that man would do otherwiſe eventually? For God commanded him to live to him, and gave him means, and promiſed him everlaſting Happineſs if he obeyed. And why may we not as well ſay Chriſt Redeemed men to Salvation, that yet for rejecting it are not ſaved? As ſhewing themſelves unworthy of eternal Life. But I like not his phraſe, that men come ſhort of Salvation by Gods diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Gods not giving them Faith, nor yet his adjudging Unbelievers to Death, are neither of them to be called his diſappointing them of Life. But becauſe he asks, who dare ſay this? let us next ſee whether the Holy Ghoſt dare not.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Text which I ſhall inſiſt on is 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 1. But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the People, even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction. And</hi> verſe 20, <hi>&amp;c. For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the World through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning: For it had been better for
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59524:164"/>
them not to have known the way of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them:</hi> But it is happened to them according to the true Proverb, <hi>The Dog is turned to his own Vomit again, and the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire.</hi>] VVhereto for fuller ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication add but <hi>Jude</hi>'s words of the ſame men, <hi>ver. 4. Ungodly men, turning the Grace of our God into Laſciviouſneſs, and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>] put all theſe together becauſe they all ſpeak of the ſame men.</p>
                  <p>Now 1. The Text expreſly ſaith, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Lord that bought them.</p>
                  <p>2. That it is the Lord Jeſus that is this Lord, appears,</p>
                  <p>1. In that it is expreſly ſaid in the 20. <hi>ver.</hi> that it was by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, that they eſcaped the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the VVorld.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Jude</hi> expreſly ſaith, <hi>They denied the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. There have been few that have denied God among all Apoſtates in compariſon of thoſe that have denied Chriſt: Nay, it is a great doubt whether it can be proved of any, directly that were in thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>4. Their Apoſtacy is deſcribed by <hi>turning from the holy Commandment delivered to them,</hi> which is called <hi>the way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and to their former Vomit (which muſt needs be the ſtate they were in before they turned Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) and to the mire, after they were waſhed; And this ſtate of Apoſtacy is oppoſed to <hi>eſcaping the pollutions of the World, by the knowledge of the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59524:165"/>
Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo that it is left paſt doubt that it is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that bought them whom they are ſaid to deny. And <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith of them, that <hi>they are twice dead, plucked up by the roots,</hi> by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that after their firſt death, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome kind of new Life by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Note, that here are many benefits which they received, which could not have befallen them, but through the Death of Chriſt; They could no other way have been waſhed, and have eſcaped the worlds pollutions, and have known the way of Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, <hi>They turn the Grace of God into Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs,</hi> therefore it was a ſin againſt Grace: and all Grace is by the blood of Chriſt: yea it ſeems they had themſelves ſome Grace, that is, (Mercy contrary to merit and tending to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery) which they ſo turned into Laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And <hi>Peter</hi> in the next chapter ſhews that their Apoſtacy lay in a not-believing Chriſts ſecond coming, becauſe of his ſeeming delay, and therefore they gave themſelves up to their Luſts, and ſaid mockingly, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> ſo that it is both evident that they were purchaſed by Chriſt, and that it is Chriſt that bought them whom they are ſaid to deny.</p>
                  <p>Yet as plain as the Holy Ghoſt hath here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, what induſtry is uſed to raiſe a Duſt, and compel theſe words to receive an alien ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>1. It is ſaid that <q>all things for Univerſal Redemption are here Uncertain: but againſt it, this is certain.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>2. Redemption is no aggravation of that mans Apoſtacy, that never was an Apoſtate. It cannot be ſaid, that they deny the Lord that bought them, who never denied him: And therefore it is a common aggravation of the ſin of all that do ſin againſt him, and of all their denial that do deny him: but all do not deny him. May not that be an aggravation of theſe mens ſins in particular, which would alſo aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ſins of any other, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral quality of the ſin?

                  <p>2.

                  <p>1. They ſay the Apoſtle inſiſteth on a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the times of the Old Teſtament, and the Falſe Prophets that were then among the People.</p>

                  <p>1. Is not the Compariſon clear, as thoſe falſe Prophets were part of the Typical Redeemed People, ſo are theſe of the truly Redeemed.</p>
                  <p>2. That Typical Redemption out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was not only a Type, but alſo a Fruit of Chriſts Redemption, in its moral being conſidered.</p>
                  <p>1. They ſay the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The third Reaſon is, that [the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms their deliverance to conſiſt in the eſcaping
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59524:167"/>
of the pollution of the World, as Idolatry, falſe Worſhip, and the like, by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, plainly declaring that their buying was only in reſpect of the enjoyment of the knowledge of the truth, but of the waſhing in the blood of the Lamb, he is wholly ſilent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The queſtion is of the ſatisfaction by Sacrifice, whether Chriſt bought them thereby: This Reaſon is from the effects and application, if they had not ſo much as eſcaped this pollution of the World, it would not follow that Chriſt did not buye them by his ſatisfaction, but only that they received not this benefit of it.</p>
                  <p>2. It is eaſier beg'd than prov'd, that Chriſt ſatisfied for none but thoſe that are waſhed by his blood.</p>
                  <p>3. If it had been ſaid that they were waſhed in the blood of the Lamb, had it not been eaſie for the ſame wit to have found another interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? and to have ſaid it was ſpoken but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>4. He that will well prove that God can and doth ſo far relax his Law, as to give all theſe mercies without Chriſt's ſatisfying for them to whom they are given, <hi>viz.</hi> waſhing, eſcaping the Worlds pollutions by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour; yea, clean eſcaping from them who live in errour, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) will do the <hi>Socinians</hi> a greater pleaſure, and ſay more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the neceſſity of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, than ever I ſaw yet done by any.</p>

how prejudice <hi>&amp; ſtudium partium,</hi> prevails in Mens Studies, and how much the Will can command the Underſtanding. When we plead that God doth in pardoning Sin for Chriſt's Sacrifice relax his Law, or diſpence with it, and not properly execute it according to its ſenſe, they ſtifly deny it, and ſay that it is but an interpreting it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> according to its reſerved exception, and that Chriſt's ſuffering was the proper fulfilling of the Law, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they give is, becauſe they think it of flat neceſſity that the Law be executed according to its ſenſe, or elſe it ſhould not be true; or at leaſt God ſhould not be juſt; (even <hi>Eſſenius</hi> himſelf forſakes <hi>Grotius</hi> in this point,) and yet theſe ſame Men will maintain either that God doth without any ſatisfaction at all ſo far relax the ſame Law to wicked men, as to give them all the mercies which they enjoy (<hi>viz.</hi> illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a taſt of the good word of God, and the powers of the World to come, to be made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and believe for a time, and be ſanctified by the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and loved of Chriſt, and clean eſcape from them that live in errour, and to eſcape the World's pollutions, and be waſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) or elſe that God doth this without relaxing his Law, and ſo, that by the rigorous Law of Works Sinners are not deprived of theſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. To the Non-Elect God relaxeth that Law without ſatisfaction, which to the Elect he doth not, yea cannot relax upon ſatisfaction. Theſe things are harder to me than to be well digeſted.</p>

                     </gap>. I am aſhamed unfeignedly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the time when I took up with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation my ſelf, and had the face to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſid.</hi> 1. It was no act of theirs which the Apoſtle mentions, (which profeſſion, though diſſembled, might have warranted him to aſcribe to them, as he may call thoſe Holy, that ſeem to be Holy by profeſſion:) but it is an Act of Chriſt (and his paſſion) long ago performed: He bought them.</p>
                  <p>2. It is not an act aſcribed to them during the time of that profeſſion, while that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion might have better warranted a miſtaking charitable judgment; but it is after by Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they caſt away that profeſſion, and ſo if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we might have indulged a charitable miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken judgment, yet after we may not.</p>
                  <p>3. It is the words of the Holy Ghoſt who is the Spirit of truth, and ſent to lead the Apoſtles into all truth: And ſhall we feign the Spirit of Truth to aſſert a falſehood, meerly becauſe men profeſs that falſehood, and this after they reject that profeſſion. Wicked men ſay Chriſt bought them, and afterward renounce or deny Chriſt,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59524:170"/>
therefore the Spirit of God ſhall write it to the Churches as Gods word, that Chriſt did buy them, even they who once falſely ſaid ſo, but now deny him: O what a bold dealing it is with the Holy Ghoſt to interpret his words thus, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any need or fair reaſon!</p>
                  <p>4. May not a Man by this dealing ſay what he will as the meaning of Scripture? May not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any truth of God expreſly affirmed in Scripture, be ſaid to be ſpoken <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>? God ſaith as Man would have him, and in giving his Laws to be a rule to the World, he ſpeaks untruly, becauſe men ſpeak ſo before him, making their ſpeeches the rule of his ſpeech, which is a rule to them.</p>
                  <p>Blame us not too zealouſly, if we do not ſwallow theſe things ſo eaſily; even meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. ſuch a one, or ſuch a one ſaith ſo.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee why they ſay ſo; for ſure they have ſome ſhew of reaſon why.</p>
                  <p>1. They ſay, [It is the perpetual courſe of Scripture to aſcribe all thoſe things to every one that is in the fellowſhip of the Church, which are proper to them only who are true ſpiritual Members of the ſame, as to be Saints, Elect, Redeemed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. All profeſſed Chriſtians are Saints by ſeparation from the World to the Church Viſible, and Elect or choſen to that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>2. Scripture ſpeaks thus of none but thoſe that ſeem to be ſuch; the Penmen of Scripture therein ſpeaking of men that knew not the heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:59524:171"/>3. But when by denying Chriſt they manifeſt the contrary, doth the Scripture ſay yet that they were Elect Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or rather that they were before of old ordained to this Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</p>
                  <p>4. Why elſe may not we ſtill uſe this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, if it be true that it is the perpetual courſe of Scripture? Be not then offended with us if we write and ſay that Chriſt redeemed by his blood all profeſſed Chriſtians; Nay, then we might ſay <hi>Julian</hi> was a Saint Elect, and ſo was <hi>Judas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>5. I would our Brethren of the ſeparation would ſpeak in the ſame Language when they are judging of Church-Members, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, as they do when they uſe theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt Chriſts Univerſal Ranſom, or at leaſt come near to this charitable vein, laying by the deluſory part.</p>
                  <p>2. But the great prop of this Cauſe is, that they will prove from other Texts that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh thus. And three Texts I find urged, and I may ſafely ſay ſadly abuſed.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 53. <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is called the Holy City, becauſe it was ſo in eſteem and appearance] ſaith my Author.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Muſt we needs take his bare word for this, when we know it was Holy by Gods own ſeparation of it from the reſt of the World, for the principal place of his publick Worſhip, and reſidence of his Church and Prieſts, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated by himſelf? What Man then will believe that it was called Holy, meerly from the Peoples profeſſing to be Holy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:59524:171"/>The Second Text is <hi>John</hi> 5. 18. It is ſaid of Chriſt that he had broken the Sabbath, which he only did in the corrupt Opinion of the blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Phariſees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The words ſeem to ſpeak only of the <hi>Jews</hi> accuſation of him, <hi>i. e.</hi> what they charged him to have done, and not what he did, [therefore they ſought to lay hands on him, not only becauſe he had broken the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>2. Diſtinguiſh between breaking the reſt of the Sabbath naturally (by Natural actions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reſt but without ſin) and breaking it morally by ſin. The former way Chriſt did break the Sabbath, the latter he did not, take this diſtinction from Chriſt himſelf, who tells you, that the Prieſts in the Temple brake the Sabbath (<hi>viz.</hi> the external reſt of it, by labour) and are blameleſs (and therefore broke it not morally.)</p>
                  <p>But the Text that I find alledged moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and confidently by very many Learned Men, is 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 23. (and I deſire God to forgive me, that in my ignorance I have oft ſo abuſed it my ſelf) The words are theſe [For he Sacrificed to the Gods of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> that ſmote him; and he ſaid, becauſe the Gods of the King of <hi>Syria</hi> help them, therefore will I ſacrifice to them, that they may help me] The laſt words are confeſs'd to be the falſe words of the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Idolater <hi>Ahaz;</hi> but all the queſtion is of the former words, which are the words of the Holy Ghoſt [He Sacrificed to the Gods of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi> that ſmote him,] where by ſupine over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59524:172"/>
Men have taken it, as if the Text made this ſmiting the act of the Gods, whereas it makes it the act of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> or the Men of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus.</hi> It was <hi>Damaſcus</hi> that ſmote him, and not the Gods of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> according to the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> render it thus plainly, [<hi>Sacrificavit enim Diis Damaſcenorum percutientium ipſum</hi>] not <hi>Diis Damaſcenorum percutientienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ipſum.</hi> And would one think now that ſo great a ſtreſs ſhould be laid by prudent ſober men, on ſuch an overſight. <hi>Darmeſek</hi> being a collective, the Cities name put for the Peoples (than which nothing more uſual when there is mention of the acts of Cities and Countries) did truly ſmite <hi>Ahaz:</hi> As <hi>England</hi> did ſmite <hi>Scotland:</hi> Or <hi>Rome</hi> conquered ſo much of the World: And <hi>Venice</hi> holds War with the <hi>Turk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. What if it had been otherwiſe? May not God give power to thoſe Devils which were the Gods of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> really to ſmite <hi>Ahaz?</hi> As well as he gave the Devil power to ſmite <hi>Job</hi> a better man.</p>
                  <p>3. And what if all that they ſuppoſed of this Text had been true? If God had ſpoke in ſo ſtrange a language once in all the Bible? If we ſhall thence take liberty to interpret him ſo elſewhere, without proving this to be the ſenſe, we may then indeed make any thing of the Scripture. And though I doubt not but God in mercy will bear with the weakneſs of good men that by the power of prejudice do run on ſuch expoſitions, having a zeal for God, though not according to knowledge, and ſuppoſing
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59524:172"/>
themſelves neceſſitated to it; yet certainly the proper natural tendency of ſuch violent dealing with Scripture is to infidelity it ſelf, and the queſtioning of the truth of Scripture: and if we eſcape that, we lie fair open to the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Popery, to conceit a neceſſity of an Earthly final Judge of the ſenſe of Scripture as being inſufficient to manifeſt its own ſenſe. In the mean time, how do we gratifie Papiſts and Scepticks by this dealing.</p>
                  <p>But inded the Text is plain; though I confeſs the Septuagint; and ſome Tranſlators might give occaſion to ſome of this common miſtake.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Text that I ſhall alledge is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, 6. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once inlightened and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the World to come, if they ſhall fall away to renew them again to Repentance; ſeeing they crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here theſe Apoſtates are ſaid to crucifie the Son of God afreſh <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> It is not barely to crucifie Chriſt again, but to crucifie him to themſelves again: That is, either <hi>finaliter</hi> (as ſome expound it) or <hi>efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (as others) which way ſoever it be, it is not <hi>efficaciter,</hi> but <hi>quantum in ſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. If it be the firſt, then the meaning is this: If ſuch be ſaved, then it muſt be by a new Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſo they bring themſelves into that caſe that Chriſts Death on the terms that firſt it was accepted, will not ſerve to ſave them,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59524:173"/>
(becauſe he died not to ſatisfie for that ſin.) So <hi>Paraeus</hi> expoundeth it; <hi>ſed quomodo hoc faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo Chriſtum denuò crucifigunt ſibimetipſis? Quia filium Dei ſemel crucifixum abnegando, nolunt ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri ejus morte ex qua ſola dependet reſipiſcentia &amp; ſalus. Si igitur reſipiſcere &amp; ſervari deberent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuò crucifigendus eſſet eis Chriſtus; quod eſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, quia amplius mori non poteſt.

Impoſſible igitur eſt eos reſipiſcere &amp; ſervari.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo: <hi>Porro haec ratio eſt cur iterum dicat Chriſtum crucifigi, quia nos hâc conditione illi commorimur, ut meditemur perpetuam vitae novita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. Qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yea <hi>Beza</hi> himſelf who ſeeing what might be ſaid for Univerſal Redemption from this Text endeavours to put in a bar, yet concludeth thus: <hi>Et fortaſſe ſic poteſt iſta ſententia explicari acſi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claretur iſtos non poſſe rurſum renovari, quoniam rurſus oporteret Chriſtum crucifigi &amp; illis ludibriis exponi, quod fieri amplius non poteſt, illo ſemel pro mortuis credituris crucifixo, nec in gratiam iſtorum apoſtatarum rurſum crucifigendo: quam ſententiam ſi amplectamur uti ſane probablis &amp; commoda mihi videtur,</hi> &amp;c.] I will add no more (though many more might be added. Now according to this expoſition it is evident that it is implied that Chriſt died for theſe men: or elſe there ſeems no force in the Argument to prove their ſin unpardonable, and themſelves unrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For the Holy Ghoſt here plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59524:173"/>
that this unrecoverableneſs is the fruit of their Apoſtacy; and that they were not unreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable before they were Apoſtates; and yet the reaſon of their uncureableneſs lies in this, that it is neceſſary to their pardon and cure that Chriſt ſhould die again, which cannot be: Now it implieth that he died for them as they were in their ſtate before Apoſtacy, or elſe on this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it might be ſaid as well that their recovery and pardon was as impoſſible then, and ſo their Apoſtacy ſhould not be the reaſon, but Chriſts not dying for them at all ſhould be it: Which is plainly contrary to the Text.</p>
                  <p>But if any will needs deny this moſt prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able interpretation, and expound it <hi>efficienter,</hi> [that they do as much as they can to kill Chriſt again by their malice and contempt, and making him to be but as a malefactor, do approve of the <hi>Jews</hi> crucifying him] (as <hi>Grotius</hi> and many more expound it) ſtill it intimates that their ſin did put him to Death once before or elſe, what force is there in the Argument? For it ſeems to run thus, [they, that as much as in them lieth, put Chriſt to Death twice (or a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time) are remedileſs: But ſo do theſe Apoſtates, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>Now if their ſin (as the <hi>pro-cauſa meritoria</hi>) had no hand in his Death at firſt, how can they be therefore remedileſs for endeavouring it a ſecond time? For it was but once by them. And if the ſame ſin was pardonable in thoſe that not only in deſire but in act, did put him to Death, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jews;</hi> then it appears that it was a pardonable ſin: And that the ſame ſin,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59524:174"/>
(nay the <hi>Conatus</hi> or meer deſire of it) which was pardonable then, ſhould become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable ſince, as it is a fancy, and hath no Scripture proof; ſo it is apparently falſe, ſeeing it ſuppoſeth that the Law of Chriſt is not now the ſame as then, which is falſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Argument for Univerſal ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this Text affordeth us: Chriſt ſatisfied for all thoſe who are inlightened, and have taſted of the Heavenly Gift, and are made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſome Non-Elect are ſuch: Therefore Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for ſome Non Elect, and conſequently for all.</p>
                  <p>This Argument is urged before, therefore I ſhall ſay little to it. Some anſwer to the <hi>Minor</hi> that it is to be denied, becauſe this Text doth <hi>nihil ponere ſed tantum ſupponere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But it doth not ſuppoſe that which never was nor will be, nor is poſſible. Moſt Interpreters (almoſt all) that are againſt Univerſal ſatisfaction, do expound this Text of thoſe gifts which may and oft are really loſt: The number is ſo many that I will cite none</p>
                  <p>2. It is further ſaid by ſome, that theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits preſuppoſe not Chriſts dying for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This is anſwered already. They that can prove that God can, will and doth give all theſe without ſatisfaction to his Juſtice firſt made, are but a ſtep from <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59524:174"/>
may next ſay, he can and will give pardon without ſatisfaction: And then they are within a ſtep of infidelity, and next in danger of ſaying, that Chriſt Died in vain, ſurely the Holy Ghoſt is given by Chriſt Crucified, and I think only to them for whom he was Crucified. The Devils are not therefore uncurable (for ought any Scripture reveals) becauſe they would put Chriſt to Death, through malice, if it were in their power; nor had they ever theſe fruits of his Death. But according to their ſenſe againſt whom I argue, the Devils might hence be ſaid to be unpardonable as well as Apoſtates. Which is no Scripture Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The 7th. Text, which I ſhall urge is, Heb. 10. 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>For if we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledg of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries. He that deſpiſed Moſes Law, died without mercy, under two or three Witneſſes: Of how much ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden nunder Foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpight to the Spirit of Grace?</hi> Hence I raiſe two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe who receive the mercies here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are of the number of them for whom Chriſt diéd: But ſuch are ſome Non-elect, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The Blood of the Covenant is ſhed before it is ſprinkled, or Sanctifieth (ſhed Phyſically or morally) and it cannot ſanctifie Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59524:175"/>
it is ſhed for them. For Sanctification, being ſome degree of application, preſuppoſeth it ſhed for them: I mean, If by Sanctification, be meant, either ſeparation relative from the World to the Church, and to Chriſt <hi>ſecundum quid:</hi> Or elſe Sanctification real, by giving Men a temporary Faith and other Graces pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, and their eſcaping the pollutions of the World by that Faith. But ſome think that by Sanctification is meant that cleanſing which immediately followed the Sacrifice (the word being uſed from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sanctifyings;) and ſo by Sanctification, ſhould be meant that conditional juſtification, or cleanſing which all Men have immediately from Chriſt crucified before any further Perſonal application. And if this be ſo, then the Caſe is plain and paſt queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The 2d. Argument is from thoſe words [there remaineth no more Sacrifice for ſins, but, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Here the Apoſtle proveth the uncurableneſs and deſperateneſs of their Caſe, in that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more Sacrifice: And this is proper to them when they are Apoſtates. Now if there were never any Sacrifice for their Sins, then this reaſon will prove their caſe no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate ſince their Apoſtacy than before; nor will it prove the Caſe of Apoſtates any more deſperate than the Caſe of all wicked Men for whom Chriſt died not. But that is contrary to the Text. It is either their own ſin or the Elects ſin, or ſome other Mens for whom the Apoſtle ſaith, there remaineth no more Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. If other Mens, then that proves not their
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59524:175"/>
caſe any more deſperate than it was: For a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for other Mens ſins hinders not their Caſe from being deſperate before: Beſides, it is no loſs to them to loſe the Hopes of Life by ſuch a Sacrifice: For they could be no hopes. But it is mentioned here as their loſs, and the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of their Apoſtacy. If 100 Soldiers be taken Priſoners by the Enemy, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prince ſhall Redeem 50 of them by a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and when he hath done ſhall ſend to all the 100 to come to him, and be true Soldiers again; and hereupon they all come (though not all alike affected to him) and he tells them all [if ever you ſleep on your watch and ſo be taken by the Enemy again, or if you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my Colours and perfidiouſly turn to the Enemy, there remains no more Ranſom for you,] would not any Man wonder both how the 50 not ranſomed ſhould come out of Priſon at all? Or why the Prince ſhould tell them, There remained no more Ranſom for them when they were never ranſomed at all? Doubtleſs the Holy Ghoſt doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe Apoſtates to be therefore miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe there remained no more Sacrifice for other Mens ſins: As if you ſhould ſay to a man in a Conſumption, There is now no hope of your Life, becauſe the Phyſitian hath given one effectual Receipt to your ſick Neighbor, and will give him no more.</p>
                  <p>But if it be acknowledged (as it muſt be) that the Text means, there is no more Sacrifice for the ſins of theſe Apoſtates; then it plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates that there was once a Sacrifice for their ſin till they by Rejection, deprived themſelves of the benefit of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:59524:176"/>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> There was a Sacrifice ſufficient for their ſin before their Apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. And was it not ſufficient materially after? Sure according to the opinion of the opponents it was.</p>
                  <p>2. If it were only ſufficient to have been a Sacrifice for them, but was not a Sacrifice for them at all, (which is their Senſe;) then their condition was as remedileſs before their Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as after; and then this could be no part of their miſery procured by Apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p>3. The Apoſtle ſaith not [there remained no more ſufficiency for them in the Sacrifice] but [there remaineth no more Sacrifice.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> They did now fully diſcover that Chriſt died not for them, which was never diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and therefore they are more miſerable.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then all the inconvenience that Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy brought on them was but a diſcloſing of the truth (that they had never any remedy or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for their ſin) a little ſooner than it ſhould elſe have been diſcloſed. But that's a far ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler matter than the Apoſtle intendeth. And then it ſhould rather be ſaid [there is no more ground left for falſe hopes and miſtakes: All this while you falſly thought Chriſt died for you, but now becauſe you have denied him, it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed to you that he never died for you.] In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this Doctrine ſuits well with the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi> fancies, which make our love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

to Chriſt to have no more tendency to Salvation than as meer ſigns and duties.</p>
                  <p>2. The Text plainly intimates the contrary to what this objection affirmeth: For it ſaith not [there is no more falſe conceits of a Sacrifice for ſin] but [there is no more Sacrifice for ſins.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> It was before offered them by the Word and general conditional promiſe: But after their Apoſtacy it is offered them no more; and therefore it is ſaid, there is no more Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It cannot be offered to them, with a poſſibility of their acceptance or benefit, till it be firſt offered for them to the Father: That which is offered is [a Chriſt that hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; with his benefits] A Chriſt that hath not redeemed or ranſomed us, is a gift that would not ſave us, if he were offered by God and accepted by us.</p>
                  <p>2. Indeed Chriſts Sacrifice for ſin was offered only to the Father, and is not at all offered to us. Chriſt himſelf is offered to us, but not as a Sacrifice, but as a Ranſomer, or one that was a Sacrifice offered to God for us, and now would be a Head and Husband to us.

To all this I find no more objections of our opponents; but to the firſt argument which we draw hence they return many words. Which was, both from all thoſe benefits which here Apoſtates are ſaid to partake of, which only Chriſts Blood hath procured them, and ſpecially in that they are expreſly aſcribed to Chriſts Blood: for they are ſaid to have been ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Blood of the Covenant:) Now to this they ſay (to give you the Senſe briefly: For if I ſhould recite and anſwer the maze of words which ſome here uſe, I ſhould provoke the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to throw away all in wearineſs or loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>1. This ſpeaks only of ſome that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Faith of the Goſpel, ſeparated from the World, brought into the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but theſe are not all Men.</p>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59524:178"/>
of all Mankind, yet) the uſe of the point is ſo ſmall, that I will not contend much about it with any.</p>
                  <p>2. They ſay [the Apoſtle doth neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what hath been, nor aſſert what may be, but only adds a commination upon a ſuppoſition of a thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This I anſwered before. I'll ſtand to the Judgment of almoſt any learned Expoſitor on this Text, though againſt Univerſal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>3. They ſay [It is certain that theſe Men made profeſſion of all theſe things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the open renouncing them was a ſin ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous as deſerved all this Commination, though the Apoſtates themſelves had never intereſt in Chriſts Blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What's this to the point? The Text ſaith, they were ſanctified by the Blood of the Covenant, and not only they profeſſed that they were.</p>
                  <p>4. They ſay [it was the manner of the Saints and Apoſtles themſelves to eſteem of all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed initiated perſons, ingrafted into the Church as ſanctified perſons: So that ſpeaking of Backſliders, he could not make mention of them any otherwiſe, than as they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eſteemed to be, and at that time in the Judgment of charity were to be conſidered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:59524:178"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How much doth it differ from the language of Men when they are pleading for Separation? Then they cannot endure to hear that all the baptiſed are called Saints by the Apoſtles and Churches.</p>
                  <p>2. Indeed only thoſe are ſo called that ſeem probably to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>3. And therefore what is this to them that by Apoſtacy into a remedileſs miſery, ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not to be ſo. The Apoſtles will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage known falſhood in the Speeches or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of others, much leſs be the Authors of it, and lead them into it; doth the Apoſtle here pronounce their Caſe hopeleſs and remedileſs, and tell them there is no Sacrifice for their ſin but a fearful looking for of Judgment, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> and doth he at the ſame time perſwade People to believe, that they were ſanctified by the Blood of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it were not true? Even then when it openly diſcovereth it ſelf falſe or is ſuppoſed ſo to do?</p>
                  <p>5. They ſay] if the Text be interpreted poſitively and according to the truth of the thing it ſelf in both parts thereof, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That theſe of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh were truly ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>2. That ſuch may totally periſh, then theſe two things will follow;</p>
                  <p>1. That faith and Sanctification is not the Fruit of Election.</p>
                  <p>2. That Believers may fall finally from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe were truly ſanctified, though not with that Sanctification which is proper to the Elect and ſaved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:59524:179"/>2. No doubt ſuch may and do fall away and periſh. He that denieth this muſt deny to believe Chriſt, who hath expreſly affirmed it in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. That they in whom the Word is not deeply rooted do believe for a while, and in the time of temptation or perſecution fall away. What elſe is our diſtinction between Temporary Faith and ſaving?</p>
                  <p>3. When common Faith and Sanctification is antecedent to ſpecial Faith and Sanctification, and ſo found in the Elect, it is then a Fruit of Election: But when it is found in others, it is no Fruit of Election. And why ſhould they wonder at that, who deny it to be a Fruit of Satisfaction or Ranſom, which is a more Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cauſe then Election is?</p>
                  <p>6. They further ſay [there is nothing in the Text to perſwade that the Perſons here ſpoken of, muſt needs be truly juſtified and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Believers, much leſs that Chriſt died for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That they were illuminated, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſanctified by Chriſts Blood the Text ſpeaks without ſtrained conſequence: (with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. But that they had true ſpecial ſaving Faith, Regeneration or Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, I affirm not. Yet was it true.</p>
                  <p>2. Is it a ſtrained conſequence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</p>
                  <p>1. That he who by Apoſtacy is fallen into that miſery which he was never in before, and other ſinners are not in, that now there is no more Sacrifice for his ſin, had before a Sacrifice? And ſo have other ſinners that be not fallen ſo far as he is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:59524:179"/>2. Or that he who is ſanctified by the Blood of the Covenant, was one whoſe ſins cauſed that Blood? and for whom it was ſhed? If you had proved that it ſanctifieth thoſe for whom it was never ſhed, then you had done ſomething; ſo much for this Text. I had thought to have anſwered all the objections of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary-minded which the Books at hand afford; but I ſhall do far leſs than I thought to do in it, as finding that they are ſo diſordered, wordy and weak, in many, that I ſhall but fill Paper with needleſs Lines, and be tedious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the judicious Readers.</p>
                  <p>The 8th. Text which I will inſiſt on is <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 2, 3, 4, 12, 13. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King, which made a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for his Son, and ſent forth his Servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding, and they would not come: And he ſent forth other Servants, ſaying, Tell them that were bidden, ſaying, Behold, I have prepared my Dinner, My Oxen and my Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: Come unto the Marriage,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then ſaid he to his Servants, the Wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy,</hi> So 12. 13.</p>
                  <p>Here it is agreed on that God is the King: The Wedding feaſt, is Chriſt and the benefits of his Death offered by the Goſpel. The kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Fatling moſt ſay, doth intimate the killing of Chriſt that he may be to us the Bread of Life, and his Fleſh Meat indeed, and his Blood Drink indeed. The Meſſengers are Preachers: The meſſage is the Goſpel Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Offer. Hence therefore I thus argue;
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59524:180"/>
If all the things are ready before hand which upon coming in to Chriſt are to be received, yea and ready for thoſe that refuſed to come, and only their not coming, or not coming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredly do hinder their participation, then Chriſt was a Sacrifice made ready even for all that refuſed to come. But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I mean not that Chriſt was appointed to ſave final refuſers conſidered as ſuch: But he was a Sacrifice for all the Sins of the ſame Men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their final refuſal, and thereby made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for them all thoſe ſaving benefits, which upon coming in they were to receive. This meſſage any Miniſter of the Goſpel may now deliver to unbelievers: Come in to Chriſt; accept him as a Redeemer, Lord and Saviour, and with him pardon and Salvation; for all this is ready: All that is prerequiſite to believing or coming in, is done by Chriſt, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him as a Sacrifice and a Donor of his Teſtamentory benefits; and as far as unſatisfied Juſtice did require: All things that are requiſite objectively to your believing are ready. Now this could not be a truth; if Chriſt had not been a Sacrifice for theſe Mens Sins: For how is all ready when the very firſt and moſt needful thing is unready, that is, an expiatory Sacrifice for ſin? When ſatisfaction to juſtice is unready? Can they make this? Or are they called to make it? Or would their coming in make it, which was not before made? Or would coming in ſerve turn without ſatisfaction? Rather it ſhould be ſaid to them (as to the Devils) come not, for nothing is ready. For where Chriſt is not ready, and ſatisfaction for ſin not ready, there
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59524:180"/>
nothing is ready which a ſinner is called to by the Goſpel. The Cauſe being wanting, all the Effects muſt needs be wanting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> All may be ſaid to be ready, in that Chriſts Death is ſufficient for All.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That's true; and I deſire no more; if you underſtand it as Divines have hitherto done, and as this Text proves it; that is, that it is a ſufficient Ranſom, Sacrifice, Price, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for all. But then this implieth that it is a Ranſom, Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for All. But according to the new futile evaſion, it is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſts Death was only ſufficient to have been a Sacrifice or Ranſom for All, if God or Chriſt had ſo been willing: but indeed was no Ranſom for them at all. For is this making all ready? Is Chriſt any readier for thoſe he died not for, than for the Devils? or than if he had never died at all? VVill you ſend to a Priſoner and ſay, I have paid 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for thy fellow Priſoner that owed but 500 <hi>l.</hi> the ſum is ſufficient to have diſcharged thy debt too, if I had ever intended it, therefore come and receive a diſcharge, for all is ready? Or will you bid your Servant go to all the Town and ſay, I have killed and dreſſed meat enough for you all, reſolving that ſome of you ſhall never taſt of it on any conditions, therefore come now and partake of it all, for all things are ready? The Readineſs that Chriſt ſpeaks of here is ſuch, as ſuppoſeth all things to be ready except receiving by Faith: nothing but coming is wanting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:59524:181"/>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But Faith it ſelf is not ready, therefore Chriſt died not for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> A falſe conſequence which yet bears the whole fabrick of the oppoſers Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Doth not the Text plainly diſtinguiſh here between Faith and all the Benefits that by Faith we are partakers of? Doth it not plainly ſay, that all things (elſe) are ready; when yet Faith in them was unready, for they would not? But the Invitation was come, for all things are ready<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what a ſilly cavil would men put into the mouths of the invited, teaching them to ſay, my coming is not ready; therefore all things are not ready: nay nothing is made ready for me. This Text expreſly diſtinguiſheth between all other things, and coming: and ſo ſhews, that when men will not come, yet all things were ready, and nothing but Faith was wanting to their participation. And therefore Chriſt may be a Sacrifice made ready for thoſe, that have not Faith, and therefore receive him not.</p>
                  <p>2. And you might ſee ſome of the reaſon of this in the Text: The King in one Relation prepares the feaſt: and in a further invites his Gueſts: and in a further compels them to come in; God and the Redeemer as preparer of the feaſt, (which is 1. By ſatisfying Juſtice. 2. By enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the New Law) have made all things ready. But to give Faith belongeth not to him in either of theſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p>2. God and Chriſt as the Inviter of his Gueſts, doth all things requiſite to the invited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:59524:181"/>3. But God as one that reſolveth <hi>de Eventu,</hi> what particular perſons ſhall be compelled to come in, gives that Faith, or ſo compels them. Faith follows this compelling (which, ſay Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters truly and generally, is an importunate prevailing perſuaſion) Now may not God</p>
                  <p>1. Make Chriſt a Sacrifice for all, ready?</p>
                  <p>2. And by Legiſlation or conditional Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, make a free gift of Chriſt to all that will have him?</p>
                  <p>3. And invite multitudes that will refuſe; and yet compel but his choſen only to come in? Here it is that ſpecial differencing Grace begins, in the execution; and it confoundeth men in the whole body of Theology when they will needs ſuppoſe it to begin where it doth not, that is, in Redemption by Sacrifice. All men ſhall one day confeſs, all things were ready: if I would have come in I had been ſaved: it was my own wilful refuſal that deprived me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But why doth not God compel all to come in as well as ſome?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. O man! who art thou that diſputeſt againſt God? May he not do with his own as he liſt? He compelleth ſome from the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance of his Mercy: He inviteth the reſt in great mercy alſo.</p>
                  <p>2. This will be no excuſe to the refuſers: what if God had only invited all, and compelled none? What if he had ſuffered all to periſh in their wilfulneſs? would that have been any eaſe to any? and if he compel ſome, is that any wrong to the reſt? will not Conſcience ſay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

day, I periſh juſtly, that would not be ſaved? muſt I need compulſion to accept of a Redeemer and Salvation with him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is not in my Power to come: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> There's no man that would come that can ſay ſo: if you will you can; yea you do come. If you will not, who will you blame but your ſelf, you may come if you will. As your will-not may be called <hi>a cannot,</hi> ſo it's true, you <hi>cannot:</hi> your <hi>cannot</hi> and <hi>will-not</hi> is all one. As for thoſe men that open their mouths againſt the moſt High, and ſay, that [if God give not willingneſs and faith to men, he doth but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude them to tell them that Chriſt died for them, and to give them Chriſt, if they will.] I intreat them to conſider,</p>
                  <p>1. God hath laid the cauſe of mens perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their own will, ſtill in his word, and will do at Judgment.</p>
                  <p>2. God hath taught all men naturally to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves when their wilfulneſs was the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>3. The light of Nature teacheth all Nations under Heaven to lay the blame on the wilful, and to make all their Laws, and execute all their Judgments on that ground; acquitting men ſo far as they can be diſcovered to have been forced and involuntary, excuſing him that can ſay [I did it againſt my Will] condemning thoſe that did it willingly: Deny this therefore and you deny, 1. The Law of God in Scripture. 2. The Law of natural Conſcience. 3. And
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59524:182"/>
overthrow all Laws of Nature and Nations, and all Churches and Commonwealths. Did ever any ſober Prince ſay, I will not condemn a man for wilful Murther, becauſe he hath not free-will, nor power to forbear it, except God give it him? Or did ever wiſe Judge abſolve an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on that ground? If a VVhore-monger or Drunkard ſo accuſtom themſelves to thoſe ſins that they have contracted a habit, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear them, did ever any Law-giver, Judge or Wiſe man, take that for an excuſe? Or rather for the moſt hainous aggravation of his fault? God and Nature hath taught all men, in their enquiries after the cauſe of ſin, to ſtop at mans Will and lay the blame there. In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat wiſe godly men therefore, that they would not ſhut the very eyes of Nature it ſelf, and overthrow all order of things for their by-conceits; and when they have done to fly in Gods Face with ſuch horrid deſperate unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and preſumption, as to ſay, God deceives and deludes men, if he give a Ranſom for them, and give them Chriſt and Pardon on condition of their willingneſs, except he alſo make them willing. I have before ſhewed it (without any participation with <hi>Pelagius</hi>) that all men that periſh do ſuffer for abuſe of Grace, ſufficient to its immediate uſe and end: and if God will not ſuffer all ſo to periſh, but compel ſome to come in, when he doth but invite others; our Eye muſt not be evil becauſe he is good. He deals mercifully with all, but more mercifully with ſome: thoſe therefore ſhall for ever glorifie his Mercy, and the reſt be

                  <p>The 9th Text is <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 27, 32, 34, 35. <hi>Then the Lord of that Servant was moved with compaſſion and looſed him and forgave him the Debt.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then his Lord after that he had called him ſaid unto him: O thou wicked Servant, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave thee all that debt becauſe thou deſiredſt me: ſhouldſt not thou alſo have had compaſſion on thy fellow Servant, even as I had pity on thee? And his Lord was wroth and delivered him to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him. So likewiſe ſhall my Heavenly Father do alſo to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his Brother their treſpaſſes.</hi> Here it's plainly ſaid by Chriſt himſelf, that the debt was forgiven him, who afterward periſhed. Whence I argue <hi>ab offectu ad cauſam,</hi> therefore Chriſt died for him. For without Blood there is no remiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Two things are ſaid againſt this. 1. That <hi>Theologia parabolica non eſt Argumentativ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> And I am ſure that Chriſt's Theology is not deluſory or falſe. If he taught by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, then his Parables were and are teaching; and if teaching, then we may argue from them. But conſider, though it's certain that nothing in Parables is to be ſtretched beyond the intent, yet this is the plain ſenſe and intent; Chriſt ſhewing that thoſe that have received mercy for their own ſins, muſt forgive others, or elſe they ſhall periſh as ungrateful for what they had received, and as unmerciful to others.</p>
                  <p>1. It is twice over expreſly ſaid that, [he forgave him the Debt.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:59524:183"/>2. The effect followed, he looſed him, <hi>viz.</hi> from Priſon.</p>
                  <p>3. It is the aggravation of his following ſin, to be ungrateful for his own pardon; and there is no ingratitude poſſible, if it had not been true that he received that mercy himſelf.</p>
                  <p>4. Chriſt expreſly openeth and applieth all this to his own Diſciples, ſaying, ſo alſo will my Heavenly Father do to you, if you from your Hearts forgive not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that it is paſt doubt that this forgiveneſs was real.</p>
                  <p>2. The other objection is this: Thoſe that are forgiven never fall away or periſh: and therefore this parable is not ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The text ſaith plainly, the debt was forgiven: and therefore it is certainly true. There is a fourfold forgiveneſs of ſin; which I deſire may be well obſerved. Firſt, upon Chriſts undertaking to ſuffer, and ſo his moral ſatisfying, God the Father as the offended Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator of the Law of Nature, remitted his right of puniſhing and advantage of honouring his Juſtice, meerly on that ground, and in that Relation; ſuſpending the obligation of that Law, and delivering up the ſinner and all his Debts into the full power or hands of him that Redeemed him, giving him authority to give remiſſion to whom he pleaſed on terms of Grace: ſo that as Chriſt and not man did ſatisfie Juſtice; ſo it ſeemed moſt meet to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, that Chriſt and not man himſelf ſhould be the firſt receiver of the pardon and other benefits: but with this difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:59524:184"/>1. Chriſt receiveth them <hi>eminenter in poteſtate conferendi,</hi> as <hi>he hath power to confer them on the Redeemed:</hi> But we receive them from Chriſt <hi>formaliter,</hi> in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>2. Chriſt receiveth them for our good; It is not the pardon of any ſins of his own that he receiveth. But we receive them for our own good. So that <hi>God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son: and he that hath the Son hath life:</hi> God hath put a Pardon for us into Chriſts hands, in giving him this Power: and Chriſt muſt be the conveyer to us, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his Power, For as the <hi>Father Judgeth no man,</hi> but <hi>hath committed all Judgment to the Son;</hi> ſo he Abſolveth no man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Abſolution to the Son: For Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is one half of Judgment. That is, God as the Rector according to the meer Law of Nature, and as meer Creator, on the firſt ground judgeth no man: But now he judgeth all as Redeemer on terms of Mercy, by him that Redeemed us; and ſo Abſolveth.</p>
                  <p>So then the firſt pardon of ſin, was in <hi>Potentia Remittendi,</hi> virtual, put into the hand of Chriſt only, for his Sacrifice and Satisfaction; and not to the ſinner immediately himſelf.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond Pardon, is by Chriſt thus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized: and it is by him as Donor, Teſtator or Legiſlator of the new Law: and it is, [A Grant of Remiſſion of ſins to All men, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they will accept him and pardon with him] ſo that this is Chriſts firſt pardoning act and this is but a conditional pardon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not yet full, and actual.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:59524:184"/>3. The third Pardon of ſin, Is Chriſts actual Pardon upon the performance of the condition: which is not by any new phyſical act, but by a new moral act of the former Law or Grant; which till now was ſuſpended, upon the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of the condition: it being the Will of the Legiſlator or Donor, that his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould not act or remit ſin till men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
                  <p>4 The fourth Pardon and moſt full, is that by the abſolving Sentence at Judgment, by Chriſt as Judge when our ſins ſhall be blotted out, when that time of refreſhing comes, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Act.</hi> 3. Theſe four are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral acts tending to the full perfecting of our Pardon and Juſtification, and are all called Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and muſt all proceed in this order one after another.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the third of theſe, or the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt remiſſion in this life, is of divers ſorts or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, according to the <hi>Termini à quibus.</hi> the divers ſins or penalties Remitted: As is the ſecond alſo. From thence therefore we muſt next diſtinguiſh of Remiſſion, as we did before from the nature of the remitting act: For the word [Remiſſion] of ſin, ſignifieth the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Obligation to Puniſhment; and ſo doth conſtitutive Juſtification too: But the term Juſtification reſpecteth more ſtrongly [the obligation] diſſolved; and the word [Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] more ſtrongly reſpecteth [the Puniſhment] to which we were obliged; not that Remiſſion doth only reſpect the Puniſhment (as ſome miſtake) and not the obligation at all; but it chiefly reſpecteth the Puniſhment. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59524:185"/>
it is both <hi>Obligationis Relaxatio vel Remiſſio, &amp; Poenae Remiſſio,</hi> but moſt properly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally the laſt. And therefore it is a right di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of Remiſſion, which is taken from the diverſity of the Penalties remitted.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore Firſt diſtinguiſh of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we may the better diſtinguiſh of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. And before that let us define Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Puniſhment <hi>Actually</hi> taken, <hi>Punitio,</hi> is. The Action of a Governour depriving an Inferiour of ſome natural good, becauſe of ſome fault by him committed (or becauſe of ſome Moral Evil.)</p>
                  <p>Puniſhment <hi>Paſſively</hi> taken, <hi>Poena</hi> is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſome natural good, Inflicted for the deſert of ſome Moral Evil.</p>
                  <p>The Matter of Puniſhment is Natural Evil: and therefore the firſt thing intended by the Inflicter is, <hi>ut noceat patienti;</hi> that it may hurt the Sufferer, and ſo may have the Matter of Puniſhment. The form, is its Relation to a fault, <hi>viz.</hi> that it be [becauſe of ſome Moral Evil:] The end is [the demonſtration of Juſtice] this end enters the difinition of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in General, and is common to all Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The other ends proper to each <hi>Species,</hi> are to be fetcht from the definition of that <hi>Species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt <hi>quoad Materiam</hi> Puniſhment is of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>1. Some Puniſhment is deſtructive to the ſinner: and ſome is leſſer, conſiſting in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of ſuch good, whoſe loſs is tolerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:59524:185"/>2. <hi>Quoad finem,</hi> ſome puniſhment is for the Demonſtration of Juſtice moſt eminently and principally; and that is either</p>
                  <p>1. When there is all Juſtice in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>utmoſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and no remitting mercy.</p>
                  <p>2. Or when the remitting mercy is ſmall comparatively, and Juſtice is moſt eminently demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>2. Some Puniſhment is for the demonſtration of Juſtice conjunct with a far greater and more eminent demonſtration of Mercy. This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called [Chaſtiſement] yea, [Paternal Chaſtiſement] becauſe of tenderneſs and Love that accompanieth it; though indeed it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to a Maſter, a Prince, or any Rector to Chaſtiſe, as well as a Father. God puniſheth in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>I. Rebels, or Unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>1. To Reſtrain them.</p>
                  <p>2. To Reclaim them.</p>
                  <p>1. From Total Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>2. From a ſeeming Religiouſneſs, or half Chriſtianity, to Sincerity.</p>
                  <p>3. From particular Sins.</p>
                  <p>II. True Believers, his Adopted Sons.</p>
                  <p>1. To weaken their Corrupt Inclinations, and ſtrengthen their Holy Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>2. To raiſe them from particular falls, and excite particular Graces into lively exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>3. Remotely.</p>
                  <p>1. To fit them for great Works.</p>
                  <p>2. To fit them for greater Glory hereafter.</p>
                  <p>3. To Glorifie his Power and Grace in their ſuſtentation, and deliverance.</p>
                  <p>4. But ſtill the end of Puniſhment as ſuch,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59524:186"/>
or of the Evil that is in it, is the demonſtration of Juſtice in ſome meaſure, however modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prevailed over by Mercy; even Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Chaſtiſe their Children in Paternal Juſtice, but with a prevailing Love; and Vindictive it is, though not in that rigorous Senſe, as the firſt mentioned ſort of puniſhment is Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive.</p>
                  <p>And as Remiſſion muſt be diſtinguiſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of the penalty remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo alſo in reſpect of the ſins remitted. (Though to remit Sin, and to remit puniſhment is all one) for it is,</p>
                  <p>1. Either the whole general Maſs of Sin paſt, and preſent, habitual, and actual, (beſides Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal imputed Sin) which is remitted at once, (which is at our firſt Repenting and Believing ſincerely.) This is called Univerſal Remiſſion, or Juſtification: Or elſe</p>
                  <p>2. It is particular ſins of Act, Omiſſion, or Habit, that are remitted to one who had all the ſins of his Unregenerate State pardoned before, and was diſpoſed to this Actual, as being Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Penitent, and Believing. This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Particular Remiſſion, or Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in regard of the obligation, diſſolved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion muſt be diſtinguiſhed: For it is either the penalty of the Law of Works (which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all Believers.)</p>
                  <p>2. Or the Penalty of the Law of Chriſt (which it obligeth men to for non-performance of the Conditions of the Law,) which is remitted to no man; ſome who ſay the Law of works is totally abrogated, do call this laſt [the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59524:186"/>
ſentence of Chriſt's Law] as diſtinct from the former, which they call [the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſentence of Chriſt's Law,] but all comes to one in ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Remiſſion muſt be diſtinguiſhed <hi>quoad jus ipſum,</hi> or its very form Into.</p>
                  <p>1. Inceptive, or Remiſſion given at firſt.</p>
                  <p>2. And Continuate, or Remiſſion confirmed and continued; (which requireth a continued mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral action of the remitting Law or Grant, and more than the continuance of our Faith, which was the Condition of inceptive Remiſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> The addition of ſincere obedience, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof.</p>
                  <p>By all this it may appear that remiſſion of ſin is variouſly diſtinguiſhable, and not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in one and the ſame ſenſe wherever we find the word in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe I have run ſo far in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will add ſome Concluſions in application of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1. In the firſt remitting act (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſo far remitteth ſin as to let go his <hi>Jus Puniendi,</hi> as <hi>Rector ſecundum legem operum</hi> meerly, and giveth up all into the hands of the Redeemer, to give out remiſſion as he pleaſe on terms of Grace) in this act, I ſay God doth remit all the ſins of all mankind, as they are againſt the Law of works. Of this are meant thoſe Scriptures which ſay [Chriſt having purged away our ſins, aſcended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. And that he took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſins of the World, and that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing to them their iniquities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="358" facs="tcp:59524:187"/>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. In the ſecond remitting act (by which Chriſt firſt gives out pardon according to the power given him) Chriſt the Redeemer and the Father by him, doth forgive conditionally all ſins to all men, except what the very nature of the Condition excepteth, <hi>viz.</hi> The Non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſaid Condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 3. Neither of theſe Acts, or any fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, do remit the proper, <hi>viz.</hi> final non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Conditions of remiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 4. In the third act, Chriſt doth actually remit to every true Believer all the deſtructive Penalty of all his ſins paſt or preſent, and all that Penalty whatſoever which proceedeth from the intention of demonſtrating Juſtice above Mercy, or prevailing or rigorous Juſtice, commonly called vindictive in a more rigid reſtrained ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 5. It is not only the Eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but all the temporal puniſhment which is of the fore-deſcribed Nature, which Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to every Believer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 6. At the ſame time he diſpoſeth him to the daily receiving of a daily pardon for daily ſins, both in that his former ſins being all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, his perſon is Accepted and Adopted, and his Soul habituated to that Faith and Repentance which is the Condition, and poſſeſſed of the Spirit, which maintaineth theſe Graces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 7. Yet are not his ſins actually pardoned before they are committed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 8. Inceptive Remiſſion is actual, and equal to abſolute (as to the preſent poſſeſſion of it) as ſoon as men believe; but as to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it, both Univerſal and particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59524:187"/>
are ſtill but Conditional till death, and the Condition of Continuance (as is beforeſaid) is more than the Condition of our firſt obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 9. That Men loſe not Juſtification or Remiſſion, therefore comes not from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, nor the Tenor of the Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Grant, which being Conditional, ſuppoſeth ever the poſſibility of the Non-performance of the Condition: (alas, more than poſſibility,) but it comes from the good pleaſure of God to maintain that Grace in his Elect which he hath given them, ſo far as to ſee infallibly that they perform the Condition of continued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Remiſſion and Juſtification, by cauſing them to perſevere, and overcome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God as Legiſlator (in Precepts, Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Threats, and Rewarding Promiſes) doth ſtill deal with all Men as defectible, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the poſſibility of their falling away from Grace, and periſhing. But God as Eternal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, and Determiner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Events by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, dealeth with all his Elect as Men whom he reſolveth infallibly to Save, and whoſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy is, though poſſible, yet <hi>non futura,</hi> a thing that never ſhall be; yea, in reſpect to the power of any Enemy to deceive them by overcoming God's preſerving grace; ſo the deceiving or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of them is properly impoſſible, as well as not future (as Chriſt himſelf tells us.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 10. It is evident therefore that Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Juſtification are not perfect in this lifie, both in that many ſins are ſtill behind to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and from whoſe guilt a particular Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is neceſſary to be added; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59524:188"/>
the very continuance of the Juſtification and Remiſſion received is but Conditional; and a Conditional Grant is not ſo perfect as an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, or when the Condition is all performed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 11. That puniſhment which man was ſentenced to <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. after his fall, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer inflicteth in this Life on merciful terms (where there is a greater demonſtration of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than vindictive Juſtice, which is commonly called corrective puniſhment or chaſtiſement,) is never wholly remitted to any, even of the Elect themſelves in this Life. All Men muſt eat their bread in ſorrow, and be ſick and dye, and the Earth is ſtill curſed with barrenneſs for our ſakes, and the remnants of God's frowns, and want of Communion with him, and want of more Grace and Spirit from him, and of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our Sins, are all ſad puniſhments which the Elect muſt here undergo. As for thoſe that ſay that none of theſe are puniſhments, I have elſewhere confuted them at large.</p>
                  <p>1. They contradict expreſs Scripture.</p>
                  <p>2. And Orthodox Divines.</p>
                  <p>3. They underſtand not the definition of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, elſe would they know that Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a <hi>Species</hi> of it. Nor is it true that they ſay, that God hath taken away all the evil of Affliction, but only he hath taken away the Deſtructive Evil, and introduced or added a greater prevailing good, which yet this Evil muſt (and that but by accident) produce. It is eſſentially <hi>quoad materiam, malum naturale</hi> ſtill; <hi>&amp; quoad formam</hi> it is <hi>propter malum morale.</hi> So that <hi>quoad Receptionem peccatoris patientis,</hi> as to our Reception, Remiſſion of Sin is not <hi>omnibus

numeris</hi> perfect in this Life, there being ſtill ſome unforgiven Puniſhment to be ſuffered here.</p>
                  <p>Hence you may ſee how to judge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ſo much agitated between us and the Papiſts, <hi>Utrum Remiſſd Culpa remaneat poena temporalis?</hi> Whether Temporal Puniſhment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main when the Sin is forgiven: (And how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly that queſtion is commonly handled; <hi>etiam per magni nominis Theologos (Detur Venia cenſurae neceſſariae.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As merciful corrective Puniſhment is not all remitted in this Life, to any of the Elect, ſo Sin it ſelf is to them ſo far unremitted, as the puniſhment is unremitted. I weigh not the Clamours that ſome will make againſt this Aſſertion, who uſe more zealouſly to aſſert the Dictates of their Leaders, than the words of God; and to ſearch and learn what the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox ſay, than what God ſaith, or the Nature of the thing containeth. Hear the Scripture, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 42. [<hi>We have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tranſgreſſed, we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, thou haſt not pardoned.</hi>] This was ſpoken by the Prophet in his own name, and the name of all God's People, the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe of their Temporal Sufferings.</p>
                  <p>Abundance of the like importance might be cited from Scripture, but this is not the place. Methinks thoſe <hi>Antinomians</hi> ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Doctrine, who (falſly) teach, that that it is only Temporal Puniſhment or Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Believers Pray againſt, when they daily Pray, <hi>forgive us our Treſpaſſes</hi> (as the moſt moderate of their Books do affirm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:59524:189"/>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 12. This imperfection in Remiſſion of Sin here, comes not from any deficiency in Gods Love, or Chriſts ſatisfaction, but from God's Wiſdom (in the right giving out of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) and Man's State, and the nature of the work. Yea, <hi>in ſenſu activo,</hi> in reſpect of God as meer Legiſlator of the Law of Works, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion may be ſaid to be perfect; that is, <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in ſe in illa Relatione,</hi> he hath perfectly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned it, by quitting all his right of puniſhing, into the hands of the ſatisfier. From whom he <hi>receives,</hi> to him he <hi>delivereth.</hi> But Chriſt ſeeth it meet to give it out to us on Conditions, and by Degrees; and we are not at the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree 'till the end of all, at Judgment; (even the Remiſſion it ſelf, and not only the manifeſtation is thus given by Degrees.) And ſo it may be longer coming to us, and be ſtill paſſively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect through our incapacity. As a King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Ranſom for a Priſoner, may agree when all the Ranſom is paid, that yet he ſhall be delivered but by Degrees, or upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 13. Yet ſome and many Degrees of the foreſaid Corrective Temporal Puniſhment are remiſſible, and Chriſt hath Conditionally promiſed to remit them in this Life.</p>
                  <p>He having now the inflicting of all Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment committed to him (<hi>John</hi> 5. 22.) hath threatned more in his new Law to ſome (yet diſobedient) than to others; and promiſed more forbearance and tender dealing to ſome than to others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 14. But this is not by ſo Univerſal and unreſerved a promiſe, as the Remiſſion of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59524:189"/>
Deſtructive puniſhment, and as Salvation is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by: But it is by a Promiſe with Exception or Reſerve: As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, [Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily you may expect to ſmart moſt, when you ſin moſt, and to be remitted and eaſed moſt, (<hi>Conſideratis Conſiderandis,</hi> taking one thing with another) when you pleaſe me beſt: But yet I reſerve my <hi>Jus Dominii,</hi> yea, and power of puniſhing even the beſt, as ſhall ſeem meet to my wiſdom, for publick good, or prevention of Sin not yet committed, or manifeſting my Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Power, or Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] So that mark here;</p>
                  <p>1. That ſtill this is puniſhment, and for Sin, (if we had nothing but Original Sin) when it is abſolutely conſidered, why God puniſheth the beſt; it is for ſin. But when it is asked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, why he puniſheth <hi>Job</hi> more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is not for Sin, and therefore in the Comparative Senſe, that is, oft rather to be called Affliction, Perſecution, (as from Men) Tribulation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in the Abſolute ſenſe, muſt ſtill be called Chaſtiſement, or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>2. Mark that this Goſpel Promiſe of Mercy, and remiſſion of Temporal Corrective Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in part, is properly a Conditional Promiſe as it reſpecteth God's ordinary dealing with Men, but it is not an infallible aſcertaining Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as to this or that particular Perſon, though they do perform the Condition: becauſe (as is ſaid) it hath, beſides the Condition on our part, certain Exceptions and Reſerves on Chriſt's part; (from hence you may ſee how to anſwer the Queſtion, whether we muſt pray for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59524:190"/>
Deliverances, Abſolutely, or Conditionally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 15. As all Puniſhments on the Elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Converſion (while yet God hateth them as Workers of Iniquity, and they are Children of wrath) are not of the firſt ſort (in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prevailing Rigorous Juſtice) but moſt commonly Merciful Chaſtiſements, (for they are oft the happy occaſions of their Converſion, yea, powerful means thereto:) So the like muſt be ſaid of the Non-Elect themſelves, who are but in the ſame ſtate, even they are the ſubjects of tender Chaſtiſement, and in a gracious ſenſe God is oft called their Father in Scripture, tho' not in that ſpecial ſtricteſt ſenſe as he is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Adopted, as not giving them that ſpecial Grace, but common only. The Reaſon is, becauſe though God have unequal Intentions <hi>de eventu,</hi> in Chaſtiſing the Elect, and the Non-Elect, yet</p>
                  <p>1. He doth demonſtrate more Mercy than Rigorous Vindictive Juſtice even in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Non-Elect, and therefore their Puniſhments are ſuch Chaſtiſements.</p>
                  <p>(Proved 1. Elſe they ſhould not be guilty and accuſable for loſing the Fruit of merciful Corrections, when indeed it is a main mercy that they ſhall periſh for not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p>2. Elſe God would not make it the matter of a threatning to correct them or ſmite them no more (that is in that ſort) becauſe they revolt more and more, which yet he doth, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Puniſhment being the Action of a <hi>Rector</hi> as ſuch, and not of <hi>Dominus Abſolutus,</hi> an Owner as ſuch, (and ſo not formally and directly the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59524:190"/>
act of God, as determining of events by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Decrees,) therefore they are to be ſpecified and denominated from Rectoral ends, (which I call the ends of God's Legiſlative Will) rather than from the ends of God's Secret Decrees <hi>de rerum eventu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 16. Hence it follows, that God may and doth remit much Temporal Puniſhment (both deſtructive and corrective,) even to the unregenerate (both Elect, and Non-Elect) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an eaſier way to give the ſame mercy, which elſe he might have given in a ſharper way; and ſo far he may be ſaid to remit or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give their ſins: Though yet the Deſtructive E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Puniſhment being not forgiven, it is not fit in ordinary Speech to ſay, that ſuch mens Sins are forgiven, without a limiting reſtrictive explication, becauſe they are forgiven only <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid,</hi> and in the weakeſt Senſe.</p>
                  <p>I have on occaſion of this Text run quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my firſt intentions in opening the nature and ſorts of remiſſion, but yet I hope not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably.</p>
                  <p>From all this now it may appear, that as there are ſeveral ſorts of Remiſſion, ſo divers of them are Reverſible and common to thoſe that periſh for ever. And now to the Text in hand.</p>
                  <p>1. It is apparent that this Text ſpeaks of ſome of theſe ſorts of Remiſſion.</p>
                  <p>2. And that it ſpeaks of a Remiſſion rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or which may be conferr'd on thoſe that afterward periſh. And though I preſume not to determine which of them it is that is here meant, yet</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:59524:191"/>3. It is certain that which ever it be, it is the fruit of Chriſts blood ſhed for them to whom it is given, for without blood there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. The Law of Works remitteth not, for it relaxeth not its own obligation. And God relaxeth it not but upon ſatisfaction, as a valuable Conſideration. And therefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed by the New Teſtament in the blood of Chriſt, for that Teſtament is founded in his blood. But for the ſenſe of the Text, I judge that the Forgiveneſs there mentioned, is the ſecond and third ſort; that is, the Conditional Univerſal Grant of Pardon by the New Covenant; (for the Covenant is the ſame in its Tenour to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and Believers; there is no real change in it when men believe, only the ſame inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth then morally act, that is, actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin, which before it did not, becauſe it was ſuſpended on a Condition which was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But Chriſt hath done his part as Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, Donor, and Legiſlator before in making the Grant.) And ſo it is applicable differently to different Perſons. To thoſe that have only the Conditional Remiſſion, and have not yet performed the Condition; it tells them even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually what ſhall be their miſerable caſe if they do not perform it (which too oft comes to paſs.) To them that do believe, and ſo are inceptively Juſtified and Pardoned, Chriſt ſpeaks as a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator and Teacher, ſuppoſing the poſſibility o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> their not performing the Condition of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Juſtification, and tells them what will be their miſery if they perform it not though yet he may, as to the event, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs 
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59524:191"/>
Decree to cauſe them effectually and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly to perform it.</p>
                  <p>Seeing I have ſpoken ſo much here of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſhall refer you to it, when I come to ſpeak of other Texts of the like ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>I might here add (leſt any upon any other Interpretation of this Text, ſhould think it of no weight) that other Scriptures do expreſly aſſert ſome kind of Remiſſion to the Wicked, upon their half Repentance; as to <hi>Ahab,</hi> the <hi>Ninivites;</hi> thoſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. that were Sanctified by the Blood of the Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> purified; and thoſe <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 20. [I have pardoned them according to thy word] ſaith God of the whole People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, forbearance of Puniſhment, with hope and means for Everlaſting Eſcape, is a ſort of Remiſſion. Thoſe that ſay this Remiſſion needed not the Sacrifice of Chriſt's Blood to procure it, do ſay that which they will never be able to prove.</p>

                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:59524:193"/>2. And indeed God is not a Saviour of all Mens Bodies in danger, by any obligation at all, that I know of. No, though they be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſuffer injuſtly: He doth what he doth of this kind for unbelievers arbitrarily: Let any Man ſhew where God is engaged by any Covenant to ſave unbelievers from bodily dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But their Souls he hath redeemed by Chriſt, and ſo ſaved them <hi>quoad pretium:</hi> And he hath made a Deed of Gift of Chriſt and Eternal Life to all, on condition they refuſe it not. So that he may in reſpect of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo in a fuller Senſe, be called their Saviour in Spiritual reſpects than in temporal; for all that they are not eventually ſaved. The word Saviour here implies ſuch a Relation as God hath undertaken, and that Men may aſſure themſelves he will perform all that belongs to it: Or elſe it could not be the ground of our confidence. But wicked Men have no promiſe for, or aſſurance of an hours Life, or any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deliverance whatſoever; no, not though it were never ſo good for them: For God will not be in Covenant with them for common things till they firſt accept of his Covenant of Grace in Chriſt. But for Salvation, he hath made them a conditional promiſe, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                  <p>3. And it is leſs probable that the Apoſtle calls God a Saviour here ſo equivocally, as not to mean in the ſame kind of Salvation, when yet he intimateth no difference in the Text.</p>
                  <p>4. But let us ſuppoſe all this were as the opponents would have it, yet for ought I can ſee the Text will fully prove the point in queſtion.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59524:194"/>
For even in temporal reſpects God is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of no Man but thoſe whom Chriſt died for. For all Men have forfeited all his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are under his Curſe: And he can be no Saviour to them according to the tenor of that curſing violated Law. It muſt be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the New Law or Covenant, or not at all: And the New Law is founded in the Blood of Chriſt, ſhed for thoſe to whom it is made. Indeed according to the firſt Law he may uphold the Life and Being of Sinners: But it is only as he doth the Devils, to make them capable of puniſhment. But neither do we for that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> call him the Saviour of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, nor would it be any ſuch great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Paul</hi> and all Chriſtians in labour and ſufferings for godlineſs ſake. So that even this Temporal Salvation, doth preſuppoſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation or Non Execution Plenary) of the Law of Works: And that is done only by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Law of Grace; and that preſuppoſeth Chriſts Blood ſhed, or undertaken to beſhed for the ſinners. I know nothing more that needs to be ſpoken to, for vindicating this Text.</p>
                  <p>The 11th Text ſhall be 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 9, 10. 11, [For this is the witneſs which he hath teſtified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witneſs in himſelf. He that believeth not God hath made him a Lyar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son: And this is the Record, that God hath given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son: He that hath the Son hath Life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:59524:194"/>Hence I thus argue: If Eternal Life in Chriſt be given to unbelievers (who make God a Lyar, and have not Chriſt or Life) then Chriſt was firſt given on the Croſs as a Sacrifice, for thoſe unbelievers. But the Antecedent is true: Therefore ſo is the Conſequent. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Chriſt died for more than the Elect; and therefore for all.</p>
                  <p>1. I Suppoſe none that is not willing to be deceived will maintain that it is only ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers as afterward ſhall be converted, and are Elect, who are here ſaid to make God a Lyar: For the Record which they are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here for not believing, is the object pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to Elect and not Elect without ſuch Diſtinction, as they are all conſidered in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſinful Mankind.</p>
                  <p>2. As for the <hi>Minor,</hi> or Antecedent of the <hi>Major</hi> propoſition, it is very plain in the Text. If all men ſhould believe (who hear the Goſpel) that Eternal Life in Chriſt is given them, and thoſe that believe it not do make God a Lyar, then it's certain that Eternal Life in Chriſt is given to them all. But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> There is nothing here to be queſtioned, but only who are meant in the term [Us] when it is ſaid [God hath given [Us] Eternal Life.] And it is plain that it is the ſame perſons (included with others) who are charged with making God a Lyar.</p>
                  <p>1. Elſe their Unbelief ſhould conſiſt only in not believing that Life is given to other men; and conſequently the Faith required of them ſhould conſiſt only in believing that God hath given Life in Chriſt to others; without any
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59524:195"/>
incluſion of themſelves. But that is not true. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The falſhood of this conſequent, is proved thus.</p>
                  <p>1. True ſaving Faith is of a Receiving or Applying nature, as it is the act of the Will, and it is introductory thereto as it is the act of the Underſtanding. But believing that God hath given Life in Chriſt to other men, is not receptive nor applicatory, nor introductory thereto. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> All our Divines againſt the Papiſts do fully maintain the <hi>Major.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Devils and the moſt deſpairing men have not ſaving Faith. But the Devils and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing men do believe that God hath given Eternal Life to others: therefore to believe that God doth give that Life to others is not ſaving Faith.</p>
                  <p>3. True ſaving Faith is of greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Believer (as to the object of it,) as being the means of his Salvation. But the believing meerly what God giveth to other men, is of no ſuch concernment to any, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> It is not Saving Faith that is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; nor any act that is proper to a true Believer; nor is it the want of that which is here condemned: But it is the not believing the Truth of the Goſpel, which is only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory act, and which the Devils themſelves may have, who believe and tremble: For though this meer aſſent will not ſave, yet the want of it will condemn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Saving Faith hath two parts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59524:195"/>
to the Souls faculties, which have each their ſeveral Offices about this ſaving object: the one is the aſſent of the Underſtanding: the other is the conſent of the Will, (and affiance thence following) when ever Juſtifying Faith is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture, it is uſually by one of theſe acts alone; ſometime one, and ſometime another. And when one only is expreſſed, the other is ſtill implied. And ſo it is in this Text.</p>
                  <p>2. Aſſent is true ſaving Faith, though not the whole of ſaving Faith.</p>
                  <p>3. It is not meerly aſſent to this propoſition in general [the Goſpel is true] that is here made the Record of God and object of Faith: nor yet aſſent to this [Jeſus is the Son of God, and Saviour of Believers.] But it is this [God hath given us Eternal Life, and this life is in his Son:] ſo that it is to believe that God hath made ſuch a Deed of Gift of Chriſt to us; that is, to Mankind, including our ſelves. Now no Devils do believe this; nor can ſay [God hath given us Eternal Life]</p>
                  <p>3. And where it may be ſaid that Wicked men may believe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> It is true, but not with that deep, intenſe, effectual, operative Belief, which is ſavingly ſincere when the Scripture requireth believing, and condemneth for want of it, it always implieth the neceſſary modification, even that the Act be in ſome meaſure anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of its object. It ſtill means [ſincere, cordial believing] though it do not alway expreſs it; (nor were it convenient ſo to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59524:196"/>
do.) And ſo undeniably doth this Text. And this Aſſent no wicked man can have.</p>
                  <p>4. The Text plainly evinceth the falſhood of the objection, and ſhews that it is a ſaving Faith that is here mentioned, and is oppoſed to the Unbelief here condemned. For it ſaith [He that Believeth hath the witneſs in himſelf] which beyond diſpute is the Holy Ghoſt, which is Chriſts great witneſs in the World, eſpecially in the Souls of Believers. And it is the Holy Ghoſt in ſuch a kind as is common to all true Believers; or elſe the propoſition were not univerſally true; And this muſt needs be, if not only, yet chiefly, the Holy Ghoſt illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſanctifying. And to this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Unbelief directly oppoſed in the next words, [He that Believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar.]</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved thus: It will not ſtand with Gods Juſtice to puniſh one ſin twice, or
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59524:196"/>
to puniſh twice for one ſin; the firſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being a full ſatisfaction for that ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God can require no more: But Chriſts ſufferings were a full ſatisfaction for every ſin of thoſe perſons for whom he ſuffered: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The Satisfaction was full.</p>

                  <p>2. As to God who was offended; he being fully reconciled, or well-pleaſed, with the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for whom the Satisfaction was made, and not only conditionally or in part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the main Argument urged by Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> and moſt others againſt Univerſal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and which prevaileth moſt with thoſe of that way, ſo far as I can find: But it is grounded on an unhappy ignorance of the Nature of Satisfaction, and a confounding of ſatisfaction and ſolution of the proper Debt; and a ſore miſtake about Chriſt's undertaking and performance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solutio ipſius debiti, ſtrictè ſic dicta,</hi> the proper diſcharge of what was due, was <hi>ſupplicium ipſius Delinquentis,</hi> and of any other in his ſtead (as I have proved before:) The Law did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Threaten the Innocent, nor make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Surety. And therefore Chriſt did not fulfill the Law, in Suffering as he did in Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or the Law was not properly fulfilled on Chriſt in his Suffering. Satisfaction is taken ſometime generally, for the fulfilling of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deſire: and ſo a Believing, Repenting, Obedient perſon, may be truly ſaid to ſatisfie God himſelf. But this is not all the ſenſe of the word
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59524:197"/>
as it's now in queſtion with us in the preſent caſe.</p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes it is taken ſpecially, for a debtors ſatisfying his Creditor (not by ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and deprecation, but) by ſuch a ſufficient way, as that the Creditor ſhall be no loſer by him. From a Creditor and Debtor it is by tranſlation applied to a Rector and Delinquent. In this ſpecial ſenſe Satisfaction is taken.</p>
                  <p>1. Sometime more looſely and largely for the Payment of the proper Debt: the ſame with <hi>Solutio ipſius Debiti.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>2. More ſtrictly and properly: For the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the Creditor by giving him as good a thing, or taking ſuch a courſe as that he ſhall be no loſer, though the Debt be not paid. And in this ſenſe is the word Satisfaction or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily uſed, as its proper ſtrict ſenſe, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe being one of them too general, and the other improper and looſe. And ſo Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is commonly by Lawyers and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men defined to be <hi>Redditio aequivalentis, alias indebiti:</hi> or <hi>ſolutio vel Redditio tantidem:</hi> and it is contradiſtinguiſhed from <hi>ſolutio ſtrictè ſumpta;</hi> which is <hi>ejuſdem quod debetur.</hi> And ſo in Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Caſes, the Puniſhment of the Offender is the <hi>Ipſum Debitum,</hi> and not properly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Comminatory part of the Law; (though all Puniſhment may be called a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as to the Preceptive part of the Law, becauſe it is not the <hi>ipſum quod debetur,</hi> as to the Precept, but ſomething to provide that the Law and Lawgiver loſe not by the delinquent:) But if any other ſufficient means be found which, without the Puniſhment of the offender, may provide for the Indemnity of the Law-giver,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59524:197"/>
and the publick good, and this both for what is paſt by reparation, and for time to come by Prevention, that ſo the main ends of the violated Law may yet be attained, this is ſatisfaction to the Lawgiver; Satisfaction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuppoſeth the non-payment of the Debt: And in Criminal Caſes (as ours is) ſatisfaction ſtill ſuppoſeth the Duty, or Puniſhment, or both to be overpaſſed which the Law required. The Puniſhment of the Delinquent himſelf, (which may be called a ſatisfaction to the Law) ſuppoſeth that the Precept was violated, by Omiſſion or Commiſſion. The puniſhing of another for us, or any other ſuch Satisfaction, ſuppoſeth the Delinquent himſelf not to be puniſhed. So that it muſt needs be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by all true Chriſtians, that Chriſt did not only ſatisfie for our not obeying, but for our not ſuffering the Puniſhment threatened by the Law, and ſo due to us for our diſobedience: yea moſt directly did he Suffer for our not Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and ſo ſecondarily for our Sinning. Further it muſt be remembred, that <hi>ſatisfactio eſt ſolutio Recuſabilis; ſed ſolutio ejuſdem eſt non recuſabilis;</hi> The Creditor or Rector may chuſe to take ſatisfaction, by receiving the value in another kind: But he cannot refuſe the proper Debt, unleſs by remitting it freely: He can require nothing elſe but the Debt: Moreover, ſatisfaction being a refuſable payment, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor may take it on his own terms, and there muſt intercede a New Agreement for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of it, and if the Satisfier will not come to the Creditors terms, he may refuſe it, as no ſatisfaction: whereas if the Debt it
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59524:198"/>
ſelf be paid, he muſt <hi>ipſo facto</hi> acknowledge the Debtor acquit and to be no longer a Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: The like may be ſaid in the Puniſhment of a Delinquent. To apply all to the caſe in hand: Chriſt was not the offender, therefore Chriſts Sufferings (as is ſaid before) were not the fulfillin; of the Law; but ſatisfaction to the Law-giver. His Satisfaction ſuppoſeth that no man was himſelf Puniſhed when Chriſt ſatisfied (morally by undertaking his natural ſuffering) nor ever was to be puniſhed meerly on the old ſcore; that is, meerly for violating and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the penalty of the firſt Law, by God as Rector according to that Law. God might have refuſed to accept Chriſts Sufferings as a Satisfaction for Sinners; much more, to have freely provided it out of his own Treaſure, as it were; when God therefore did freely him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf provide a Satisfaction, and freely Accept it, He did both only on theſe terms; that [as Legiſlator of the ſtrict Law of Works as ſtanding without remedy, he would puniſh no Man, but yet he would not actually and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely diſcharge them, for they are ſtill his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and now by a double right and bond, <hi>viz</hi> both of Creation, and Redemption, and therefore muſt ſtill be governed by him, and therefore muſt ſtill be Governed by Laws, and therefore muſt ſtill be under Precepts, Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, Promiſes, and Threatnings, which are the Parts of the Law. For the Nature of Man is ſuch, as that it muſt be governed not meerly by Commanding, but alſo <hi>per Praemia &amp; Poenas,</hi> (Experience tells us that of the beſt Men on Earth) as propounded to them; therefore

God in mercy would make a New Law, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manding all men to repent, and (that hear the Goſpel) to Believe; and giving to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the actual pardon of all their Sins on theſe Conditions, making Chriſt the Fountain of our Life, and Head of all that ſhall be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Ordaining that Chriſt, and with him Pardon and Adoption, and the Spirit, (for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sanctification) and Salvation, ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all that will take Chriſt, and that thoſe that refuſe him ſhall be unpardoned for all his Sacrifice and Satisfaction, and ſhall moreover incur a far ſorer puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the terms on which God took Chriſt's Sufferings as ſatisfactory to his Juſtice, which terms are well pleaſing to the Son him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor did he ever deſire to ranſom them on other terms, or to bring them into any other Condition, than under this his own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Laws, nor to convey Pardon and Glory (the Fruits of his Death) to any that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him; (ſtill ſuppoſing his Everlaſting ſecret Decree of procuring his choſen infallibly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Conditions, and partake of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which belongs to another part of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.)</p>
                  <p>Alſo it muſt be well obſerved (as the very Principal Point for avoiding the common Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in this buſineſs) that the ſatisfaction is made to God as <hi>Legiſlator,</hi> and ſo <hi>Rector per Leges;</hi> and ſo hath its main direct reſpect to his Legiſlative Will. His Will <hi>de Eventu</hi> is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Antecedent to it, and the Cauſe of it as Event: But his Law was the cauſe or occaſion of it, as due or morally neceſſary; and alſo there
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59524:199"/>
are no Acts of his Decretive Will <hi>de Eventu</hi> cauſed by it, but there are Acts of his Laws (and ſo as to our manner of conceiving of his Will <hi>de Debito</hi>) cauſed by it; and ſo it was not for Chriſt's Death that God decreed to give Faith to any, and conſequently to give actual Pardon and Glory: But God Decreed to give theſe for Chriſt's death, when he ſo gives them: And it is becauſe of Chriſts death that they are due; though not immediately from his death, but <hi>mediante donatione Teſtamenti vel faderis,</hi> Chriſt's death is the Cauſe of Faith, but not of the Decree to give it.</p>
                  <p>Again it muſt be underſtood, that it is not God as Legiſlator of the New Law, that is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for Sin by Chriſt's death, that were to dye to ſatisfie himſelf, the Mediator, for the Non execution of his own remedying Law: But it is God as Legiſlator of the Law of Works; conſtituting Everlaſting Death the due Penalty of every Sin: Or if any had rather ſay, that it is not formally the Law of Works which is now in force, conjunct with the Law of Grace, but it is become part of the Law of Grace; the matter comes all to one ſenſe, though we change the words: There is one Law that ſaith [<hi>He that Sinneth ſhall dye,</hi>] call it what you will; this Law as to the end Chriſt hath ſatisfied, <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath properly ſatisfied the Law-giver: There is another Law (or as they call it, the peremptory part of the New Law) which ſaith [<hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be Saved, and he that believeth not ſhall be Damned;</hi>] Chriſt hath not ſatisfied the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of this Law by his Sufferings. The ſenſe of the Commination is [<hi>He that in the time of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59524:199"/>
this Life believeth not ſhall be Damned.</hi>] This Law is ever executed on all that are guilty, and by it obliged to Everlaſting Death; that is, on thoſe that in their life time here, do not Repent and Believe. For the violation of the precept of this Law, as it requires Belief, or other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the preſent time, Chriſt did dye, but not for the non-performance of the Condition which Death is threatned to.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is therefore certain that Chriſt dyed not for the Sin of Final Impenitency (in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent degree) and unbelief, or Final Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt himſelf, or his Father.</p>
                  <p>And therefore when I ſaid before that he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed God as Legiſlator of the Law of works, for ſin as ſin, it is to be underſtood of the Law of Works, as <hi>contradiſtinct</hi> from the Law of Grace; and ſo all the ſins peremptorily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law of Grace, are excepted from the ſatisfaction: Not only (nor at all) becauſe they are the ſins of ſuch Perſons, but becauſe they are ſuch excepted ſins, who ever the perſon be.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore to the Argument, and firſt to the Major, I deny it, and never ſaw any fair colour of proof of it; and therefore (having full plain Scripture to the contrary) do confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believe, that all thoſe are not Saved that Chriſt ſatisfied for; and to the Proof brought I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It is untrue that Chriſt ſatisfied for every ſin of every Man for whom he ſatisfied; and it will never be proved. He hath excepted all thoſe Sins which are comprized in the final non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of the Condition of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:59524:200"/>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> None that he ſatisfied for are ever guilty of that, and that's the Reaſon why he may not be ſaid to dye for ſuch Sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's denyed, and to be better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before it can be received, by Sober Men. I have already proved that he dyed and ſatisfied for thoſe that are final Unbelievers, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and ſo periſh. And I now prove that the Reaſon why Chriſt ſatisfied not for ſuch ſins (as final Impenitency, Infidelity, or Rebellion) is not accidental from the ſtate of the Redeemed, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe none of them are guilty of ſuch; but it is directly from the Nature of the ſin, without reſpect to this perſon more than that.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt have expreſly excepted the final non-performance of the Goſpel Conditions from among the number of thoſe ſins which he hath ſatisfied for, and that even in the New Law which he hath enacted for all (Elect, or Non-Elect,) then it is not only accidentally, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not found in thoſe he ſuffered for, but it is directly <hi>à volunt ate Dei Redemptoris &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Natura peccati,</hi> becauſe God would not accept, nor Chriſt give any ſatisfaction for that kind of Sin, (or for any ſin ſo qualified or circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,) but the Antecedent is certain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I prove the Antecedent thus: It is the very Nature of every Condition added to any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Condonation, Premiant Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it be or contain an exception of the Non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that Condition from among the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of thoſe things that are given, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, conſtituted, due, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Becauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59524:200"/>
is to ſuſpend the Gift 'till it be performed.) But the New Law or Teſtament as made to all (Elect, or Non-Elect) doth conſtitute this its Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> That all that will be Juſtified, Repent, and Believe, and take Chriſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and thankfully for their only Lord and Saviour; and that all that will be Saved do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere herein, and in adding further ſincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God's Laws: Therefore by making theſe the Conditions, the Law excepteth the non-performance thereof from among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe things that are given, forgiven, or granted thereby. And Conſequently theſe ſins are excepted from among the ſins that Chriſt bore on the Croſs, or ſatisfied for: For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever kind of ſin he hath ſatified for, he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Pardon of it, Conditionally at leaſt, (and that in his Law to them to whom his Law is made,) ſo far is he from making an expreſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of that from among the number of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſins: But theſe he excepteth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that number.</p>
                  <p>If a Man by Legacy give you <hi>1000l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> on Condition you pay his Heir out of it an <hi>100l. per annum,</hi> Rent: Here this <hi>100l. per annum</hi> is expreſly excepted from the Sum gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe the payment of it is required as the Condition of enjoying the reſt.</p>
                  <p>If a Man to whom you owe <hi>1000l.</hi> make you an Acquittance and Diſcharge, on Condition you pay him a Penny in token of thankfulneſs, here that Penny is plainly excepted from among the number, or from the Sum given, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:59524:201"/>If a King paſs an Act for the pardoning of all Offences committed againſt him, on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Men will thankfully acknowledge his Clemency; here the not acknowledging it thankfully is plainly excepted from among the number of Faults Pardoned.</p>
                  <p>2. Moreover this Law being thus conſtituted for all, (Elect as well as others) it is undoubted, that if we may ſuppoſe an Elect man to be guilty of final unbelief, or impenitency, it would be to him an unpardonable ſin, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Chriſt dyed not for it..</p>
                  <p>If you ſay, this is not to be ſuppoſed, I Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>1. It is <hi>ſupponendum,</hi> though not <hi>ponendum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Holy Ghoſt ſuppoſeth it poſſible (<hi>etſi non futurum</hi>) in that the Law is made to them as well as others; and in that he expreſly requires them ſo oft to take heed leſt they fall, and come ſhort of the Promiſed Reſt, through unbelief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore we alſo may put ſuch a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Do not thoſe that oppoſe us in this, uſe ſo to Expound ſuch Scriptures, frequently, both about Redemption, and when they Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt the Apoſtacy of the Saints; and ſay it is ſuppoſed only; but <hi>Suppoſitio nil ponit in eſſe:</hi> Moreover the Scripture makes it plain, that theſe Sins of Total Apoſtacy, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable (becauſe uncurable) Sins, are in them for whom Chriſt dyed: For <hi>they bring on themſelves ſwift Deſtruction, by denying the Lord that bought them: They tread under foot the Blood by which they were Sanctified, and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to the Spirit of Grace; and ſo there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59524:201"/>
no more Sacrifice for</hi> (their) <hi>Sin, but a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looking for of Judgment.</hi> So that is is plain that Chriſt dyed not for all the Sins of all Men for whom he dyed, excepting by his new Law, the final <hi>Non-performance</hi> of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Promiſe, in whomſoever without exception. Yea, Chriſt's real giving all Men under his hand the Pardon of all their Sins, on Condition they Repent and Believe; ſhews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt, that he bore on the Croſs all their other Sins, but bore no Man's final Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, or Unbelief.</p>
                  <p>2. And the other Principle, which is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Argument of Chriſt's ſatisfying God to a full Reconciliation) is as falſe as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in the beſt Senſe needs cautelous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                  <p>1. It is certain that no Man is actually recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, Pardoned or Juſtified 'till he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, (or others Believe for him, as Infants at leaſt ſo far as is revealed,) God ſtill hateth all the workers of Iniquity, and we are all by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Children of Wrath. By receiving Chriſt, we receive power to become the Sons of God, and by Faith only are we juſtified, and not before we believe: And who but the <hi>Antinomians</hi> will ſay the contrary?</p>
                  <p>2. The end to which God (as Legiſlator of the Old Law) accepted ſatisfaction, was that the impediments of Remiſſion being taken out of the way, he might (without any derogation from the honour of himſelf, or his Law, and without fruſtration of the ends of that Law) give out in a New Law, a Free Pardon and Salvation with Chriſt to all that will accept
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59524:202"/>
them. So that the end of ſatisfaction as ſuch, and not any accidental or collateral effect muſt direct us to judge of its extent and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.</p>
                  <p>3. To this end Chriſt hath made full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God's Juſtice, and Mens After-Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are not from any defect in Chriſt's ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. God hath granted a Pardon under his hand to all that will accept it in and with Chriſt, and for Mens final rejecting of Chriſt and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he received no ſatisfaction. God may not be ſaid properly to be conditionally ſatisfied: He is ſatisfied actually and abſolutely, as far as ever he required ſatisfaction. But the Benefits of that ſatisfaction are only conditionally given out to the Ranſomed, and not abſolutely. If it be objected that God is ſo far ſatisfied as to give Faith it ſelf, which is the Condition to all for whom he is ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>anſw.</hi> 1. It is untrue: and never was prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor ever will be.</p>
                  <p>2. Faith is a remote effect of Satisfaction, and not the proper direct effect: It floweth not from Satisfaction as Satisfaction; but from Satisfaction as connexed with Election, as I ſhall anon more fully open, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader, to peruſe what we ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely write of that point by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I deny therefore their great <hi>Medium,</hi> that [God cannot in Juſtice puniſh one ſin twice] that is [for one ſin] (for it is not the ſin that is puniſhed, but the man for the ſin.) Though I eaſily grant that if the violated Law be once fully executed, it cannot be again or in a double meaſure executed (for that's impoſſible as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59524:202"/>
a contradiction: for it is no execution of the Law, which goes beyond the ſenſe of the Law.)</p>
                  <p>But conſider 1. The Law was not executed on Chriſt in his ſufferings; and therefore may well be executed on all Unbelievers in their own damnation. Chriſt did by his Sufferings only pay, as it were that which is a valuable conſideration, for the non-execution of the Law as to all that will perform the conditions of the Goſpel or New Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Did not Chriſt bear the Curſe of the Law for us, that he might Redeem them that were under the Law?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, he bore the Curſe of the Law Materially; that is, that Curſed Death which the Law threatned; But he bore it not <hi>ex for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali Legis obligatione, ſed tantum ex obligatione ſponſionis propriae, &amp; precepti paterni;</hi> The Law obliged us to puniſhment, but it never obliged Chriſt to Puniſhment; only its obliging us to it, was the occaſion of Chriſts Obligation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it occaſioned him to Oblige himſelf by his own voluntary ſponſion, that he might free us. But ſtill it was only his own ſponſion that obliged him (together with that peculiar will of his Father, that he ſhould undertake and diſcharge our debt;) ſo that you ſee the Law is but once executed, even on the Damned (as to full execution, for mans mortality and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings here, are a ſmall part of the Execution which Chriſt ſaw it not meet to take off.) And ſo the <hi>ipſum Debitum</hi> is paid but once; Chriſts
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:59524:203"/>
Sufferings being not <hi>ſolutio ejuſdem, ſed ſatisfactio, i. e. ſolutio aequivalentis alias indebiti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Nay, conſider further, that the equivalency lay not in the proportion of Puniſhment (pain or loſs) equal to that which was due to all or to the Elect; but in the ſufficient aptitude of that Degree or Puniſhment, which Chriſt bore (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a publick ſpectacle of ſhame, for the demonſtration of Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Dignity of the perſon, to be a means to Gods obtaining the remote ends of his Law, (<hi>viz.</hi> the demonſtration of Juſtice, and right governing the Creature, and preſerving the Authority of the Lawgiver) though the neareſt ends of that Law were not attained (<hi>viz.</hi> the perſonal obedience of man, and for want of that, his perſonal ſuffering.) Many Learned Divines have written largeiy to prove that Chriſt did not properly ſuffer the pains of Hell on his Soul; I will not meddle much with that queſtion; But doubtleſs it was a very great part of our puniſhment which Chriſt was uncapable of undergoing; much leſs may any dare to affirm that his Sufferings Materially were as great as All the Sufferings of All that he died for ſhould have been. The Death due to us was Temporal, Spiritual, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The Temporal Death is ſo much the leaſt, that many Divines will not be perſuaded that it hath now to the Godly any nature of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is only materially a ſuffering. The Spiritual Death, ſo far as it conſiſted in the loſs of Gods Image, and privation of Holineſs, and Dominion of Sin and Slavery to Satan, Chriſt bore not at all. Nor yet as it lay in any Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59524:203"/>
or Gripes of Conſcience, which are the fruits only of perſonal proper guilt, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Folly, or Wilfulneſs, or Negligence, or Unkindneſs, or the like Evils manifeſted in Sinning. Chriſt had no ſin of his own to look on to torment him: and other mens Sins could not procure to him the gripes of a Guilty Conſcience. Nor yet was his Soul or Body ſo deprived of Gods Love as are the wicked, nor ſo hated by God, nor at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united from God: For upon the loſs of Union with God, and Spiritual Communion with him, would have followed, the loſs of Grace, and depravation of the Soul, and prevalency of ſin: nor yet were any of Chriſts ſufferings Eternal. Yet did he endure that debaſedneſs and publick ſhame, and that forſaking of God by the denial of Spiritual Comforts, and by giving him up to the Will of his Enemies, and by an inward ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure, in trouble of Soul, which was a full ſatisfaction to Juſtice, or a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſufficient for God to do what he did, upon the reception of it. But you ſee that <hi>quoad Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riale poenae</hi> there was much difference between Chriſts Sufferings and the Damneds in Hell.</p>
                  <p>3. Conſider Chriſts ſufferings being not <hi>ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ipſius Debiti</hi> but <hi>ſatisfactio;</hi> as is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, therefore it was <hi>ſolutio recuſabilis,</hi> God might have choſen to accept it; and there muſt intercede, as it were, a new agreement for its acceptance. Now God did accept it, and Chriſt ſuffer it only on theſe terms, that none ſhould for all that have the Pardon of his ſins, till he accepted Chriſt as his Lord Redeemer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his ſins: and this is the true reaſon why
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59524:204"/>
Chriſts Satisfaction, is no hinderance to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of thoſe that reject him and his favours.</p>
                  <p>4. The Satisfaction of Chriſt is ſufficient and perfect <hi>ad ſuum finem,</hi> to all its own ends, but not <hi>ad omnem finem,</hi> to every uſe and end: and it was not its uſe and end to acquit <hi>ipſo facto</hi> any ſinner, but only to acquit all on condition of Repenting and Believing, (it being alſo the full intent of God to give that condition to all his Elect, as ſhall be anon opened.) Some very Wiſe, Godly, and Learned men that I have ſpoke with, wiſh that the Word [Satisfaction] had been never here uſed, but inſtead of it the terms of [an Expiatory or Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:] becauſe the laſt is the Scripture phraſe and the firſt is not: But yet Satisfaction is no ſuch unfit term but that it may well be uſed, though ſtill Scripture phraſe I confeſs is better.</p>
                  <p>5. As Chriſt hath ſatisfied the Father, ſo the Father hath ſatisfied Chriſt (in the larger ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath fulfilled his deſire.) It was not man himſelf that ſatisfied, but Chriſt for man; nor did Chriſt ſatisfie in our perſon, as a delegate pays a Debt in the Debtors name, ſo as in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe <hi>Civiliter,</hi> it is the Debtor himſelf that pays it; For then it ſhould have been <hi>Solutio</hi> not <hi>Satisfactio;</hi> There being no <hi>Vicarius Poenae</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Law, it is indeed impoſſible, for ſuch a ſolution to be made; For it ſhould be the <hi>Idem</hi> and not the <hi>Idem quod debetur, quia non naturaliter per eundem,</hi> and conſequently not <hi>civiliter per eundem.</hi> Yet a ſatisfaction may be made by ſuffering <hi>alterius loco;</hi> and ſo Chriſt did. But as Chriſt ſuffered in his own perſon, <hi>viz. Sponſoris,</hi> and not our ſelves; ſo the effect that
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59524:204"/>
he deſired was, that he might himſelf be the firſt <hi>Recipient</hi> of the fruits of that ſatisfaction (in that ſenſe as he is capable of receiving them) that he might be the Head and the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of all the Mercy procured by his Death; and being made Lord of all, might give them out to whom, and when, and how he pleaſed; and in ſpecial, that he might make a general Deed of Gift of himſelf, and Pardon and Salvation to All that would accept it, and might ſend forth the Spirit and Word to bring in men to himſelf in what meaſure he pleaſe; and in particular in an infallible prevalency to his choſen: And that none might periſh merely on the old ſcore, or be judged meerly by the Old Law; but all ſtand or fall according to their improvement or abuſe of recovering Mercy. And all this God hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon granted to his Son: And ſo he hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his ſatisfaction; though many that he hath ſatisfied for do periſh.</p>
                  <p>6. Beſides conſider, though men be puniſhed for the ſame ſins that Chriſt ſuffered for, yet as to God, the ſame do become new ſins, and ſo men ſuffer for them as it were, as for new ſins: For,</p>
                  <p>1. The old Obligation was ſo far made void or diſabled, that of it ſelf it could never more bind them to puniſhment, by reaſon of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a remedying grant.</p>
                  <p>2. God did <hi>quantum in ſe</hi> as Legiſlator of the old Law, forgive them all the debt, (except the ſins of non-performance of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which God ſtill excepted and Chriſt never ſuffered for) for God hath delivered the obligation out of his own hand (as ſtanding in

He hath alſo made a free Deed of Gift of an Univerſal Pardon, to all that will accept it. So that though men be not actually pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet God may conveniently be ſaid to have pardoned them, in that he did his part as <hi>Rector ſecundum Leges.</hi> As he ſaith to <hi>Iſrael, I have healed thee and thou art not healed.</hi> When a true Believer is actually Pardoned, God doth put forth no new act to Pardon him, but doth it by the general Grant or Act of Oblivion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he Pardoned All men conditionally as well as them. The Law, ſaith a man, hath done a thing or given a benefit when he hath done his part, though the effect follow not, and the Work be yet undone: For Moral Cauſes may do all their part, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et the effect not follow, for want of the performance of conditions in the receiver, or becauſe con-cauſes do not their part. And therefore if the effect follow not, the Law enquires, Who it is long of? Whoſe fault was it? if of the Patient or Receiver, then the Donor or Agent is ſaid to have done the thing, though yet it be not done. For as to him <hi>moraliter vel Civiliter</hi> it is done: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no default on his part. If any ſay that God followeth not the Rules of Humane Laws. I anſwer, God is the Fountain of all right Laws, and Reaſon, and Juſtice, and I ſpeak not of any unjuſt or miſtaking Laws. This is an ill pretence for men to judge their Maker by; when they will not allow him that reaſonable apology, nor make that conſtruction of his
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59524:205"/>
ways according to common undeniable equity, as they will do of the ways of men. Right Reaſon, and the Laws made thereby, are a beam of Gods perfect Wiſdom and Juſtice. If any ſay that God doth not <hi>Totum quod ad ſe attinet,</hi> all his part, in making a Deed of Gift of Chriſt and Pardon, and Glory, to all that will accept it, unleſs he alſo give Faith which is the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it ſelf. I ſhall now only ſay this much (till we come to the point by it ſelf) that God doth <hi>Totum quod ad ſe attinet ut Legiſlatorem vel Rectorem juxta Leges,</hi> all that belongs to him as Rector according to Laws; (though not all that belongs to him as abſolute Lord and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of events and all Creatures.) And it is in that Reſpect, <hi>ſub</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Rectoris</hi> that Chriſt made ſatisfaction to him, and not in the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of an Eternal-Elector or Abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary and Diſpoſer of all.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee now that <hi>quoad Deum</hi> all men are pardoned all their ſins (except thoſe excepted in the conditions of the Grant,) though <hi>quoad delinquentis Receptionem</hi> they are ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned. They may have Chriſt and Pardon if they will. And when they are deprived of the Gift meerly becauſe they will not have it, no Reaſon can ſay, God did not give it, or Chriſt did not procure it, or that God is unjuſt in that they are without it. So that it is not now meerly the obligation of the firſt Law, as unremedied that binds them over to puniſhment, nor as it is in the Hands of God as Creator or Rector <hi>ſecundum Legem operum;</hi> but it is the Obligation of the new Law primarily (He that believeth not ſhall not be forgiven nor be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59524:206"/>
and conſequently of the Old Law, as the obligation is in the Redeemers hands to be charged only on the Rejecters of Grace. It is not primarily for ſin as ſin, according to this Law; [Whoſoever ſinneth ſhall dye,] but it is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily for Rejecting the Remedy, and then that ſin, by neceſſary conſequence remains unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: ſo that it is not directly becauſe they were guilty of Death by the firſt Law, but <hi>propter rejectam Remiſſionem</hi> for deſpiſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that guilt. So that <hi>quoad Deum</hi> it may be called the return of Sin or Guilt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and ſo to be more properly <hi>ex novd obligatione</hi> from the New Obligation of the Law of Chriſt, binding all their ſins again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; though as to them and their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is both from the New Obligation and the old. And therefore <hi>Jude</hi> calleth ſuch, twice dead, and pluckt up by the Roots. If an hundred Traytors be condemned, and the Prince Ranſom them all at a Price, agreeing in the payment of it, that they ſhall now be all his own, and none of them be delivered for all that, who will not thankfully own him and acknowledge his favour: Here it is juſt that all the Refuſers of Pardon yet periſh: And their Death is directly for the refuſing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and ſecondarily from their old crime becauſe they would not have it remedied. So that though <hi>Materialiter</hi> they loſe but one Life, yet it may be ſaid that the Life they now loſe, <hi>Civiliter</hi> is not the ſame that before they loſt; but it is <hi>vitam de novo donatam,</hi> a Life newly given them, for they were dead in Law, and the King gave them a new Life, <hi>Moraliter etſi non
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59524:206"/>
Naturaliter.</hi> And it is the rejecting of the Gift by which they loſe their former Natural Life, and their New-given Mortal Life. And will any man be ſo ill adviſed in this caſe as to ſay, that it is injuſtice in the King or Prince to puniſh the ſame perſons that were before Ranſomed? Yea if it were not by Money but by ſuffering publick ſhame that the Prince had Ranſomed them.</p>
                  <p>Having thus Explained the Caſe, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Argument, I will (looking at Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and not the uſual form of Diſputing) go beyond the task of a meer Reſpondent, and give you two or three Arguments to prove that it is no injuſtice in God to puniſh thoſe for whom Chriſt hath ſatisfied, or for whoſe ſins he was a ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>And, 1. I argue thus; If it be no injuſtice in God to oblige men to puniſhment for all Chriſts ſatisfaction, then it is no injuſtice actually to puniſh men for all Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. But the former is true, therefore ſo is the latter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will prove the conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition thus; from the eſſential of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Law.</p>
                  <p>1. The Law is <hi>Juris conſtitutiva, vel ſaltem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarativa.</hi> It conſtituteth Right, or at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth right; (I put in the latter [declareth] not as my own ſenſe, but to prevent the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of any that may think this or any Right was conſtituted from Eternity before there was any Law, or at leaſt before that which we ſay obligeth ſinners to puniſhment: Though indeed
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59524:207"/>
the Law doth conſtitute before it declare.) And ſo the Law is <hi>Regula juſsiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; vel ſaltem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula juſta:</hi> And if ſo, then to execute ſuch a Law can be no injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>2. The Law is <hi>Norma judicii;</hi> that's paſt queſtion. I ſpeak of a Law in force, and as to the ſubjects to whom it is in force. And if ſo, then it can be no injuſtice to execute it. But I think few ſober men will deny the <hi>Major,</hi> and therefore I leave that. And one would think none ſhould doubt of the <hi>Minor:</hi> Whether it be any injuſtice in God, by his Law to oblige to puniſhment thoſe that Chriſt Died for? But becauſe the <hi>Antinomians</hi> deny it, let us prove it. If God do <hi>de facto</hi> oblige to puniſhment thoſe for whom Chriſt Died, then it is no injuſtice ſo to do: But God doth ſo actually, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I hope if we prove that God doth it, none dare ſay it is unjuſt. If he be not Juſt he is not God. And that God doth it I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe that God Hateth, and are Children of Wrath, and without Hope, and without God in the World, and Strangers to the Covenant of Promiſes, and Aliens to the Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> are certainly obliged to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But ſuch many have been and ſtill are, for whom Chriſt Died, <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God hateth all the workers of Iniquity, and they are all by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Children of Wrath,</hi> &amp;c. But many that Chriſt Died for, are before Regeneration workers of Iniquity, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. All that are under the Curſe of the Law are obliged to puniſhment. But many that Chriſt Died for, were under the Curſe of the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59524:207"/>
Law ſince his Death, undertaken (when his ſatisfaction was in force) yea ſince his actual ſuffering; <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c. Many Scriptures ſhew both that we were under the Curſe of the Law when Chriſt actually ſuffered, and that all the Elect are under it ſtill as well as others, till their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. I am loth to trouble the Reader in heaping up Teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p>3. All that are condemned already, and the Wrath of God abideth on them, are doubtleſs obliged to puniſhment. But ſuch are many for whom Chriſt Died; (even all the Elect as well as others, while they are unbelievers, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>4. All that are guilty are obliged to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: (Proved, <hi>Reatus eſt obligatio ad poenam,</hi> they are all one thing) But ſome that Chriſt Died for are Guilty. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Even all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pardon, and that is all before Converſion are guilty.</p>
                  <p>5. All thoſe whoſe ſins Chriſt doth pardon were firſt guilty or obliged to puniſhment. But, ſome that Chriſt Died for have their ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved beyond all doubt from the formal Nature of Pardon, which is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Guilt, or the Diſſolving of an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to puniſhment; therefore where is no ſuch obligation there can be no Diſſolution of it: For that which is not, cannot be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And ſo there is no capacity for pardon; no more than a living man can be raiſed from the Dead, or a Man cured of a Diſeaſe, which he never had. The like may be ſaid of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation alſo. Our Divines have fully proved
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59524:208"/>
againſt the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that we are unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and unjuſtified till we believe: We are Juſtified by Faith, and therefore were unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Faith.</p>
                  <p>6. If none be obliged to puniſhment for whom. Chriſt Died, then none ſuch may pray for Pardon, nor confeſs that they need any Pardon from Chriſt. (For Pardon being the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of an obligation to puniſhment, there can be no pardon, where there is no obligation; and therefore no need of it, nor of prayer for it) But the conſequent is very wicked: We muſt daily pray, <hi>Forgive us our Debts and Treſpaſſes: Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Second Argument is this, If God do actually puniſh thoſe for whom Chriſt Died, then he may juſtly puniſh them. But God doth actually puniſh ſuch: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is unqueſtionable.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is fully proved thus.</p>
                  <p>1. The expreſs words of Scripture ſhew it, <hi>Lev. 26. 41, 43. Lam.</hi> 3 39. and 4. 6, 22. <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 3, 6, 9, 11, 13. and 2. 1, 4, 6. 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 14. Jer. 44. 13. Ezra. 9. 13. Hoſ. 4. 9, 15. Jer.</hi> 9 25. Read the places.</p>
                  <p>2. The execution of that ſentence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18 19. is certainly puniſhment. [<hi>I will greatly multiply thy ſorrow and thy Conception, in ſorrow thou ſhalt bring forth Children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Curſed is the ground for thy ſake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the days of thy Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Duſt thou art, and to Duſt ſhalt thou return.</hi>] But this ſentence is executed on thoſe that Chriſt Died for, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="401" facs="tcp:59524:208"/>3. Thoſe whom God chaſtiſeth he puniſheth: But he chaſtiſeth thoſe whom Chriſt Died for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable to all that know what chaſtiſement and puniſhment is: Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the <hi>Genus</hi> (being a Natural Evil, or the privation of a Natural Good, inflicted for a Moral Evil, the privation of a Moral Good:) Rigorous vindictive Puniſhment tending moſt to the ruine of the Sinner, is one ſpecies of it, Chaſtiſement is another ſpecies, which, by the hurt of a ſinner tendeth to his good. And though this be called Paternal, yet, 1. Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the proper act of Parents. Maſters may Chaſtiſe Servants, and Princes their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. 2. It is Metaphorically called Paternal in one reſpect, as God exerciſeth it; when yet in other reſpects it is the act of God as <hi>Rector per Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> for ſo all Gods Chaſtiſements are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> All ſhall work together for good to them that Love God, to the Called, &amp;c. therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The beſt Interpreters (according to the plain truth) expound that Text of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, and moſt of ſuch Affliction as is ſuffered for Chriſts cauſe, or at leaſt not for hainous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God. And it is unlikely it ſhould be otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe the defect of Love to God ſeems excepted in limiting it to them that love God: But one that Chriſt Died for may be defective
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:59524:209"/>
in love to God, therefore that is not promiſed to work for good.</p>
                  <p>2. Every Man dieth in ſome ſin, and how that ſhould do him good is hard to diſcern.</p>
                  <p>3. If we had a Promiſe that ſin and all ſhould work for the beſt, then we had no evil to fear, nor avoid, nor pray againſt, nor lament; but that is not true.</p>
                  <p>4. Such a Promiſe would be a dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſin; if every Chriſtian knew by promiſe before hand that how much ſoever they ſinn'd it ſhould be better for them than if they had not ſinned.</p>
                  <p>5. The good of a Chriſtian lyeth in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, by knowledge, love, joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore his want of knowledge, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not that which is Promiſed ſhall work for the beſt.</p>
                  <p>6. It is poſſible for a believer by Revolting to decline in Grace, and conſequently in Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; (elſe we need not fear declining nor lament it.) But if ſin ſhould all work for the beſt to them, then it were impoſſible their Happineſs could decline: for nothing but ſin, or ſo much as ſin can cauſe it.</p>
                  <p>7. They that have leaſt improved their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and have leaſt Grace, ſhall have leaſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: God is enjoyed hereafter in various degrees according to mens various capacities; therefore that defect of Grace, or that ſin here which cauſed their leſs degree of Glory did not work for their greater good. Yet I confeſs, 1. That God may and oft doth make ſin an occaſion of good to his People. 2. And always brings good out of it to his own Glory; But he hath not
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:59524:209"/>
Promiſed that every believers ſin ſhall work together for good to him.</p>
                  <p>8. The word [working together] expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a cauſality, and a concauſality with God, which cannot be aſcribed to ſin, it being at the beſt but an occaſion of good.</p>
                  <p>2. If this Promiſe were ſo to be underſtood, it were nothing againſt what I ſay: And if it do extend to all ſufferings as well as thoſe for Chriſt, yet it is not againſt it. For it proves no more but that they are chaſtiſements that ſhall produce a greater good than the ſuffering is evil. But yet chaſtiſements are puniſhments, and the evil is ſtill evil though it occaſion good: It is evil in it ſelf or directly, it doth us good but by accident. Or whatſoever you conclude of chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements in ſuffering, certainly it is a heavy Puniſhment when God permitteth his People to ſin (as he did <hi>David, Peter,</hi> &amp;c.) yet ſuch as Chriſt hath Died for do ſuffer this Puniſhment. Again, is not Original ſin the loſs of Gods Image, and the pravity of Nature a Puniſhment for the firſt ſin? I mean Gods withdrawing his Grace, which is the Antecedent.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If all this were nothing as to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, yet who ever ſaid that God never puniſheth any of his Elect while they are Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate? Are none of their ſins Original or Actual, nor any of their ſufferings or diſunion from Chriſt and Alienation from God, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them? It is beyond all diſpute. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore that it is a point of undenyable evidence, that God doth actually puniſh ſome, yea all for whom Chriſt Died; and he doth it juſtly. And therefore it is not injuſtice to
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59524:210"/>
puniſh men that Chriſt Died for, (meerly as if God could not do it, leſt he puniſh twice for one ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But the great Puniſhment of everlaſting Death, would be injuſtice, though leſſer be not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Degrees here make but a gradual differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If it be therefore injuſtice to inflict puniſhment becauſe Chriſt hath ſatisfied for the ſin, then a leſſer puniſhment would be a leſſer injuſtice: But God is as uncapable of the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice as of the greateſt.</p>
                  <p>3. The Third Argument; It is no injuſtice in God to make a Law to thoſe that Chriſt Died for, which threatneth Puniſhment to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, and commandeth them to fear it, and avoid it; therefore it is no injuſtice in God to puniſh ſome for whom Chriſt Died. The Antecedent is doubtleſs becauſe God doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally make ſuch Laws as threaten to all both Temporary and Everlaſting puniſhments. If it be ſaid that [they threaten none but final Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers; and Chriſt Died for none ſuch.] I anſwer, (to omit the begging of the Queſtion in this Objection) Gods new Law threatneth Temporal Puniſhment to thoſe that are not ſuch Unbelievers, and Eternal Puniſhment conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally to All; <hi>viz.</hi> If they believe not: And it threatneth no man but conditionally, for the diſcovery of abſolute Non-election, and the certainty of the periſhing of all the Non-elect, is not properly a threatning but a Prediction; yet improperly may be called a threatning: Even as the diſcovery of abſolute Election, and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59524:210"/>
of the certainty of the Salvation of all the Elect, is improperly called a Covenant or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; which is properly a Prediction <hi>de eventu</hi> only, not conſtitutive of any Right. If the whole New Law (<hi>He that believeth ſhall be Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he that believeth not ſhall be Damned</hi>) be made to all, Elect as well as others; and muſt be preached or promulgate to every Creature, then the comminatory part is made to all, Elect, as well as others: But the Antecedent is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. For the Conſequence of the Argument, I need not ſay much more than is ſaid already in the firſt Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But the Elect will all certainly Believe, and therefore God cannot juſtly execute that threatning on them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But he may on others, for whom Chriſt ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>2. The reaſon why he cannot on them, is not properly becauſe they are ſatisfied for, but becauſe they believe, and ſo are not the proper ſubjects of the penalty.</p>
                  <p>3. They will certainly believe; not meerly or directly becauſe Chriſt ſatisfied for them; but becauſe God hath choſen them to Faith and Salvation, and Chriſt in Dying for them had a peculiar intent of ſaving them infallibly, and giving them Faith to that end; they being given him peculiarly by his Father.</p>
                  <p>4. The Fourth Argument is the ſame that I have elſewhere handled, <hi>viz.</hi> If it be injurious
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59524:211"/>
or unjuſt to puniſh the ſame man for whom Chriſt Died, then it is <hi>injurious to ſome one:</hi> But it is injurious to no one; therefore it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt or injurious at all.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is evident. All injury is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to ſome, and ſo is all injuſtice injurious to ſome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It may be that injuſtice which is contrary to Vertue or Univerſal Juſtice, though it be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to none.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's not ſo; for that Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is injurious to God, and perturbeth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature, and is injurious to our ſelves. But this God is not to be conceived as capable of, ſeeing it conſiſteth in a diſconformity to his will.</p>
                  <p>And, 2. It's apparent that it is Gods diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive Juſtice, as to men, and his commutative Juſtice as to Chriſt, which is here pleaded by Divines to prove a neceſſity of the Salvation of all that Chriſt Died for.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore go to the proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition: And it is proved thus.</p>
                  <p>If Gods puniſhing the ſame men that Chriſt Died for be injuſtice or injurious, then it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wrong to God himſelf or to Chriſt the Redeemer, or elſe to the Sinners that periſh: But it is no wrong to God the Father, Chriſt the Redeemer, nor the Sinner: Therefore it is no injuſtice nor wrong at all.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> conſiſteth of two parts, both which are beyond diſpute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:59524:211"/>1. That whatſoever is injurious, is injurious to ſome perſon or Society.</p>
                  <p>2. That the enumeration is ſufficient in the preſent Caſe. None elſe can be imagined to be wronged but God, or the Redeemer, or the Sinner.</p>
                  <p>And, 1. That it is no wrong to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is paſt doubt, for God cannot and will not wrong himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it would be contrary to the goodneſs of his Nature, and ſo contrary to himſelf, and to Univerſal Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo: There can nothing in Gods Nature be manifeſted which ſhould neceſſitate or cauſe him certainly to ſave all that Chriſt Died for. Not his Juſtice, for that requires him to give every Man his Right. But I ſhall ſhew you that this was never the Right of all that Chriſt Died for, nay, I have ſhewed already that all of them are after Chriſts Dying for them actually obliged to puniſhment; ſo that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was then their Right. Not his truth: For he hath no where promiſed it.</p>
                  <p>2. It is no injury to Chriſt that ſome ſhould periſh for whom he Died.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe it is his own will: He never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſave any that he Died for, but only thoſe that accept him and his benefits.</p>
                  <p>2. It is according to the contract (as we may improperly call it) between him and the Father. God never required nor accepted ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, nor did Chriſt ever give it, but on theſe terms, that only thoſe ſhould be ſaved by it that
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59524:212"/>
accept him and it. God hath done what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Redeemer. He hath delivered up all mens Obligations into the hands (<hi>i. e.</hi> the power and diſpoſe) of Chriſt; and ſo hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Debt to all that will accept it: Chriſt may now give pardon to whom he pleaſe. It was not we, but Chriſt that made the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and therefore it is not to us immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately that God hath delivered up the Obligation; but to Chriſt that ſatisfied. As it is uſual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, for a friend that is ſurety for another to have his obligation delivered to him for his own ſecurity. So hath Chriſt, that if Sinners prove unthankful rejecters of his kindneſs, he may puniſh them for it accordingly.</p>
                  <p>3. It is Chriſts own doing to condemn thoſe for whom he Died: And he will not wrong himſelf. And he therefore doth it, becauſe they will not accept him and his favour, nor thankfully acknowledge what he hath done for them.</p>
                  <p>4. No man can ſhew one word in Scripture where God hath promiſed Chriſt to ſave all that he Died for. I conclude therefore that God is no more bound to ſave all that Chriſt Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than to ſave all that himſelf Created: And the vulgar Argument of the Prophane [God did not make us to Damn us] or [God made us; therefore he will not Damn us] is as good as this [Chriſt Died for us; therefore he will not Damn us.]</p>
                  <p>3. That it is no injury or injuſtice to the Damned themſelves is as eaſily manifeſted: (and yet here is all the ſhew of injury that is.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:59524:212"/>1. It is no wrong to give men their due: But Damnation is the due of all Unbelievers; even thoſe that Chriſt Died for: Therefore it is no wrong for God to Damn them. The <hi>Major</hi> is paſt doubt. The <hi>Minor</hi> is as clear as any point that I know in the Goſpel. A ſingle obligation makes it their due: but here is a double obligation.</p>
                  <p>1. That of the Law of Works, obliging them to Death as Sinners: which is not diſſolved becauſe they accepted not of Pardon in and with Chriſt: and ſo they are condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: For none is pardoned till he Believeth: and Puniſhment remaineth due, till men be Pardoned.</p>
                  <p>2. The obligation of the new Law both bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their former guilt on them by a peremptory irreverſible Decree, and condemning them for contempt of recovering Mercy, to a ſorer Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: This laſt I mention as belonging on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to final Unbelievers. The firſt obligation lyeth on the Elect themſelves till they Believe: And moreover the New Law pronounceth them all that time, <hi>non-liberatos,</hi> unpardoned, and doth not give them any remiſſion; though it paſs not on them the peremptory irreverſible Sentence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> If this be ſo, then God ſhould do the Elect themſelves no wrong if he did damn them before they Believe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> None at all; nor dare any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ober knowing man tell God, that he had wronged him if he had ſo done: But on the contrary
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:59524:213"/>
it's the uſe of all Godly Orthodox men, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or private perſons (ſo far as ever I could obſerve) to confeſs to God in their Prayers, that he might juſtly have cut them off before their Regeneration, and have caſt them into Hell; and that it was then their due; yea, that he might have ſent them to Damnation from the Womb: yet it followeth not that God might Damn the Elect: For he hath Decreed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: But the Purpoſe or Decree of God doth no more give them a Right to Pardon or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than my Purpoſe to make ſuch a man my Heir, or to give him 100 <hi>l.</hi> doth give him right to that 100 <hi>l.</hi> or to my Inheritance. So that God Damns not any of his Elect: but the reaſon is not becauſe that Damnation was not due to them before they believed, or becauſe God could not damn them in Juſtice, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wronging them; but becauſe he cannot change his Purpoſe or Will; which properly is to ſay, God will not Damn the Elect, rather than, He cannot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But it would be a wrong to Chriſt: for they are given him to ſave effectually, by the Covenant between God and Him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am indifferent how this is anſwered, ſeeing we are agreed in the ſenſe, that God never will condemn his Elect: But by [the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between the Father and Son] either they mean, ſomewhat from eternity, or before the Fall; and this is but Gods Decree; and is no more a Covenant indeed, than any other
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59524:213"/>
Decree of God is: Doth God make Covenants with himſelf?</p>
                  <p>2. Or elſe they mean the Prophecies and Promiſes in the Old Teſtament (or Scriptures before Chriſts Incarnation) made to or of Chriſt as God-man to be Incarnate: and theſe are more properly Predictions <hi>de ſuturo,</hi> as other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies are, (which God cannot but fulfil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is immutable and infallible) than the Divine Obligations, (which God muſt fulfil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is Juſt:) or if any will ſay, that they are ſtrictly obligations (about which I will not contend) yet the Elect are not named or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals mentioned in them: Or ſuppoſe that the Individuals names be implied, yet this is nothing to the time before ſuch promiſes were made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or if they had been made in the beginning, ſtill this is nothing to the point in queſtion. If God were obliged to Chriſt to ſave all the Elect, yet he was never obliged to them, till they believed; (I ſpeak of Obligation in ſuch an imperfect ſenſe as it may be applied to God.) Much leſs did he ever oblige himſelf to ſave all that Chriſt died for.</p>
                  <p>2. And that Chriſts actual ſuffering gives no man right, appears from what was ſaid on the former Propoſition, It was not man himſelf, that ſinned who was the ſufferer or ſatisfier, either <hi>in ſenſu Naturali or Civili.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot have the benefit till it be made over to him by ſome further conveyance.</p>
                  <p>3. And therefore it is no wrong to the ſinner to ſuffer; becauſe he ſuffereth but once, and ſuffereth no more than he deſerved. So much

                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg. II.</hi> Chriſt hath purchaſed Faith infallibly to be given to all that he died (or ſatisfied) for: But Chriſt hath not purchaſed Faith infallibly to be given to all men, but only to the Elect, Therefore Chriſt died not for all men, but only for the Elect.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is thus proved. Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed all things neceſſary to the Salvation of all he died for: But Faith infallibly to be given, is neceſſary to their Salvation, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is thus proved, Chriſt is a perfect Saviour to all thoſe to whom he is a Saviour or Redeemer: Therefore he hath purchaſed for them all things neceſſary to their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> of the main Argument is proved by experience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is not true, nor can be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Scripture; but the contrary may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly be proved. The argument by which they would prove the <hi>Major,</hi> is ſick of the ſame diſeaſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Its <hi>Major</hi> is falſe: and the <hi>Minor</hi> if not well explained is falſe too. To the <hi>Major</hi> I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Chriſt hath done all that belonged to him as a Redeemer by dying, or as a Satisfier, or all that for which properly an expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:59524:214"/>
was required, for all thoſe for whom he died: But I ſhall anon ſhew that the thing in queſtion is not ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt did not purchaſe all things neceſſary to Salvation, for all that he died for: I wait the proof of the affirmative. In the mean time I mind the arguers, that themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. He did not purchaſe Predeſtination.</p>
                  <p>2. Nor that Love which cauſed God to ſend Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. Nor Creation and our Natural Being.</p>
                  <p>4. Nor his own Death and Merits: He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed not theſe for any man.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Minor,</hi> if it mean, [Perſonal Faith] which it ſaith is neceſſary to Salvation; It is not true of Infants: If it mean the ſame Faith, which now is neceſſary to our Juſtification (to believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, that he Died, Roſe, Aſcended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) this was not neceſſary to the Salvation of all before Chriſts Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>As to the Argument by which they would prove the <hi>Major,</hi> I anſwer to it.</p>
                  <p>I. To the <hi>Major,</hi> by diſtinguiſhing [Chriſt is called a perfect Saviour] in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
                  <p>1. As to his plenary Power and Authority: ſo we confeſs he is a perfect Saviour.</p>
                  <p>2. As to the ſufficiency of his Satisfaction, or expiatory Sacrifice, or of whatſoever he was to do as ſatisfier of Juſtice: and ſo I confeſs he is a perfect Saviour. And do not all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers confeſs that Chriſts Death was ſufficient for All men? and all till a few of late do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Chriſt died for all men <hi>quoad ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59524:215"/>
pretii:</hi> And if it be ſufficient for all men, even for thoſe that periſh, then he is <hi>quoad ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactionis vel pretii ſufficientiam</hi> a perfect Saviour to all men: For they periſh not through any Imperfection or Inſufficiency in Chriſts Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>3. Or elſe it is in regard of the Application of his benefits, and conveyance of the fruits of his Death, that he is ſaid to be [a perfect Saviour to all that he died for.]</p>
                  <p>And ſo 1. Diſtinguiſh ſtill of the term [Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour] as it ſignifieth [a ſatisfier of Juſtice, or <hi>Redemptor per ſacrificium expiatorium</hi>] Chriſt is perfect <hi>quoad opus,</hi> as to his Work; and not only in himſelf and ability, and the material ſufficiency of his Sacrifice: but, this is not to the preſent point.</p>
                  <p>2. A [a Saviour] ſignifieth, an actual Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, by perſonal application and collation of his benefits; ſo again Chriſt is to be conſidered in a double Relation.</p>
                  <p>1. As <hi>Dominus Abſolutus ex novo Jure Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Ut Rector per leges ex eodem novo Jure:</hi> As he is become the Abſolute Owner or Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of all: Or as he is become the Rector and ſo the Legiſlator, (for under one of theſe two reſpects he maketh over all his benefits.)</p>
                  <p>II. And accordingly you muſt diſtinguiſh of thoſe benefits which Chriſt is to convey as <hi>Rector per Leges;</hi> and thoſe which he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey as <hi>Dominus Abſolutus,</hi> and as above or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Laws arbitrarily without pre-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo I anſwer, that Chriſt doth all that belongs to him as Legiſlator and Recto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

according to the Tenour of the New Law and Covenant, perfectly to all, as well as to the Elect: But he doth not all that he may do, (and mans neceſſity requires that he ſhould do) as abſolute Proprietary or Owner; either to all, or equally to the Elect: yet is he not therefore an imperfect Saviour: For that belongs not to the making of him a perfect Saviour, though it belong to the perfection of the Sinners Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore the conſequence of this Enthymeme is denied on theſe grounds.</p>
                  <p>That theſe things may be yet more clear, I ſhall briefly open a little further, the Nature of theſe diſtinctions, and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe ſeveral effects of Chriſts Death; and ſo ſhew you that he is a perfect Saviour though he give not Faith to all that he died for; having ſhewed you in what ſenſe Chriſt may be ſaid to have purchaſed for us the Habit or Act of Faith. For I find that a good explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lets in more light into the underſtanding, and prepares it more for the entertainment of Truth, than doth the moſt ſubtle Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>And 1. You muſt underſtand that the firſt main diſtribution of the Works of Chriſt in our Redemption (comprizing the whole) is into the work which he did for the ſatisfying of Gods Juſtice, in offering himſelf a Sacrifice for ſin.</p>
                  <p>2. And thoſe which were to be done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, for the ſake of this: and that,</p>
                  <p>I. By God the Father.</p>
                  <p>1. To Chriſt, (accepting his ſacrifice, acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>1. From our Legal neceſſity of Periſhing.</p>
                  <p>2. To Chriſt as our Lord and Ruler, to be dealt with on terms that have a tendency to our recovery.</p>
                  <p>II. By Chriſt the Redeemer, who being thus made both Owner and Rector of us all, doth according to theſe two reſpects give out all the following Fruits of his death to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>So that Chriſt's firſt work of ſatisfaction which is terminated as it were on God, is a perfect entire work of it ſelf. And (as Dr. <hi>Ameſ.</hi> ſaith in the place before cited, <hi>Anti-Bellarm.</hi>) it is to the work of Grace, as Creation is to the work of Nature.</p>
                  <p>And therefore as none can deny but the Non-Elect have common grace, as Conditional Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Illumination, the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (elſe how do they turn grace into wantonneſs?) ſo none can well deny but they have it from the general Fountain of Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Let us then conſider what is the proper uſe of ſatisfaction as ſuch, and what it was that made ſatisfaction neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>And it is evident that it was the juſtice of God Creator, as Rector according to the Law of Works, and the miſery of Man that ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

by the Sinners Damnation they would have been; ſo that it was the death which was become due to Mankind which required the death of Chriſt their Sacrifice, (as on Man's part;) and God's Juſtice which would not remit ſin but on a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration for the demonſtration of its ſelf, and of God's Holineſs, which required it on God's part; ſo that you ſee, that on our part, which required a Sacrifice was guilt, that is, obligation to everlaſting puniſhment. And it doth not belong to the ſatisfier as ſuch, to ſee that the guilt be actually done away <hi>quoad even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or that the Damnation be actually eſcaped: but that a ſufficient Sacrifice or ſatisfaction be given, on conſideration whereof Remiſſion and Salvation may be given on the terms as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators and Redeemers Wiſdom ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
                  <p>How Chriſt doth give out this Pardon we ſhall ſhew you anon, <hi>de quadruplici Remiſſione,</hi> ſo that it is apparent that the want of the act or habit of Faith, or the want of the Holy Ghoſt to effect Faith, is not the thing that required ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to God's Juſtice directly; but that Faith is only a remote effect of this ſatisfaction, and ſuch an effect as hath no ſuch Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with this Cauſe, but that the Cauſe (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially) may be and oft is without that effect in many; and the effect might have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that cauſe from another, if God had ſo pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>To manifeſt this (that it is not want of Faith that required ſatisfaction as ſuch; and that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction may be made for thoſe that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe) obſerve theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:59524:217"/>1. That Man's Suffering is not a thing pleaſing to God in and for it ſelf, but for its end, <hi>viz.</hi> The Demonſtration of Juſtice and Right Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of the World. God profeſſeth that <hi>he hath no pleaſure in the death of a Sinner,</hi> Ezek. 18. nor <hi>in the death of him that dyeth,</hi> Ezek. 33. <hi>but rather that he repent and live.</hi> Much leſs hath he pleaſure in the death of the innocent, and leaſt of all in the death of his own Son. God is not blood-thirſty, who abhorreth the blood-thirſty man.</p>
                  <p>2 It is not therefore for Chriſt's Sufferings as in themſelves conſidered, that God doth give men either Faith or any Mercy. God doth not ſell his mercies for blood, as if he would give the World Remiſſion of Sins, on condition he might put his Son to ſo much torment.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Faith is not the immediate effect of Chriſt's death <hi>in ſenſu morali:</hi> It comes not from his death, as death or ſuffering; nor may it without Blaſphemy be conceived that ever God made ſuch an agreement with his Son, as to give Faith to Men meerly on Condition that Chriſt would ſuffer death without firſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat elſe that required that ſuffering, and ſomething that put a value upon it.</p>
                  <p>3. So that the thing which did require Chriſts Suffering was (as is ſaid before) the obligation to puniſhment, called guilt, on mans part, and vindictive juſtice on God's part. Unbelief as Unbelief did not neceſſarily require it, but the guilt of unbelief, or any other ſin did require it, if ever it be pardonable.</p>
                  <p>4. So that the following effects of Chriſt's death do all preſuppoſe the ſatisfaction of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59524:217"/>
and hence Chriſts death becomes ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, not as death, but as ſatisfaction, and ſo a means fitted to the attainment of his ends.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe this means ſo pleaſeth him, he eſteemeth Chriſts ſatisfaction meritorious of further benefits, (joyned with his meritorious obedience) upon which eſtimation and his own will (called the Covenant with Chriſt) he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth further benefits thereto. For the end why he ſatisfied his juſtice by the Sacrifice of his Son, was that he might honourably, wiſely, and juſtly give out the following benefits which he giveth out hereupon. So that Chriſts death is as to God, firſt ſatisfactory, and then merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of further benefits. Now Faith very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely followeth all this, as ſhall be ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>5. The thing that God could not do without ſatisfaction, was the remitting of ſin, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the delinquent from puniſhment: it was not directly, nor in its ſelf the beſtowing of Faith.</p>
                  <p>6. For I would deſire any Judicious Man to conſider, whether if Chriſt had by his death ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied God's juſtice for mans guilt, and had not at all done any more by his death for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting of Faith, might not God have given man Faith at his own pleaſure, without the leaſt ſhew of injuſtice, or any other prohibiting inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience? though Chriſt <hi>de facto</hi> did merit more, yet we may well in diſpute for ſearching out the truth, ſeparate in our thoughts guilt of ſin, and want of Faith in Chriſt; and we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Chriſt had done no more by his death,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:59524:218"/>
than to ſatisfie God's juſtice for man's guilt, by bearing that which was due to man.</p>
                  <p>Now I would fain know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this being once done, why God or the Redeemer might not give Faith to whom he will: Is there a further neceſſity of any new death or ſuffering to merit Faith for us? If there be, what is that neceſſity? It is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in God to do it: There is no Law ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way by which he is obliged to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome will object, that the ſame may be ſaid of Pardon and Salvation, that there needs no new ſuffering to merit them, if once Juſtice be ſatisfied, and yet Chriſt dyed for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, All this is true, but then obſerve the difference; ſeparate in your thoughts Remiſſion, Juſtification, and Salvation on one ſide, from Faith in Chriſt on the other ſide, (as we by ſuppoſition may well do in diſputation;) and you will find that God could not give Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Juſtification, and Salvation from Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Chriſt's ſatisfaction; but he could have given Faith in Chriſt (if you will ſuppoſe it to go alone without the former benefits) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſatisfaction, I ſay, he <hi>could</hi> not give the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; not by reaſon of any impotency or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in God, but by reaſon of the perfection of his Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>For them that deny this (as <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> and ſome others do, to the great hardning of <hi>Socinians,</hi> and Infidels) at preſent I refer them to the Writings of Divines that have proved it: As <hi>Voetius in Theſibus, Camero Paſſim;</hi> ſpecially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

                  <p>But on the other ſide, that God might have given Faith (ſeparated from theſe benefits) without ſatisfaction, is evident.</p>
                  <p>1. In that there is no injuſtice or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting inconvenience in it.</p>
                  <p>2. God doth give the Devils a belief that God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him diligently, and that Chriſt is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World, and that he was Incarnate, dyed for Sin, Roſe and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, and ſhall come again to judge the World, ſome to life, and ſome to death, and that all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Gods word, and all true, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of Mankind believeth ſhall be ſaved, (for the Devil believeth the connection between Faith and Salvation,) all this Faith God giveth to thoſe that look to the nature of things more than to bare words, and can ſee through the vail of metaphorical expreſſions, will not make any queſtion of this; eſpecially if they have ſo far ſtudied the Civil Law and Politicks as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the right underſtanding of the nature and extent of theſe two relations. Indeed Chriſt is called a Father, but that ſignifieth but</p>
                  <p>1. His ſpecial propriety in us, as Fathers have in their Children (which is a branch of propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in general.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:59524:219"/>2. And his Authority over us, as a Father hath over his Children, which is part of his Rector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And withal it ſignifieth that ſpecial love of Chriſt to thoſe to whom he is thus rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>So he is called a Husband, which expreſſed the ſame ſpecial Propriety and Rectorſhip with the ſingular love accompanying them. He is called a Prophet, but that term expreſſeth but the manner of his applying himſelf to men in the exerciſe of his Dominion and Rule; for he that teacheth them, doth not teach them as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, but with Authority, and as their rightful King, whether they acknowledge him or no;) even as a King doth offer mercy to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and perſwade them earneſtly to accept it, ſhewing them the danger of ſtanding out againſt him: Or as he teacheth his Subjects their duty; you may call this Man a Teacher, but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only is this, he is a Teaching King, and ſo his Teaching is part of his Ruling, or ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to it: It ſignifieth but the manner of his applying himſelf to them, ſo Chriſt's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office in its ſelf belongeth to his Rector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: Not that all Teaching is Ruling, but in all his Teaching he doth it as their Ruler, in right at leaſt, if not in exerciſe. For that Teaching by which he converteth Sinners, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an act of moral ruling thoſe Sinners; but yet it is the Act of a King perſwading Rebels to come in that they may be Ruled; and as their King doth he perſwade them.</p>
                  <p>And then the diverſity of the degrees of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Light and Motions, (ſome having more, ſome leſs, ſome none,) is from Chriſt as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:59524:219"/>
owner of all, that may do with his own as his liſt.</p>
                  <p>It were eaſie to manifeſt how all his other Office-Titles and Relations are reducible to theſe two, at leaſt as he is ſignified in relation to the Creature; For in his interceſſion he ſtands in a double relation.</p>
                  <p>The one is to God, with whom he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth, and ſo he intercedeth as the Son of his Love, who having ſatisfied his Juſtice, hath all delivered up to him, and therefore is Owner and Ruler of all.</p>
                  <p>The other Relation is to the Creature for whom he intercedeth; and that is as their Owner and Ruler, and for his own choſen as their Owner and Ruler in a ſtricter ſenſe than the reſt, even as they are his Jewels, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially beloved.</p>
                  <p>More is ſaid of this in another place: peruſe the Table of the effects of Chriſt's death.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee how it is that Chriſt hath purchaſed Faith, and how he giveth it, having ſatisfied God's Juſtice by dying for all Mankind, God giveth up all men to him as their Owner and Ruler by Redemption-Title (and giveth up alſo into his hands the former obligation, as is ſaid,) hereupon Chriſt hath full power,</p>
                  <p>1. To alter the Law, or to make new Laws for them, and by theſe Laws to confer Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other Benefits, by ordaining on what terms they ſhall be obtained, and ſo giving right to them.</p>
                  <p>2. To give further mercies, over and above what he giveth right to by that Law, being abſolute
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:59524:220"/>
Lord, he may do with his own as he liſt; (ſtill ſuppoſing that his Fathers Will is his Will.)</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt having received this Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, as <hi>Rector per Leges,</hi> he makes a free Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conveyance or Grant of Pardon, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Reconciliation, Adoption, Sanctification, in the common Scripture ſenſe) and Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Men on Condition they Repent, and Believe.</p>
                  <p>But he hath no where made any Conveyance of the firſt effectual Grace, or of Faith to any Man. He hath indeed propheſied or foretold us that he will infallibly give it to his Choſen, but he hath not named or deſcribed them by any antecedent diſtinguiſhing Character; ſo that no man can beforehand ſay this belongs to me, nor hath he by this Prediction made over to them any right to the thing, but only foretold that he will give them right hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Only he hath preſcribed certain means to all men, either for the immediate obtaining of Grace to believe, or at leaſt for the obtaining of Grace conducing thereto, which may bring them into a nearer capacity, who before were further off than the reſt of the World. And he hath given them ſufficient encouragement to uſe thoſe means without deſpairing of ſucceſs, even ſo much, as that no man that hath the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, can be named by the tongue of Man that did his beſt in the uſe of means to get Faith, or to get nearer to Chriſt, and yet loſt his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                  <p>Yet hath not Chriſt thought meet to engage or oblige himſelf to any Unbeliever to give him Faith; but when he doth it, he will do it as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:59524:220"/>
Abſolutus,</hi> and as not obliged; and indeed doth it only to thoſe whom he had an abſolute purpoſe to ſave, and were given him to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly brought home to God.</p>
                  <p>So that Chriſt gives not Faith (the firſt Faith) as <hi>Rector per Leges,</hi> but as <hi>Dominus Abſolutus.</hi> Thoſe Mercies (if ſpecial) that are thus given, are ſaid by ſome Divines to flow from Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination alone, as did the gift of a Saviour to fallen Mankind; but no doubt, it is <hi>mediante Sanguine Chriſti,</hi> and in a remote ſenſe are fruits of Chriſt's death.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been ſaid it may appear that Faith is not the proper effect of ſatisfaction as ſatisfaction, nor is it any neer or inſeparable effect of ſatisfaction as it is meritorious. God did not give Chriſt Faith for his bloodſhed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; the thing that God was to give the Son for his ſatisfaction, was Dominion and Rule of the Redeemed Creature, and power therein to uſe what means he ſaw fit for the bringing in of Souls to himſelf, even to ſend forth ſo much of his word and Spirit as he pleaſed; both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son reſolving from Eternity to prevail infallibly with all the Elect. But never did Chriſt deſire at his Fathers hands, that all whom he ſatisfied for, ſhould be infallibly and irriſiſtibly brought to believe; nor did God ever grant or promiſe any ſuch thing. Jeſus Chriſt as a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom dyed for all, and as <hi>Rector per Leges,</hi> or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator he hath conveyed the Fruits of his death to all; that is, thoſe Fruits which it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to him as Legiſlator to convey, which is right to what his New Law or Covenant doth promiſe. But thoſe Mercies which he gives as
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:59524:221"/>
                     <hi>Dominus Abſolutus,</hi> arbitrarily beſides or above his engagement, he neither gives nor ever intended to give to all that he dyed for; no nor to all his Elect doth he give all thoſe fruits of his death, nor for ought I know to any in the ſame degree; for theſe are but remotely the Fruits of Chriſt's death, and not conſtant nor inſeparable Fruits. Peruſe the foreſaid Table of the Fruits of Chriſts death, and it will ſhew you which the mercies be that Chriſt gives by Law, and which arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as beſides his engagement.</p>
                  <p>Is it not manifeſt then that it is a deſperate charge againſt the Lord Chriſt to ſay, that he is an imperfect Saviour, if he do not perfectly ſave all that he Died for; or convey to them all the fruits of his Death?</p>
                  <p>The Preaching of the Goſpel expreſly, is a fruit of Chriſts Death: Some have this in great power, clearneſs and conſtancy; ſome but weakly, darkly, or ſeldom; and ſome not at all. Shall they that have been at one or two dark Sermons of Chriſt in all their Lives ſay, That either Chriſt Died not for them, or elſe was an imperfect Saviour? Some are endowed with the gift of Prophecy, Tongues, Miracles, as fruits of Chriſts Death; ſhall all that receive not theſe ſay, that Chriſt is an imperfect Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, becauſe he gave them none of theſe fruits of his Death? Some are made Kings and Rulers, and ſome Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all are fruits of Chriſts Death: Yet all are not Apoſtles, Paſtors, Teachers, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> Some have Learning and ſome none: Some have good Parents, and good Education, and ſome bad: Some of the Elect have Health of Body,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59524:221"/>
and Helps, Opportunities and Advantages to to ſerve God, which others want: Some are permitted to live long in ſin, as <hi>Manaſſes:</hi> And others converted in the morning of their Days: Some are preſerved in a more even and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able walking with God: And ſome are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fall into moſt hainous ſcandalous ſins, to the great diſhonour of God and their Profeſſion, and to walk ſadly for it all their Days, Nay, ſome to ſuffer Death by the hands of publick juſtice; Shall all theſe ſay, Chriſt is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Saviour to them? Some are kept in vigor and growth in grace, and ſome remain Infants; and ſome loſe their firſt degree of Love, and grow more luke-warm, and Die in a very low ebb of Grace, Comfort and Aſſurance. Some enjoy much fellowſhip with the Father and Son in the Spirit: And others are almoſt wholly ſtrangers to it. Some are made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of doing God abundance of ſervice and the Church much good, and bringing home or building up many Souls, and that to the end of their Lives: Others are kept without parts and gifts, next to uſeleſs, if not burdenſome. Some Diſtracted, and after a Godly Life fall into ſtark madneſs, and ſo ſpend their days as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of making uſe of their Affliction or of any Mercy: And ſome are cut off in Infancy or in the Womb, before they did ever believe or love God, or do him any ſervice. And is Chriſt an imperfect Saviour to all theſe? Nay, and he hath revealed to us, that according to this diverſity here in degrees of Grace, Holineſs and Obedience; ſo will be the diverſity in the degrees of glory: One ſhall be Ruler of ten
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59524:222"/>
Cities, and another but of two: For he will reward every Man according to his works. How vaſt a difference then is there like to be between the Glory of an Infant, that being born of a weak believer, Died from the Womb, and the Glory of <hi>Peter, John, Paul,</hi> or thoſe to whom it ſhall be given to ſit on Chriſts Right Hand and Left Hand in his Kingdom. And yet all theſe are Elect. Where is it then that the force of the Argument lyeth that would prove that all muſt needs have Faith for whom Chriſt Died? If he be an imperfect Saviour except he ſave all alike, or give to all that he Died for, all the fruits of his Death, then ſuch a charge might as truly be grounded on his dealings with the Elect themſelves as with others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But he ſaveth all the Elect, though not all alike: He bringeth them all ſafe to Heaven at laſt; but ſo he doth not others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's true: But then,</p>
                  <p>1. It's yielded that it belongs not to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Chriſts Office or Work to give all the fruits of his Death (<hi>quoad ſpeciem</hi>) to all that he Died for.</p>
                  <p>2. It belongs as truly to his office of ſaving, to ſave men from ſin, and to give them a full degree of Grace and Glory, as to give men Faith: And yet it belongs not to his office ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to give theſe to all that he Died for. No doubt a greater meaſure of Glory is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good than that ſmall meaſure which ſome enjoy. (Specially if the joy of ſome ſaved In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were no greater than <hi>Nazianzene</hi> (<hi>Orat.</hi> 40.)
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:59524:222"/>
and other antients did think the pain of ſome condemned Infants would be.)</p>
                  <p>3. Some of theſe parts of Salvation which the Elect themſelves do come ſhort of, are penally denied them, (and ſo are given by Chriſt as Legiſlator) being propounded on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and they not performing the condition; (to the performance whereof Grace was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to aſſiſt them.) If then Chriſt may give good things by a conditional grant (as Legiſlator) to his Elect, and yet not give them that Grace which may cauſe them infallibly to perform the condition, and ſo deny them the benefit condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally given, for want of that performance, what reaſon can be given, why he may not do ſo by the Non-Elect, in reſpect of Salvation and Faith, and Repentance, the Conditions thereof?</p>
                  <p>So that all the weight of their Argument lyeth on this ſuppoſition, that Chriſt bore not Puniſhment for any mans ſins but thoſe whom he intended infallibly to bring to Heaven: which they have never yet proved, nor ever will do, there being no Word of God that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to ſave all that Chriſt died for.</p>
                  <p>Lay all this together and you will ſee the truth of theſe Concluſions.</p>
                  <p>1. That it was not the abſence of Faith in Chriſt the Remedy, but the Old Laws Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of us to Puniſhment, or the guilt of ſin, which required Chriſt's ſatisfaction to God's Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>2. That Chriſt by this ſatisfaction did not immediately merit Faith it ſelf, but only thoſe intermediate cauſes, from whence the Faith of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59524:223"/>
his Elect is produced, that is, He purchaſed all men from the Legal neceſſity of periſhing that they were in, into his own Power, as their Owner and Ruler, that ſo he might make over Reconciliation. Remiſſion and Salvation to all, if they will believe; and might ſend forth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means and help of Grace to draw all men towards him: reſolving to draw his Elect Infallibly to him.</p>
                  <p>3. That it is therefore an improper and unfit phraſe to ſay, that [Chriſt Died to purchaſe us Faith] though rightly explained it hath truth in it: But rather, that [Faith is an effect or fruit of Chriſt's Death,] <hi>viz.</hi> where Faith is given. For the former phraſe would intimate as if Faith were the thing that God was to give in requital of Chriſt for his Bloodſhed, and that directly: and ſo Faith ſhould be given by God as Legiſlator of the Old Law: For the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuppoſed to be between the Father and Son, was made by the Father on his part, not as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, or Legiſlator of the New Law; but as the offended Rector according to the Law of Creation, now treating with the Mediator about mans Recovery. Though theſe things ſpoken after our manner, do but ſignifie Gods Decrees, yet they ſhew us in what Relation God ſtood towards Man and towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, when he required and accepted of Satisfaction. Whereas the thing given to Chriſt was Power of Dominion and Rectorſhip, and ſo the Redeemed delivered to him (not all to one final end, nor with a like intent.) And ſo Faith is procured by Chriſt only in this remote ſenſe, in that he procured full power to uſe
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:59524:223"/>
the fitteſt means to draw men to him, in the ſeaſon and degrees he pleaſe; with a full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in his own mind to make all this effectual upon his choſen, that he might attain the full end of his Blood-ſhed. So that Faith is the effect of that degree of Grace which from his Plenipotency he gives, leſt his choſen ſhould miſs of the intended Salvation; and therefore is improperly ſaid to be purchaſed by Chriſts Blood, though yet it be a remote effect of his Blood to thoſe that have it, and none could have had it without the Intervention of his Blood, becauſe there would have been no ſaving uſe of Faith without that Blood: otherwiſe they might, if we look to Faith, but as ſuch an act conſidered without its object given.</p>
                  <p>4. And therefore the Scripture no where uſeth any ſuch phraſe, as to ſay, that Chriſt Died to purchaſe us Faith: But ordinarily that he died to purge or put away ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in controverted caſes it is ſafeſt to ſpeak in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Language: Suppoſe a man pay 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to Ranſom certain Priſoners that owed that ſum, and upon the Ranſom it is agreed that they ſhall now be delivered up to him, as his Ranſomed ones, to diſpoſe of at his pleaſure; yet both parties agree that only thoſe ſhall be actually delivered into freedom who thankfully accept the favour, and the Ranſomer as their Lord: The Redeemer knows that theſe are men of ſuch ſtubborn hearts that they will refuſe his offer: yet he reſolves to ſend them under his hand a conditional diſcharge, that all ſhall come forth that will accept him and his offer; and to tell them, that all the reſt ſhall by him be
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:59524:224"/>
ſtill detained, and as his Priſoners ſuffer greater miſery: Yet out of a ſpecial love to ſome of them, he reſolves to ſend a friend who is ſo effectual an Orator, as will certainly prevail with them to lay by their obſtinacy and yield to his motion. Doth it ſeem a proper phraſe in this caſe, to ſay, that this man paid 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to purchaſe for theſe men a yielding Heart, or to purchaſe their conſent to accept him and his kindneſs? Rather he did it to purchaſe their Freedom from Priſon; which he gives to all, as far as belongs to him as Ranſomer. But he ſends this Orator with a reſolution to prevail, in another ſuperadded relation, <hi>viz.</hi> as one that beareth a ſpecial love to thoſe particular men above the reſt; or as one at leaſt that is reſolved to attain infallibly that fruit of his Ranſom, even the actual deliverance of thoſe men. Nor can it therefore be concluded, that he paid not the debt of any of the reſt, becauſe he will not as importunately ſolicite them to accept of his offer.</p>
                  <p>5. We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh of meer Ranſoming or Redemption by Sacrifice; and the ſame Sacrifice or Redemption as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with Election, and is ſubordinate to it: Effectual Grace to work Faith infallibly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Redemption as it is accompanied with Election, or with a ſpecial abſolute reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, of ſaving thoſe particular perſons: but it comes not from mere Redemption by Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as divided from Election; and therefore is common to all the Elect, but not common to all the Redeemed. For God hath means of two different ſorts for the accompliſhing his
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:59524:224"/>
Decree of Election, as to execution: Firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral means, and ſecondly ſpecial means: and the general is the Foundation on which he means to build the ſpecial.</p>
                  <p>Let us again remember <hi>Ameſius</hi>'s words, that Redemption is to the whole work of Grace (<hi>viz.</hi> both common and ſpecial) what Creation is to the work of Nature. Nay, better we may ſay, what Creation was to Gods Governing Adminiſtrations under the firſt Law, that is, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to Gods Governing Adminiſtrations under the Second or New Law. For in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God did two things.</p>
                  <p>1. He gave man his Being, that he might be a Subject fit for Government.</p>
                  <p>2. He gave him his Right Being Real and Relative; making him after his Image, in his favour, and in a ſtate of happineſs: and in this ſtate he made a Law with him, (even with all mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi>) promiſing him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther everlaſting life on condition of obedience. Now here Gods Creation of man in his favour and in rectitude, was a common work; and ſo was his giving him that Law: But ſo was not the fulfilling of its Promiſe, which implieth the Intervention of mans performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Suppoſe now that man had been mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by propagation before the fall of any, and then one half of mankind had kept this Law of Works, and the other had broke it: Had it been fit for any man to ſay, that God did not Create any of thoſe that fell, in his favour, or placed them not in happineſs, or ſet them not in the way to a further happineſs, becauſe he did not infallibly cauſe them to keep his Law,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59524:225"/>
which was the condition of further happineſs? No more can it be truly ſaid that Chriſt did not Redeem them becauſe he did not cauſe them infallibly to believe. Indeed it may be ſaid of both, that God in Creating or in Redeeming had not the ſame Decree or Abſolute Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſave them, as he had to ſave the Elect whom he cauſeth to perform the condition. And yet our Divines uſe commonly to ſay, that God created all Mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> in a ſtate of happineſs, and to a further happineſs: that is, as Legiſlator, ſet them in a way to a further happineſs, and conditionally promiſed it to them (whether it were any greater happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or only the perpetuation of the ſame, I will not now diſpute.) And ſo hath Chriſt done all for men that pertains to a ſatisfier of Juſtice, and ſetteth them in a way to full deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the miſery that they were fallen into, and conditionally promiſeth it to them, with an additional happineſs.</p>
                  <p>6. And Laſtly, Beſides all this let it be well conſidered, that if there be any man on Earth (that hath the uſe of Reaſon, of whom only actual Faith is required) that doth not actually Believe in Chriſt, it is their own fault, and is not long of Chriſt: He will not condemn them meerly for their ſin againſt that Law of works which ſaith [obey perfectly, or dye] but for rejecting recovering Grace, and that ſufficient in its kind, and to its own work. I ſay it again confidently, all men that periſh (who have the uſe of reaſon) do periſh directly for rejecting ſufficient Recovering Grace. By Grace I mean, mercy contrary to merit: by recovering, I
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:59524:225"/>
mean, ſuch as tendeth in its own nature toward their Recovery, and leadeth or helpeth them thereto. By ſufficient I mean, not ſufficient directly to ſave them; (for ſuch none of the Elect have till they are ſaved) nor yet ſufficient to give them Faith, or cauſe them ſavingly to Believe: But it is ſufficient to bring them nearer Chriſt than they are, though not to put them into immediate poſſeſſion of Chriſt by Union with him, as Faith would do. It is an eaſie truth, that all men naturally are far from Chriſt, and 2. That ſome by cuſtom in ſinning, for want of informing, and reſtraining means, are much further from him than others (as the Heathens are.) 3. And that it is not Gods uſual way, (nor to be expected) to bring theſe men to Chriſt at once by one act, or without any preparation, or firſt bringing them nearer to him. It is a ſimilitude uſed by ſome that oppoſe what I now ſay: ſuppoſe a man in a lower room, and another in a room below him, and you ſtand at the Stair head, and call them both up to you and offer them ſomewhat if they will come: It is not your intent that they ſhould leap up at one leap, but come up ſtep by ſtep: nor do you mean that he in the lower room ſhould go no more ſteps than he in the middle room: He muſt go many ſteps before he come to be as near you as the other is. Now ſuppoſe you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to take them by the hand when they come to the upper Stairs, and give them ſome other ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient help to come up the lower ſteps: If theſe men will not uſe the help given them to aſcend the firſt ſteps (though intreated) who can be blamed but themſelves if they come not to the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:59524:226"/>
top? It is not your fault but theirs that they have not your hand to lift them up at the laſt ſtep. So is our preſent caſe. Worldlings, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ignorant ſinners, have many ſteps to aſcend before they come to Juſtifying Faith: and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have many ſteps before they come as far as ungodly Chriſtians (as might eaſily be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by enumeration of ſeveral neceſſary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.) Now if theſe will not uſe that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient help that Chriſt gives them to come the firſt or ſecond or third ſtep, who is it long of that they have not Faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But here you vent two points of Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm, one, that there is ſufficient Grace which is not effectual: The other, that God will give men Spiritual Bleſſings on the good uſe of natural.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No Arminianiſm at all.</p>
                  <p>I. I ſay not that God giveth all men ſufficient Grace to Salvation, or to Believe.</p>
                  <p>II. That there is ſuch a thing <hi>in rerum naturâ,</hi> as ſufficient Grace, not effectual, as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> ſo it is undeniably proved.</p>
                  <p>1. In the caſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> who had ſufficient Grace to have ſtood (or elſe all the ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in the World muſt come principally from Gods denial of ſufficient Grace, before ever man did treſpaſs.) Yet the event ſhewed that hat Grace was not effectual.</p>
                  <p>2. From the Caſe of the Godly, who have ſufficient Grace to think, ſpeak, and do more good, and leſs evil than they do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:59524:226"/>3. From the Caſe of the Wicked, who have ſufficient Grace to enable them to do leſs evil than they do, and uſe more means for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grace to Salvation. They might paſs by an Ale-houſe Door, and might go to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon when they go to a Whore: and might go among good company when they go to bad.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond point I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>I. I ſay not that God gives Spirituals, on our right uſe of Naturals: but that God gives Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, on our right uſe of Common Grace; Or rather that he may moſt juſtly deny men ſpecial Grace, that will not make that uſe of Common Grace as they might.</p>
                  <p>II. And I do not ſay, that God hath any where promiſed to give men Special Grace, if they will uſe well their Common Grace. For God hath not thought meet to make any ſuch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Unbelievers; nor to engage himſelf to them, but when he giveth the firſt Special Grace for Repenting and Believing he doth it as not pre-engaged to do it; and therefore as <hi>Dominus Abſolutus,</hi> and not <hi>per legem premiantem.</hi> (And therefore the Papiſts in their Language ſay, the firſt Grace is not of merit, at leaſt of Condignity.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Then they that come not the firſt ſtep are excuſable; for if they had come to the ſtep next Believing, they had no aſſurance that Chriſt would have given them Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> No ſuch matter: For though they had no aſſurance, they had both Gods Command to ſeek more Grace, and ſufficient encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:59524:227"/>
thereto: They had ſuch as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> calls half promiſes, that is a diſcovery of a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and high degree of probability of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon</hi> [Pray if <hi>perhaps</hi> the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven.]</p>
                  <p>They may think God will not appoint men vain means, and he hath appointed ſome means to all men to get more grace, and bring them nearer Chriſt than they are. Yea, no man can name that man ſince the World was made, that did his beſt in the uſe of theſe means, and loſt his labour.</p>
                  <p>So that if all men have not Faith, it is their own fault; not only as Originally Sinners, but as rejecting ſufficient Grace to have brought them nearer Chriſt than they were; for which it is that they juſtly periſh (as is more fully opened in the Diſpute of ſufficient Grace.</p>
                  <p>I think now I may fafely conclude, that there is no proof yet brought that Chriſt will give Faith to all that he dyed for, but the contrary I have proved.</p>

                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:59524:227"/>1. Jeſus Chriſt ſatisfied God's Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>1. Morally, at his firſt undertaking, interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or engagement (according to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) preſently upon mans fall.</p>
                  <p>2. By that Natural Suffering which he had before undertaken, and this was in the fulneſs of time.</p>
                  <p>It is uſual for moral effects to go before the natural part of the Cauſe, but the Cauſe is <hi>in eſſe morali,</hi> in moral being. Many a man upon his word to pay ſo much money ſuch a day, or upon earneſt given, hath the thing bought deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, tho' he pay not the price till long after: So may a man redeem Slaves by ſuch an undertaking. So did Chriſt undertake to bear the puniſhment due to the Sins of all; and this undertaking ſatisfied God, not without his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but by its reſpect to his future ſuffering, giving it a moral Being before hand; ſo that when Chriſts ſatisfaction was in its firſt moral being, no man (of this World) was in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or in Hell.</p>
                  <p>2. It was neceſſary, for Chriſt having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to ſuffer the puniſhment due to their ſins, before they were Condemned to perform his undertaking after they are Condemned.</p>
                  <p>If you give earneſt for the buying of Beaſts, or Slaves, and take them into your poſſeſſion, and promiſe ſuch a day to make payment, though they dye the while, you muſt pay the price.</p>
                  <p>3. Chriſt had as much of his ends obtained in thoſe that periſhed by Rejecting Grace, before his death, as he hath for thoſe that periſh for the ſame cauſe ſince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="440" facs="tcp:59524:228"/>4. The Wicked that periſhed before Chriſt's death, had the ſame benefits by it, as thoſe that periſh after his death, (allowing the difference that the clear diſcovery of the myſtery of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now doth cauſe;) they had mercy offered them, and Remiſſion and Salvation given them on Condition of repenting and believing, and ſufficient grace to have brought them nearer God than they were, which if they had obeyed, they had a high probability of having more added.</p>
                  <p>5. All this preſuppoſeth Chriſt then a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Object for their Faith; that is, Chriſt who had ſatisfied for them, as to his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and muſt and would do it afterwards in performance, was then the Object propounded for them to believe in; and therefore their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief was Conſequential, and not Antecedent to Chriſt's moral ſatisfaction, and ſuffering for them; even as the Faith of the Godly alſo was.</p>
                  <p>6. It is as good arguing, to ſay, ſome were in Heaven when Chriſt dyed, therefore he dyed not for them, as to ſay, ſome were in Hell, therefore he dyed not for them. For it may as wiſely be ſaid, thoſe in Heaven were paſt all need of ſatisfaction, as that thoſe in Hell were paſt all hope and remedy.</p>
                  <p>The time was, when they had hope from that ſatisfaction ſet before them, and when it was a ſufficient remedy for them, and wanted nothing but their own conſent to make it fully effectual: As the time was when thoſe now in Heaven had need of it, and did accept it offered them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:59524:228"/>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſt's day and rejoyced, and <hi>Moſes</hi> counted the reproaches of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures of <hi>Egypt:</hi> But the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent then refuſed Chriſt, and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore were juſtly denied his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercies.</p>
                  <p>7. Only this much may be concluded by this arguing; that Chriſt at the time of his dying, did not intend the Saving of thoſe that were then in Hell; and ſo it is as true, that Chriſt at his death did not intend for the future to give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, the firſt Reconciliation, Pardon, Adoption, Union with him, or Glory to thoſe in Heaven; for they had received them all long before, as the Damned had loſt them all before by their Rejection.</p>
                  <p>But it follows not hence, that therefore Chriſt bore not the puniſhment of all mens ſins, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his firſt undertaking.</p>
                  <p>I know great diſſimilitudes are pretended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Caſes of the Saved and the Damned when Chriſt dyed, as to this Argument, but they are but pretended, and none is ſhewed; and I think it needleſs to ſtrive againſt meer words.</p>
                  <p>But a fore-mentioned Diſputer undertaketh to ſhew, that the Anſwer drawn from the ſtate of them that were Saved when Chriſt dyed, will not hold, and why?</p>
                  <p>1. He ſaith. [Thoſe that were ſaved, were ſaved on this ground, that Chriſt ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuffer for them in due time, which ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was as effectual in the purpoſe and promiſe as in the execution and accompliſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="442" facs="tcp:59524:229"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And thoſe that were Damned, had Pardon and Salvation given them freely, if they would have accepted them on God's terms; and this was on the ſame conſideration, of Chriſt's future dying for them.</p>
                  <p>2. And conſequently they who were then Damned for unbelief, were Damned for reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chriſt that had undertaken to dye for them, and the mercy purchaſed by his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken death.</p>
                  <p>2. This Author produceth ſuch a Simile as I mentioned even now, [of one that undertaketh the ranſom of Priſoners, and ſendeth to them thereupon to come forth, for he that detaineth them taketh his word: Now if ſome come forth, and the reſt refuſe, and be dead in Priſon, and others hear not of that, and that according to his appointment, and were dead long ſince; when the Ranſomer comes to pay the Debt or Ranſom, doth he intend it for them that dyed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately in Priſon? or only for thoſe that came forth? doubtleſs only for theſe laſt.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. (To anſwer as confidently) doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is the Debt and Ranſom undertaken for all, and paid according to the undertaking.</p>
                  <p>2. Bring home the Similitude nearer the caſe, from payment of money, to ſuffering of the puniſhment which they ſhould have ſuffered, or ſome other <hi>ad fines Rectoris</hi> equivalent, and doubtleſs then he ſuffered <hi>Loco omnium;</hi> inſtead even of thoſe that are dead in Priſon, or elſe he is not a man of his word, if his action anſwer not his undertaking: But he did not at his actual ſuffering intend it for the further good of the dead, not <hi>in bonum ulterius omnium,</hi> ſuppoſing
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:59524:229"/>
what good they had before received by it, and might have received a full deliverance if they would; (And to make them willing and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable might belong to him in another reſpect to do if he pleaſed, but it did not belong to him either as Ranſomer or Ruler of them.</p>
                  <p>Nor did he at the time of his payment intend to them that were before gone out of Priſon at his command, any further good by his Ranſom than what be gave to the obſtinate that dyed, ſo be it they would accept it.</p>
                  <p>3. The ſaid Author argued thus; (If Chriſt dyed inſtead of all men, and made ſatisfaction for their ſins, then he did it for all their ſins, or for ſome only. If for ſome only, who then can be ſaved, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>And yet for all this, all true Believers ſhall be ſaved; For <hi>he is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. <hi>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God by him,</hi> Heb. 7. 25.] He dyed for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary unbelief, that it may be done away by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Faith; but we may ſay more of this in a fitter place.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a ſtrange Objection for thoſe Men to make, who ſay that Chriſt ſuffered e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for all, or paid a Ranſom ſufficient for all, without any intent that it ſhould be <hi>loco omnium</hi> in their ſtead, or ſhould ſatisfie God's Juſtice for all.</p>
                  <p>They ſuppoſe Chriſt to have ſuffered or paid as much as we do affirm; we ſay it was becauſe all mens ſins lay upon him, they ſay no, and give us no reaſon why Chriſt ſhould ſuffer enough for all, when he undertook to ſuffer only for the ſins of the Elect.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould think that the Objection lay ſtronger againſt them, that they feign Chriſt to ſuffer in vain; but how theſe ſame men can fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object this to others, who aſſign ſo many effects of Univerſal Satisfaction, I cannot yet diſcern.</p>
                  <p>And let me add this much, leſt I be miſtaken in my tenth and eleventh Arguments againſt them (moſt of which is <hi>ad homines,</hi>) that I do not think it can be proved that the degree of Chriſt's pain was ſo punctually proportioned to the number of ſins or ſinners for whom he died, that if there had been one more ſin or ſinner he muſt have ſuffered more (or one 1000,) and if there had been one leſs, he muſt have ſuffered leſs; (though yet I think it was neceſſary that his ſuffering were ſo great and reproachful, as might be a full demonſtration of Gods Juſtice,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:59524:230"/>
and might ſerve to the attainment of the ends of the Law: And not as the Fryars ſay, that the leaſt drop of Chriſts blood might have ſerved to redeem a thouſand Worlds.) I ſuppoſe it is clear that Chriſt did give himſelf a ranſom for Fallen Mankind in general, and that if it had been but for a few perſons, leſs might have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied God's Juſtice than Chriſt did undergo: But that his <hi>Sufferings</hi> were ſo proportioned to the number of Sins or Perſons undertaken for, let them prove that can, for I cannot, or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, for I do not.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe the principal Dignity of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which made them ſatisfactory, and equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to all mens ſufferings, was not the degree of the pain, but the dignity of the ſufferer; and next to that was the relative part, even the publick ſhame and infamy to which he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,</p>
                  <p>2. May we not think that as it was Chriſt as Man who ſuffered, ſo Chriſt as Man knew what he ſuffered for. And is it not doubtful whether Chriſt as Man in his ſuffering (before he was glorified) did know every Perſon, yea, or all the Elect for whom he dyed.</p>
                  <p>In his Infancy he did not; and when he ſaith, that the Son of man himſelf knew not the day or hour of his coming to Judgment, may it not intimate that he knew not juſt how long the World ſhould laſt, and conſequently that he knew not juſt how many, or who ſhould be born (Elect or others) before the End: But this I will not inſiſt on, as ſpeaking with ſome fear of intruding too far into unrevealed things, and not doubting but that Chriſt as God knew
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:59524:231"/>
all men by name. But it is moſt unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Chriſt as man intended his Sacrifice in ſuffering to be in the ſtead and for the ſins of Mankind in the general; whether he ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it with a nomination of each particular Perſon or not.</p>
                  <p>2. I further Anſwer to this Objection, That it is high arrogance and preſumption for us ſilly Bats and Moles to charge God with doing any thing in vain, or to charge Chriſt as ſuffering in vain, meerly becauſe we cannot reach to the knowledge of his ends. As if he might not have many glorious ends that we know not of.</p>
                  <p>3. I further Anſwer, That it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſcovered, that it is not in vain, nor one drop of Chriſts blood loſt, tho' many that he dyed for do come ſhort of Salvation. For that which is the means to theſe ends following (which Chriſt attaineth) is not in vain.</p>
                  <p>1. He hath attained the effectual ſatisfaction of Juſtice for all, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the Firſt Law.</p>
                  <p>2. He hath delivered the Sinner from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal neceſſity of periſhing that he was then under.</p>
                  <p>3. He hath laid the Foundation of his new right of Dominion, as owner of all men: For to this end he both dyed, roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. And if this were his end, and this end attained, then it was not in vain.</p>
                  <p>4. He hath laid the Foundation of his new right of Rectorſhip, as the forementioned Text more directly proveth; (for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth him as Rector than as Owner,) God
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59524:231"/>
being minded to change the Government of the World, did lay the whole Foundation of the New Government in Chriſts Univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even as he laid the Foundation of the Old Government, in the Creation of Man after his Image.</p>
                  <p>Our Divines ſay, God Created Man to Life and Happineſs, ſo be it he would obey; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he Created him in a ſtate of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and put him in a way to obtain either the enjoyment of a greater, or at leaſt the perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which he did enjoy, and made him an implicite promiſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Now ſhall any man ſay, that becauſe God foreknew or decreed that <hi>Adam</hi> would ſin, and never obtain that life to which he was ſo Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or which was ſo promiſed him, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God made him capable of it in vain, or promiſed it in vain, or preſcribed him means to the attainment of it in vain? (for his attaining Life after by Chriſt, is nothing againſt his loſing it in the firſt way?) Moſt certainly thoſe that ſee not the glory of Chriſts new Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Government of the World in general, (in Title, and ſo legiſlation, judgment, and execution) as it differs from the Adminiſtration of the former Government, they do rob God of a very great part of the glory of the work of Redemption; and if they overlook ſo glorious an effect of this work (which ſhould be part of the matter of their weekly ſolemn Praiſes on the Lords days in the Church Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, for which the day was tranſlated from the ſeventh, which was for the commemoration of the Creation, as the cauſe of our being, and ground of the former Government) no wonder
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59524:232"/>
if they ſpeak and write again Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                  <p>The whole World is now governed by Chriſt, and ſo by God, as he is God Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. And it is no ſmall flaw or errour in their Theology, that deny the Foundation of the whole Government, and then cry out, that we make Chriſt to dye in vain, if he bring not all infallibly to Heaven that he dyed for.</p>
                  <p>5. And alſo he hath (in ſubordination hereto) attained this by his death, that he hath power to abrogate or alter the Law that was againſt us: And that men before their believing, are now his Priſoners, and not the Fathers, as Rector ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt Law unremedied, and ſo they are Priſoners of hope, and not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
                  <p>6. He giveth them under his hand a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Remiſſion and grant of Salvation: If they will have him, and Life with him they may, <hi>For this is the Record</hi> (which men periſh for not believing) <hi>that God hath given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son: He that hath the Son hath Life, and he that hath not the Son</hi> (for all that gift) <hi>hath not Life,</hi> 1 John 5. 10, 11, 12. This end Chriſt attained, and therefore dyed not in vain.</p>
                  <p>7. He putteth men in a way towards reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, appointing them ſome means to be uſed thereto, and giving them ſufficient grace or help to that uſe of thoſe means which he firſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of them.</p>
                  <p>8. Theſe men do actually partake of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of mercies in this Life, beſides the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned: They enjoy a comfortable, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:59524:232"/>
Life, with the ſupply of their wants, being provided for with neceſſaries, and uſually with delightful abundance; having the ſervice and uſe of all the Creatures. They are kept from all cauſe of deſparation, and the ſelf-torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Conſcience which are its inſeperable concommitants; and which thoſe that feel do often call the torments of Hell within them. They are not only kept out of Hell it ſelf, but (as is ſaid) have a poſſibility of everlaſting eſcaping it; and if they will not reject it, they ſhall certainly enjoy Eternal Life. All the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies (in one word) which ever they receive are from the Blood of Chriſt; and therefore as to them, he Died not in vain. Their Lives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed might have been continued according to the tenour of the firſt violated Law, but it would only have been as a fit ſubject of miſery: It would not have been ſuch a Life of Hope, Delights, and Abundant Mercies.</p>
                  <p>9. They ſhall all have their Bodies raiſed up at the Reſurrection Day, and that by the power of Chriſt as the Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>10. They ſhall all be judged by Chriſt as their Lord-Redeemer, and ſo acknowledge him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the World.</p>
                  <p>11. They ſhall be judged according to the Talents of Mercy which they abuſed, and the Grace which they rejected, after the tenour of the Redeemers Law; and not according to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remedied Law of works: And ſo ſhall be left without all juſt excuſe, even at the bar of Grace: To their greater ſhame, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers greater glory, than if they had been judged according to the meer Law of works,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:59524:233"/>
by God-Creator, as the Legiſlator of that Law.</p>
                  <p>12. Laſtly, They ſhall in their juſt everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Damnation bring double Glory to Gods Juſtice, as Belilevers in their Salvation ſhall bring a double Glory to his Mercy. As in our Salvation God will not be honoured only as Creator and Rector according to the firſt Law; but alſo as Redeemer and Rector accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the New Law: So in the Damnation of Unbelievers, it is not only the Juſtice of God as Creator and Rector according to the firſt Law, but it is ſpecially the ſupereminent Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Chriſt and God as Redeemer and Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, according to the new Law, which will be everlaſtingly glorified on the rejectors of Grace. They will then fully acknowledge that Chriſt died for them and Redeemed them, and that in mercy; and that for the undervaluing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of that mercy, they do juſtly ſuffer: So that here will be a more glorious advantage for the demonſtration of Gods Juſtice, than ever could have been according to the tenour of the firſt Law, and without Chriſts ſatisfaction for the Sinners. And I think if Chriſt attain his own and his Fathers Glory, he Dieth not in vain, and loſeth not the fruits of his Blood-ſhed. He knows how to manage the buſineſs ſo as that he ſhall be no loſer, let men prove as ungrateful and obſtinate as they pleaſe. All theſe ends Chriſt actually obtains, for they are ends fully intended by himſelf. But then the very Salvation of all men, is <hi>finis preſcriptus &amp; propoſitus,</hi> propounded to man to be intended, and Chriſts ſatisfaction is made a ſufficient
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:59524:233"/>
means thereto, <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> and ſo this may be called the end of Gods Legiſlative will, though he attain it not (as is ſaid before.)</p>

                  <head>Argument the Fifth againſt Univerſal Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>5. All thoſe for whom Chriſt Died (or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) have the Goſpel Preached to them. But all men have not the Goſpel Preached to them: Therefore Chriſt Died not for all men.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved thus:</p>
                  <p>1. Chriſts Dying for men would be in vain, if it ſhould never be revealed to them that they might believe: But Chriſt doth not Die for any in vain; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. For whomſoever Chriſt Died, for them did he procure Remiſſion, Salvation, and all means neceſſary thereto. But the Preaching of the Goſpel is a means neceſſary thereto, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Proved in that the Preaching of the Goſpel is a neceſſary means to believing, and Faith is a neceſſary means of Remiſſion and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> of the main Argument is proved by experience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let it be obſerved that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument makes nothing againſt the Redemption of all men that hear the Goſpel, Elect and Non-Elect; but only of thoſe Pagans or others that never hear it; And if they grant that Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for all that hear the Goſpel, few will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend much with them about others; as judging
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:59524:234"/>
it partly ſo far beyond us, and partly ſo little to concern us, as not to be worth much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet, for my part, I think the Argument weak and the Concluſion untrue.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Davenant</hi> in his Diſſertation of Univerſal Redemption, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap. 6. per tot. page 65. ad. p.</hi> 87 hath ſaid ſo much to this pointt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hat I may well refer the Reader thither for ſatisfaction, without adding any more.</p>
                  <p>3. Yet I ſhall firſt briefly Anſwer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and then more fully open the truth about this point in certain concluſions.</p>
                  <p>And, 1. We muſt diſtinguiſh of ſeveral terms in the Arguments, and ſome other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be here conſidered.</p>
                  <p>1. Chriſt is ſaid to Die for men, 1. Dying <hi>in their ſtead</hi> and for their ſin, as lying on him in the undertaken ſuffering:</p>
                  <p>2. Or elſe <hi>final it er in eorum bonum.</hi> Which is,</p>
                  <p>1. Common.</p>
                  <p>2. Or Special. And both.</p>
                  <p>1. Either given as Legiſlator <hi>quoad jus,</hi> by a conditional grant.</p>
                  <p>2. Or given as <hi>Dominus abſolutus</hi> and the diſpoſer of all things <hi>quoad eventus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> When I ſay Chriſt Died for all men, I mean not that he finally intended as <hi>Dominus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutus,</hi> eventually to ſave all by his Death: But that he Died in the ſtead of all, ſuffering the puniſhment which by the Law of works was due to all mankind: And how far he died <hi>in bonum ominum,</hi> for the good of all is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and ſhall be ſhewed more anon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="453" facs="tcp:59524:234"/>Secondly, We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the [the Goſpel as it ſignifieth the Covenant of Grace with its grounds and fruits fully expreſſed] and as it ſignifieth [only ſome particular Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truths, which go before the full revelation of the ſaid Covenant Grounds and Effects; as the Break of Day goeth before the Sun Riſing: and the Revealing of ſome of the fruits of Chriſt's Death, by which ſtreams, men ſhould be drawn to enquire after the Fountain] in the later ſenſe all have the Goſpel; In the former, all have it not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt diſtinguiſh of [Preaching] which is either taken in general for any way of Revelation; or ſpecially for a Revelation by Writing or Speaking. The former All have, the later not, (when I ſay [All men] I ſtill mean [All that have the uſe of their ſenſes and reaſon] and not Infants, Mad Men, Ideots, or Senſeleſs, of whom more anon.) By this much you may ſee in what ſenſe we acknowledge or deny the Truth both of <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Argument. And hence alſo you may ſee how far I deny the <hi>Major</hi> of the next ſubſervient Argument if withal you diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
                  <p>3. Between, <hi>Fruſtra,</hi> being in vain, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to all ends and uſes, (yea Gods chiefeſt ends) or in vain to the particular end of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners own Salvation.</p>
                  <p>4. And, (as to the cauſe hereof) you muſt diſtinguiſh between [being in vain through any defect of Chriſt's Satisfaction, or on his part] and [being in vain, (as to their Salvation) meerly through their own fault.] According
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59524:235"/>
to the laſt members of theſe two diſtinctions we confeſs Chriſt's Death is in vain to all that periſh, but not according to either of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>5. We diſtinguiſh between [Chriſts procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remiſſion and Salvation to be made over to all by him as Legiſlator in the tenour of his Conditional Grant.] And [being eventually conferred on all by God as the diſpoſer of events.]</p>
                  <p>6. We muſt diſtinguiſh between [the extent of the new Law or Grant of it, as to its own Tenour or Senſe] and [the extent of it as to the Promulgation.]</p>
                  <p>7. Alſo between [promulgation initial, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and full and perfect.]</p>
                  <p>8. And between [means ſufficient to the firſt Duties that Chriſt by Goſpel Truths calls men to] and [all means abſolutely neceſſary or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Faith and Salvation.] And ſo I anſwer to the ſecond Proſyllogiſme; that Chriſt did not procure that all he died for ſhould eventually receive Remiſſion and Salvation, or ſufficient means thereto; nor yet that the Covenant of Grace which conferreth Right to theſe ſhould be, as to the Infallible event, fully promulgate or revealed to all. But he hath procured, not only that all mens ſins be made pardonable (in a nearer ſenſe than they were before his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction) but alſo that, as to the tenour of his Law, or Covenant, Remiſſion, and Salvation be conferred on all ſo be it they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it: and alſo that ſome part of his Goſpel Truth (and the effects of Chriſts Death) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in ſome meaſure to all, and ſo ſome part
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59524:235"/>
of his New Law promulgate to all; and all have ſufficient means to help to perform the Duties which he thus calls them firſt to perform.</p>
                  <p>9 We muſt diſtinguiſh between [Believing that God is, and that he is reconciled to man ſo far as that he will reward them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek him] and believing that Jeſus Chriſt was Incarnate and ſatisfied by his Death.]</p>
                  <p>10. And between [Neceſſary to Salvation <hi>Neceſſitate Precepti</hi>] and [<hi>Neceſſitate Medii</hi>] and ſo I anſwer to the laſt confirmation: that Faith in the firſt ſenſe is neceſſary to the Salvation of all that have the uſe of reaſon, both <hi>neceſſitate precepti &amp; medii:</hi> but faith in the laſt ſenſe is neither neceſſary to Ideots, Mad-men, Infants, nor yet to thoſe that never heard the Goſpel, <hi>neceſſitate precepti:</hi> And whether or no it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>neceſſitate medii, etſi non preſcripti,</hi> we ſhall ſay more to anon.</p>
                  <p>So much directly to the Argument.</p>
                  <p>Next I ſhall for the fuller opening of my Judgment on this point, lay down what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the truth in theſe following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> I. As Chriſt hath born the ſins of all, and done all for them which pertaineth to the Ranſomer by an expiatory Sacrifice; and hath obtained thereby a new Title of Lordſhip and Soveraignty over all, and all are delivered to him accordingly; ſo doth he faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the office of a Soveraign Redeemer to all, governing them as his Ranſomed ones, by ſuch Laws and Ways of undeſerved Mercy, as have a natural tendency and conducibility to their Salvation. Though ſtill, as Abſolute Lord,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59524:236"/>
he giveth out the Mercies which belong to him to beſtow in that Relation, with great diverſity, to all the World; but yet a great meaſure even of theſe doth he give to all men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> II. Chriſt dealeth not with any Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens on the meer terms of the Law of works, as it was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> or ſtood without the connexion of any Remedy: Theſe are not the full terms on which God deals with them [If you perfectly obey (without any ſin) you ſhall live: If you ever ſin you ſhall dye.] This will be proved in that which follows: and might eaſily be proved more largely were it not ſo plain as to prohibit ſuch vain endeavours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> III. Chriſt is not properly ſaid to be in mutual Covenant with all that he died for; and I think he is not ſo in Covenant with any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, as to a true mutual Covenanting, nor to any that never heard the Goſpel, as to the Legal promiſſory Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant of Chriſt is taken in ſeveral ſenſes: Among others for the two here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p>1. For his New Law, Teſtament, Goſpel Promiſe, or Conditional Gift of Pardon and Life: (call it what you will.) By this he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands men to Repent and Believe, and giveth them his foreſaid Benefits on condition they perform this: laying a kind of engagement or obligation upon himſelf, which he cannot break; For <hi>God cannot lye: and ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth do Righteouſly? How elſe ſhould God judge the World?</hi> And God in the relation of a Righteous Judge <hi>will give the Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at that day to all them that love his appearing.</hi>
                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:59524:236"/>
Now I conceive that in a full proper ſenſe, none that hear not the Goſpel (<hi>i. e.</hi> that have not ſome Revelation of Chriſt Crucified) are in this Covenant, nor God in Covenant thus with them: For the Preceptive part of the New Law doth not actually oblige them to the performance of the full condition (of Believing in Jeſus Chriſt Crucified;) nor doth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſory part oblige Chriſt to give them the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in ſo full a ſenſe as to thoſe that have this Covenant revealed to them; nor can Chriſt be ſaid conditionally to give it them, in ſo full a ſenſe; becauſe the Law or Deed of Gift is not Promulgate fully to them, as it is to others. I ſhall open this more in the following conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>2. The Covenant of Chriſt is taken alſo for this ſame forementioned Covenant when it is accepted by Believing, and ſo become a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Covenant, when men engage themſelves to Chriſt as Chriſt firſt doth to them, and ſo the Promiſe comes into force for the actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of Right to the thing promiſed. This is the fulleſt ſenſe in which it is called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to our common cuſtom of ſpeech: and the firſt is moſt properly called a Law, Teſtament, Diſpoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet is the word [Covenant] in Scripture uſed ofteſt in this leſs proper ſenſe. Now it is only Believers and their Seed that are in this mutual full Covenant with Chriſt. But this belongs not ſo nearly to our preſent enquiry, about the ſtate of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens as the former doth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> IV. The New Law, Teſtament, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or Gift, which ſaith, [Whoſoever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:59524:237"/>
and Believeth ſhall be ſaved; and whoever doth not ſhall be Damned] doth, as to its Tenour, or extent of the ſenſe of the words, belong to all men in the World, even thoſe that never heard the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>This is ſo ordinarily acknowledged, that I need not prove it: Nor doth it need any other proof than the recital of the Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms. The Promiſe is univerſal, and no man on Earth is excepted or excluded: ſo that Chriſt may be ſaid to have, [1. Obliged All men to Believe. 2. And conſtituted Faith a condition of Salvation to all men. 3. And obliged himſelf to give them Remiſſion and Salvation if they do Believe;] <hi>quantum attinet ad merum Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem,</hi> as far as belongs to him as mere Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or as to the meer enacting of his new Law, Grant, Teſtament, which is conſtituted and perfected with his <hi>Fiat:</hi> And of the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Acts, the laſt, which is the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Chriſt's part, is moſt full and irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: For though there goes yet more to the actual obliging of the Subject to perform the condition, and of Chriſt to give the benefit, when the condition is performed; yet to the firſt conditional Obligation of Chriſt to give it, there is no more requiſite to make it real and irreverſible, than this enacting, ſo that the New Law or Covenant extendeth to all the World, as to its ſenſe or tenour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> V. This New Law or Covenant doth not actually oblige men (for all the enacting of it) till it be Promulgate; that is, a rational ſufficient publication of it, made to the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="459" facs="tcp:59524:237"/>It belongeth to the Rector after the enacting of his Law, to promulgate it: And though promulgation be not in the ſtricteſt ſenſe (I think) a part of Legiſlation (though many think otherwiſe I confeſs;) yet it is a neceſſarily ſubſequent act of the Rector, without which his Law cannot actually oblige; even as [Revelation] is a natural requiſite, of our actual Believing any Truth of God; tho' not (as I think) the <hi>ipſum formale objectum fidei, ſed potius (quod dicitur) vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum inter formale &amp; materiale.</hi> For it is the <hi>Senſe and Will</hi> of the Legiſlator, that his enacted Law do oblige thoſe, and only thoſe to whom it is promulgate; (elſe it ſhould be apparently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, as obliging to natural Impoſſibilities.) And it cannot oblige beyond his Senſe and Will.</p>
                  <p>And therefore though the Tenour of the New Law extend to all men in the World, yet it cannot be ſaid that any man is by it obliged to Believe in Jeſus Chriſt Crucified, further than this Law hath been publiſhed or promulgate to him, with a Rational ſufficiency. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a vain objection that one makes (<hi>J. G.</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> p. 47.) that if men be not obliged before the revelation of the Goſpel, then either they muſt remain diſobliged when it is revealed, or elſe God muſt make a new Law for them, or be changeable: (that is his ſenſe.) For it is ſufficient that he make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of that Law which before he had enacted; and which was before an Inſtrument fit to oblige but wanted the application by a Promulgation, without which it could not actually oblige.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="460" facs="tcp:59524:238"/>By all this it appears, that if the Heathens may be ſaid to be not-obliged to Believe, or to be not under the New Law or Covenant, it muſt be only for want of a ſufficient Promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that Law, and not for want of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tenour; or from any exceptions againſt them in the Law it ſelf. Let us therefore next ſee how far the New Law is Promulgate to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> VI. The Lord Jeſus having enacted his New Law, did purpoſely ordain Univerſal Officers to Promulgate his Univerſal Law; giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them this Commiſſion and Command, [<hi>Go ye into all the World, Preach the Goſpel to every Creature; He that Believeth and is Baptized ſhall be Saved, and he that Believeth not ſhall be Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>]</p>
                  <p>So that Chriſt hath not been wanting <hi>quoad actus morales,</hi> as to the moral part, (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in commanding and authorizing his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers) for the Univerſal Promulgation of his New Law. Yea, for my part, I doubt not, but this work of publiſhing the Goſpel to all Nations, and ſo carrying it to them that have not heard it, doth lye on ſome men to this day; and God would have ſuch Univerſal Miniſters yet in the World; and ſo far the Apoſtolical Work is not ceaſed: And I believe it is a moſt hainous ſin of Chriſtian Princes and States, that they procure not able Miniſters to be ſent into all the Heatheniſh parts of the World, as far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they can: and that it is the ſin of thoſe Miniſters, who have ability, fitneſs and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for this Work, that they do not (how hazardous, and painful, and chargeable ſoever)
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:59524:238"/>
ſet themſelves reſolvedly to it. So that if Chriſts Laws were well obeyed, there is no likelihood that there would be any known part of the World where the Goſpel would not be publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> VII. So little know we of the Hiſtory of thoſe remote parts of the World, that have not now the Goſpel among them, that it is very hard for any man to know that thoſe Countries never had the Goſpel in any meaſure revealed to them. We may diſcern that now they want it, and that they know not themſelves that ever they had it: But how far their contempt of it may in many places cauſe God to give them up to that Barbariſm and Sottiſhneſs as may obliterate all former Revelations, and bury them in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion; this we cannot tell, the rather becauſe that the Apoſtles (and many other Chriſtians) of that Age did travel ſo far in execution of their Office, and the <hi>Goſpel is then ſaid to be Preached to all Nations, and the ſound of it to have gone to the ends of the Earth, and through all the World:</hi> and becauſe there hath been ſo much entercourſe between ſome Chriſtians or other, and moſt of theſe Nations ſince then, yet is it moſt probable that there are many ſavage parts where the name of Chriſt was never revealed with a competent ſufficiency, yea, or at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> VIII. The Heathens that never heard the Name of Jeſus, have yet ſufficient means afforded them to know (among many others) theſe following Truths.</p>
                  <p>1. That there is a God, and only one God.</p>
                  <p>2. That this God is Infinite in Being, Immenſe and Eternal, and Infinite in Wiſdom (Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient)
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:59524:239"/>
Goodneſs and Power, (and ſo Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                  <p>3. That he is the Maker, Preſerver, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all, and therefore that all men do by the ſtrongeſt obligations owe him the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience.</p>
                  <p>4. That he being Ruler muſt needs give us a Law, that is, ſome ſign of his Will, conſtituting our duty, and determining what ſhall be our reward and puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>5. That God being perfectly Holy and Juſt, he muſt needs make a wide difference between the Righteous and the Wicked; and cauſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Paſſionis vel Phyſicum,</hi> ordinarily to follow <hi>Malum Morale vel Actionis, vel Omiſſionis: ut benè tandem ſit bonis &amp; male malis.</hi> And that the ſame Cauſe which was for the enacting of his Penal Laws, requireth the execution of them ordinarily, at leaſt in as high a meaſure, as Worldly Princes are engaged to execute all their Laws.</p>
                  <p>6. That the Soul of Man ſhall in another World everlaſtingly partake of exceeding mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery or happineſs, according to what they have done in this World.</p>
                  <p>7. That therefore it ſhould be every mans chief care to provide for his Everlaſting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to eſcape everlaſting Damnation or Miſery; and that all things in this World are vanity, and will not ſatisfie the Soul, or make men happy; and therefore that our care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for this World, and our Love of it ſhould be nothing in compariſon of our love to that to come, and of our care and labour for it, and that no man can be too diligent in ſeeking after his Everlaſting Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="463" facs="tcp:59524:239"/>8. That God is to be loved, honoured, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, truſted, feared, and that above all Creatures whatſoever; and that he is the moſt happy man that is moſt in his favour; and that we ſhould Worſhip him frequently, reverently, and heartily, and that according to his own will, and that we ſhould honour our Superiors, and love our Equals alſo, and do no wrong to any man, in Soul, Body, Friends, Name, State, or Chaſtity; but do as we would be done by.</p>
                  <p>9. That all men are Sinners, and every man for himſelf may know by experience, not only that he hath broke theſe Laws, but often and heinouſly broke them, yea, breaketh them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day.</p>
                  <p>10. That a very grievous puniſhment is due to them for theſe ſins.</p>
                  <p>11. That God being the Righteous Judge and Governour of the World, it beſeemeth him to do Juſtice on thoſe that ſo offend him, and to adjudge them to their deſerved miſery, except on ſome valuable Conſideration he forgive them.</p>
                  <p>12. That it is paſt their reach to diſcover of themſelves what ſuch a valuable Conſideration may be, or what God will accept of as ſufficient to be a ground for Remiſſion of this Sin and Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>13. That it is paſt their own power to make any ſatisfaction, ſeeing all that they can do which is good, is but the remainder of their duty, (which yet is depraved by the daily mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sin,) and all that they can ſuffer here, is but part of their deſert.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="464" facs="tcp:59524:240"/>All this the light of Nature may ſhew them, as is evident by the clear deductions and infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Reaſon, and all this is Antecedent to any thing Evangelical.</p>
                  <p>But beſides all this, God's Providential deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may teach them ſome things of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even concerning God's mercy, and their own Recovery. As particularly.</p>
                  <p>1. That God doth not deal with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, or themſelves in particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſert. This they may find by his patience, and the multitude of mercies that they enjoy.</p>
                  <p>2. Nay, that he dealeth with them ſo much contrary to their deſert, as to give them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of precious mercies through all their lives, when they had deſerved the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                  <p>3. That therefore God hath found out ſome ſufficient means, grounds or terms on which he both may and doth actually diſpenſe with the rigour of exact Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>4. That therefore their caſe is not utterly deſperate, and remedileſs.</p>
                  <p>5. That they cannot of themſelves diſcover what thoſe ſatisfactory grounds are, on which God ſo ſuſpendeth the rigour of Juſtice, and dealeth with them ſo contrary to their deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p>6. That therefore they ſhould uſe all poſſible means and induſtry for the fuller knowing of theſe great things, and therefore ſend to enquire of all others in the World, as far as is poſſible, who are likely to know more of them than they.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="465" facs="tcp:59524:240"/>7. That they ſhould for the time to come repent unfeignedly of all their ſins, not only as they are hurtful to themſelves, but as againſt the publick Ruler of the World to whom they were ſo many ways obliged; and that for the time to come they ſhould to the utmoſt of their power ſin no more.</p>
                  <p>8. That they ought frequently and fervently to pray to God, both to reveal to them fully their Caſe, and his Will concerning their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and Duty, and importunately day by day to beg mercy at his hands.</p>
                  <p>9. That all this muſt not be done in deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but as a means to their own deliverance, and God is to be ſought and worſhiped by them as a merciful God, as having proved him ſo to be, and that the uſe of his means is not like to be in vain.</p>
                  <p>10. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> careful ſeeking, and diligent obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience they ſhould continue to the death, againſt all Temptations to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Truths may thoſe come to know, by the uſe of Reaſon, from the Creatures, and Providences, and ſpecially their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, who never heard of Chriſt or Scripture. And how much <hi>Socrates, Ariſtotle, Plato, Plotinus, Seneca, Cicero, Plutarch, &amp;c.</hi> did know, may partly be ſeen in the Monuments of their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> IX. All this Revelation is ſome part of the Law of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo theſe Truths are diſcovered, and this light ſent by him as the Lord Redeemer of the World, or as Rector upon his Redemption Title. For all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now delivered into his hands, and the whole
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:59524:241"/>
frame of Government being laid on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and built on his Redemption, even on Chriſt the head Corner Stone; the very moral Law now is his Law, and its obligation to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is his obligation; yea, the very Law of Works obligeth to puniſhment now, not as it was at firſt given, and remaineth in the hands of an offended unſatisfied Creator, but as it is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended and delivered up into the hands of the Satisfier or Redeemer, to remit wholly, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute only, conditionally, as men ſhall receive or reject the grace of Redemption; ſo that as God ruleth among thoſe blindeſt of Heathens that yet know him not, ſo doth Chriſt Rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that know not him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> X. The Ten laſt Particulars before mentioned, which theſe men may know, are properly Goſpel Truths, for the Law of Works ſheweth nothing of Mercy contrary to deſert, nor of any hope of Recovery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But how can the meer light of Nature diſcern Goſpel Truths, without a ſupernatural Revelation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Light of Nature is either Reaſon it ſelf, which is the Souls vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>2. Or the External Light which in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things ſhines forth.</p>
                  <p>3. Or the Species and Knowledge received by Reaſon through the mediation of this External Light. Alſo ſupernatural Revelation is,</p>
                  <p>1. Either the Rectitude of the Soul as a Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient Power or Faculty, which was natural to
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:59524:241"/>
                     <hi>Adam,</hi> and may be called ſupernatural to us, becauſe it is not born with us, and becauſe it is not wrought but by a ſupernatural efficient, though it be moſt natural to us, as a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to our Natures welfare, as health is to our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>2. Or it is the Objective Extrinſical Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a ſupernatural way, and that either as diſtinct from that which ſhould have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenor of the firſt Law, or from that which is ordinary by common Cauſes, tho' beyond the former.</p>
                  <p>3. Laſtly, it is taken for the actual efficient impreſſing of the Species on the Intellect by a ſupernatural Aſſiſting Power.</p>
                  <p>On theſe diſtinctions I Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. Natural Reaſon, or the Intellectual faculty is the recipient of all Revelations, natural, or ſupernatural.</p>
                  <p>2. There are many Objective Revelations ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, as being ſuch as according to the firſt Law of Nature would never have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, which yet are not ſupernatural as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are in oppoſition to a natural Cauſality in the way of Revealing. And ſo Rain, and Fruitful Seaſons, Health, Wealth, Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Mercies that come in a natural way of Cauſality, and yet they may teach a Sinner thoſe Truths which the meer Law of Nature never taught him; Mercies and ſuch Mercies gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thoſe that deſerve Miſery, and are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to extremity of Puniſhment by Law, do teach us that there is Remiſſion of Sin, and a way found out for the Relaxing the obligation that mens deſerts do not fall upon them. Theſe
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59524:242"/>
Providences therefore are ſo far ſupernatural, as being the clear effects of the Law of Grace, which relaxeth the obligation of the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XI. It is not proper or fit to ſay, that [the Goſpel is Preached to theſe Heathens that never heard of Chriſt,] becauſe that the word [Goſpel] moſt properly ſignifieth the main heart and ſubſtance of it: <hi>viz</hi> The diſcovery of Chriſts Incarnation, Life, Death, Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Aſcention, Dignity, Office, and the full New Covenant. But yet it may truly be ſaid, that ſome Goſpel Truths, and ſo ſome ſmall part of the Goſpel is revealed to theſe men; <hi>viz.</hi> the ten particulars forementioned. No doubt <hi>Paul</hi> Preached part of the Goſpel to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens at <hi>Lyſtra, Acts</hi> 14. 7, 15. &amp;c. when he mentioned Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ver. 23. Heb.</hi> 4. 2, 3. It is ſaid that the Goſpel was Preached to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Wilderneſs, who yet had little of that which now is the ſubſtance of our Creed about Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XII. That Repentance which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirerh now of all men (even them that never heard the Goſpel) is not a Helliſh, <hi>Judas</hi>-like deſpairing Repentance; (ſuch as was due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the violated Law of works:) but it is a Repentance that is appointed as means to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward recovery, and therefore hath a tendency to Salvation. Gods mercies lead to Repentance, but not to a deſpairing Repentance; for they contradict that. All the precepts of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prove this, and the courſe of Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And indeed, elſe all the remnants of Religion would be baniſhed out of the World. For deſpairing men will not Worſhip God, nor ſeek to pleaſe him, nor forbear ſinning;
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:59524:242"/>
but will hate God and live like Devils, and ſin while they may, without voluntary reſtraint. All the Sacrifices that the Heathens offered, and all their Prayers and Conſcience of Sinning ſhewed that they apprehended God merciful and placable, and their caſe remediable. Hope did keep up all that remnant of Religion which all Nations of the World have maintained, which elſe had been extinguiſhed long ago, and Earth been like Hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XIII. Theſe Heathens do all of them receive ſome Grace which was purchaſed by the Blood of Chriſt, and there is a Natural aptitude in it as in other effects, to lead the enquirer to the knowledge of the cauſe and fountain, <hi>caeteris concurrentibus;</hi> Grace is Mercy contrary to Merit. Heathens have much Mercy contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Merit, therefore they have ſome Grace.</p>
                  <p>Now all ſuch Grace is inſeparable from ſome Revelation of Goſpel Truths: Nay, indeed it is a Revelation there of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XIV. Though Chriſt giveth not to theſe Heathens ſufficient Grace to believe in his name, yet he giveth them ſufficient Grace, or merciful aid to receive and obey thoſe (or ſome of thoſe) Truths fore-mentioned which he doth reveal to them, and ſo to come nearer to Chriſt than before they were. I have before ſhewed, that all men are far from Chriſt Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and that they muſt be brought divers ſteps or degrees nearer him, before they are brought to the very act of Faith which unites men to him; ſpecially Heathens that are at the remoteſt diſtance. Alſo I have ſhewed that there is ſuch a thing as ſufficient Grace, not
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:59524:243"/>
effectual as to the event; and that both from the example, of <hi>Adam,</hi> of the wicked now, and fot he Godly themſelves. I ſhall therefore now ſuppoſe what is already proved. I have ſhewed alſo, that though God thought it not meet to engage himſelf in Covenant with ſuch, nor to make any thing ſhort of true Faith, to be the condition of his Promiſe, yet he hath appointed means to others that yet have not Faith, which they are bound to uſe towards the getting of it; and he hath given them ſufficient encouragement to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves cheerfully and vigorouſly to the uſe of thoſe means, with hope to ſpeed. So that if they neglect them they are left without excuſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XV. It belongeth to Chriſt in drawing men towards Salvation by his Rectorſhip, to reveal-oft times ſome of the forementioned Goſpel Truths by way of preparation, and to draw men nearer him, before he reveal the full ſubſtance of his Covenant, or fully promulgate his Law. As the Sun ſendeth forth ſome light before it appeareth it ſelf at its riſing, which light yet comes from the ſame Sun: So doth the Goſpel oft-times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XVI. Thoſe that have the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned truths revealed to them with hearing the Goſpel, are bound in all reaſon for the ſafety of their Souls, to uſe all poſſible diligence to make a fuller diſcovery; which is not likely that any Indians or others have done: Had they been as diligent in improving the truth received till they had been civilized, and then in ſending to all others for information where there was a probability of receiving information even
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:59524:243"/>
as men are diligent in trading tedious Voyages for Merchandize and Worldly Gain, it's like there is no Nation under Heaven but might have had the Goſpel ere now.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XVII. If men will wilfully reject and abuſe that meaſure of light and help which they do injoy, which was ſufficient to that end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it was given. (to have brought them nearer Chriſt than they were:) And if they will not uſe the means for getting of the Goſpel, which they have ſufficient help to uſe; then it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently juſt with Chriſt; even as Rector accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law of Grace, to condemn ſuch men after he hath Died for them. And if his Death prove in vain, as to their Salvation, the fault is only in themſelves, and themſelves, ſhall they blame for ever. And this is the caſe of theſe men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XVIII. Nay in this caſe the very Law of Grace, commanding Faith in Chriſt Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied doth oblige theſe men remotely to the Duty, and to puniſhment for neglect of the Duty. For though a Law not promulgate cannot oblige, yet the Queſtion is, Who it was long of? Or, Who was the faulty cauſe that it was not Publiſhed? If the Law-giver, then it cannot oblige: But if it were the ſubject, then it doth actually, though remotely oblige. For no man is to receive benefit (ſaith the Civil Law) by his own fault. Who knows not that among us if a Man will lie in an Ale-Houſe and never come to hear the word, God will judge him guilty of being Ignorant of all the Truths which he might have there learnt? And of neglecting all the Duties which he might have been informed of? And if a man
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:59524:244"/>
know ſome few preparatory Truths here, (as that he is a ſinner, and miſerable, and ought to ſeek out for remedy, and ſhould come to hear the word, and forſake his known ſin, and keep good company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and yet he deſpiſe or diſobey theſe, ſhall we ſay this Man was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bound to believe? I ſay, he is bound [remotely] that is, firſt to do ſome other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which tend towards the obtaining of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and then to believe: For the obligation to both Duties lyeth on him at once; but not an obligation to perform both Duties at once.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But if they ſhould improve their degree of Light and ſufficient Grace, they have no certainty ty (becauſe no promiſe) that the Goſpel ſhall be given them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's no excuſe as long as they have ſo full encouragement, as is before expreſſed. Should a man in danger of Death do nothing for his own ſafety without a certainty of ſucceſs? Should not the leaſt hope of probability (much more ſo high a probability) be enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite men to ſeek the ſaving of their own lives? Suppoſe a King having paſt an Act of Oblivion (upon a ranſom to that end) for a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Traytors (as <hi>Ireland,</hi>) ſhould ſend his Herald to proclaim it to all: But to ſome of them he ſendeth before hand ſome inferior meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, telling them in the Kings Name, that he is placable, and their caſe remediable, and he requires them to uſe certain means (as Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Petition, Laying down Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:59524:244"/>
try what the King will do? If theſe men reject unthankfully this favour, and abuſe the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and perſiſt in Rebellion, is it not juſt with the King to forbid the Herald, that he proclaim not to them the act of oblivion? And is it not long of themſelves if they never hear it, nor have any benefit by it? ſo is it in the preſent caſe. By the abuſe of ſufficient Grace to have come nearer Chriſt, do the Pagans forfeit all other fruits of his blood. So that Chriſt may truly be ſaid to have done his part even as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator; and to have promulgated his new Law among them, in that he did his part, and ſo it's promulgate <hi>moraliter vel Reputativè,</hi> though it was not <hi>actualiter &amp; perfectè</hi> through their own fault. It is not long of Chriſt but of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that it was not done fully, in that they ungratefully rejected his Precurſors or Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that came before the Goſpel. Seeing they would not make uſe of the Twilight or Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, Chriſt juſtly denieth them the Sun-Riſing.</p>

                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XIX. It ſeems moſt probable that it was not only <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin that is imputable to his Poſterity, but that we are all ſtill guilty of all our Parents ſin to this Day; and that therefore God may juſtly deprive a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the light of the Goſpel for their Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors ſins, and that not only according to the Law of Works, but even according to the Law of Grace.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſtand now on the proof of this, any further than to tell you;</p>
                  <p>1. That the ſame ſolid Arguments which prove the imputableneſs of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, ſeem to
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:59524:245"/>
me to prove this; and by denying this we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the grounds of the Doctrine of the ſaid Imputation.</p>
                  <p>2. And that the Second Commandment, with all thoſe Examples of Gods deſtroying the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with the Parents, and for their ſin, do ſeem fully to prove it; together with the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Godly men to humble themſelves for their Fathers Sins. Yet underſtand me thus, that though according to the Law of Works we are guilty of all our Parents Sins; yet the Law of Grace Promiſeth that no man ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed for them, who diſowneth them by true Repentance and taking a contrary courſe (in obedience) when he comes to Age. (This is the ſenſe of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. and 18.) And ſo the guilt is cut off, and the Child by the Covenant of Grace taken in with its Parents, and ſo is looked on as in his immediate Parents, and the ſin of former Parents forgiven him; though yet that guilt will return if when he comes to Age he ungratefully reject the mercy by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>I do but propound this to Divines to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: For certainly if we prove all guilty of all our Parents Sins; it is ſad that the Church hath no better underſtood it, and that we have none almoſt that ever bewailed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acknowledged, or pray'd for Remiſſion of ſuch a Guilt; nor any Miniſters that ever acquainted them with it (yet <hi>Urſine</hi> and ſome few I find make it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) yet here is no ground for their objection, who ſay, that then for the Sin of <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Cham,</hi> God may deſtroy all their preſent Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="475" facs="tcp:59524:245"/>To which I Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. According to the Law of Works, he may.</p>
                  <p>2. According to the Law of Grace, if there have been no Godly intermediate Progenitors. (which is falſe or improbable.)</p>
                  <p>3. Or if the Children prove wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious themſelves, God may bring on that Generation the Evlis deſerved by the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yet is there a great difference in degree between guilt from Progenitors, and guilt from our own Perſonal voluntary Actions; and therefore God never imputeth the former where men are perſonally obedient and penitent; but lays it as an addition to their perſonal guilt, on the Impenitent and Diſobedient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XX. I cannot find in Scripture where it is clearly revealed to us, on what terms God will Judge thoſe that heard not of Chriſt. In general we find that he will judge them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their uſage of the Talents of Mercy received, and not according to the rigour of the Law of works as it ſtands alone; but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly how God will proceed with them, or whether any Heathen be ever ſaved? I cannot find that he hath revealed. For indeed it doth not concern us to know it. I dare not ſay that any of them (<hi>Socrates, Seneca, Plato,</hi> &amp;c.) are ſaved: Nor dare I ſay that I am certain they are not: They that are certain let them be thankful for their knowledge, and not be angry with me for confeſſing my Ignorance. And I hope they will diſtinguiſh between Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Error, and therefore not charge me with Error in this. It ſeems to me that theſe
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:59524:246"/>
men being not under any conditional Promiſe of Life, (for Faith is the condition) therefore they cannot lay claim to Salvation by the Tenour of the Covenant. (Though ſome think that the Promiſe of Pardon and Life to them that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent may give them an intereſt:) But yet God is not engaged to the contrary, but dealeth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily with them, and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know his dealings particularly and fully herein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XXI. Thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of the neceſſity of Chriſt to mans Salvation (for ſatisfying Juſtice) do plainly extend it to all men in the World, but thoſe that ſpeak of the neceſſity of believing ſeem to limit it to them that hear the Goſpel, or might have heard it but for their own fault. It is true of all men, that there is no other name given under Heaven by which they can be ſaved, but the Name of Jeſus: There is no Remiſſion but by his Blood, nor Acceptance with God but for the ſake of his Satisfaction and Merits. But it may be obſerved from the Context, that when it is ſaid [He that believeth not ſhall be Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned] it is plainly fore-implyed, that they are ſuch as are called to believe. It hath the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a threatning and therefore preſuppoſeth the ſin of Unbelief, and that it be not meer Negative Unbelief, but Privative; and that ſuppoſeth the duty of believing, and that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the command conſtituting the Duty, and that ſuppoſeth Natural Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Man, (though not Moral) and the Natural poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obeying. Peruſe each particular Text of this Nature and you will find this true.</p>

The ſame Faith which is now among us of abſolute neceſſity to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation, was not ſo to thoſe before Chriſt; therefore it is not <hi>per ſe</hi> of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to Juſtification by Chriſt: Therefore if God ſo pleaſe, thoſe that hear not the Goſpel may be Juſtified without that Faith which to us is neceſſary. <hi>If we believe not that Jeſus is the Chriſt we ſhall Die in our ſins.</hi> But this was not neceſſary to the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſts coming: Nay, it appears by divers paſſages in the Goſpel, that Chriſts own Twelve Apoſtles after they had long heard his Teaching, and ſeen his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did not believe that Chriſt ſhould be put to Death, and be made a Sacrifice for Sin; much leſs his Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely is it then that all the true believers of the World long before ſhould believe this? (How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome Prophets might diſcern much of it.) Do but well peruſe every example of believing in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and ſee what Faith it was that then ſaved them.

                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XXIV. God can if he pleaſe pardon and ſave men for the ſake of Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, without letting them once know that Chriſt ſatisfied for them, elſe he cannot ſave an Infant or an Ideot. Some Divines (as <hi>Twiſſe, &amp;c.</hi>) are ſo bold as to ſay, that God could have pardoned Sin without Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:59524:247"/>
I dare not ſay ſo: But methinks the ſame men ſhould never make mans knowledge or belief of Chriſts ſatisfaction, to be abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, if the ſatisfaction it ſelf be not: Dare any ſay, [My own Faith was more neceſſary than Chriſts Death? I could have been ſaved without Chriſt, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not without Faith.] God could have forgiven men abſolutely if he would, or elſe have made ſome other condition, when once his Juſtice was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: And therefore we cannot conclude that this is the condition to any further than Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith ſo.</p>

                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVI. Thoſe who think it poſſible for a <hi>Socrates, Seneca,</hi> &amp;c. to be ſaved, (or one that never heard the Goſpel) do not hereby equal Heatheniſm with Chriſtianity, nor make our Religion needleſs: For they,</p>
                  <p>1. Make their Salvation leſs certain, and ours moſt certain.</p>
                  <p>2. And their Salvation moſt difficult (as for a man to hit a narrow way in the dark;) and ours incomparably more eaſie (as for a man to hit the right way by day-light.)</p>
                  <p>3. And that therefore they are very few of them that are Saved; but Multitudes with us.</p>
                  <p>4. That their Glory ſhall be leſſer (as his that improved the two Talents;) and ours

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVII. If all the Heathen be Damned, though their loſs will be materially equal with ours, yet formally as a privation (for they were never in our capacity of Glory;) and their <hi>poena ſenſus,</hi> will not be near equal to ours either materially or formally. For their Conſciences will never torment them for the refuſal of Chriſt revealed, and Heaven offered to them, or any other ſins which they were not capable of committing. Nay, if it were true that ſome teach, that they had no Goſpel Mercy or Grace given or offered to them, nor any ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ever made for them by Chriſt, then ſhould they eſcape all the ſorer puniſhment of the new Law, and never ſuffer at all for Abuſe of that mercy, or rejecting a Redeemer, or any fruit of his ſatisfaction which he made for them. And this would be an eaſie Hell in compariſon of theirs that refuſe Chriſt offered them.</p>

            <head>DISPUTATION OF Special Redemption;</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether Chriſt Died with a Special Intention of bringing Infallibly, Immutably, and Inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably certain Choſen Perſons to Saving Faith, Juſtification, and Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Queſtion is ſo cautelouſly and clearly expreſſed, that I need not ſay much for the explication of it, but ſhall directly determine it <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> only in brief take notice of theſe things, as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Terms.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We mean here the <hi>Intention</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> [<hi>as God;</hi>] for ſo he <hi>knew all things,</hi> and <hi>Willed</hi> all the Good which he knew. But whether as Man, he that knew not the day nor hour of his own coming to Judgment did know the number and names of his own Elect that ever were and ſhould be, and conſequently, whether he had a ſpecial Intention concerning the Salvation of each of them in particular; this I ſhall purpoſely leave undetermined.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is therefore implied by us, that
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:59524:249"/>
the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> had the ſame Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we affirm Chriſt to have had.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the word [<hi>Intention</hi>] we mean that Act of Chriſt's Will, which is reſembled by <hi>Intention</hi> in mere man, and ſo is <hi>Analogically</hi> called <hi>Intention.</hi> And we confine it not to the <hi>Will alone,</hi> but take it as comprehending that <hi>Counſel</hi> of the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> or that <hi>ſimple Knowledge,</hi> which the act of the <hi>Will</hi> ſuppoſeth: Nor do we take it in the <hi>ſtrict</hi> ſenſe, as it is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated only on the <hi>End,</hi> and ſo <hi>Intentio Finis</hi> is diſtinct from <hi>Election</hi> of the <hi>means:</hi> but more largely as it may comprehend either of theſe, for that which we commonly call a <hi>Purpoſe</hi> or <hi>Reſolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, We call it [<hi>a Special</hi> Intention; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is about a <hi>Special Object,</hi> and is not <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> or <hi>Common</hi> to all.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We call it an Intention of [<hi>Bringing</hi>] men to Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe it is Chriſt's <hi>own Work</hi> to <hi>give</hi> theſe things which he <hi>Intendeth,</hi> and ſo we difference it, both from his <hi>Intention</hi> to <hi>Permit</hi> (if ſuch there be) in caſe of <hi>Sin;</hi> and from that imagined Intention of a Partial Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; of a Concurſe determinable by the Will of Man, But tho' it be an intention of <hi>Effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that we mention, yet the <hi>Manner</hi> of this <hi>effecting,</hi> or bringing men to Believe, we here meddle not with.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is an [<hi>Infallible</hi>] effecting of this that we mention, thereby differencing it from a mere <hi>Velleity,</hi> or a <hi>conditional willing,</hi> ſo as that the very act of willing, ſhould depend upon ſome uncertain condition: as diſtinct from this we may call it <hi>Abſolute.</hi> And in the word [<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi>]
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:59524:249"/>
which reſpecteth the act of the Divine <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> we imply alſo [<hi>Immutable</hi>] which reſpecteth Gods Will: and <hi>Invincible</hi> as to his operation: and had we one word that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended theſe, it would contain our full ſenſe. It is the ſame thing which our Divines mean by the word [<hi>Irreſiſtible</hi>] or <hi>Inſuperable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, It is [<hi>Certain Perſons</hi> or <hi>Individuals,</hi>] that are the objects of this Purpoſe: which we mention as againſt the <hi>Arminian Conceit,</hi> that it is <hi>only Believers</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> or <hi>All men Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally</hi> if they will Believe, that Chriſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to Juſtifie and Save, without determining infallibly of <hi>any certain Individuals</hi> till he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that themſelves would make the difference by Believing.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, We call them [<hi>Choſen</hi>] Perſons: not <hi>a Poſteriore,</hi> upon the foreſight of their Faith: but <hi>a priore</hi> before and without any moving cauſe or condition in themſelves: It is the ſame act which we here call [<hi>Chuſing</hi>] as conſidered in <hi>Eternity,</hi> determining of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture difference of Perſons; and which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call [<hi>Special Intention,</hi>] there conſidering it as reſpecting the time of Chriſt's Death.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, The Intended effect is,</p>
            <p>1. [<hi>Saving Faith</hi>] ſuch as is not common to the Unjuſtified. This we expreſs againſt the Pelagian Conceit, that giveth <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> on condition of <hi>Faith,</hi> but not <hi>Faith it ſelf,</hi> or at leaſt not <hi>Certainly</hi> and <hi>Infallibly</hi> to any: we ſay, both that <hi>God Decreeth</hi> us to <hi>Faith</hi> as well as to <hi>Salvation by Faith,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt dying</hi> did <hi>purpoſe Infallibly</hi> to bring his
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:59524:250"/>
choſen to <hi>Believe,</hi> and this as a fruit of his Death.</p>
            <p>2. When we ſpeak of [<hi>Juſtification</hi>] as the ſecond Intended effect, we take it in <hi>Connexion</hi> with the foregoing <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſubſequent Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; meaning that all the Elect that are at Age and Believe, and they only, have that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which follows their perſonal Faith. We own not their opinion that think that many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were never Elected to Salvation, were yet Elected to Faith and Juſtification, and do fall from theſe at laſt and periſh: Tho' yet we reverence many that have maintained or owned this opinion, as precious Servants of God: and think not ſo hardly of their opinion, as of their's who maintain the Apoſtacy of the Elect, if now there be any ſuch. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf ſeems fully to go that way, who yet maintaineth the perſeverance of all the Elect: And ſo doth <hi>Muſculus</hi> and ſome others among the Reformed Divines called <hi>Calviniſts:</hi> But for the <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Infants</hi> which hath <hi>no ſuch connexion</hi> to a <hi>perſonal Faith</hi> of their own, whether it may <hi>ceaſe</hi> when they come to the uſe of Reaſon for want of perſonal faith to continue it (which was the Judgment of <hi>Davenant,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ward, Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus,</hi> and many of our own) this I intend not here to determine or meddle with.</p>
            <p>3. We anumerate <hi>Salvation,</hi> that is, <hi>Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> to theſe intended effects of Chriſt's Death for his choſen, this being the <hi>End</hi> of all the former, and therefore we imply that <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> and a State of Juſtification was intended infallibly and certainly to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="485" facs="tcp:59524:250"/>Tenthly, Obſerve that we do not here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the <hi>preſent immediate effects</hi> of Chriſt's Death as a <hi>ſatisfaction to Juſtice:</hi> For I doubt not but the ſins of the <hi>Non-Elect</hi> did lye upon him, as the <hi>pro meritorious Cauſe</hi> of his Suffering as well as the ſins of the <hi>Elect,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he made <hi>Satisfaction for them</hi> to God, and <hi>purchaſed them</hi> by his Blood.</p>
            <p>Eleventh and Laſtly, Obſerve, that in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Infallible, Immutable, purpoſe of God,</hi> to ſave his <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>them only,</hi> we do not deny his <hi>Purpoſe of giving Pardon and Life in Chriſt Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally</hi> to thoſe that are <hi>not Elect:</hi> For that which he hath done in <hi>Time,</hi> he <hi>Purpoſed before Time</hi> (and ſo did Chriſt at his Death.) But in <hi>Time</hi> he hath <hi>made</hi> ſuch a <hi>general Conditional Grant or Gift of Chriſt and Life,</hi> (as is legible in the Goſpel beyond all exceptions,) <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore according to his (<hi>Legiſlative Will, antecedently, God would have all men to be ſaved;</hi> tho' <hi>conſequently</hi> conſidering many as <hi>finally Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Unbelievers,</hi> he <hi>Wills</hi> as a <hi>Righteous Judge,</hi> their <hi>Damnation.</hi> Nor will I diſpute, whether as we aſcribe a <hi>Volition</hi> to God as the cauſe of his <hi>Effectual Grace;</hi> ſo we may aſcribe a <hi>Velleity</hi> to him (as <hi>Lud. Crocius</hi> and other of our Divines do) as the cauſe of that <hi>Grace</hi> which proveth <hi>not-effectual:</hi> in both, ſpeaking of him from the manner of man.</p>
            <p>Upon this very curſory explication, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to prove the <hi>Theſis,</hi> thus,</p>
            <p>Argum. I. <hi>If Chriſt Died with a Special Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bring his choſen Infallibly to Believe, and to give them Juſtification and Glorification on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of believing, then he died with a ſpecial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:59524:251"/>
of bringing infallibly certain choſen perſons, to Faith, Juſtification and Salvation. But the Antecedent is true, therefore ſo is the conſequent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which we have to prove therefore is, that he had a <hi>Special Intent</hi> to <hi>give Faith</hi> to ſome Infallibly, and then there will be no more queſtion of <hi>Juſtification and Glorification.</hi> And that I prove thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatever Grace Chriſt giveth abſolutely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly, that he purpoſed before to give abſolutely and infallibly. But Chriſt giveth the Grace of Faith (and Repentance) to his choſen (and them only) abſolutely and infallibly. Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By [<hi>giving</hi>] in this Argument I mean, the <hi>actual Cauſation</hi> or <hi>Collation</hi> of <hi>faith it ſelf,</hi> and not <hi>merely a Legal giving</hi> a <hi>right</hi> to it, of which anon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> I think, no ſober Chriſtian will deny. For how can the <hi>Omniſcient, Immutable God,</hi> be ſuddenly ſurprized with a new purpoſe which never came into his mind before our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Believers?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved 1. From the <hi>viſible Event.</hi> 2. From <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We ſee <hi>und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>niably</hi> that ſome men <hi>have Faith,</hi> and others <hi>have not:</hi> therefore we know that God giveth it abſolutely and infallibly to thoſe only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj</hi> God gave it to all alike, but the reſt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. If that were true of God's <hi>Moral Civil</hi> way of <hi>giving,</hi> yet it <hi>cannot</hi> be true of his <hi>Phyſical gift</hi> or <hi>operation</hi> which we now ſpeak
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:59524:251"/>
of: for <hi>that giving</hi> is ever connexed with <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving:</hi> As God never giveth a <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>any Body,</hi> nor <hi>health</hi> to any <hi>Sick man,</hi> but thoſe that <hi>receive them,</hi> ſo he never thus <hi>gives Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, a New-heart, to any</hi> but thoſe that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> He offereth Chriſt and Grace to believe in him to All: and offering is conditional giving: and he doth no more to any, but on ſuppoſition of their Reception, or performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. It's falſe, that he <hi>actually offers Chriſt to all,</hi> tho' as to the <hi>tenour of the Gift</hi> he doth, which without the <hi>Promulgation</hi> (which extends not to Millions of Heathens) is no <hi>actual offer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Much leſs, or as little, doth he offer them <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. It's falſe, that he <hi>doth no more but offer Faith conditionally</hi> to his <hi>choſen:</hi> For he <hi>effecteth</hi> it abſolutely. To [<hi>offer Conditionally</hi>] is a <hi>Civil act,</hi> and we are ſpeaking of a <hi>Phyſical Cauſing:</hi> This objection therefore flatly denieth that God is the Author of any man's Faith.</p>
            <p>We therefore prove it out of Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> The Expoſitors that are moſt againſt the Doctrine which I defend, do confeſs that it is <hi>Faith,</hi> (and not <hi>Salvatiin</hi> only) that is here called, <hi>the Gift of God;</hi> but they ſay, <hi>God giveth it, by giving the object, Chriſt and the Goſpel. Anſw.</hi> That is ſomewhat <hi>towards the giving of Faith,</hi> but that
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:59524:252"/>
is not the <hi>giving of Faith,</hi> if there be no more. Do theſe men think that the unrenewed faculty hath need of <hi>no Grace</hi> but an <hi>object</hi> or <hi>perſwaſion</hi> from without, to cauſe it <hi>to believe?</hi> Many have the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that have not <hi>Faith:</hi> therefore God hath not <hi>cauſed</hi> ſuch to <hi>believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>Who are kept by the Power of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</hi> God's <hi>Power</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in <hi>keeping</hi> us in <hi>Faith</hi> as the <hi>means</hi> to <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> the <hi>end:</hi> And he that by his mighty Power keeps us in Faith, no doubt did cauſe it.</p>
            <p>2 Pet. 1. 3. <hi>According as his Divine Power hath given to us all things that pertain to Life and Godlineſs, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to Glory and Virtue.</hi> If he give us <hi>all things pertaining to Life,</hi> then he gives us Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Faith is expreſly excepted, in the Words [through the knowledge of him that hath called us] that is, through our own believing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. It is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, as <hi>a Gift</hi> which is a <hi>means</hi> to the <hi>other gifts,</hi> but not excepted.</p>
            <p>II. Our <hi>following acts</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> ſeem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the [<hi>All things</hi>] here mentioned, <hi>viz. Through our firſt believing God giveth us Chriſt, the Spirit, and all following Grace.</hi> And if the following acts of Faith are the gifts of God, then no doubt the firſt was ſo, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us when we were leſs able of our ſelves to perform it, then when we are <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 12. 2. <hi>Jeſus is the Author and Finiſher of our Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="489" facs="tcp:59524:252"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> That's meant of the Doctrine of our belief, and Objects of Faith; the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. Then to be the <hi>Finiſher</hi> and to be the <hi>Author</hi> would be all one. For as ſoon as Chriſt was the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> he was the <hi>Finiſher:</hi> but not ſo about our <hi>own Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. If it <hi>were ſo,</hi> yet may it be meant of <hi>Faith</hi> as it contains both, even the whole work of our <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Phil. 1. 29. <hi>For to you it is given on the behalf of Chriſt not only to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> From this Text <hi>Grotius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth that it is proved that <hi>Faith is the gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Joh. 3. 27. <hi>A man can receive nothing except it be given him from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>nothing,</hi> then <hi>not Faith.</hi> If they ſay, they <hi>received it not,</hi> the Apoſtles queſtion may ſhame them. <hi>What haſt thou which thou haſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> That's meant of gifts that were for Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. Much more of Faith, which is a ſpecial Grace.</p>
            <p>II. It is <hi>General,</hi> implying that we <hi>have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we received not,</hi> that thence he might conclude [<hi>Therefore not ſuch Gifts.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Joh. 6. 44. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father which hath ſent me draw him, ver.</hi> 65. Therefore ſaid I unto <hi>you, No man can come unto me except it were given to him of my Father.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. The <hi>Drawing</hi> here mentioned is the ſame with [<hi>giving to come to him.</hi>]</p>
            <p>II. It is given as the Reaſon why <hi>ſome Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not,</hi> becauſe <hi>none can come</hi> except it be <hi>given them,</hi> and they be <hi>drawn.</hi> Thoſe that <hi>believed not</hi> had your <hi>Moral drawing</hi> which was <hi>uneffectual,</hi> but it is evident, they had not the <hi>drawing</hi> which Chriſt mentioneth.</p>
            <p>Luk. 17. 5. <hi>Lord increaſe our Faith.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt <hi>give</hi> it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> That is a Faith of Miracles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Saving Faith</hi> is as much Gods Gift as that: and the Soul as unapt to it till he give it.</p>
            <p>Mark 9. 24. <hi>Lord I believe: help thou mine Unbelief.</hi> He that muſt <hi>Help</hi> our <hi>Unbelief,</hi> that is, <hi>give us more Faith,</hi> muſt <hi>help our total Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> by <hi>giving</hi> us our <hi>firſt Faith,</hi> which we are moſt unable to perform of our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Gal. 5. 22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> That's meant of Fidelity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. That's unproved; that it's <hi>only</hi> meant of that.</p>
            <p>II. If common fidelity muſt be wrought by the Spirit, much more <hi>Saving Faith in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all theſe it's further objected, that <hi>God
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:59524:253"/>
giveth Faith equally to All, that is, his help to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi> but it is only the <hi>Materia Diſpoſita that receiveth it,</hi> and the reaſon why <hi>ſome</hi> have it <hi>not,</hi> is becauſe they are <hi>not diſpoſed</hi> or prepared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If this be ſo, that this is the Reaſon of his <hi>denying</hi> faith to <hi>ſome,</hi> yet the <hi>contrary diſpoſition</hi> is not the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of his <hi>giving faith</hi> to <hi>others.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Undiſpoſedneſs</hi> is only a <hi>Reaſon ſufficient</hi> to <hi>Juſtifie God's denial</hi> of Grace, but not <hi>Diſabling</hi> him to <hi>give</hi> it, or <hi>neceſſitating</hi> him to <hi>deny</hi> it. Elſe all men ſhould periſh, who are <hi>undiſpoſed</hi> unleſs they <hi>diſpoſe</hi> themſelves. And this is plain <hi>Semi-Polagianiſm,</hi> that Grace is tyed to ſuch Diſpoſitions of our own.</p>
            <p>2. Prove if you can that ever God hath made a Promiſe of Faith, to men on condition of any prerequiſite Diſpoſitions. I find no ſuch thing in the Word.</p>
            <p>3. Are thoſe <hi>Diſpoſitions Gods Gifts</hi> or not? If not, then all is ultimately reſolved into <hi>mans will,</hi> and we have <hi>ſomething</hi> that we <hi>have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> If they be, then they are given <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> or <hi>Conditionally.</hi> If <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> then they are not ſo given to <hi>All,</hi> elſe <hi>All</hi> ſhould <hi>have them</hi> and ſo <hi>Believe.</hi> If <hi>Conditionally;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. What is the <hi>Condition?</hi> They ſay our <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance:</hi> But our <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> is either <hi>Habitual</hi> or <hi>Actual.</hi> The <hi>Actual</hi> is our <hi>Actual Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing;</hi> The <hi>Habitual</hi> is our <hi>Habitual Unwillingneſs, Deadneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Muſt we cure all this of our ſelves, before God will give us Faith? I will not ſay as Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> that <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> is <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> that is, <hi>Faith it ſelf</hi> that is the contrary to this Reſiſtance or Unwillingneſs; becauſe you may tell me, that to be <hi>unwilling of Chriſt as offered,</hi>
               <pb n="492" facs="tcp:59524:254"/>
and to be <hi>Unwilling that God ſhould make me wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Chriſt, or give me Faith,</hi> by the means of my hearing, is not all one. But this I ſay, that the <hi>best did reſiſt</hi> and were <hi>unwilling</hi> both of <hi>Chriſt and Faith,</hi> till God did overcome their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. And that God hath not promiſed Faith on condition of mans Non-reſiſtance that I know of.</p>
            <p>2. Is this <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> or <hi>Willingneſs</hi> to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the <hi>Gift</hi> of God or not? If not, then we have ſomewhat which we did not receive, and then all Grace ſtill is ultimately reſolved (with the <hi>Pelagians</hi>) into mans will; and man makes himſelf to differ, which I diſproved in the laſt days Exerciſe. If it be <hi>Gods Gift,</hi> then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abſolute</hi> (and ſo proper to <hi>ſome:</hi>) Or <hi>Conditional,</hi> and then that muſt have a <hi>Condition;</hi> and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> till you ſtop in ſome <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Gift</hi> not common to all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> God is not the total, but partial Cauſe, and therefore he doth quantum in ſe give Faith to all, and that ſome are yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, is long of themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. I confeſs that it is long of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that any are Unbelievers.</p>
            <p>II. Though man believe, yet it ſeems to me that God is not to be called <hi>Cauſa partialis,</hi> but <hi>totalis</hi> in that Supream Cauſality which he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth.</p>
            <p>III. That God doth <hi>quantum in ſe</hi> give all men Faith, may be underſtood either.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Quantum in ſe quoad potentiam, as much as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e can:</hi> But that's Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:59524:254"/>2. <hi>Quantum in ſe quoad Decentiam, as much as is meet for him to do.</hi> But who dare ſay that it is <hi>unmeet</hi> for God to give men ſuch effectual grace as ſhall <hi>Infallibly cauſe</hi> them to <hi>Believe?</hi> He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſuch to his Elect, and therein doth not any thing that is <hi>unmeet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Or elſe it is meant, that God giveth ſo much help to unbelievers, as leaves all the <hi>blame of their unbelief</hi> upon themſelves, and juſtifieth him from being the <hi>culpable deficient</hi> or <hi>efficient Cauſe:</hi> And this I grant, but this is no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Adverſary. But I have been too long on this firſt Argument.</p>
            <p>Arg. II. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt dying intended the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Glorification of Gods free grace in the certain Regeneration, Juſtification and Glorification of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men, therefore he intended the infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Regeneration (or Faith) and Justification and Glorification of thoſe men</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Chriſt came into the World with a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain intention</hi> to accompliſh the <hi>glorifying of God</hi> as <hi>his end;</hi> is undoubted. For to ſay either that he undertook ſo great a work <hi>without an end,</hi> or that the <hi>glory of Gods grace and love</hi> was <hi>not</hi> that <hi>end,</hi> are both impious. And as certain is it that it was the glory of Gods <hi>grace in</hi> the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Salvation of ſome</hi> men that was <hi>intended.</hi> For as there is <hi>no other way</hi> of this <hi>full glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Gods grace,</hi> manifeſted to us, but only by <hi>mans Salvation,</hi> ſo the Scripture moſt frequently tells us that <hi>this is the way,</hi> and this was <hi>God's deſign,</hi> and therefore Chriſt is ſtiled <hi>the Saviour,</hi> which certainly implyeth that he hath <hi>ſome infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly to ſave,</hi> and that he came to <hi>ſeek and to ſave
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:59524:255"/>
that which was lost.</hi> And if it were not the Salvation of <hi>Determinate Perſons</hi> that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to glorify himſelf in, then was it not in the <hi>Salvation of any man at all:</hi> for <hi>all Salvation</hi> is <hi>ſome ones Salvation. Accidents</hi> exiſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Subject.</hi> And if it were not a <hi>certain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> of <hi>this end by this means</hi> that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, then Chriſt came upon an <hi>uncertain er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi> into the World, and intended not the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain attainment</hi> of Gods glory herein, which is unreaſonable to imagine. So admirably was this deſign of Redemption laid, ſuch a wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Myſtery is it to Angels and Men, that it is apparent God intended infallibly the attaining of his bleſſed ends thereby. And ſo precious was the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that it is impious to imagine that he had no certain end in the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, or that it might have been loſt as to the glory of Gods grace, and the Salvation of any perſons, for any thing that he intended to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Arg. III. <hi>What Chriſt intended from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that he intended in dying</hi> (which was yet future) <hi>but Chriſt did from all Eternity intend the certain justification and glorification of his Choſen, and giving them faith to that end, therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it on the Croſs, and at his undertaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Argument divolves the whole Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to the point of <hi>Predestination,</hi> where it is plain that it lyeth, which becauſe our Divines have fully vindicated, I will now paſs by.</p>
            <p>Arg. IV. <hi>God hath made an ab olute Promiſe that he will infallibly Convert, Pardon and ſave ſome, viz.</hi> his Choſen,) <hi>which he hath not made
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:59524:255"/>
concerning others, therefore he intended the certain Converſion, Remiſſion, and Salvation of thoſe ſome, and not of others</hi> (in giving Chriſt, and ſo did Chriſt in giving his Life.)</p>
            <p>Jer. 31. 33. <hi>This is my Covenant, &amp;c. I will put my Law in their minds, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People. So I will take the hard heart out of their body, and give them an heart of fleſh, a new heart, one heart, &amp;c. And I will put my fear into their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Such Promiſes are not <hi>to all,</hi> nor <hi>Conditional:</hi> If they are, <hi>what is the Condition?</hi> Now what God <hi>Promiſeth,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he <hi>Performeth,</hi> and <hi>intended</hi> to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>Arg. V. <hi>If Chriſt intended not the certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Juſtification, and Glorification of his Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, more than of others, then thoſe in Heaven are no more beholden to his intention or his death, than thoſe in Hell, nor the Regenerate, than the Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. But the Conſequent is intollerable, therefore ſo is the Antecedent.</hi> At leaſt it will follow that they are no more beholden to him for <hi>their Faith,</hi> than they that never had it.</p>
            <p>Arg. VI. <hi>Either God Purpoſed (in giving his Son, and Chriſt in dying) the certain Salvation</hi> (and ſo <hi>Converſion</hi>) <hi>of All, of None,</hi> or <hi>of Some only.</hi> Not <hi>of All,</hi> for then <hi>All ſhould</hi> be <hi>Saved.</hi> Not of <hi>None,</hi> for then either <hi>None ſhould</hi> be <hi>Saved,</hi> or elſe they ſhould be <hi>Saved without</hi> or <hi>againſt Gods Purpoſe.</hi> Not <hi>againſt it,</hi> as will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. <hi>Not without it,</hi> for,</p>
            <p>1. He who <hi>Saveth them</hi> in <hi>Time, Purpoſed</hi> it from <hi>Eternity, for he worketh all things after the counſel of his own Will.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="496" facs="tcp:59524:256"/>2. He whoſe <hi>Providence</hi> extendeth to the <hi>falling of a Sparrow,</hi> and the <hi>cloathing of the Graſs,</hi> doth ſure <hi>provide</hi> and <hi>regard</hi> the Salvation of Mankind, and ſaveth not man without his <hi>own purpoſe to ſave him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If it be a <hi>Performed Act,</hi> and not a <hi>Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Act,</hi> for God to Convert and Save, then it would be either an <hi>Irrational Act</hi> which had <hi>no end,</hi> or elſe <hi>that</hi> purpoſe muſt be <hi>new</hi> in him, which was not at <hi>Chriſts dying;</hi> both which are <hi>intollerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they ſay that he <hi>purpoſed it Conditionally,</hi> or <hi>quantum in ſe,</hi> determining <hi>nothing Abſolutely</hi> of the Event, I have anſwered enough to that before.</p>
            <p>Arg. VII. <hi>Ad hominem:</hi> The Adverſaries grant in effect the ſubſtance of our Concluſion; for,</p>
            <p>1. They grant, <hi>That God Infallibly decreed to Save all that would believe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That God knew from Eternity who would Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and who not,</hi> and that <hi>Christ knew this at his undertaking to dye,</hi> and <hi>at his death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. They grant that <hi>he doth not abſolutely purpoſe the ſaving of any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. They grant, <hi>That as Chriſt dyed not from Eternity,</hi> ſo we are to look on him as <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to dye for us, and entring</hi> upon the <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory work,</hi> not <hi>from Eternity</hi> (upon his meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,) but <hi>preſently upon Mans fall,</hi> when the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made:</hi> for the <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>Extrinſic a Denomination</hi> might then begin, tho' no <hi>new Act</hi> of Gods Will.</p>
            <p>Lay all this together, that God reſolved to ſave <hi>all Believers,</hi> and knew each of them by name that would believe, and who would not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="497" facs="tcp:59524:256"/>
and intended to ſave no other than Believers, and that <hi>after this</hi> Chriſt <hi>undertook</hi> and <hi>performed</hi> the <hi>ſatisfaction by his death;</hi> and I think, the main that we plead for is granted, as to the <hi>Intent of Christ infallibly to juſtifie,</hi> and <hi>ſave ſome determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Perſons only.</hi> Nor can they deny this with any modeſty, in conſiſtency with their conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>But then its true, that they yield not that he <hi>Intended</hi> the <hi>giving of Faith infallibly and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> to <hi>ſome only,</hi> becauſe they ſay, he intended not <hi>ſo to give it to any,</hi> but only offer them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient help to believe, and leave it to their own wills whether to make it effectual or to fruſtrate it: And withal they ſay, that it was upon the <hi>foreſight</hi> that <hi>ſome would Believe,</hi> and <hi>others not,</hi> that he intended the Salvation of ſome determinate Perſons, and condemnation of others.</p>
            <p>But having ſpoke to this already, I only now add,</p>
            <p>1. Yet ſtill this grants that <hi>Chriſt dyed with a ſpecial intent of ſaving thoſe determinate Perſons and them only,</hi> tho' they ſuppoſe this <hi>Intent</hi> to be upon a <hi>foreſight</hi> of their <hi>own Faith,</hi> or <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I demand whether <hi>God could not</hi> without wrong to any of his Attributes, have <hi>cauſed</hi> thoſe to <hi>Believe,</hi> whom he <hi>foreſaw</hi> would <hi>be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,</hi> and ſo having <hi>decreed</hi> to <hi>cauſe them</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> as well <hi>as others,</hi> have <hi>foreſeen</hi> that <hi>they would Believe.</hi> They that dare ſay, <hi>God could not have given any ſuch Unbeliever Grace to Believe</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,) do moſt audaciouſly abuſe Gods power, goodneſs, and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:59524:257"/>3. And doth not God <hi>do more</hi> for <hi>Peter,</hi> than for <hi>Judas,</hi> for the <hi>Elect</hi> than the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> antecedently to their Faith? all the <hi>Arminians</hi> are not bold enough to deny it.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf grants, that after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe and rejecting of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God gives up ſome, as <hi>Pharaoh, Ahab &amp;c.</hi> to <hi>fill up the meaſure of their ſin,</hi> and penally forſakes them; and I think they will grant that ſome others <hi>as bad</hi> are <hi>not ſo forſaken</hi> nor given up, but <hi>Converted,</hi> as <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if God ſhew this undeſerved Mercy to a <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> which he denyeth to a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> is it not his <hi>free grace</hi> that makes <hi>Manaſſeh to differ?</hi> And if God may do ſo in one, why not in others?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Schoolmen, and moſt Papiſts will acknowledge, that <hi>Chriſt dyed for all men as to the ſufficiency of his death, and for ſome men only efficiently;</hi> that is, to effect ſome mens Salvation.</p>
            <p>And doth not this grant that he <hi>dyed not for all alike,</hi> and that he had a <hi>ſpecial intent</hi> of <hi>Saving ſome,</hi> which he had not as to <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We eaſily grant that he hath <hi>effected ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for all,</hi> but he that <hi>intended only</hi> the Saving of <hi>Believers,</hi> could not <hi>intend</hi> to ſave thoſe Perſons actually by his death, who he <hi>knew</hi> would <hi>not believe,</hi> but periſh in <hi>unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe Reaſons we proceed to ſome from particular Texts of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> John 17. 2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give Eternal
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:59524:257"/>
Life to as many as thou hast given him.</hi> Here Chriſts <hi>Authority</hi> as <hi>Redeemer</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>over all fleſh,</hi> and ſo <hi>all are</hi> his <hi>purchaſed ones;</hi> but the <hi>purpoſe</hi> of giving <hi>actually Eternal Life,</hi> is expreſly reſtrained to thoſe that are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>given him</hi> by the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> By Giving is not meant abſolute E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting from Eternity, but giving them by Vocation to Chriſt as true Diſciples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe that be ſo:</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Giving</hi> them to be true Diſciples, can import no leſs than God's <hi>making them Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> that is, <hi>Believers:</hi> And ſo it is not Man that <hi>gives himſelf to Chriſt primarily,</hi> or makes himſelf a <hi>Believer:</hi> And God makes not <hi>all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> which he could do if he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>2. And if God give men to Chriſt by effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Vocation in time, then no doubt he decreed ſo to do from Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Eph. 1. 22, 23. <hi>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the intent of God in <hi>giving Chriſt,</hi> is expreſſed to be, that <hi>he might be the head over all,</hi> but not the <hi>Head of All,</hi> but <hi>of the Church only.</hi> And it is he that makes his Church, and not the Church itſelf principally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> John 10. 15. <hi>I lay down my Life for the ſheep,</hi> which implyeth that it is laid down with a <hi>ſpecial intent</hi> for them, more than for <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:59524:258"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Sheep are Believers, undeterminate as to Individuals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Men are <hi>Believers before</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning</hi> of them, but not <hi>before</hi> Chriſt's <hi>laying down his Life for them;</hi> nor ſo conſidered; elſe the Act of Faith ſhould be before, and without its <hi>Object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It's confeſſed that <hi>God knew</hi> who the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were that would believe; therefore his purpoſe was of determinate Individuals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If he did not intend to purifie <hi>every man,</hi> and make them <hi>zealous of good works</hi> (eventually,) then he intended this much <hi>more to his choſen</hi> than to <hi>others.</hi> But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If he intended the ſeparating of ſome as a <hi>peculiar</hi> people, from others, then he dyed not with equal Intentions to all. But, <hi>&amp;c Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> John 11. 51, 52. <hi>He Prophecied that Jeſus ſhould dye for that Nation, and not for that Nation only, but that alſo he ſhould gather together in one, the Children of God that were ſcattered abroad.</hi> Here is expreſſed a peculiar intention of <hi>gathering God's Children,</hi> which was not of others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> God's Children are Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It ſeems rather, that they are called <hi>Children,</hi> becauſe they are decreed to be actually Children, and will be ſuch: (and not as <hi>Grotius</hi>
               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:59524:258"/>
of them, and of the Sheep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 16. as if it were from ſome diſpoſition of mind, antecedent to Faith.)</p>
            <p>2. However ſtill it is <hi>Determinate Individuals,</hi> elſe it were indeed none at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Acts 13. 48 <hi>And as many as were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Eternal Life believed.</hi> The wriglings and ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thoſe that would pervert this Text, and their new deviſed ſtrained expoſitions of the word [<hi>Ordained</hi>] I ſhall not now ſtand to detect and confute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The inſtances of the Converſion of <hi>Manaſſeh, Paul,</hi> the <hi>Thief</hi> on the Croſs, and other particular Sinners, do plainly tell us that Faith and Converſion proceedeth from God's differencing grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Paul was called, becauſe first choſen.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Whom he predestinated, them he called,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But in the Concluſion, I muſt ſay, that even in this point of notable difference between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants, and the Contra-remonſtrants, the difference is not ſo great as ſome imagine or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. It is confeſſed by the underſtanding ſort on both ſides, that Chriſt at his death had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intention to bring certain individual perſons to a ſtate of Juſtification and Salvation. But then they ſay that this was only upon the foreſight of their believing: yea, ſome of them ſay that God purpoſed to give the grace of Faith to ſome indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals only, but they ſay that it was upon the foreſight of their non-reſiſtance, or of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary diſpoſedneſs to receive it, or of their right uſe of former preparing grace; ſo that the ſame decree, as to theſe gifts, is confeſſed on both ſides; and it cannot be denyed but that the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:59524:259"/>
               <hi>foreſight</hi> which they preſuppoſe is from <hi>Eternity,</hi> and therefore Mans fall, or Chriſts Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and that there is no priority or poſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Time</hi> between the <hi>foreknowledge</hi> and the <hi>Decree,</hi> but only in <hi>Nature:</hi> And then it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly confeſſed that though <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> in Man are two things, yet in God they are but <hi>one;</hi> and are only diſtinguiſhed <hi>denominatione ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecâ</hi> by Man for the accommodation of his narrow imperfect apprehenſion. Therefore (though) I confeſs that a difference ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, yet let it not be thought to be greater than it is.</p>
            <p>Yea more, not only many, yea, moſt of the Schoolmen confeſs an Abſolute Election to Faith, and ſo to Salvation, and ſo hold in this the ſame that we do; but alſo many of the Jeſuites, and Moderate Lutherans and Arminians hold the ſame, (though not an Abſolute Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation) which was alſo <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s, <hi>Prosper</hi>'s, and <hi>Fulgentius</hi>'s Opinion. And I have elſewhere yet more contracted this Controverſie.</p>
