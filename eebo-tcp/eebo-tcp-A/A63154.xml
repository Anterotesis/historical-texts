            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Ay, on my Soul and Conscience do I; for we were at that time in as good Health and Credit as one would wish, Money was brought in to us all day long, as cheap as Neck Beef, we gave nothing for it, but little bits of Paper called <hi>Speeds Notes.</hi>

And the Jurors aforesaid do find, that the Bank aforesaid having by their Cashiers Notes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Moneys as aforesaid, contracted great Debts at home and abroad, out of their further Covetousness and Folly did deliver a Memorial for procureing an Act for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coining the silver Moneys of this Kingdom, and reducing the price of Guinea's, in hopes thereby to recover their losses by their remittances aforesaid; and also fondly fancying that their said unlawful Engines would have drawn in unto them the Moneys recoined, and the Guinea's reduced, in the same manner as they did the clipt Moneys. And the Jurors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid do say, That the recoining the said silver Moneys did occasion the greatest part of the Moneys then in the subjects hands to be drawn from them, in order to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coined, which (contrary to the fond Conceit of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors aforesaid) after the said 4<hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> 1696. did occasion great Demands to be made upon them at home and from abroad, for payment of the Bills and Notes, in currant Moneys.

               <p>There's our Evidence: But because your Counsel is not used to Crown Law, we will be so fair to inform him, that the Executors may traverse the Inquisition, if they please, being not taken <hi>super visum Corporis</hi>: Or if he can prove the Bank of <hi>England Non compos mentis</hi> at the time when they gave themselves the strokes, they will not be <hi>Felo de se.</hi>

               <p>VVhat do you tell me of Rules of Court and Land-Bank men, all you and your Banks are a pack of Cheats. I entered my mannor of <hi>M—font,</hi> with Dr. <hi>C—lain</hi> three months agoe, and can get no money yet, here we pay Taxes and Polls, and all the money is gone away into Banks, and Sallaries to Officers. I offered at first to furnish them with a set of Judges for 600 <hi>l.</hi> a year a peice; as good as any they have for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> my Brother should have been one, and then I lost 1500 <hi>l.</hi> by one of my familiar Peers, whom I used to take by the buttons in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time, but he gave me the slip to run away with his Master. If you'll chop and change your Revolutions on such suddains, how can any man get in his Debts ffrst, I am sure I have no place, and I'll tell you plainly if you don't pay me my money I'll sue you, you and all your Banks, and your Land-Banks for a pack of Cheats.</p>
