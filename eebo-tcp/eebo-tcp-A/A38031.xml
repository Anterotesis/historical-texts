         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

EDWARD,
Earl of ORFORD, Viscount

            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALL true <hi>English</hi> men have
their Eyes upon Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as their Faithful Patriot
and Protector, as a Firm Lover of
their Religion and Country; and they
all pay a profound Respect to that
Illustrious Name, in which the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Nation is so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd.
We are every one of us
sensible of those large and manifest
demonstrations which You have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us of Your Concern for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:107741:3"/>
Good in the late Happy Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
Your Heroick Enterprizes,
Your constant Fatigues, Difficulties
and Perils undergone for the Service of
Your Country, are the continual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of our Admiration. We celebrate
and applaud Your never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Engaging the <hi>French</hi> Navy;
when their <hi>Admiral</hi> felt the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
force of your Martial Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which You poured out so fast
upon him, and which produced a
a Glorious Victory over the Insulting
but Flying Foe: the remembrance
of which Great and Noble Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Your Lordship bears in Your
<hi>Honourable Title.</hi> Which way so ever
we look, whether at Sea or Land,
we find Your Lordship meriting in a
most sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al manner both of Church
and State. And Your near relation
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his Grace the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bedford;</hi>
whose Family hath been the Nursery
of Patriots and Worthies, yea, and
of <hi>Sufferers</hi> for the Publick Interest
and Welfare, renders You a Person
<pb facs="tcp:107741:3"/>
yet more Conspicuous in the world.
And lastly, That High Degree of
Honour which Your Prince hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
You to, and that Eminent and
Honourable Post Your Lordship is
now in, make You capable of being
(what is so much desired by You)
Beneficial not only to the County
You have a more particular Concern
in, but to the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But I know Your Transcendent
Modesty will scarcely suffer these
things to be said, and therefore I
dare add no more. The design of
this present Address to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
is, to express my Thankful and
Dutiful Resentments of the undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Favours cast upon me by Your
Lordship, and to offer my sincere
Wishes and Prayers to Heaven for
Your Health and Long Life, that You
may live in the favour of the <hi>Most
High,</hi> and be bless'd with His Divine
Assistance, that Success may crown
<pb facs="tcp:107741:4"/>
all Your Worthy Undertakings; that
You may continue to be Happy in
the Embraces of so Excellent and
Accomplish'd a Lady as Heaven hath
bless'd You with; that You may be
as instrumental in Preserving the
Church and State as You were in
Restoring them, that You may long
enjoy the Honour which Your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have advanc'd You to, and the
Happiness You have of possessing His
Majesty's Favour; and (in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> word)
that You may still be admired, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
and loved by all his Subjects
that are Wise and Religious.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>My Lord,</hi> permit me
to beg an Extraordinary favour of
You, but such as I know Your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
will not disdain to grant, <hi>viz.</hi>
that I may have the honour to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the following Papers to Your
Lordship's Name: which as it will
give a Glory to them, so it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
a Testimony (which is the thing
<pb facs="tcp:107741:4"/>
I design) of that Entire Service and
Duty which I owe, and shall ever
be owing to Your Lordship. I have
had Your Lordship in my eye ever
since I have begun to be a Writer,
but I could not prevail with my self
to make my Approaches <hi>of a sudden</hi>
to so Great a Personage; nor was I
furnish'd with a Subject which was
suitable to Your Lordship's Genius.
I forbore to trouble You with <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms</hi>
and <hi>Controversies,</hi> though of an
important nature: but now when the
Matters I treat of are agreeable to so
Noble and Exalted a Mind, I take
the confidence to make an Oblation
of my Discourses to Your Lordship.
And though You have sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
Your averseness to see Your
Name in Print, yet I presume to
prefix it to these Papers, which have
the <hi>Sacred Writings</hi> (for which Your
Lordship hath so great an Esteem)
for their ground-work. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
I hope they will not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
<pb facs="tcp:107741:5"/>
notwithstanding their Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Faultiness otherwise. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
begging Your Lordship's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for this Prolix Trouble, I lay
this Offering, with my self, at Your
Lordship's Feet, and crave the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be esteemed,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SEveral Years ago I was solicited by some
of my Brethren of the Clergy, and other
Worthy Friends, who were pleas'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
no ill opinion of some of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
which were deliver'd from the Pulpit,
to make them more Publick, and to expose
them to the General View: but I was at that
time furnish'd with such Reasons as would not
permit me to give way to their importunity.
But about half a Year ago, being solicited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,
I began to relent, and to comply with
such a Motion: For a Friend extorted these
Papers from me by an Argument which I was
not able to resist, he assuring me, that Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Sermons,</hi> or <hi>Practical Discourses</hi> were
call'd for by the generallity of Readers, and
were in great Esteem with them: which I
look'd upon as a Good Sign (I wish it were
an Infallible one) that they were intent upon
Practice. I was heartily glad to hear, that
the World is in so good a temper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I laid aside my former Resolution, (for
<pb facs="tcp:107741:6"/>
I had prepared Discourses of another nature
for the Press) and betook my self to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating
them with a <hi>Volume of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
whilst they were in so good a Vein, and
relish'd matters of a Religious and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
nature. And I did this the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
having lately been employ'd in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some of the Chief Articles of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith, and in animadverting on the Errors
which are contrary to them, I was forc'd on
that account to be ingaged in <hi>Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oversies</hi>
and <hi>Debates:</hi> and therefore I take the first
Opportunity to let the world see, that I take
no pleasure in Contests, that I delight not in
Insults and Philippicks, and that I prefer the
<hi>Practical</hi> part of our Holy Religion to the
<hi>Disputes</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Having thus assigned the <hi>Occasion</hi> of my
publishing these following Discourses, I will
in the next place give you a brief <hi>Account</hi> of
them. In the first I have endeavour'd to fix
the <hi>Standards</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and to shew how
they are to be Applied, especially how the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> (which are the Chief Standard
and Rule) are to be made use of in the
searches and enquiries about Divine Truths.
This Discourse lays the Foundation for those
which follow, for even the Sacred <hi>Verities</hi>
and <hi>Principles</hi> of our Religion have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to <hi>Practise.</hi> The second is of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb facs="tcp:107741:6"/>
Authority</hi> of <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Judges;</hi>
wherein I have endeavonr'd to Establish the
Right and Iurisdiction of Civil Governours
upon the sure basis of Reason and Scripture,
and thereon have grounded our <hi>Obedience</hi> to
them, which is an indispensable Law and
Duty of the Christian Institution. But as we
are to obey Magistrates, so <hi>they</hi> are to do
Homage to the King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords, and to give proof of this Reverence
and Submission by their Religious and Holy
Demeanour. Wherefore in the third place I
have shew'd the absolute Necessity of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Exemplary in their lives,</hi> and of their
surpassing others in all Moral and Religious
Actions. Next, I undertake to display th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Office of the Guides and Rulers of the
Church,</hi> the Ministers of the Gospel, the
Publick Instructors of Souls, and to shew what
<hi>Excellencies</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> they ought to
be Masters of, in order to their <hi>Edifying</hi> the
Church of Christ. Then, I descend to the
more Particular Cases and Conditions of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and shew how necessary <hi>Religion</hi> and
<hi>Vertue</hi> are to men of <hi>Traffick</hi> and <hi>Business</hi>
in the world, and that the <hi>Decay of Riches
and Plenty</hi> in a Nation is to be attributed
to their <hi>Vicious Practices.</hi> Afterwards, I
represent to the Reader that Extravagant
<hi>Pride and Vanity of Apparel</hi> which are so
conspicuous in this Age, and with that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:107741:7"/>
which becomes a Dispenser of the Divine
Oracles, I set before the offenders the <hi>Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Mischief</hi> of this Excess. Again,
I took occasion from the commencing of the
late War to satisfie the Scrupulous about the
<hi>Lawfulness,</hi> yea and <hi>Necessity</hi> in some cases
of <hi>going to War.</hi> And soon after there
was ground for another Discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>the Causes of Ill Success in Martial
Affairs.</hi> And because it was requisite that
whilst we were engaging the Enemy abroad,
there should be Peace at home, I impartially
represented the <hi>Mischievous and Pernicious
Consequences of Intestine Broils and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
in a Kingdom,</hi> and warmly Exhorted
to Vnity and Concord.</p>
            <p>This is a brief View of Ten of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in this Volume: which are so mixed,
that there is no Degree or Quality of persons
but will find themselves concern'd in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
here treated of. Princes and Monarchs,
Inferiour Rulers and Magistrates, Ecclesia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
persons, and all others, whether publick
or private, Civil or Military, Wealthy or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent,
of the Manly or of the Softer Sex,
have their share in these Papers. As for the
two last Sermons, they had their birth from
the two much prevailing Opinion of those men
who deny, that <hi>there are Mysteries in the
Christian Religion.</hi> I strike only at that
<pb facs="tcp:107741:7"/>
General Doctrine, and wave all Set Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on Particular Persons or their Attempts.
The sum of my Vndertaking here is this, I
give a particular account of the word <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
as it is mention'd and understood in the
<hi>New Testament:</hi> more especially, I settle
the true notion of that Term as it peculiarly
respects the present Case, and hath reference
to <hi>Christianity.</hi> I shew upon what Reasons
and Grounds this doctrine of <hi>Mysteries</hi> is
founded; I represent the notorious Blemishes
of the Contrary Opinion; and lastly, I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse
such proper Inferences as are the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
result of the respective Particulars. Thus,
though others have handled this Subject, I
make it a Peculiar Province by the particular
way of my undertaking and managing it:
which, whether it be done aright, and to the
satisfaction of the Learned and Pious, I
leave to the Reader to judge. But this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I am able to say, and that most sincerely,
that I design'd what I have here written for
the Vindication of the Cause of <hi>Christianity,</hi>
and for the Glory and Honour of its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Author. And this is the Design of all
my Writings, of what Subject soever I have
already treated, or shall hereafter treat.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may think I pour them in too
fast upon the Reader, and don't keep a due
distance (such as they would have) between
<pb facs="tcp:107741:8"/>
one book and another. I am so Vncivil a
Writer, that I will scarcely give the Reader
time to breath. And besides, it is a blemish
to my Reputation, that I hereby give occasion
to some to censure me for being too Forward
a man, and one that affects to appear often in
publick view: and therefore they prudently
advise to observe a Moderation, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rule of Husbandry, to lie Fallow
some time. I thank these Gentlemen for the
care they pretend to have of the Reader and
me: but I must tell them, this good Advice
of theirs belongs to those <hi>Novices,</hi> who want
Materials for a Scrible, though it be but a
four-penny Cut; or those poor starv'd souls
that write for Bread, and clap all their Book,
and sometimes more than is in it, into the
Title Page. Here the Counsel would be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
especially for the Readers Good, to
be Temperate Writers. But if they will be
so Civil as not to rank me in the number of
those fore-mention'd persons, I think I have
enough to plead in behalf of the <hi>Frequency</hi>
of my Writing. I could support my self here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by very Good and Vnexceptionable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
half a douzen of the Best Penmen
we have at this day among us, two of the
Learnedest Prelates of our Church, who fail
not every year to present the Learned with an
Offering; and their Teeming Thoughts are
still designing to oblige the world in the same
<pb facs="tcp:107741:8"/>
manner. But waving <hi>Precedents,</hi> especially
those which are too High for me, I will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
my practise from the Reason and Equity of
the Thing it self. I hold it proper to offer
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Truths to the world <hi>now,</hi> whilst I am
able to <hi>defend</hi> them against the Objections
which some may think fit to make against
them, as I have in some part found it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be done already: and I know not why
Truth may not be as Sharp as Error. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
some things are proper for <hi>this Peculiar
Age;</hi> and if they should be deferr'd, would
prove Vnseasonable. I conceive our Sceptical
Times require some such sort of Writings, as
I have had occasion to publish, more than
any that were before, or perhaps ever will
be. Again, what I do is pursuant to my
<hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Function,</hi> which exact a
Publick Appearance, and an Open doing of
good to mankind. For a <hi>Clergyman</hi> should
give an account of his Time to the World,
as well as to God. Wherefore being not enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
at present in the Employment of the
Pulpit, I think my self obliged in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eak to the world from the Press,
and to let my Pen do the Office of my
Tongue. And truly, why one should be a
Crime, and not the other, is unaccountable.
Or rather, it is not much to be doubted, that
<pb facs="tcp:107741:9"/>
those men whom I have to do with at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
look upon both equally Culpable. Those
that blame my Intemperance in <hi>Writing,</hi>
if I were in a publick Station of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
would find fault with my <hi>Preaching</hi>
too much.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, I desire to regulate my self
and my undertakings by that Rule of the
Royal Preacher, <hi>Eccles. 9. 10. What thy
Hand findeth to do, do it with thy
Might:</hi> The Reason of which follows, <hi>For
there is no work, nor device, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
nor wisdom in the grave whither
thou goest.</hi> This Present World is the place
of Action and Duty, and these are to be
performed according to the particular Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
and Abilities bestow'd upon us by our
Great Benefactor. The Proper Concern and
Business of our Lives, which we design to
discharge, we must dispatch <hi>now,</hi> and that
with our <hi>might</hi> and vigour. Accordingly
I have taken up a Resolution, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Aid, to do what Good I can with my
Pen whilst I can hold it, and make use of
it. And surely this will not, this cannot be
offensive to any Good and Vertuous men:
and to such I desire to give an account of
<pb facs="tcp:107741:9"/>
my Actions, and not to others. Wherefore
I shall not be diverted by the little Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and seemingly prudential exceptions of
the foresaid Objections from a sedulous and
continued applying my self to the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
way of communicating my Thoughts
to the world, which I hope will, through
the Blessing of the <hi>Highest,</hi> prove some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
serviceable towards the advancing of
Truth and Piety in the minds and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of men: though I am sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
how Mean and Vnworthy my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are, and how much inferior to those of
my Reverend Brethren, and other Excellent
Writers of this Age.</p>
            <p>And, because I will be free and open
with the Reader, I will give him his Bill
of Fare for the time to come. I design,
God willing, to entertain him next with a
Large Discourse <hi>concerning the Different
Dispensation of Religion, since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World to the Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things.</hi> It is a Work that I
have been designing for the Publick a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
time, but have not yet had an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to send it abroad, by reason of some
Other Treatises which were call'd for. It is
a Work, if I mistake not, that is exceeding
<pb facs="tcp:107741:10"/>
necessary for the right understanding the Books
of the Holy Scripture, for apprehending the
True Scope and Design of them, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of the Grounds and Reasons of
God's Various Administrations to the World,
and for the fully evincing of his Peculiar
Care of his Church in all Ages. I have
also ventured to make a Modest Enquiry
into the <hi>Future</hi> State and Circumstances of
the Church here on Earth; but I have all
along built my Assertions on the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which the <hi>Sacred Writings</hi> have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
me with; for it is certain, that the
Great and Wonderful things which are yet
to come, and which are more Glorious than
ever yet appear'd on the Stage, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
in the Inspired Volume, though the
Texts which speak of them have through
prejudice and prepossession been unhappily
misinterpreted. This and some other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
as <hi>an Impartial Enquiry after
Truth, and the Right Methods of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it,</hi> &amp;c. I intend as Preliminary to a
<hi>Body of Divinity:</hi> for that is the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
I have been accomplishing some
years, and I have made some Progress in
it. I purpose that the Several Parts, of
which it is composed, shall contain Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Distinct Discourses on all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb facs="tcp:107741:10"/>
of the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> on every one
of the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> on the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eral
Petitions of the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> and
on all the <hi>Vertues, Graces</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of
Christianity, with all the <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi>
of it. I intend a Large <hi>Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
concerning the <hi>Five Points</hi> (as they
are commonly call'd) controverted between
the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> and <hi>Calvinists:</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
concerning all those Opinions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rines
which are debated between the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
and the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Provision</hi> which I have
been making, and which I hope to finish,
unless it shall seem good to the All-wise
Disposer, <hi>in whose hand my times are,</hi>
otherwise to determine concerning it and
me. However, I cannot reasonably expect
the continuance of Health and the Prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my days till I have <hi>entirely pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd</hi>
what I have thus prepared. But so
far as I am able, I am willing to make my
own hands my Executors in part, and not
to imitate those Close-fisted persons, who
whilst they are living distribute nothing of
what God hath given them, but thrust all
their good deeds to the other side of their
<pb facs="tcp:107741:11"/>
Graves. Or, if the Benign Deity should
vouchsafe to add a greater number of
days to my Life, yet <hi>we Know not what
evil shall be upon the earth:</hi> for truly,
when I place before me that Atheism, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
and Prophaneness, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in the Lives of the Worst, and
the strange Indifferency and Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that reign in the Best, I'm enclin'd
to think, that, though there be a Period
at present to the late Hostilities, yet we
are in a very Dangerous condition. Which
is one principal reason of my making that
<hi>Haste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which some, I perceive, censure me
for; it may be partly out of good will
and pity towards me, fearing lest I should
Exhaust my self, and turn Bankrupt in a
short time. But I believe I have said
enough to ease their fears as to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And as for others, whose Censure
proceeds from a worser Principle, I let
them know once for all that I have devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the residue of my Life to the Publick
Defence and Advancement of Christianity,
with all its Weighty Truths and Doctrines,
and all the Holy Duties and Practices
that appertain to it. And I revere and
adore the Divine Bounty that hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
<pb facs="tcp:107741:11"/>
to entrust me with a small Stock,
(such as is suitable to my poor Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
to carry on so laudable a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
I intend it shall not lie dead, but
be employ'd to the <hi>GLORY</hi> of the
<hi>GREAT</hi> Eternal Donour.</p>

What is Truth?</head>

Charles II. at Newmarket.</head>

               <q>Pilate saith unto him, What is Truth?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ONE Signal <hi>Circumstance</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Meritorious Passion, was
That which we daily rehearse in
the <hi>Creed,</hi> That <hi>he Suffered under
Pontius Pilate.</hi> And truly from the Character
which is given this Person, not only by the
Evangelists but Other Writers, he appears to
have been a <hi>Fit Man</hi> for that Execrable work
of Condemning the Lord of Life. For who
was more so than the Covetous and Greedy
<hi>Pilate,</hi> who attempted to Rob the <hi>Temple,</hi> and
Sacrilegiously to Rifle the <hi>Corban</hi> (as <hi>Iosephus</hi>
relateth)? Who could be Fitter than He to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Bribe from the Jews, and even against
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107741:17"/>
his Conscience to deliver up the <hi>Messias</hi> a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim
to their fury and malice? Who than He,
who had inhumanly <hi>mingled the Galileans Blood
with their Sacrifices,</hi> was Fitter to be employ'd
when the Great <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the World was
to be offered, and when <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> (from
whom his followers were called <hi>Galileans)</hi>
was to give his Blood for the Redemption of
Mankind? But though this Man was thus fitly
Disposed and Prepared for his Work, yet the
Bloody Sentence against our Saviour was not
to be pronounced by him without the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
of a Formal Arraignment and Trial.
And accordingly the Innocent <hi>Iesus</hi> was set to
the Bar; and this <hi>Roman</hi> Governour took the
Bench: where (as you will find by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text)
this <hi>Iudg</hi> was full of his <hi>Interrogatories,</hi>
and propounded several, and those not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
<hi>Questions.</hi> But among them all
there was none certainly that was in it self
more Substantial and Useful than this, <hi>What is
Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was as Pertinent as it was Weighty:
for it was justly occasioned by our Lord's <hi>Plea</hi>
and <hi>Protestation</hi> in Court, <hi>viz.</hi> That, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the malicious Jews had Accused him
as an Impostor, yet <hi>to This end he was born, and

Nature, and great numbers of them have been
spoiled through their Philosophy and vain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit:
And likewise among you <hi>Iews,</hi> the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God's Written Law is depraved by the
Corrupt Doctrines of the Superstitious <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi>
and Prophane <hi>Sadducees,</hi> (the former a
sort of <hi>Hebrew Stoicks,</hi> the later a kind of <hi>Iewish
Epicures</hi> and <hi>Atheists:)</hi> and you are divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
several Other Disagreeing Sects and Schools,
and go on daily to corrupt and stifle the True
Notions of Morality and Religion, and even
utterly to take away the Key of <hi>Knowledge</hi>
and <hi>Truth:</hi> Whereas things are Thus, The
Great Design of my Visiting mankind is of a
Contrary nature; namely, to lead them to
Right Apprehensions of things, to baffle all
Error and Delusion, and to direct them most
effectually into the way of <hi>Truth.</hi> And <hi>every
one that is of the Truth heareth my voice,</hi> v. 37.
that is, Those who are Competent Judges and
Sincere Lovers of Truth, will soon descry My
Doctrin to be fraught with the Highest and
most Important Verities; and will imbrace it
as the Greatest Blessing that was ever vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pilate</hi> hearing our Saviour discourse of <hi>Truth,</hi>
puts this Question to him in the Text. It is
<hi>Luther</hi>'s Conjecture that he did it out of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to our Lord; for <hi>Pilate</hi>
(saith he<note n="*" place="margin">Colloqu. Men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did as much as say to him, What? wilt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107741:18"/>
thou dispute concerning</hi> TRUTH <hi>in these Wicked.
Times of the World?</hi> TRUTH <hi>is here of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue:
it is generally despised and rejected. You must
think of some Other way, for This will not do.
Alas, What is</hi> TRUTH <hi>worth? and what are
you like to get by abetting it?</hi> But I rather think
that <hi>Pilate</hi> ask'd This Question in Contempt
and Derision, I pray, Sir, What is the Right
Definition of <hi>Truth?</hi> Do you pretend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Exact Notion of it? I must tell
you This, Friend, Men are as much Mistaken
about This as Any thing in the World; and
I believe <hi>You</hi> are One of that number. You
talk of <hi>Truth,</hi> but do you know <hi>What it is?</hi>
And as soon as he had started this Query he
went off the Bench.</p>
            <p>By which it appears, that his Enquiry was
not Serious; and that he Cared not for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to it. Otherwise, if he had been in Good
Earnest, without doubt our Saviour would
not have failed to return an Answer. For he
was a Person extremely Communicative, and
used to satisfy all Material Questions to the
Full, yea above what was demanded: As
when a Lawyer ask'd him, <hi>What was the First
Commandment,</hi> he told him moreover <hi>what was
the Second, which was like unto it.</hi> So when it
was asked him, <hi>Is it lawful to give Tribute to
Cesar or no?</hi> His Answer was more than Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory;
for he not only acquaints them that
they ought to pay <hi>Cesar</hi> his Tribute; but he
adds also, that <hi>God</hi>'s as well as <hi>Cesar</hi>'s Dues are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107741:18"/>
to be discharged. It is not to be doubted,
that He who was so Ready at all times to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
Mens Demands, would have returned an
Answer to This of <hi>Pilate,</hi> if this Great Man
would have Stayed for it.</p>
            <p>But though <hi>Pilate</hi> went away in Haste, I
hope it will be worth our Time to Stay, and
Satisfy our selves about This Question of so
unspeakable Use and Value; a Question which
is every ways Necessary in order to the Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the Scruples of the <hi>Conscientious,</hi> and
Silencing the Cavils of the <hi>Atheistical</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane;</hi>
a Question whereon the whole Frame
and Constitution of Religion depends; a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of the Greatest Importance next to That,
<hi>What shall we do to be Saved?</hi> Or rather, it is
of the Same rank with it; for (as the Apostle
hath joyned them together) <hi>God would have
all Men to be Saved,</hi> and <hi>come to the Knowledge
of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But an <hi>Other Question</hi> then will arise, How
shall we come to the Knowledg of the Truth?
Are we not on every side beset with Mistakes
and False Notions? Was not Error very Early
in the World; and doth it not bear Date from
<hi>Adam?</hi> I have not Examined whether that
be True which One saith,<note n="*" place="bottom">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>That there is but

wherein there is not an Erroneous Conception.</hi>
But this is certain, that Mistake and Falshood
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107741:19"/>
enter'd into the World <hi>betimes;</hi> and that ever
since a Night of Ignorance hath over-spread
our Minds, and our Judgments are involved
in a Cloud of Obscurity and Imperfection. In
<hi>Cebes</hi>'s <hi>Table,</hi> which represents Man's Life,
<hi>Imposture</hi> gives her Cup to all that come into
the World. <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> are the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and every one Drinks of it: but some
more and some less. Hence it is that Pretences
and Appearances of Reason cozen us; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect

easily determine us. A Petty Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a Weak Likelihood, a Plausible Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,
are enough to Turn the Scales with
us, and Weigh heavier sometimes than a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.
Hence it is that Truth is so
Rare a thing in the World. We may justly

            </p>
            <p>Nay, We are in as bad Circumstances as
before, and <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Demand is as far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Answer'd as it was; for as the Sceptick
doubteth of all <hi>Truth,</hi> yea, indeed, denies it;
so on the other hand we see, that All Parties
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107741:19"/>
of Religion in the World pretend that they
are Masters and Possessors of it. Before there
was <hi>No Truth,</hi> and now <hi>All is Truth.</hi> If you
ask, what it Truth? you shall not want whole
Herds of Men who will come and offer their
Service to you, and with all Officiousness will
tell you, that they are able to Resolve you in
such an Easy Question as That is. <hi>Truth</hi> takes
up its Residence with <hi>Vs,</hi> say the <hi>Paga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipers:</hi>
Our Numerous Deities and their Idols,
have been vouched by Oracles and Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all the ways that are requisite to
make a Religion Authentick. <hi>We</hi> are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of Orthodox Faith, say the <hi>Iews,</hi> and all
the rest of the World are Bewilder'd and Lost,
being destitute of a <hi>Pillar of Light</hi> to lead them.
Alas, they are inveloped in <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkness,
and must continue to be so till they take <hi>Moses</hi>
for their Only Guide to bring them out of it.
But then again, Neither <hi>Gentiles</hi> nor <hi>Iews</hi> are
in the right, say the Followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
who yet was the Son of a <hi>Pagan</hi> Father and a
<hi>Iewish</hi> Mother. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> is the True
Charter of our Religion; and who can suspect
it, since our Prophet received it from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<hi>Gabriel?</hi> We are the True <hi>Musselmen,</hi> i.e.
<hi>Believers,</hi> and all Others are downright Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
and Miscreants. Nay, even among Those
who profess <hi>Christianity</hi> (for out of the Best
and Purest Religion will arise the Worst of
Corruptions and Heresies) the Parties and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
the Disputes and Claims are not a few.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107741:20"/>
Truth is but One, and yet they All think they
Monopolize it. Every Sect is Eager and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
and some of them Confine All Religion
and Salvation to their Own Way. Nay, they
are for Persecuting all Parties but their Own;
like the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes, they must Strangle
all their Brethren, otherwise they think they
cannot Reign safely. Ask the Different Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
even from the Highest to the Lowest,
from the <hi>Old Gentleman</hi> that sits in the <hi>Porphyry
Chair,</hi> to the meanest <hi>Quaker</hi> or <hi>Muggletonian,</hi>
and they will all tell you they are in possession
of the <hi>Truth.</hi> Every Perswasion hath this of
<hi>Popery</hi> in it, that the Professors of it think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Infallible,</hi> and say they have an Unerring
Guide; and therefore they take the Chair, and
Determine Peremptorily on their Own Sides.
Even whilst some cry, This is False, and others
That; if you ask them singly, they all say
they are in the Right; and every one confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
vouches that he is Proprietor of Truth.
It seems by This, that Truth is Equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
among All Men; or rather indeed, that
the Opinion of it is so. And hence it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Indifferency</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
have had their Rise; for too Lavish Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to <hi>Truth</hi> have made some question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be Any. The Divers Claims and
Quarrels in Christianity have wonderfully fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
<hi>Atheism.</hi> For whilst it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that Divinity hath every where become
<hi>Polemical;</hi> and that Men have thrown Bibles
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107741:20"/>
at one anothers Heads, whilst it hath been
cried in their Ears that here is Truth, and
there is Truth, they have grown Perplexed
and Distracted, and know not how to behave
themselves, and What Part to take. They
hear that the Claim to Truth is Universal;
but then they know This, that <hi>All</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to it cannot be True, and How, say
they, if <hi>None</hi> of them should be so? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they renounce Religion as a Faction, and
in plain terms a Cheat, and consequently they
Live and Act in the World as they Please. If
<hi>Truth</hi> be claimed by All the Professors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and those Professors Contradict one
another, Where shall we find an Answer to
This Interrogatory, <hi>What is Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In way of Reply it is enough to say at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
(for I shall answer a great part of these
Cavils afterwards in the sequel of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course)
1. These Several Divisions and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
evidently prove a <hi>True Religion:</hi> For it is
certain, that Rational Men would not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for Nothing. Unless there were some
Reality at the bottom, we cannot imagine
that Persons of unprejudic'd Minds and sincere
Intentions (as we must allow a great Part of
them to be) would thus seriously busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and be so mightily concern'd. 2. Some
Mens fond and groundless <hi>Pretences</hi> ought not
to be equalled with the <hi>Iust Claims</hi> of others.
As long as the World continues in this degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
posture where it is, there will ever be a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107741:21"/>
great number of men who will be pretending to
Truth, even whilst they are maintaining those
Doctrines which are directly opposite to it:
Therefore we are not to concern our selves for
these Pretenders, only so far as to slight them
as Persons govern'd by Interest or Passion, or
to pity them as those who are misled by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or Prejudice. 3. As for the generality
of Disputes which are at this day on foot,
<hi>Religion,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
(I mean the Essentials and Vitals of it,
which give it its denomination) are little, or
not at all concern'd in those Quarrels, as will
appear from what I shall suggest anon; and
therefore I shall say no more here. But (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
what hath been objected) I will
go on with my present design, which is an
Inquest after <hi>Truth:</hi> and I hope the attempt
will not prove vain and succesless.</p>
            <p>That we may certainly find it out, those
Two known, but too much neglected Rules
or Standards are to be made use of by us, <hi>viz.
Reason and Scripture.</hi> By <hi>Reason</hi> I mean the
free and impartial use of our Understandings
and Judgments which God hath naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
us with, and which we are obliged to
improve and cultivate by the aid of our <hi>Bodily
Senses,</hi> by the <hi>Testimony of others,</hi> by serious
and steady <hi>Observation</hi> and well-grounded <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi>
for these must be assisting to <hi>Humane
Reason</hi> to render it perfect and compleat. If
thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we would apply our selves to a serious
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107741:21"/>
search after <hi>Truth,</hi> we should soon make
our selves Masters of it: For <hi>the Candle
of the Lord</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> very significantly
calls the <hi>Reason of Man)</hi> was set up in our
Breasts by God, on purpose to discover <hi>Truth</hi>
to us.</p>
            <p>But it must be acknowledged, that this
<hi>Light</hi> hath been much impair'd by Man's
Degeneracy, so that it can scarcely be said to
<hi>Shine out; i.e.</hi> perfectly to display it self. It
hath been Clouded ever since the First Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy,
and obscured daily by the actual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
of Vice. An undeniable Evidence
whereof were those swarms of monsterous
Opinions among the Pagans, that gross Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
and Idolatry of the Gentile World,
those prodigious Shapes and Models of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which were invented by them. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it happened, that the Creature made and
framed his Creator; they shaped out Deities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the way of Worshipping them according
to their own Fancies and Imaginations; and a
<hi>God</hi> was even what they thought good to make
him. Or, suppose Natures Light did shine
out to the full, yet it would not be Clear and
Bright enough, to give us a Prospect of those
Divine and Supernatural Truths, which are
to bring us to Everlasting Happiness. For
Nature and Reason cannot Dictate those things
which depend wholly on God's Free Grace
and Pleasure: And such are the Doctrine of
a Saviour and Redeemer, the Method of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107741:22"/>
Man's Salvation, and all the Mysteries of the
Christian and Evangelical Dispensation. How
was <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (a Noted Master in <hi>Israel,</hi>
and no mean Possessor of Reason) baffled
with the Doctrin of Regeneration? He might
truly be said <hi>to go to Iesus by Night,</hi> who
made his Visit only by the dusky and obscure
Light of Nature. Therefore, tho' Reason,
or rather the Understanding using its reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faculty, be a laudable Guide in Religion,
yet it will not be a safe Conduct to Truth if
it be alone. There must of necessity be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Guide besides this, to lead us to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Heavenly Verities, and Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Faith. There must be Divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to assist us, to find out Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Truths.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Standard</hi> then of Truth is, the
<hi>Infallible Word of God.</hi> Divine Truths must
be sought for, not from Man, but from God;
not from Human Writings, but an Unerring
Word; not from those who are Finite and
Ignorant, but from Him who is Infinite, and
knoweth all Things; not from the Sons of
Men, but from Him who is the only-begotten
Son of God, the Revealer of his Father's Will:
For [<hi>No man hath seen God at any time: the
only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he hath declared him,</hi>] as the beloved
Disciple beareth witness, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 18. None
is able to discover the Divine and Supernatural
Mysteries which our Religion is fraught with,

but the Founder of them.<note n="*" place="bottom">U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have arrived to those Transcendent Notions,
unless we had been taught them from Heaven.
We were not skilled to appoint the Manner
of Appeasing the incensed Majesty of Heaven,
and to prescribe the Way of Worship suitable
to that Oeconomy. <hi>This</hi> would have been
as if it should be left to some silly Country
Peasant, to assign the Way and Manner of
Treating a Mighty King and Monarch;
Who would not expect in such a case a strange
and uncouth, a rude and ridiculous Way of
Address and Courtship, and below the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Majesty of a Prince? But it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
there should be a particular Divine
Discovery, a clearer Light, a surer Guide
than that of Nature: For though God at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
times, and in divers manners had Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself to the past Generations of Men,
yet to make that Revelation compleat, he
spoke in the last days by his Son, and by the
Testimony of the Holy Ghost in the inspired
Writings of the Apostles and Evangelists.
Christ therefore saith, and that Emphatically,
<hi>I am the Truth, Iohn</hi> 14. 6. The Gospel was
the last and most corrected Edition of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of Truth; and we must never look for
any other to come forth to the End of the
World. This is <hi>Truth</hi> more eminently so

called,<note n="†" place="bottom">

               </note> 
               <hi>The Truth which came by Iesus Christ,</hi>
as the Blessed Evangelist speaketh. This is
the <hi>Christian Truth, Our</hi> singular Glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>We</hi> are distinguished from all those who
profess any other Religions whatsoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi> or the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the Deluded <hi>Saracens</hi> and
<hi>Turks,</hi> or downright <hi>Atheists,</hi> and others of
a like Perverse Perswasion. These all Err,
especially the three first Ranks of Men, by
not knowing or not imbracing the <hi>Scriptures;</hi>
which are deservedly stiled,<note n="*" place="bottom">Col. 1. 5. 2. Tim. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The Word of
Truth,</hi> and are the only supreme Rule of Faith
and Doctrin. We then, who imbrace this
<hi>Christian</hi> Rule, are Blessed with that Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is Pure and Undefiled, which is
grounded on undoubted Revelation, which
is backed by a more sure Word of Prophecy,
which hath a divine Impress stamped upon
it. So that <hi>Our Religion</hi> as far surmounts all
<hi>Others,</hi> as the Gold which hath passed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers
Fire, and hath the Royal Stamp upon
it, outbids the common Ore, and shames its
Dross and meaner Alloy.</p>
            <p>You see then which are the unalterable
<hi>Standards of Truth,</hi> viz. <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the Light of Nature and of Scripture.
And I dare confidently aver, that if our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
and Determinations in Religion were
faithfully managed by these two, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107741:23"/>
to fail of <hi>Truth.</hi> If we would but
act thus as <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> (and that is as
we ought to do) we cannot miss of it: For
it is certainly the Purchase of all those who
make a right Use of their Rational Powers, and
also help and direct those Powers by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the Sacred Spirit in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
By these two we may examine the
<hi>Truth</hi> of the Whole Christian Religion, and
we shall find that it will abide the Test. By
these Standards of Truth we may examine the
Doctrins of all Seducers that are abroad in the
World, and we shall find them to be False
and Adulterate. If we would sincerely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
these Rules, the great Diversity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Sentiments amongst us would soon
be reconciled: If we would faithfully take these
Measures, <hi>i.e.</hi> always be Ruled and Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> we should easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agree upon what is to be believed and assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Religion; and all our Disputes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
would vanish.</p>
            <p>Now, from what hath been hitherto Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed,
we may in some good measure
be able not only to return an Answer to
<hi>Pilates</hi> Question, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> but to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
near a kin to it, <hi>viz. What is Error and
Falshood?</hi> All Propositions which contradict
the common Notices and first Principles in
our Minds, and which affront right Reason
and the plain Deductions made from it, are
to be looked upon as False: And on the same
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107741:24"/>
account those Assertions which overthrow the
Verdict of our Senses; and much more those
that imply Contradictions in them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
Impossibilities, cannot be True.
And on <hi>These</hi> Grounds I might shew that the
Divinity of some High-flown <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> and
the Doctrin of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Transubstantiation, are justly to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
of Falshood.</p>
            <p>Again, whatsoever Assertions in any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
are repugnant to Divine Revelation, to
God's Will declared by some Positive Law,
to such Discoveries as are known to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from Heaven, these must necessarily
be <hi>False.</hi> And on this Ground the Religion of
the <hi>Pagans, Iews,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> must be
voted to be such, because they oppose an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Revelation, and <hi>That</hi> confirmed by
unparallelled Miracles. And semblably in
<hi>Christianity,</hi> all those Tenents of several <hi>Sects,</hi>
which bid defiance to any part of the Sacred
Scripture, which is left us by the Holy Ghost,
as the generality of the <hi>Roman</hi> Opinions, the
Doctrins of <hi>Pelagians, Socinians, Anabaptists,
Antinomians, Libertines, Quakers, Hobbians,
&amp;c.</hi> are False and Erroneous.</p>
            <p>Thus far then, by vertue of the Premises,
we have advanced, that when there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Claims and Pretences to <hi>Truth,</hi> and it is
enquired, What Judge shall decide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy,
the Answer must be, That <hi>Right
Reason</hi> and <hi>Inspired Scripture</hi> are the only
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107741:24"/>
Judges, they being the fixed Standards and
Measures of Truth.</p>
            <p>But then here will lie the main Difficulty
of all, that in the Questions and Debates of
Religion, Scripture is quoted with equal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
and Confidence on all Sides; as if what
the <hi>Iewish Rabbies</hi> say of Scripture, That <hi>it
hath Seventy-two Faces,</hi> were the received Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Christians. Nay, some of these seem
to acknowledge, by their strange way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
it, That it hath not only different,
but contrary Aspects. When therefore there
are Disputes about Scripture-Interpretation,
What must we do? How can we discern
what is <hi>Truth</hi> by Consulting of <hi>Scripture,</hi> when
as that is Dubious and Uncertain? If contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sects and Parties quote it, and plead it, how
can it be a fixed Standard of <hi>Truth?</hi> How is
it an unerring Guide?</p>
            <p>It might suffice to say in General, That it
is no wonder that all Opinionists, even the
Wildest of them, make use of Scripture; yea,
a great Part of the <hi>Turks Alcoran</hi> is express
Words of the <hi>Bible.</hi> It is no wonder, I say,
since Scripture was quoted by <hi>Satan</hi> himself,
who, when he Tempted our Saviour, misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
it to the vilest Purpose. But particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
to satisfie this Great and Affrighting
Difficulty, we may inform our selves that in
Religion there are Five Sorts of Enquiries
and Doctrines. Now, I will briefly shew
how <hi>Scripture</hi> is to be made use of, and when
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107741:25"/>
it is fit to Apply it to any of these Particulars.</p>
            <p>I. Some Points of our Religion are <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Mystical and Profound;</hi> and the Sacred
Writings having not Explained them, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expected that we should ever do it.
Such Difficult and Sublime Doctrines as the
Mystery of the Sacred Trinity <hi>(i.e.</hi> a Trinity
of Divine Persons in the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head)
the Union of the Divine and Humane
Nature in One Person, the Manner of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and the like, are not to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known by us as long as we sojourn on Earth.</p>
            <p>These are like the Book in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 5. 3, 6.</note>
               <hi>which none is able to open
in Heaven or in Earth, but the Lamb.</hi> And
seeing he is not pleased to Unfold them to us,
we must Admire and Adore them, but not
be sollicitous to Comprehend them. We are
to remember this, that some Things must be
believed on the mere Authority of the Speaker,
and it argues Infidelity to question the Truth
of them, or so much as to be Inquisitive about
them. The Things are spoken by God,
therefore we ought to give Credit to them:
The Manner and Circumstances of them are
not discovered, therefore I'm obliged not to
pry into them. This was the Sense and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Primitive Christians, as we may
learn from <hi>Origen,</hi> who tells us, That the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
some Articles of Faith on the bare Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scriptures, was objected to the
Christians by the Heathens: Their Complaint
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107741:25"/>
against them was, <hi>That they would neither give
nor receive a Reason of their Faith, but were
wont to cry out,</hi>

               <hi>I think it Boldness to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

things with equal Evidence; and why then

Those Words which I meet with in one of

worth the Observation of those, especially,
who are Students of Divinity.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Nihil aliud ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

into those things which God would not have

our selves with Trifles, we quit the Fountain
Truth, and run after the fruitless Streams of meer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107741:26"/>
Opinion and Fancy.</hi> Let us fix this on our
Minds, That there are some unsearchable My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
and it was designed by the All-Wise
God that we should not be acquainted with
them. We may say here, as<note n="*" place="margin">Nat. Qu.</note> 
               <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
concerning the Nature of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
God only, whose sole Prerogative is to have
a perfect Knowledge of Truth, knows these things
to be true,</hi> and the very manner of them, tho'
it be hid from us. When we peremptorily
say this or that concerning these <hi>obscure</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
we <hi>may Err,</hi> and we cannot tell when
<hi>we do;</hi> but when we determine nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
(above what is determined in Scripture)
we are sure we <hi>do not Err;</hi> and we are sure
of this too, that we are not guilty of Distort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Misinterpreting the Word of God;
which is a Fault very frequent in these Cases.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Particular, Let not weak
Christians be troubled that there are several
Passages in the Bible which they cannot clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand. I assure them, that they may
be Ignorant of the <hi>full meaning</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of
them, and yet their Salvation is not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
thereby. And as to our Deportment
towards others, with respect to these Points,
seeing we cannot perfectly explain them, why
should we be Angry at those who embrace a
different Perswasion concerning the manner of
these things?</p>
            <p>II. Many things in Religion are made dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
merely by Disputes and Quarrels; and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107741:26"/>
if the Holy Scriptures were Plainer than they
are, yea never so Plain, yet Wrangling Heads
would fall a Disputing, and make way for
Error by that means. And here it is their
way commonly to make use of one or two
places of Scripture, and to oppose them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a whole heap of other Texts. The old
Hereticks (those <hi>Interfectores V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

calls them, those Murtherers and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sasines

               <hi>To explain
obscure Places of Scripture, let us use the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of those that are plainer; and by the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and Clearness of some, let the Doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of others be taken away.</hi> This may be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to us when we read the Scriptures,
and when we would be satisfied about some
Controversies which arise thence. But alas,
this Holy Book is Ruffled and Intangled by
wilful Mistakes and Disputes, wherein it is
common to Wrest the Words, and to Oppose
one part of them to another, instead of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justing
the whole Matter by a fair Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107741:27"/>
To Instance, Nothing is Plainer in
the Book of God than this, That he hath fully
Decreed and Predetermined whatever shall
come to pass; and Nothing is more Plain in
the said Holy Volume than this, That Man
is a free Agent, and is not Constrained and
Compelled, but what he willeth he willeth
freely. All sober Persons agree in these, and
therefore this ought to be a Ground of mutual
Concord and Reconciliation. But instead of
this, some raise Disputes still, and whereas
we are agreed that both these are True and
Consistent, <hi>viz. God's Decree,</hi> and <hi>Man's Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
they will ask, <hi>How this can be?</hi> And if
you do not satisfy them as to this (which it is
utterly Impossible perhaps to do) they will
shew themselves very much displeas'd. Which
argues that they are of a quarrelsom Temper,
and delight in Wrangling, and make use of
Scripture for that purpose in the most serious
and weighty Doctrines.</p>
            <p>III. It happens by the Luxuriancy of busy
Brains, that many Enquiries in Religion are
<hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Subtle, Over-curious</hi> and <hi>Trifling;</hi>
and as for these, they are below the Verdict
of <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> It began to be a matter of
Wit to be a Christian (as<note n="*" place="margin">Eras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

observes) about the days of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine
the Great:</hi> So soon had they learned
to be Quaint in their Divinity, and that about
the highest Points of it. And other subtile
Heads since that time (such were most of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107741:28"/>
the <hi>Schoolmen)</hi> have troubled the World
with their Fruitless Speculations, their Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
and Unlearned Questions, their Fond and
Sapless Notions. And these, and others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them, are called <hi>Truths</hi> by some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
but indeed, they are not worthy of that
great Name. A Man may be Ignorant of a
thousand of them, and yet not Impair his
Knowledge. To make use of Holy Scripture
here, is to be serious in the midst of Trifles,
and (which is worse) to Prophane that Holy
Book. The same Judgment may be made of
many (not to say most) of the Questions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and handled by the <hi>Roman Casuists,</hi>
which are of no moment or use at all, nay
they are very hurtful and pernicious, because
they distract Mens Minds, instead of directing
them; and yet they are very warmly contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
as if they were the most serious and
important Truths.</p>
            <p>IV. There are some Propositions in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which are <hi>Disputable</hi> and <hi>Probable on
both Sides:</hi> And in these doubtful Cases to hear
Persons of different Judgments cite the same
Passages of Holy Writ, should not give Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to any. Because that Trumpet <hi>gives
an uncertain Sound,</hi> I see no reason why the
Parties should <hi>prepare themselves for Battle,</hi> and
Dispute with so much Fierceness and Rage,
as generally they do. I cannot sufficiently
Admire and Commend the excellent Candor
and Moderation of the first Pious Reformers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107741:28"/>
of Our Church, who in such Articles as are
Dubious and Disputable have not shewed
themselves Stiff and Peremptory, Rigid and
Magisterial, have not wound up the Strings
too high, lest they should marr the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Peace of the Church. But where the
Arguments are deemed to be Equal on both
Sides, they have allowed us an ingenuous Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and permit us to make use of our own
Judgments; and yet at the same time severely
and indispensably urge upon us all Articles that
are of the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and which are certainly
known to be True. And this brings me to
the</p>
            <p>Fifth and Last Rank of Principles in our
Holy Religion; and they are <hi>Fundamental</hi> and
<hi>Necessary,</hi> and of the very Essence of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity:
Of which sort are the Doctrines of
Man's Corruption and Degeneracy, of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
made by Christ the Redeemer, of
Forgiveness and Justification by his Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
with all those substantial Articles of Faith
comprised in the <hi>Creed,</hi> which goes under the
Name of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> These are the <hi>Christian
Verities,</hi> and these are clear and manifest in
God's Word, and have plain Evidence of
Scripture, and are agreed upon by all Sober
and Considerate Persons who have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the Christian Profession. Here it is
that we have the greatest Use and Guidance of
<hi>Scripture;</hi> and for that plain Direction which
it gives us in these, we are to Prize and Value
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107741:29"/>
it as the Richest Treasure, nay; as the Only
Treasure in the World: For from this Inspired
Book alone we have these Heavenly and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Doctrines; they were originally in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Writings in the World but these. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us look upon these grand Truths as the
main and necessary Contents of the Bible, and
as the Matters which we are indispensably
concerned in. As for those Texts which are
Obscure and Difficult, or which relate not to
Faith or Manners, and consequently are not
necessary to be known, let us not be displeased
that we cannot reach the meaning of them.
Let it not seem strange that Interpreters vary
here, and cannot agree about the Sense of these
Places. St. <hi>Ierom</hi> upon the Place saith thus,
St. <hi>Augustin</hi> otherwise, and St. <hi>Chrisostom</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
from both; and it may be a fourth differs
from these; and a fifth comes and diffents from
them all. This doth not offend me in the least,
for where the Scripture speaks of things that
are Abstruse, or speaks in an obscure and dark
manner, it is not strange that we have not a
clear and plain discovery of those Passages, and
consequently that those Writers who have
treated of them differ in their Expositions. Let
not this trouble us, for it was God's Will there
should be these Difficulties in Scripture, and
he hath not made it necessary for us to have
the certain sense and meaning of these Places.
But this should satisfy us, that whatever is
necessary to Salvation is plainly revealed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107741:29"/>
and written in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and that the Knowledge of this alone is
absolutely necessary.</p>
            <p>This then is that which I say, that if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Men would read the Bible, to learn
thence these undoubted Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
Duty, and not to furnish themselves
with Matter of Dispute, they would be the
happiest People under Heaven, and be no
longer Scandalous to the greater (which is the
Unbelieving) Part of the World, by their
Dissentions and Disagreements. O when will
that Blessed Day come when Rectified and
Unbiassed <hi>Reason,</hi> and the plain Arbitrement
of <hi>Scripture</hi> shall decide the Controversies in
Christendom! If these were once admitted as
Impartial Umpires, they would make short
Work of all the Quarrels about Religion,
namely, by pronouncing <hi>Many</hi> of them to be
vain Janglings, and <hi>Most</hi> of them Unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and Absurd; by assuring the Christian
World, That if they would lay aside <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi>
and <hi>Interest,</hi> and <hi>Vile-Affections,</hi> nothing
would appear so Clear and Evident and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable
as the Fundamental Doctrines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-named;
and that all who name the Name
of Christ are obliged to Embrace and Profess
these necessary and unquestionable Maxims,
and that they ought to be Wary and Modest
in their Determinations concerning other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
which are uncertain; and that in
Matters which are <hi>Indifferent</hi> and <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:107741:30"/>
it is Reasonable that they should either
conform themselves to the Practice of the
Church they live in, or mutually agree to bear
with one another.</p>
            <p>Where then is there any place left for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Disputes, and Unchristian Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities?
No where certainly, but where meer
Wilfulness and Perversness reign. For are not
the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Standards</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> Easy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible?
Have we not the Eternal Laws of
Reason, the immediate Directions of Nature,
and the Convictions of our own Minds; and
moreover have we not the Infallible Oracles
and Inspired Writings to rectify our Mistakes?
Have we not Heavenly and Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to Exalt our Natural Notions? Hath
not the Divine Goodness blessed us with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Discoveries, both from the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and the Positive Laws of Christ Jesus,
but more especially from the <hi>Latter,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Body of Divine Laws, that Authentick
Volume of Religion, that Inestimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
of true Wisdom and Knowlege? So that
if we will sincerely make use of these Helps
which God hath given us, we shall have no
occasion to renew this Demand, <hi>What is
Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to the <hi>God</hi> of Truth, and Father of
Lights; and to his Son Christ <hi>Iesus,</hi> who is
the Way and the Truth; and to the Holy
<hi>Spirit</hi> of Truth and Grace be ascribed everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for <hi>of them</hi> it speaks, and <hi>for them</hi>
it was Penn'd, that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
their <hi>Duty,</hi> and not be ignorant of
their <hi>Dignity;</hi> that they might know how to
discharge their Office (which is briefly sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
up in the third and fourth Verses) and
that they might be assured likewise that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107741:31"/>
Heaven it self hath vouched their Function,

might be Ascertained that those of their Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Rank and Quality are under the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Influence of Providence, that they are
God's Charge, and that they are themselves
<hi>Gods. [I have said, Ye are Gods.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Words, and the following ones
which I have read to you, we may take notice
of these Two General Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Concession,</hi>
and a <hi>Correction. 1st.</hi> An honourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Magistrates Eminency and high
Degree, <hi>[I have said, Ye are Gods: and all of
you are the Children of the most High.] 2dly.</hi>
Here is adjoined a Correction, or a severe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
for the Abuse of their Place and
Dignity, <hi>[But ye shall die like Men, and fall
like one of the Princes.]</hi> Or, if you will thus:
Here is the Dignity of the Magistrates Office,
<hi>[I have said, Ye are Gods:]</hi> And here is the
Infirmity of their Persons, <hi>[Ye shall die like
Men.]</hi> In the former of these you may observe,

<hi>I have said, Ye are Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the First, <hi>viz.</hi> The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
<hi>Eminency;</hi> they are <hi>Gods.</hi> Rulers and
Governors, Publick Ministers and Dispensers
of Law and Justice among the People are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
<hi>called Gods. Great</hi> and <hi>Excellent
Things</hi> have the <hi>Name of God</hi> added to them
in the Stile of Holy Scripture (of which there
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107741:31"/>
are abundant Instances): And here the <hi>Name
of God</hi> is not only Adjoined but Attributed to
<hi>these Great and Excellent Persons.</hi> Not only
Kings and Supreme Rulers, but Subordinate
Magistrates are <hi>Gods,</hi> for in the very front of
this Psalm, wherein my Text is, it is said,
That <hi>[God standeth in the Congregation of the
Mighty, he Iudgeth among the Gods] i.e.</hi> the
<hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Magistrates</hi> who sat in the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sanhedrim. The <hi>Gods</hi> then
<hi>here</hi> are not the <hi>Sovereign Powers;</hi> so that the
Title is competible <hi>both</hi> to these and to Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Magistrates. And accordingly my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
at present will have reference both to
the <hi>King</hi> as Supreme, and unto <hi>Governours</hi> as
unto them who are sent and appointed by
Him. Some Passages will more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Crowned Heads, but yet in a due
proportion may be applied unto <hi>you,</hi> and by
<hi>you</hi> who have the Honour to be the King's
Immediate Vicegerents. And because you
bear that High and Noble Character, let it
not be thought strange if I seem sometimes
to treat you in the <hi>Stile of Majesty.</hi> I shall not
endeavour to gain your Attention by <hi>Flattery,</hi>
but seeing the Relation you bear to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Power, and the worthy Office you hold
under it entitle you to the Name of <hi>Gods,</hi> I
think it will be Impossible (and consequently
a vain attempt) to fix a more Honourable
Title upon you, and therefore I shall make it
my Business to descant upon <hi>That.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:107741:32"/>You cannot but observe that in the Sacred
Writ this Epithet is frequently fastned on
Magistrates and Governors. <hi>Moses</hi> was to be
to <hi>Aaron instead of a God (Exod. 4. 16.)</hi> that
is, a <hi>Iudge</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> say the <hi>Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase,</hi>
and <hi>Arabick Version:</hi> Though I rather
think there is another meaning of those words,
<hi>viz.</hi> That he was to be an Interpreter from
God to <hi>Aaron,</hi> as he is said to be <hi>a God to
Pharoah, Exod.</hi> 7. 1. and therefore I will not
insist upon that Place. The <hi>22d.</hi> of <hi>Exod.
ver. 28.</hi> is clear and without Dispute, <hi>[Thou
shalt not revile the Gods, nor curse the Rulers of
thy People.]</hi> One is Exegetical of the other.
A <hi>Ruler</hi> and a <hi>God</hi> are Synonymous Terms,
and signify the same Person. In <hi>Iotham</hi>'s
<hi>Parable</hi> it is said, That <hi>Wine cheareth God and
Man, Iudg. 9. 13.</hi> which words, though the
worthy Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> would have understood
of Appeasing God by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> wherein <hi>Wine</hi>
was commonly used; and some Interpret
them in <hi>another way,</hi> yet <hi>this</hi> seems to me to
be the plainest and most obvious Sense of the
Words, <hi>viz.</hi> That the moderate and lawful
Use of Wine is serviceable to the refreshing
and chearing of the Hearts of both High and
Low, Kings and their Subjects, Magistrates
and others that are of an Inferior Quality,
briefly expressed here by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> You
may gather from <hi>Psalm</hi> cxxxviii. that it was
no unusual thing to denote the Office of Kings
and Rulers by the Title of <hi>Gods;</hi> for in <hi>ver.</hi> 1.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107741:32"/>
the Psalmist thus speaks, <hi>[Before the Gods will
I sing Praise unto Thee;]</hi> and after he had stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Them</hi> up to join in the same Chorus with
himself, he adds, <hi>ver. 4. [All the Kings of the
Earth shall praise Thee.]</hi> The <hi>Gods</hi> and the
<hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth are the same. If you pass
to the <hi>New Testament</hi> you will read in <hi>2 Thes.
2. 4.</hi> That <hi>the Man of Sin exalteth himself above
all that is called God, i.e.</hi> (it is very probable)
Magistrates and Civil Powers: he pretends
he hath a power of disposing of Kingdoms and
Empires, and of Reigning over the Kings of
the Earth. And this way of Speaking is usual
with <hi>Prophane Nations,</hi> as well as <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Christians.</hi> I could shew you, if I had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that the Gentile World signified their
Apprehensions concerning <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
very conformably to the Stile and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Holy Scripture; they represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Governors</hi> as <hi>Gods:</hi> Both their Orators and
Poets mention them as <hi>Divine</hi> Persons, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reach of <hi>Humanity.</hi> Yea, it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that when the<note n="*" place="margin">Hor. Hieroglyph.</note> 
               <hi>Egyptians</hi>
Pourtrayed their <hi>Gods</hi> and

with Wreaths of <hi>Serpents,</hi> which, according to
their Hieroglyphicks, were Symbols of <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
as well as <hi>Sovereignty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains now that I shew you in <hi>what
Sense</hi> the Civil Powers are called <hi>Gods,</hi> and
why even the Sacred Writ honours them with
That Title. It is Blasphemy to assert that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107741:33"/>
they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, really Gods by nature, <hi>i.e.</hi>
Omnipotent and Independent Beings; for so
there is no other God but One, who is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>The God of Gods,</hi> to distinguish Him
from All Nominal Gods, and particularly
<hi>Magistrates,</hi> who are <hi>called so</hi> for these Three
Reasons chiefly, <hi>viz.</hi> because, <hi>First,</hi> They
are Gods by <hi>Deputation;</hi> they are God's Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents
and Delegates; they are His imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Ministers and Deputies; they are in the
Place of the King of Kings; they Personate
and Represent Him here on Earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may justly bear His Name. This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what King <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> gave in
Charge to his Judges, in <hi>2 Chron. xix. 6. [Ye
judge not for Man, but for the Lord;] i.e.</hi> Ye
do not so much Appear and Act <hi>in the Place
of Man,</hi> as in <hi>God's Stead;</hi> you do not Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the King so much as the Great God of
Heaven. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are Gods by a kind
of <hi>Participation:</hi> They Share in some sort
with the Almighty. <hi>Divisum Imperium cum
Iove Caesar habet:</hi> God hath devolved His
Power on them, and hath made them as it
were <hi>Derivative Deities,</hi> by that Impress of
Authority and Greatness which he hath stampt
upon them, and by appointing them His
Viceroys and Vicars here on Earth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
Magistrates are Gods by way of <hi>Analogy</hi> and
<hi>Resemblance. Every Man,</hi> as he is <hi>Man,</hi> is the
<hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Glory of God</hi> (if the Determination
of the Great Apostle be valid) <hi>Much more</hi> is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107741:33"/>
the <hi>Ruler</hi> the Image and Glorious Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Deity; and that,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> (More Generally) because of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
and Eminence above Others. A
Great King and Monarch may be said on <hi>This
Account</hi> to make <hi>some Approaches</hi> to the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Being of the World.</hi> His Acting in so
Large and Capacious a Sphere, is some mean
Resemblance of the Divine Dominion. The
<hi>vast Influence</hi> which Rulers have over the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the <hi>Great Circumference</hi> they describe,
may entitle them to a kind of Deity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> More <hi>Particularly,</hi> The God of
Heaven, and Those whom he hath appointed
to Rule on Earth, <hi>Resemble one another in their
Actions and Imployments, viz.</hi> in Ruling and
Governing All for the Good of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
in making and appointing Laws to That
End, in distributing of Punishments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and in executing of Justice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the World. Therefore, saith<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <q>A
Ruler <hi>(saith he)</hi> is the Image of God, who
Governs all things. A Magistrate needs no
<hi>Statuary</hi> to make an Image of God, for by
no other Workmanship and Art than that
of <hi>Vertue and Goodness</hi> he can make <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Such,</hi> a Piece of so much Worth and

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Doctrin Thus Illustrated</hi> may be <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi>
both to <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>People. First,</hi> To
the <hi>People,</hi> who by Vertue of what hath been
said, are obliged to Consider and Weigh well
the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the Persons who are Set over
them, and to <hi>Behave themselves Accordingly,
i.e.</hi> willingly to Acknowledge their Authority
and Superiority, to Respect and Reverence
them, to pay them that Civil Worship which
is due to them, and chearfully to Obey their
Lawful Commands. Governours are <hi>Gods,</hi>
therefore to Speak Evil of them is a kind of
<hi>Blasphemy.</hi> They are the <hi>Images</hi> of God, and
so he that Disrespects and Despises them, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buseth
<hi>God in Effigie.</hi> To do Violence to
Them, is to Assault the Deity, to Combate
against Heaven, and Fight against God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Here then is a Solid Basis for Obedience,

God hath Deputed Magistrates, and made
them his Representatives, and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Authority and Power to them, and
by being <hi>Good</hi> they do more signally Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Him: Whence it is Rational to Infer,
That the wilful Contempt of <hi>Human Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
is Affronting of <hi>God,</hi> and despising even
the <hi>Majesty of Heaven.</hi> It is the <hi>Peoples Duty</hi>
then to Study and Practise <hi>Obedience,</hi> and
more especially to Thank God for <hi>Good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi>
who are sent from Heaven, and are the
peculiar Gift of God. Magistracy deserves a
<hi>Double Veneration,</hi> when it is in Conjunction
with <hi>Holiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Magistrate</hi> no less than the
People, is concerned in This Text, and in
This Discourse. He may see here at once his
<hi>Eminency</hi> and his <hi>Duty,</hi> what God hath <hi>made
him,</hi> and what <hi>He expects</hi> of him. Let the
Masters of <hi>Heraldry</hi> range all their Titles of
Honour, it is certain there cannot be a <hi>greater</hi>
and <hi>more Honourable</hi> one than <hi>This</hi> of <hi>Gods.</hi>
But as it carries <hi>Honour</hi> with it, so it bespeaks
a <hi>Behaviour</hi> becoming That Honour. If any
Magistrate should be so Vain as to Rely on
the <hi>Title of God,</hi> and Vaunt of <hi>That,</hi> and yet
in the mean time Neglect his Duty, he may
remember that <hi>Heathen Idols</hi> are called <hi>Gods,
Psal. xcvi. 5.</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> is called the <hi>God of this
World, 2 Cor.</hi> iv. 4. Rulers must <hi>Deport</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
like <hi>Gods,</hi> else they fondly lay Claim to
that Name; They must remember that the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107741:37"/>
               <hi>Name they bear</hi> puts them in mind <hi>whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties</hi>
they are. It is a high Compliment
which <hi>Pliny</hi> passes upon <hi>Trajan</hi> in the Close of
his <hi>Panegyrick, viz.</hi> That <hi>nothing Greater or
Better could be wished to the Commonwealth, than
that the Gods would Imitate the Emperour.</hi> It
is a Truth, without any strain of Rhetorick,
that no greater Felicity can be wished to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Commonwealths, than that the
<hi>Gods,</hi> so stiled in my Text, would endeavour
to Imitate the <hi>King of Kings.</hi> It will be a
Shame and a great Solecism, if Those who are
<hi>in God's Stead</hi> discover Nothing of God or
Divinity in their Lives and Actions; if Those
who bear the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> partake not of the
<hi>God-like Nature,</hi> but rather of that which is
Diabolick. Remember that as you are <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by God,</hi> so you must <hi>Resemble Him.</hi> You
are the <hi>Children</hi> of the most High, you are his
<hi>Off-spring</hi> more Signally; be mindful of your
Heavenly Extraction, and commit nothing
Unworthy of it. You that are Governours
must use your Power for God; for it is reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that He who is the Original of your Power
should also be the End of it. Think not that
the Title given you here is an <hi>Idle and Empty
Thing.</hi> The <hi>Gods</hi> which the Psalmist speaks
of must not be like the <hi>Heathen Gods and Idols,</hi>
who (as he saith) <hi>Have eyes, but see not: ears,
but hear not: hands, but handle not.</hi> We have
too many of such Gods as These in This Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How many Magistrates sit with their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107741:38"/>
Arms across, and Study to do Nothing? How
many <hi>Gallio's</hi> are there of this Age which <hi>Care
for none of those Things</hi> which are the <hi>Proper</hi>
Work of their Place? The Hebrew
<note n="*" place="margin">Netzib.</note> word which signifies a <hi>Statue,</hi> and a
<hi>Tomb,</hi> signifies also a <hi>President,</hi> a <hi>Governour.</hi>
How many are there that bear this <hi>Latter Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,</hi>
who are too near of Kin to the <hi>Former?</hi>
Though they are appointed to be Publick Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencers
of Justice, yet they are not Sollicitous
to Discharge that Office, but rather give the
Neighbourhood to understand that they are
meer Senseless Statues, and Empty Sepulchres.
But certainly it is very unbecoming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
Magistrate, to be Idle and Unactive in
his Place, to be Careless and Unconcerned,
and sleep away his time, as if the People of his
Province were as Inconsiderable as the <hi>Frogs,</hi>
over whom (as the Fable tells us) <hi>Iupiter</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a <hi>Log</hi> to be their King and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
To be dull and heavy in an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that calls for Activity is Inexcusable, and
very Reproachful. <hi>Bibulus,</hi> who was <hi>I. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Fellow-Consul, but did nothing in his
Office, was left out in the <hi>Roman</hi> Dates, which
otherwise always made mention of <hi>both the
Consuls.</hi> An Idle and Useless Magistrate ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
himself Ridiculous and Contemptible;
he is of no Value, and therefore is reckoned
as a meer <hi>Cypher</hi> in the Publick Accounts.
Matters of great moment call for his Care and
Inspection; how then can he be Unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107741:38"/>
and Unactive? His Affairs are Great and
Weighty, and he hath no leisure to Trifle,
after the rate of that Loitering Emperor who
spent his time in Catching and Killing of Flies.
He is made for the Safety and Welfare of the
People, and therefore it is not enough that he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>its quiet, and doth no harm; but it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he do Good. Seeing Rulers are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
to <hi>Divinity,</hi> they must be Vigorous and
moving; they are to Live and Act as <hi>Gods,</hi>
they are engaged to shew forth the God-like
Vertues which are supposed to be in them.
They must Resemble the Deity in Holiness
and Purity; unless they would approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be such <hi>Gods</hi> as <hi>Homer</hi> and other Poets
are wont to make, that is, Drunken, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous,
Contentious, and Debauched Gods:
Which indeed is no more than could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from that sort of Writers; for it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that they who advanced Men and Mortal
Creatures to the Quality of Gods, thrust down
these Latter to the Condition of the Worst Sort
of the Former. But these Things become not
those Persons who are stiled <hi>Gods</hi> in the Holy
Scripture, and are to Represent the God of
all Purity. They should be reminded of this,
That they are to Walk worthy of a Name
that is so Sacred, of a Title that is so Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
And so much for the First Remark on
the Words, <hi>viz.</hi> The Dignity and Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Magistrates Calling, <hi>Ye are Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proceed we in the next Place to the <hi>

               </hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:107741:39"/>
of this Eminency, to the Fountain of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Dignity, <hi>I have said,</hi> viz. <hi>That ye are
Gods.</hi> Had they been called so by Men, it
might have been construed as Flattery: As
we read that it was the Proud and Insolent
Humour of Great Ones, not only to give
this Title to themseves, but to be Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to have it Attributed to them by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and to be told by their Parasites, as our
First Parents by the Serpent, That <hi>they shall
be as Gods.</hi> But here Magistrates are called
<hi>Gods</hi> by God Himself. Behold then the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institution, the Sacred Appointment of
Magistracy! The Tenure they hold by is the
Highest and Best, <hi>viz. in Chief,</hi> from the
King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Earthly
Governours are Invested with their Authority
from the God of Heaven. <hi>I, even I have said, Ye
are Gods. First, Nature</hi> saith it, whereof God
is the Author: <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Sacred Writ</hi> saith
as much, whereof God the Holy Ghost is the
Inditer: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Strange Events</hi> and <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences</hi>
in the World, whereof God is the
Cause and Procurer, say, and proclaim aloud
that Magistrates and Governours are God's
Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Nature</hi> saith it, whereof God is the
Author and Founder, Magistracy bears an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Date, and had the same Horoscope with
the Creation. It began <hi>Primo Adami,</hi> it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
on the Calends of the World. The
Light of Nature, with which we were born,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107741:39"/>
dictates Superiority and Inferiority: And it
may be observed, that the Man who is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
against this Sentiment, at the same
time acknowledges the Truth of it; for he
Claims a Preeminence to Brutes, and a Power
over them, and this Right was Founded in
the Primitive Laws of his Creation. He hath
likewise Power and Sovereignty over himself,
and that Part of him which is Brutish, his
Lower Faculties and Sensual Appetites. And
this Empire is wholly Managed by the Laws
of Reason and Rectified Understanding. It
is confessed by all Mankind, that there is yet
a farther Dominion; for they have and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a Power over one another, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
over their Servants, and Fathers over
their Children: For all Children, as soon as
they are Born, are under a Paternal Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
so that to be Subject is as Natural as to be
a Man. And now, since the World is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
the same Law of Reason and Nature
dictates Subjection and Obedience to the Civil
Parent, the Father of our Country, and to all
those that are Deputed by him. For the
Power of a King over his People, and so of
Lower Magistrates over their peculiar Charge,
is every way as Rational and Accountable as
the foresaid Authority of Fathers over their
Children. Whilst the World was yet in its
Minority, it had these Guardians and Tutors;
and even to this Day, when it is above Five
Thousand Years old, it stands still in need of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107741:40"/>
them. For certainly the very Necessities of
Mankind are sufficient to vouch the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Magistracy. We came into the World
under a State of Government, and we cannot
subsist without it. Our Natural Condition
and Frame require such a Dispensation as this.
To this there is the United Suffrage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all Nations, which shews it to be a
<hi>Law of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might add that God hath Condescended
to the Weakness, and Complied with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of our Nature, in appointing such
Vicegerents as are of a resembling Temper
with us, <hi>Men of like Passions with our selves.</hi>
The <hi>Gods are come down to us,</hi> but <hi>in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Men.</hi> The Lustre of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
would have dazzled and confounded
our weak Sight: That Glorious Sun could
have no sooner been seen, but we should
have been blinded. But when we cannot
bear that Sun it self, we may behold its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivative
Beauty in God's Deputies, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.
In their Purple and Bright Robes
we may safely view the Reflections of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Majesty and Brightness: And thus by
a Necessary Constitution of Heaven, fitted to
our Natures, and by the Suggestions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Instinct and Right Reason, we are
brought to acknowledge the <hi>Reasonableness and
Necessity</hi> of a Government in the World. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we find the Beginning and Rise of
it referred to <hi>This</hi> very Principle by the Great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107741:40"/>
Masters of the <hi>Imperial Laws,</hi> in their Books
of<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 1. Tit. 2. viz. De Origine Juris Civi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is &amp; omnium Magistratuum.</note> 
               <hi>Digests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are we to Imagine (as some have fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done) That <hi>Grace</hi> banishes <hi>Nature,</hi> that
Reason and the Conduct of it are not Obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
under the Gospel. This is a groundless Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
because 'tis certain, that he who swerves,
from the Dictates of Nature declines God's
Law, this being a Divine Law; and we may
rationally gather any thing to be from God, if
it be Evident by and Consonant to the Light
of Nature, which is<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xx. 27.</note> 
               <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>andle of the Lord.</hi>
In a word, Natural Reason is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abolished by the Laws of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that
it is Confirmed and Authorized by them,
they being the Upshot of all Good Laws, and
the Consummation of the Best Reason. Hence
it appears that what is said by Right Reason
is said by God, for that is the Voice of God;
<hi>I have said, Ye are Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Sacred Scripture</hi> saith it,
whereof God the Holy Ghost is the Inditer.
The Law strictly charges Men <hi>not to Revile
the Gods, nor speak Evil of the Ruler of the
People, Exod.</hi> xxii. 28. Besides, that the Judges
or Rulers of the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> are call'd <hi>Gods</hi> by
the Psalmist, in the Person of God, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Approbation is farther evidenced from
the first Verse of this Psalm, where we are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107741:41"/>
told, That <hi>God standeth in the Congregation of
the Gods;</hi> the Great God presides over them,
and Authorizes their Office and Employment,
so far as they discharge it lawfully. This
Divine Authority of our Superiors is for ever
Established by that Royal Patent, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii.
15, 16. <hi>By me (i.e.</hi> by the Eternal and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Wisdom) <hi>Kings reign, and Princes decree
Iustice: By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even
all the Iudges of earth.</hi> This unexceptionably
makes them to be the Ordinance and Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God himself: And the <hi>New Testament</hi>
abets and confirms the <hi>Old,</hi> for in <hi>Iohn</hi> x. 34.
our Saviour refers to the very Words of the
Psalmist, saying, <hi>Is it not written in your Law,
I have said, Ye are Gods?</hi> The known Practice
of Christ, and his exemplary Subjection to the
Powers then in being, may be concluded to
be Authentick in this case, and to prove the
Divine Commission both of Superior and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Magistrates. But to wave that at
present, if you peruse the <hi>Epistles</hi> of those
Great Apostles St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> you will
find the Regal and Magistratical Office fully
Asserted, and set up to its utmost heighth.
<hi>Let every soul be subject to the higher Powers, for
there is no Power but of God; The Powers that be,
are ordained of God,</hi> Rom. xiii. 1. <hi>Submit your
selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lord's
sake, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or
unto Governours as unto those that are sent by
him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107741:41"/>
praise of them that do well,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 13. Thus,
whether they be <hi>Dii Majorum</hi> or <hi>Minorum
Gentium,</hi> the Gods of an higher or an inferior
Rank, whether they be those that have the
Supreme Authority, or whether they be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Officers and Rulers, they are All to be
Reverenced, Honoured, and Obey'd; and
there is the Command of God for it.</p>
            <p>But a severe Enquirer into these foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Texts will arrest me, it may be, with
with this <hi>Objection;</hi> The Apostles seem to
Clash, and to Contradict one another; for the
former asserts, That <hi>the Powers which be, are
Ordained of God;</hi> but the latter tells us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That <hi>they are the Ordinance of Man.</hi> These
are two different Things, yea Repugnant, to
be the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> and to be <hi>the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have no time now to offer to you the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Glosses of the Learned on that Passage of
St. <hi>Peter;</hi> nor am I at leisure to acquaint you
with the sundry Criticisms upon the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and to tell you how variously it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
But adhering at present to our own
Translation, I will in few words dispatch the
Difficulty, and shew you that Magistracy
may be the <hi>Ordinance of Men</hi> as well as of <hi>God,</hi>
and these are not Repugnant to one another.
It is not unfitly stiled an <hi>Humane Ordinance,</hi>
1. In respect of the Object and Matter about
which it is conversant, <hi>viz.</hi> Humane Society,
the Affairs of Mankind. The Higher Powers
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107741:42"/>
are set over Men, and Transact those things
which are Civil and Humane. 2. In regard
of the Subject in which it is seated, it may
have this Denomination; These <hi>Gods</hi> are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the same Nature and Make with our
selves. 3. In respect of the End, it is justly
called an <hi>Humane Ordinance;</hi> for it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Good and Preservation of Mankind,
for the well ordering and governing the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
of Men in the World. Now, all this
is consistent with what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>viz.</hi>
That Magistracy is the <hi>Ordinance of God;</hi> for
though the Particular Form and Manner of
Government be not fixed by God or Nature,
by a Divine or Natural Law, but by a Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
One (otherwise there would be but One
Lawful Form of Government) yet this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Government in the General is the
Direct and Express Appointment of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Thus it is evident that the Powers are
the <hi>Ordinance of Man,</hi> and yet it is as true that
they are <hi>Ordained of God,</hi> they are Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Authorized by Him, and they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by his Written and Revealed Will.
Thence we are assured that Divinity is Incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
in the compass of a Crown, and that Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
are Invested with their Authority from the
Supreme Sovereign of the World. Among
<hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s <hi>Scholars, if their Master said it,</hi> it
was enough, it was Authentick and Unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable.
Much more surely with the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> must that be held Indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107741:42"/>
which <hi>God hath said</hi> in his Holy Word,
<hi>I have said, Ye are Gods.</hi> We have not only
the Suffrage of <hi>Reason</hi> (of which I spoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
but the Infallible Dictates of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Oracles.</hi> The Reason of the Thing it
self, and the Will of the Supreme Majesty of
Heaven concur here: And what Proof more
Convincing can be desired and expected than
Divine Testimony superadded to Natural
Light? But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As these, so likewise the <hi>Strange
Events</hi> and <hi>Occurrences</hi> in the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>God</hi> is the Cause and Procurer, proclaim
aloud this Truth, That Magistrates and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
are God's Ordinance. There have
not been wanting Wonderful Signs to confirm
this. Government and Order have had a
Blessing entail'd upon them by Providence.
When Magistrates have faithfully discharged
their Duties, some signal and open Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations
of God's Favour have acquinted us
that he is pleased with them. When <hi>Phineas</hi>
(whom we must look upon as a Publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of Justice) stood up and Executed Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon that Pair of Infamous Sinners
(whose Contagion else might have spread it
self through the whole Land) the Plague pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
ceased, and the Divine Vengeance was
appeased. But when bold and hardned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
have openly affronted Magistracy, and
Mutinied against their Governors, they have
but ill succeeded in such Expeditions. Thus
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107741:43"/>
when those three Notorious Conspirators o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
their Mouths against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
the Earth (in a resembling sort) <hi>open'd its
mouth, and swallowed them up, and all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to them, Num. xvi. 30, 32.</hi> These Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
found their Punishment in their Sin, and
their Destruction in their Disobedience. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of Government, as it is a Curse in it
self, so Judicially it is followed with one from
Heaven. Not only Reason and Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
it, but the Divine <hi>Nemesis.</hi> It is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
on the <hi>Scottish</hi> Coin (as the Emblem,
I suppose of their <hi>Thistle,) Nemo me impune la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesset;
None shall provoke me, and be unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
It may justly indeed be the <hi>Magistrates
Motto,</hi> for none ever Affronted them, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Reward of their Folly, for the
King of Kings will not suffer his Vicegerents
to be exposed to Contempt and Injuries. As
they are Approved of and Countenanced by
him, so their <hi>Opposers</hi> shall be Baffled and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
And thus when Nature, and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and the Holy Writ, and Providence all
join in one Sound, it is the Voice of God.</p>
            <p>This Doctrin thus Established, concerns
both the <hi>Magistrate</hi> and the <hi>People.</hi> First the
Peo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le, for as before they were invited to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
from the Consideration of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Eminency of their Superiors, so here
they are called to the same Duty by this
Thought, That Magistracy is of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
Rulers are Constituted by God.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107741:43"/>
God Himself hath said of them, <hi>They are Gods.</hi>
Both their Name and Office are Reverend
and Honourable, and therefore you are bound
to pay them your utmost Regards and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
You are lead to this Duty by the
Light of Nature, as I have shew'd: And
therefore he that despises Authority, at the
same time acts against Reason, and abandons
his Understanding. And you are conducted
to it also by a Divine Warrant, as you have
heard, and therefore you cannot be excused
from the Performance of it.</p>
            <p>In the next place, this Doctrin doth more
nearly concern the Persons who are in Place
and Dignity. They should be Instructed from
what I have tender'd,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To acknowledge their Original and
Founder, the God of Gods, the Absolute Lord
and Sovereign Controller of the World. Let
not their Title, though it be Great and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
make them forget that there is a
<hi>GOD</hi> who Ruleth in the Earth, and that all
Earthly Gods must do Obeisance and Homage
to him. <hi>He is to be feared above all Gods,</hi> Psal.
xcvi. 4. The contrary Temper and Practice
have prevailed too much in the World, of
which we have abundant Instances: The first
<hi>Gods</hi> among the <hi>Heathens</hi> were <hi>Kings,</hi> and
<hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Great Men. Nimrod,</hi> the first
Monarch and Sovereign, was the first that was
Deified among them. <hi>Idolatry</hi> commenced in
<hi>Monarchy:</hi> The Greatness and Power of their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107741:44"/>
Kings extorted Worship from their Subjects,
who admired and feared them: Lordship and
Dominion entailed Divinity upon them. It
is well known that most of the Pagan Kings
of old (to make themselves more Venerable to
their Subjects) used to derive their Pedigree
from some God, and at last some of them
would needs be taken for Real Gods. Thus
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and some of the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Iulian</hi> joined the Effigies of the Heathen Gods
with his own Statues, that they might pay
Reverence to the Gods and Him together.
<hi>Our Lord God the Pope</hi> hath been a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

you may read in the Second Councel of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>

this Language is unsufferable: Though the

We read that the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth
prov'd Ungrateful to the Friends and Patriots
of their Country, the very Restorers and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
of their Welfare, as <hi>Camillus, Publius,

and animate all great Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
who discharge a good Conscience,
that Heaven hath a special Regard and Eye to

for the hard Usage and ill Returns they meet

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Since they are <hi>Gods,</hi> and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Almighty, they ought to think
themselves charg'd with a great Necessity of
Living and Acting well. They are set in an
Eminent Place, and all Men stand gazing at
them. Rulers that are Vitious, like <hi>Vzziah,</hi>
carry their<note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. xxvi. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Leprosy in their

if some do not Imitate them; as Men
usually do the Actions, and even the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107741:46"/>
of their Superiors. Their Care then
must be to Cherish Vertue in themselves, and
to Patronize it in others, both by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Example. The Interest of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
and of the <hi>Church</hi> (among other Matters,
yea and above them) is their Province: Of the
<hi>Church,</hi> I say, for which the <hi>World</hi> was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made, and Commonwealths first Instituted,
and Civil Societies have ever since been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
Be perswaded that the promoting of
<hi>Religion</hi> and God's Honour is the proper Task
of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> as well as the <hi>Minister.</hi> And
<hi>now</hi> especially, in a declining Age, when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is rendred Ridiculous, and Vertue is
grown Unfashionable, and a Strict and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect
Walking is counted too Demure:
Now, (I say) you are more especially oblig'd
to Befriend the Cause of Religion, and to take
her part when she hath so many Enemies and
Opposers. This is that which will admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the most Comfortable Reflections to you
when you come to leave the World: For he
that saith, <hi>Ye are Gods,</hi> saith likewise, That <hi>ye
shall die.</hi> And this Conducts me to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
General Part of the Text, of which I
will speak but a few words, and so put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to my Discourse.</p>
            <p>After the Honourable <hi>Concession</hi> follows a

the Dignity and Prerogative of the

is supposed in these words that they must <hi>die</hi>
as to their <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Office;</hi> And then what
Anguish and Regret must needs overwhelm
their Minds, when they look back on any of
those Unlawful and Unjust things which were
done by them? A Magistrate that hath any
Sense of the High Character he bears, knows
this, That he hath an Account to make to
Himself when he leaves his Place: And how
Dismal and Deplorable will it be, if upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
his past Carriage he be forced to say
of himself as the <hi>Historian</hi> of <hi>Caligula</hi>

               <hi>Tho'
some things were done by me which were not unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Man in Place, yet for the most part my
Behaviour was more like that of a Monster, than
of a Magistrate.</hi> With what Terrors will such
a Person be filled, when he considers that he
is in part Guilty of all the Debauchery and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,
all the Disorders and Enormities
which he might and ought to have prevented,
but did not? This is a thing which deserves
your most serious Thoughts.</p>
            <p>Again, this Clause may be look'd upon as
a <hi>Threatning</hi> for the Abuse of their Places;
<hi>They shall die,</hi> they shall not go Unpunish'd
here and hereafter, if they Discharge not their

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107741:47"/>
They shall not only <hi>die as Men</hi> (as you shall

Death shall transmit them to an Impartial
and Severe Judgment. Magistrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Justice, who sit on the Bench and
Judge others, must appear themselves before
the Last and Dreadful Tribunal, and there
render an Account of their Behaviour, and
Answer for all that they have done. Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Great Offices will not Priviledge
them from this. The Title of <hi>Gods</hi> will not

their Misery; for how intolerable will
it be to enter into the Portion of <hi>Evil Demons</hi>
and <hi>Damned Spirits,</hi> after they have born the
Name of <hi>Gods</hi> here upon Earth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> To confine my self to the bare words
of the Text, the Psalmist here humbles the
Magistrate after he had Exalted him; and at
the same time he teaches him how to Deport
himself, whilst he is in Place and Dignity: He
must then think of the Fate and Mortality
which are common to him with the meanest
Persons. It was rightly said by
<note n="*" place="margin">Lord Bacon. Essay 19.</note> One of your Order, <hi>All Precepts

you with <hi>both</hi> these Considerations; and
now I am concluding all with the latter of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107741:47"/>
them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Memento that they are Men.</hi>
Magistrates are of a different Make and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure:
Look on one side, and they are <hi>Gods;</hi>
but look on them on the other, and they are
<hi>Mortal Men. Ye shall die like Men, like</hi> Adam
(so 'tis according to the Original) like the
First Parent of Mankind, and as the whole
Race of <hi>Adam</hi> ever since; for ye are <hi>no better
than your Fathers.</hi> That of <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick
to <hi>Trajan,</hi> is almost the only Passage
in it that is void of Flattery;<note n="*" place="bottom">Ut caeterorum hominum, ita Principum, eorum etiam qui Dii sibi videntur, aevum omne &amp; breve &amp; fragile est.</note> 
               <hi>Princes</hi> (saith
he) <hi>though they seem to themselves</hi> (and others
too) <hi>to be Gods, yet they are as short-liv'd as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men.</hi> Here indeed we must be Plain
with the Greatest Men; though they are such,
yet Death will despoil them of this Character,
and strip them of all the Badges and Ensigns
of Authority, and will make them equal with
others in the Grave.</p>
            <p>This Part of my Text puts me in mind of
two or three remarkable Passages that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Antient Record; The <hi>Crier</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> used
to follow the Chariot of the Triumphant, and
cry to him after this Fashion, <hi>Remember that
Thou art Mortal.</hi> Be mindful of this in the
midst of these Triumphal Ovations, that
you must leave the World, as goodly and
Glorious as your Procession is now. And
<hi>Philip</hi> the Famous King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> after
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107741:48"/>
a great Victory that he had obtained over the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> ordered a Youth to come to him
every Morning, and to refresh his Memory
after the same manner, <hi>i.e.</hi> to tell him that <hi>he
was but a Man.</hi> And with Pagan let me mix
Christian Story; The <hi>Grecian Emperors</hi> on
the day of their Coronation, used to have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Marble-Stones of divers Colours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to them, to make Choice of which sort
of them they thought fit to have their <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chral
Monuments</hi> made of.</p>
            <p>So here, by the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> the Magistrates
Dignity and Mortality are remembred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Here is their Solemn Inauguration, <hi>I
have said, Ye are Gods;</hi> and then their Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
<hi>Ye shall die like Men.</hi> It is good to mix
these together; and accordingly in the midst
of your Glories and Honours I have presumed
to remind you of your Leaving of them. This
latter Consideration, if effectually managed,
is able to Instruct you in your Whole Duty,
and the best Discharge of it. For though it
is the Epicure's Catch, <hi>Let us eat and drink,
for to morrow we shall die,</hi> yet <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
runs quite counter to it, <hi>Whatsoever thy
hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for
there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor
wisdom in the grave whither thou goest,</hi> Eccl.
ix. 10. If it becomes an <hi>Emperor</hi> to die stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as one of them said) surely it will not be
Unbecoming a <hi>Christian Magistrate</hi> to do so, I

               </gap>an, to expire in the Faithful Performance

of his Office, in the actual doing of his Duty.
Others of a meaner Quality steal into their
Coffins, and silently descend into their Graves,
and are not much observed; but <hi>you</hi> will be
watched when you go off the Stage, when
you leave the World, and it will be asked in
the Neighbourhood what you did when you
were in it, and how you manag'd your Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardship.
Live then so, that when you come
to die, you may with <hi>Pericles,</hi> a Famed
Statesman of <hi>Athens,</hi> rejoice that no Citizen
ever wore a Mourning Habit on your account.
Live so, that when God shall remove you from
your Places by Death, you may (in another
Sense than our <hi>Psalmist</hi> intended) die like <hi>Men,</hi>
Bravely and Honourably, that ye may fall like
one of the <hi>Princes,</hi> with Credit and Renown,
and that after your Departure you may live
and flourish in the Memories and Hearts of
all Good Men, who will never suffer your
Good Actions to be Buried with you.</p>

and made them Heads over the People.</q>

            <p>WE find that <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
have been made
matter of <hi>Chance</hi> with some
People; thus one <hi>Regilianus</hi>
was promoted to Kingship meerly because of
his Name. The <hi>Sidonian</hi> Servants agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves to make him King, who the
next morning should first see the Sun. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s
Horse made his Master King of <hi>Persia</hi>
by his Neighing. But it is certain, that so
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107741:49"/>
Great a Concern should not depend upon
meer <hi>Casualty,</hi> but ought to be determined
with the most serious Deliberation imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And so as for Subordinate Rulers and
Governors, the Designation of them ought
not to be Accidental and Fortuitous, but is
to be managed with Consultation and Choice;
for every one is not fit for such a Place, every
one is not duly Capacitated and Qualified for
a Publick Office and Trust. This is the first
thing we take notice of here, That <hi>Moses
chose</hi> Men out of all <hi>Israel</hi> to be Heads and
Rulers.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Choice</hi> was conformable to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law
<hi>Iethro</hi>'s Advice, <hi>ver. 21. Thou
shalt provide out of all the People able men, such
as fear God, men of Truth, hating Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and place such over them to be Rulers.</hi>
The first and leading Qualification of an Able
Magistrate is, That he <hi>fears God.</hi> He must
be one that is Eminent for Religion and Piety;
which ought to be seen and observed not only
in his Profession, but Practice. Next, he ought
to be a <hi>Man of Truth, i.e.</hi> void of all Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
and Hypocrisy, one that is Faithful
and Upright in his Dealings, and therefore the
<hi>Septuagint</hi> render it <hi>Iust</hi> or <hi>Righteous.</hi> For
he is not fit to be a Ruler whose Life is stained
with Acts of Injustice and Dishonesty. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
none should be preferred to Magistracy
and Government, but such as <hi>hate Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
such as are of a Free and Generous Spirit,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107741:50"/>
and Detest all Base and Sordid Actions, such
as Scorn to Pervert Justice by taking of Gifts
and Bribes, such as have been taken notice of
for their great Inclinations to Charity, for
their readiness to Relieve the Distressed, and
for their Condescending to the Poor and
Needy, thereby shewing that they <hi>hate Pride
and Haughtiness,</hi> which gives an
Account of the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or Gloss rather. These
are the Qualifications of a Magistrate; but the
First of them is the Chief, and governs the
rest. He that fears God will approve himself
to be a Man of Truth and Sincerity, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Uprightness. Religion and Piety will
make him Just and Honest towards Men:
These will inspire him with Charity, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
and Condescention, and will not suffer
him to pervert Judgment and Justice. In
short, the Fear of God will make him Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in his Life and Actions, singular for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Goodness, and cause him to do all
things worthily, and as becomes a Migistrate.
This is the Character which Rulers must
bear, according to <hi>Iethro</hi>'s Advice to <hi>Moses:</hi>
And the Text acquaints us that this latter
made his choice agreeably to it, for <hi>he chose able
Men out of all Israel, and made them Heads over
the People, and Rulers of thousands,</hi> &amp;c. that
is, he conveniently placed them in several
Quarters, to decide Controversies among the
People, to distribute Justice, to give every
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107741:50"/>
one their Right, to take care of the Publick
Welfare, and to discharge all the Parts of a
Good Magistrate.</p>
            <p>The General Proposition then which I will
entertain you with at present, is this, That
a Ruler must be a Man of an exemplary Life
and Conversation; he being placed above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
must Excel them in the Eminency of
his Deportment and Actions. This is clear
from the <hi>Choice</hi> which is here made, and from
the <hi>Character</hi> which is here given. There is
a great deal more requir'd in a Governor, than
in an Inferior Person. He may be Good in a
low and mean Place, who can scarcely be
reckoned so in a high one: So that it may be
said of such a one, after he is advanc'd to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as <hi>Tacitus</hi> said of <hi>Galba,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Omnium consensu cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have been thought by all Men to be capable
of Ruling, if he had not actually been prefer'd
to that Station. For this is unquestionable,
That that Person may make a tolerably Good
Subject or Citizen, who yet may not be fit to
be a Chief Governor: The Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such a one must Surpass others; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what is sufficient and fitting in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
is not so in the latter. It was one of
the Laws of the <hi>Twelve Tables</hi> among the

               </note> the Order of the Senators

should be free from Vice, and be an Example
to others. The same may be pronounced in
General concerning the high Degree and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Magistracy; It must not be spotted
with the common Defilements of the World,
it ought to be a Pattern to the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
It is required of Superiors and Rulers,
that they be as Noted for their Moral and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Excellencies, as for their Authority and
Dignity. They must strive to outshine others
in Vertue and Goodness, and to be really the
Best Men in the place they live in.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of which will appear
from the Consideration of these following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A Magistrate is oblig'd to be Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
in his Life, because so great numbers of
Men have their Eyes fixed upon him; and
that, 1. To find Fault with him; 2. To Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
him, and do as he doth. I begin with
the first: Mens Eyes are fixed upon you that
are Magistrates, to see what Faults they can
find in you, to discover your Imperfections
and Miscarriages. The Great Luminaries of
Heaven are never Eclips'd, but we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them; yea, some of the Lesser Lights
and Petty Stars (which seem so to us because
they are so high) cannot withdraw their light,
cannot be over-run with Scum, but some
Body will obsrve it. When there was but
a Spot in <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

were enclin'd to Astronomy, presently found
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107741:51"/>
it out: Nay, it seems they found it out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was any such thing; for
a<note n="*" place="margin">Philos. Trans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct.</note> while after they retracted their
Observation, and acknowledg'd it
to be a Mistake. The Application of this
is very profitable; You that are Governors,
that act in a Sphere above othes, that are in
comparison of the meaner People, <hi>Heavenly
Bodies,</hi> Eminent Lights placed on high, you
will be taken notice of when your Lives are
blemish'd with Vice, and spotted with foul
Misdeeds. Yea, sometimes there will be those
that will pretend to espy Faults, whether
there be any or no. <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaks well,

               <hi>The Vices of Great Men</hi> (saith he) <hi>cannot be
conceal'd: Their Crimes are Perspicuous as well
as Themselves. Even the least Offences of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Persons are as it were Calumniated, and
made greater than they are.</hi> And he goes on to
shew that the Particular Failings of Men in
Place are objected to them, as <hi>Cimox</hi>'s Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s Sleeping, <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s Costly Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.

you see this is a received Notion and Truth,

               <hi>You must live as if the
whole World were the Theatre you acted on; and
it is impossible that the least Fault you commit can
be kept secret. All Men are wont most readily to
busy themselves about the Actions of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.</hi>
Seeing there is so narrow a Watch
upon you, it cannot but excite you to act
warily and wisely. If the <hi>Gods</hi> (for so Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates

should cause you to walk with great Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection,

            <p>Again, as some Persons fix their Eyes upon
you to Espy your Failings, so others do it to
Imitate you. And upon this Consideration
also you are engaged to be very Exact in your
Lives. The Ruler's Example mightily influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

this in express Words. And as it is thus
in respect of Bodily Infirmities and Blemishes,
so it happens likewise in regard of all other
things that come under Imitation. When
<hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> pretended to be a Skilful Mason
and Engineer, there were great numbers that
were ambitious to Excel that way. Our
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third being a Valiant Prince,
and delighting in Arms, we read that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Men were very numerous, and that they
endeavoured to exceed one another in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Enterprizes. The very Fashions or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
of Great Ones have been greedily
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107741:54"/>
imbraced by the People. All the <hi>Italian</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
affected an Amber-colour'd Hair when
<hi>Poppaea</hi>'s (which was of that Colour) was so
admired by <hi>Nero,</hi> and extoll'd by him in
Songs and Catches; then they all strove to
dye their Locks of that hew. The <hi>Roman</hi>
Historians acquaint us, that <hi>Augustus Cesar</hi>
loved Poetry, and accordingly every one
gave his mind to Versifying in his days. When
<hi>Nero</hi> play'd on his Instrument up and down
the great Towns, Minstrels and Fidlers were
all in Fashion. When <hi>Commodus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror

grew to be the Mode.</p>
            <p>But I will shew you that as to all Moral
Actions chiefly, <hi>i.e.</hi> all Vices and Vertues, a

These two things then I will particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
enlarge upon, <hi>First,</hi> That if a Ruler be
Vitious and Wicked, the People will follow
his Steps: And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> (on the contrary)
If the Ruler be a Man of Vertue and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Worth, they will Imitate him in that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I say, if the Ruler be Vitious, the
People will follow his Vices. <hi>Abimelech</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Party that stuck to him, and follow'd him in

them; for what Religion the King
was of, that they would be of too. It is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of <hi>Vriah</hi> the Priest, That <hi>he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all that King Ahaz commanded him,
2 Kings</hi> xvi. 16. If he disputed not the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of any thing the King said, it is not
to be questioned but that he Imitated what
he did. There are such People in all Ages;
they follow the Prince even in his very Vices
and Impieties. This was observ'd by one
that was a King himself, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxix. 12. <hi>If a
Ruler hearkens to lyes, all his Servants are wicked,</hi>
they will lye too; and whatever other Vices
he is guilty of, they will certainly imitate
him. <hi>Iustin</hi> the Historian hath these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable

Players. I might mention several other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to prove how prone Men are to imitate
the Failings and Defects of their Superiors.
<hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> in the Oration which he
made at the Funeral of <hi>Basil</hi> the Great, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us that some Persons affected even the
Infirmities of that Great Man, thinking that
those had some worth in them, or at least that
they were wholly to be excused because they
were found in him. Nay, the Imitation of
Superiors went further yet, for we are told
that when the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> kill'd himself,
many of his Subjects dispatch'd themselves out
of Compassion and Kindness to him. They
would Imitate their Prince not only living
but dying.</p>
            <p>And thus you see how <hi>Reasonable</hi> it is
(which is the thing I am urging) that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and Rulers should behave themselves
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107741:55"/>
in a very exact manner. To prosecute this
yet farther, I will shew you that when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
are Vitious and Wicked, there is, <hi>1st.</hi>
danger of a greater <hi>Contagion; 2dly.</hi> Of an
heavier <hi>Punishment</hi> than ordinary.</p>
            <p>That there is a Contagion I have proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
but it is as easy to prove that this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by <hi>Magistrates</hi> more than by any <hi>other</hi>
sort of Men. The Sins of Private Men, and
such as are in a mean and ordinary Condition,
Infect those only who immediately converse
with them; but when Great and Eminent
Persons Sin, they must needs scatter the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to a very wide Circumference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are known to all, and their Crimes
become Catholick. It was Excellently said

               <hi>Vitious Rulers deserve worse of the

themselves conceive Vices, but infuse them into
the Commonalty; They are hurtful to the Publick
not only because they themselves are Corrupted, but
also because they Corrupt others, and do more
harm by their Example, than by the Fault it self.</hi>
Why? Because their Example is enough to
make Error Authentick, and their single Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is able to justifie a Crime: for meaner
Persons think it cannot but be Vertuous to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107741:56"/>
Imitate them, and they conclude that to be
Good which they see them do. <hi>Plutarch</hi> said

               <hi>When Wickedness is added to Power,

well as <hi>themselves;</hi> for the Multitude are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
in their Vitious Practices, by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Faults of those in Place; they think

Crimes.<note n="†" place="bottom">Hae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> The Actions of Governors
pass for Edicts and Laws. Inferior Persons
stand waiting to see what their Superiors do,
and they imagine that they cannot do amiss,
as long as they take them for their Pattern.
Thus we see what Influence the Vitious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of Rulers hath: Their Faults are like
Diseases which seize upon some Principal part,
and so endanger all the rest. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they must needs do more harm than
others.</p>
            <p>In the next place this must be remembred,
that the Sins of Governors are not only more
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107741:56"/>
than ordinarily Infections, but the <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and <hi>Iudgments</hi> which attend them are
far heavier than those which befal Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
God is used to proportion Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto Sin; and look where there is an
inequality of the latter, there likewise is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
as to the former. Now, among other
Circumstances, Sin is made Greater in respect
of the Person that commits it. The Greater
he is, the more Heinous and Scandalous is his
Fault. <hi>Nathan</hi> in his Impeachment of <hi>David</hi>
lets him know that <hi>he had given great occasion
to the Enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, 2 Sam.</hi>
xii. 14. And without doubt he gave great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of Offence to <hi>others</hi> (even the Friends
of God and of Religion:) not only the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
but the <hi>Israelites</hi> might be tempted to
Blaspheme God's Name, and to Practise Vice
with great Freedom, when they beheld the
Flagitious Deeds which <hi>David</hi> was Guilty of.
A Magistrate's Sin is Great, because it is a
Magistrate's; that very Consideration aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
it. And thence we may reasonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that the <hi>Penalty</hi> of it shall be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Accordingly the Sacred History informs
us, that generally such a Person is doubly Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
namely in himself and in others. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
was not only personally Plagued, but all
his People suffer'd for his sake. <hi>David</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the People, and thereby derived upon
himself the Wrath of God, and upon them
likewise a very terrible Infliction. King <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:107741:57"/>
brought Vengeance on himself and his
Subjects, by his evil Demeanor. The Text
saith expresly (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxii. 25.) <hi>That He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah
rendred not again according to the Benefit
done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was Wrath upon him, and upon Iudah
and Israel.</hi> These suffer'd for what he did.
<hi>The Confusion of Egypt</hi> was the attendant of <hi>the
foolishness (i.e.</hi> the Sinfulness) <hi>of their Princes,
Isa.</hi> xix. 11. And you may hear God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus in <hi>Zech.</hi> x. 3. <hi>Mine anger was kindled
against the Shepherds, and I punish'd the Goats,
i.e.</hi> God punish'd both Rulers and People, but
these for the sake of them. Yea, a Nation is
sometimes punish'd because of a Wicked King,
even when he is dead, as appears from <hi>Ier.</hi>
xv. 4. <hi>Israel</hi> was Plagued for <hi>Manasses</hi>'s Sins,
after he had left the World. So Pernicious
and Destructive are the Miscarriages of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors.
The Community is endamag'd by
their Disorders. Their Follies bring down
Judgments on a whole Nation. All the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
suffer for what the Head doth. And
this happens so from the Nature of the thing
it self, as well as by the just Judgment of God.
By <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>'s Luxury the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
was removed to the <hi>Medes.</hi> By <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi>'s
Riot and Prodigality the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire
was Ruin'd. And many other Instances there
are of the like Nature. From whence you
may gather how Reasonable it is that a Ruler
should endeavour to be free from Vice, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107741:57"/>
to lead a very Religious and Pious Life: For
if he doth otherwise, the People stand ready
to follow his Steps, and so there will be an
Universal Corruption, and the Judgments of
God will overtake both Rulers and People.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Those in High Places are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
to be Exemplary in their Lives, and to
shew forth all Vertues and Graces, because
when Men behold these in them, they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to Imitate them. I have shew'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they are apt to resemble them in their
<hi>Vitious</hi> Practices: Now I will briefly let you
see, that if they have Examples of <hi>another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
set before them, they will be enclined to
follow them.</p>
            <p>As there is no Evil so Pernicious as a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ruler, because (as I have shew'd under
the foregoing Head) his Personal Faults soon
become National, and his worst Actions are
drawn into Example, so there is no Good in
the World so Universally Beneficial as a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ruler, because most Men will be moved
to Transcribe his Good and Vertuous Actions,
and so there will be an effectual and speedy
Reformation of the Publick. There are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in Holy Scripture which might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
here: For as <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> a Bad King,
corrupted the People by his Evil Life as well
as Laws, and <hi>thereby made all Israel sin,</hi> so we
read that <hi>David, Asa, Iosiah, Hezekiah,</hi> Good
Kings, promoted God's Worship and a Holy
Life by their own Practice. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107741:58"/>
Life of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> a Person of Wealth and
Quality in <hi>Athens,</hi> tells us how he refused to
learn to play on the Flute, and inveigh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Instrument (as it was then in use)
whereupon it soon wore out of Fashion, and
at last was look'd upon as a Sordid and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
sort of Diversion by the <hi>Athenian</hi>
Gentlemen. <hi>Livy</hi> acquaints us that <hi>Romulus,</hi>
who at first was very Extravagant and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
afterward grew Sober and Staid: And
when he did so, all the <hi>Romans</hi> chang'd with
him, and became like him. The Custom of
Immoderate and Excessive Attire, Feasting
and Houshold Stuff had prevail'd long at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and could not be Repress'd by Laws;
but as soon as <hi>Vespasian</hi> was Emperor, it went
off of it self. <hi>Tacitus</hi> observes the Cause of
it to be their desire of Emulating their Prince,
and conforming themselves to his Example.
This did more than Fear and Penalty. <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
observes of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> Surnamed the
<hi>Philosopher,</hi> that he was the first Emperor that
signally <hi>Establish'd</hi> Wisdom and good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
by his own Life and Actions; whereby
it came to pass, that that Age yielded a great
Company of Wife and Grave Men. You may
read in a very good Author, that the Senate
of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Acclamation to <hi>Severus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was after this manner,<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>All Persons do all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107741:58"/>
things well, because you Rule well.</hi> This perhaps
may be said in Flattery to that Prince, but it
is undoubtedly true, that if he were a Good
Ruler, the generality of his Subjects would
find the happy Influence of it in the Goodness
of their own Lives. Never was there such a
Time of Converts, as when <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Great turn'd Christian; and afterwards when
he was Baptiz'd,<note n="*" place="bottom">Nicephor. l. 7. c. 34.</note> Twelve thousand Men,
besides Women and Children, received the
Christian Faith that Year, and were admitted
to Baptism. <hi>Ammianus</hi> observes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Valentinian,</hi> that he being a very Chast
Prince both at Home and Abroad, and giving
way to no Obscene and Lascivious Words or
Actions, This was the Bridle of the Court,
and it prov'd the best way to keep them in
good Order. To come nearer, when King
<hi>Lucius,</hi> a <hi>British</hi> King, embraced the Faith
of the Gospel, and was Baptiz'd, great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his Subjects receiv'd the same Faith,
and flock'd to the Baptismal Waters; and so
Paganism and Idolatry decay'd daily. And
afterwards, when Heathenism return'd into
this Land, by the Invasion which the <hi>Saxons</hi>
made, it by degrees wore off again by the
powerful Example of their Kings: When
King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> and King <hi>Sebert</hi> embrac'd the
Christian Religion and were Baptiz'd, the
Nation was in a short time Christianiz'd.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107741:59"/>
Thus it is evident what great Obligations lie
upon Rulers and Governors to be Good and
Righteous; for their Examples teach Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
most powerfully and effectually.</p>
            <p>There are other Considerations (besides
these which I have mentioned and insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to convince you of this Truth, That a
Magistrate ought to be a Man of an Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
Life, and to surpass others in all lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Endowments and Actions. I might men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this, that he cannot with any confidence
govern others, unless he have a Government
over himself, and looks narrowly into his own
Life and Manners. He cannot with Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
call upon others to obey those Laws
which he breaks himself. One of the Antients
expresses it thus;<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <q>It is not for him that is
falling, to set others upright; it is not for
him that hath no command over himself, to
command others. It must be look'd to in
the first place that the Rule be streight, and
lie right and orderly if you intend to bring
those things to a rectitude which it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to. So must a Prince first rightly settle
his Command and Empire over himself, and
direct his own Manners in order to a right
governing of others.</q> This latter cannot be
done as it should be without the former:
Though it is true it is done after some sort
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107741:59"/>
where the other is wanting. Thus <hi>Plutarch</hi>
Remarks of <hi>Sylla,</hi> that he would be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prescribing Laws to the <hi>Romans</hi> of Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Chastity, whilst himself was a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to them both, and indulg'd himself in all
Intemperance and Leudness. <hi>Domitian</hi> made

in Incest with his Neece. <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,

               </gap>s and Reluctancy.</p>
            <p>The next Consideration is this, That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
are to <hi>Punish</hi> others, and upon that
account are obliged to be Blameless and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
themselves. It was said of <hi>Cato</hi> the
<hi>Censor,</hi> that the Strictness of his own Life,
made him a Bold, Severe and Rigid Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter
on others. And so every Governor
may with Confidence and Authority restrain
and correct Vice in others, when he permits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it not in himself. But how can he punish Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
that commits them? With what Face
can he be actually Guilty of that which he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107741:60"/>
Animadverts upon, and severely Chastises in
others? For this Reason a Ruler should be
exceeding wary in his Life and Manners.</p>
            <p>Again, by his effectual Influencing on others
it will come to pass, that <hi>their</hi> Actions will be
interpreted <hi>his.</hi> Their Good Deeds will be
reckon'd so, because they were the Effect of
his Authority. And how joyful a Reflection
must this needs be, that the Vertuous Acts of
so many Persons are esteem'd as his own?
But then on the other side, the Evil Actions
and Enormities of Men shall be attributed to
him, if he made them Bad by his Example.
This must needs lie very heavy on his Mind,
and therefore it follows hence, that those who
preside over others are hugely concern'd to
look to their Lives.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this might be added in the last
place, that the Devil, the Malicious Spirit of
Darkness, chiefly designs and endeavours the
Corrupting of Governors, and those in high
Places. <hi>Fight neither against small nor great,
but against the King,</hi> against Rulers and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
is the Maxim of that Infernal Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician.
We read (<hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 8.) that <hi>Elymas
the Sorcerer sought to turn away Sergius Paulus
the Deputy</hi> (the Great Man of the Country)
<hi>from the Faith.</hi> If he could pervert <hi>him,</hi> he
knew he should gain others fast enough. That
which was <hi>Nero</hi>'s Bloody wish, <hi>That all the
People of</hi> Rome <hi>had but one Neck, that he might
cut it off at one blow;</hi> the same in some kind is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107741:60"/>
Satan's constant Endeavour, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Head and Governor to destroy all
the People, whilst by his wicked Example he
Debauches all that are under him. A Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
for this reason ought to be very obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of his Actions, thereby to Defeat and
Baffle the Designs of the Prince of Darkness.
These are the <hi>Reasons</hi> of that Proposition which
I founded on the Words of the Text.</p>
            <p>Now I will offer some seasonable <hi>Inferences</hi>
from what hath been said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let those in Authority check and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themselves if they find that their Lives
are Evil, and that (instead of being Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Goodness and Holiness) they have
taught others by their Practice to act Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Prophanely. When it was the Fashion
heretofore to make <hi>Gods,</hi> some Great Men
would needs Practise this upon themselves;
and then they thought they had a Licence to
do what they pleased: And too many, tho'
not of Pagan Principles, are seen to Imitate
them too much, whilst being of the number
of those whom the Scripture calls <hi>Gods,</hi> they
take Liberty to act that which is unworthy of
<hi>Men:</hi> And whereas they should Punish Vice,
they are themselves Examples of it. But this
is a very Gross and Abominable Miscarriage,
and therefore you that are Magistrates ought
seriously to consider of it. You must not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that your Authority cancels your Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to Vertue, and that your Greatness
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107741:61"/>
compounds for your Wickedness. Reckon
not that you have an Advantage above others
to do Ill, and go unpunish'd. Think of this,
that your Quality doth not Annihilate or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
your Faults, but hugely Aggravates
and Inhanses them. <hi>There is an evil that I have
seen under the Sun,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, an error that
proceedeth from the Ruler;</hi> and it is <hi>his</hi> Fault,
(as he adds) <hi>that folly is set in great dignity,</hi> as
you read <hi>Eccl.</hi> x. 5, 6. Thus this Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
takes notice of and reproves the Evil
Behaviour of Crown'd Heads, and of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Governors; and therefore you must
not imagin that your Place gives you leave to
do what you will. But rather perswade your
selves of this, that the thing which should
Exalt Palaces above Cottages, and Magistrates
above the Common People, is the Transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of their Vertues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> then, As you are desirous to do
any good in your Places, be careful that your
Lives be Vertuous and Exemplary. The
Advice of one of the Antient Moralists to a
Person in Authority, shall be mine to you,
<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </gap> Orat.</note> Set your selves Patterns to others in Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and all other commendable Qualities,
knowing that the Manners of the whole City
are conformable to the Behaviour of those that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107741:61"/>
are in Authority. Remember that your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are all taken notice of, and therefore they
ought to be such as should be Imitated. Take
heed that you Soil not your Worthy Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Good Actions with others that are
Blameable; as 'tis said that <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> stain'd
his Valour and Great Learning with Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Lasciviousness: His Successor <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
Tainted his Liberality and Clemency with
Impatience and Envy: <hi>Vespasian</hi> Clouded his
Good Nature and Prowess with Avarice:
And <hi>Trajan</hi> Sullied his Justice and Affability
with his Cruelty to the Christians: And
(to give an Instance at Home) our King
<hi>Henry</hi> VII. Eclips'd his Wisdom by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness.
Let your Vertues be entire, let
there be nothing seen to Obscure them. Shine
forth with a perfect Light, and remember
that others shine with a Light borrow'd from
you: Therefore if you substract your Rays,
you leave them in Darkness. Great Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
endure not any Rivals, they cannot
brook Competitors and Equals. Let it be
seen that you cannot suffer Rivals in Vertue
and Goodness. Strive to surpass others in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
Justice, Mercy, Piety and Religion.
Endeavour to Excel your Inferiors in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as well as in Authority and Dignity. Be
not only above their Conditions and Stations
in the World, but above the Qualities of their
Minds, and the Actions of their Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:107741:62"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Not only Rulers but the whole
Community are concern'd in this Text, and
in the Doctrin I have treated of. We are all
bound to Bless God for Good Rulers and Able
Magistrates. This is a signal Favour and
Blessing to a Nation. <hi>Rulers are like Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bodies, which cause Good or Evil Times,</hi> saith
the Lord <hi>Verulam.</hi> Whether we speak of the
Civil or Ecclesiastical Governors, it is most
true: Whether we apply it to those that are
concern'd in the Temporal or Spiritual Affairs,
it holds good. Next to a Good Magistrate there
is not a greater Blessing under Heaven than a
Good Minister. But of the former I speak at
present: There is nothing more profitable,
desirable and excellent than a Worthy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor:
And on the contrary, what can be
more pestilent and destructive than Bad ones?
They are indeed <hi>Rulers of Sodom,</hi> according
to the Sacred Stile, <hi>Isa.</hi> i. <hi>10.</hi> and then 'tis no
wonder that we read in the same place that
their People are <hi>People of Gomorrah.</hi> How
great reason therefore have you to thank God
for Religious Governors! The Wise Man tells
us, That <hi>when the Righteous are in authority,
the people rejoice; but when the Wicked beareth
rule, the people mourn,</hi> Prov. xxix. 2.</p>
            <p>Thus I have spoken to <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
I will now, in few Words, Address my
self particularly to the Person who this Day is
to be Chosen, and afterwards Inaugurated
into the Office of Chief Magistrate of this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107741:62"/>
Corporation, as a fit Person to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
with so high a Concern: And therefore let
me remind you of your proper Duty in these
present Circumstances. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vid</hi>
pray'd,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 51. 12.</note> That <hi>God would uphold
him with his free Spirit;</hi> in which Petition he
refers to the Great Place and Dignity he was
advanced to, he desires such an Heroical and
Princely Temper as befitted that high Station.
May this Generous and Noble Spirit inspire
you, and cause you to do nothing that is Vile
and Mean, unworthy of your Place, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
your Station. May this powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stir you up to act vigorously for God and
Religion, and prompt you to exercise Justice
with due severity. It is not to be denied that
<hi>England</hi> may vie with any Nation in the
World for Good and Wholesom Laws, but
the grand Complaint (and which is too true)
is, that they are seldom executed by Inferior
Magistrates. I hope, Sir, you will cause this
Complaint to cease, and that you will not
bear the Sword in vain, but remember to
draw it, and make Offenders feel the edge of
it. If, like <hi>Phineas,</hi> you stand up, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Judgment, our Plagues will cease, God's
Judgments will be averted, and his Blessings
deriv'd on this Town. This Town indeed
is your peculiar Province, your particular
Care: the Priviledges and Immunities, the
Peace and Welfare of which are most sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be preserv'd by you. One of the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:107741:63"/>
Emperors made it his Boast, that when he
came first to Rule he found the City of <hi>Rome</hi>
built with Brick, but he left it made of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Assure your self, Sir, that to leave a
Town better in Manners than you found it,
is a truer Monument of your Care of the Place,
and will be more lasting than Marble or Brass.
When you look upon your outward Habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the Badges of your Office, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that they teach you to do something more
than other Men. For, do you think that you
are to differ from others in Honour, and not in
those things likewise which are of an higher
Nature? Why doth the <hi>Topping Mace</hi> lead the
Van when you come into Publick? What
serves the Venerable Scarlet or Fur for? What
do your Worshipful Appellations and Titles
signify? To what purpose is your Solemn E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage
and Retinue? Are all your Ensigns of
Authority, and Badges of Honour meer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry?
Do not these tell you that as you are
<hi>Distinguish'd</hi> from other Persons, so you ought
to <hi>Excel and Surpass</hi> them? When therefore
you shall actually take upon you the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Antient and Renown'd Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
see that you first out-do your self, and
then make others out-strip their former Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that it may be said with truth, That this
Place is visibly Amended and Reform'd by
your being <hi>Mayor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To shut up all, take care to discharge your
Duty, and be not Affraid. Do what <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:107741:63"/>
what your <hi>Prince,</hi> and what the <hi>Laws</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you, and that will be sufficient Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to you. And, bear this ever in your
Mind, that it is a Vertuous and Exemplary
Life, and that only, which can create you a
firm Respect and Esteem. Your <hi>Place</hi> may
(and that justly) cause Admiration and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
but it is <hi>Goodness</hi> alone which will
purchase you <hi>True Honour,</hi> for this is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence

such are the <hi>Saving</hi> Vertues and

Prophesying, and such like Miraculous Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which were necessary for the first Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Propagating of Christianity in the
world. And with These may be Ranked all
the goodly Indowments of Mens Souls all
the fair Accomplishments of Nature, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
they have enrich'd their Faculties with.
The third and last degree of God's Gifts
(which by Vulgar Minds are reckoned as the
Greatest, but really are the Meanest of all)
are those <hi>Good</hi> things which belong to the
Body and Outward State of Man: Such are
Health, Riches, and Honour, and all other
things of resembling Quality. These (alas)
are poor and sorry Acquisitions if compared
with the more Noble Accomplishments of the
Better Part of Man. And yet both <hi>These</hi> and
<hi>They</hi> may be strangely abused and perverted
by the Owners of them, contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Donor, and the excellent ends for
which they were bestowed. Thus (to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
many make their Wealth and Great
Revenues subservient only to their Rambling
<hi>Lusts:</hi> and Pride and Ostentation have stain'd
the Spiritual Endowments of others.</p>
            <p>Of this latter our Apostle hath given a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Demonstration in this Epistle. Here
you may read how the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (a
Church planted by the Ministry of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
himself, and Eminent for all Spiritual Gifts)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107741:65"/>
either not knowing, or not minding the Right
Use of such an excellent Treasure (<hi>viz.</hi> that
the meanest of them were intended for the
Good and Benefit of the Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and that all of them were some ways
useful to that End) vainly disparaged <hi>Some</hi> of
them, and unwisely set the Greatest Value on
<hi>Others,</hi> which really were not in themselves
serviceable to the Highest and Noblest Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
Pride and Applause, Vain Glory and
Affectation made them prefer <hi>Tongues</hi> before
<hi>Prophesying, i.e.</hi> their own Private Credit and
Reputation before the Common Good and
Edification of their Brethren. This is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the Apostle's Admirable Discourse
concerning <hi>Spiritual Gifts,</hi> which begins at
the Twelfth Chapter: Where first of all he
acquaints them with the wonderful Diversity
and Disparity of God's Gifts; and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to convince them that the Meanest
of them are not to be disregarded, since all of
them issue from one and the same Spirit, and
acknowledge the same Author and Donor.
And as the Original of them all is alike, so
also is the Intent and Design of them, which
is no other than the Common and Universal
Good. From such Premises as these he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
that 'tis gross Folly for any to be Proud
of their Gifts, and to Insult over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
on the account of what they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and that it is as unreasonable to Envy
those that are Possessors of the Choicest Gifts,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107741:65"/>
as 'tis to despise those that are Owners of the
Meanest. This is the main Scope of the 12th
Chapter.</p>
            <p>And now, because Ambition, and desire of
Excelling and Outstripping one another, have
possessed their Minds, he perswades them in
the last Verse of that Chapter to a Vertuous
Zeal and Holy Emulation, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>]
<hi>Covet earnestly the better Gifts, and yet shew I
unto you a more excellent way</hi>] a Superlative
Method of Outvying others, and even of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
your selves, and that is no other than
<hi>Charity,</hi> that Great and Noble Grace which
will render you Eminent and Useful in the
World, which will set off all your other Gifts
and Endowments, and direct you how to
manage them for the best Advantages. This
Sovereign and Superintending Grace will
most successfully guide all the Inferior ones,
and put them upon their proper Work and
Employment, and conduct them most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously
to their right End. This Grace the
Apostle admirably deciphers in the Thirteenth
Chapter, and in the beginning of the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
he shuts up that part of his Discourse
with a Perswasive to so Incomparable a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
[<hi>Follow after Charity,</hi>] pursue it with the
greatest Eagerness and Vigour, and give not
over till you have perfectly attained it. Be
careful above all things to Excel in This,
which makes all your other Attainments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
both to your selves and others. Strive
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107741:66"/>
then to surpass one another in the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Evangelical Grace; for this is an
Harmless Contention, this is an Innocent and
Holy Emulation, and most suitable to the
Christian Spirit, and the Genius of the Gospel.
<hi>Follow after Charity, and desire spiritual Gifts.</hi>
Join the one and the other, and you are safe.</p>
            <p>And then immediately our Apostle (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus caution'd all with <hi>Charity</hi>) takes
occasion again to speak of those <hi>Spiritual Gifts</hi>
which he had insisted on before. There was
it seems a Great Mistake about them, and
therefore he thinks good to Rectify their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thoroughly in the point; and this he
doth by telling them, that though the Gift of
Tongues was in great request among them,
(for <hi>This</hi> Reason it is likely, because the <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
were most eminently indued with That,
the Holy Ghost descending on them in the
shape of <hi>Cloven Tongues</hi>) yet the Gift of <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ying</hi>
(<hi>i.e.</hi> of Understanding and Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God's Will) was clearly the more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
and Desirable Accomplishment; and,
amongst All the Spiritual Gifts conferr'd on the
Christian Church, deserved to be ranked in
the first place. For tho' Variety of Tongues
might seem more Admirable, and make a
greater Noise, and create more Wonder and
Astonishment, yet certainly if they sought not
rather to be Admired for their Gifts than to be
Beneficial by them, they could not but give the
Precedency to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that being the more
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107741:66"/>
Useful Gift, and that which conduceth most
to our greatest Concern, and our highest Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
the Edification of the Church of Christ.
It is better to <hi>do Good,</hi> than to <hi>appear Great.</hi>
Tongues have their Use, but in Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Prophecying. That is most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
which is most Advantageous and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>
            <p>This is the Scope of the Apostle's Discourse
in this Chapter, whereof my Text is a part,

the Greatest Skill for so Difficult an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
They that heartily love the Church,
and sincerely tender the Good of its Members,
never think they can prepare themselves <hi>enough</hi>
for its Service, and are ever studying to do
<hi>More,</hi> making the Apostle's Words their
Motto, <hi>(Who is sufficient for these things)?</hi>
Here it is that they spend their best Affections;
and their highest Aims and Enterprizes centre
in This. They are Impatient till they can
bring with them Gold and Silver and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Stones for so Glorious and Edifice. They
are ambitious to <hi>Excel,</hi> not that they may
thereby derive a Glory and Applause upon
themselves, but for the solid Good of their
Christian Brethren. So that the Text is no
other than the Dictate of Christian Charity,
prescribing to us the way of Using those Gifts
Well, which are so subject to be abused.
Charity esteems it better to be Profitable to
Mens Souls, than to purchase their Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Applause; it teaches us to prize the
<hi>Salvation of Men</hi> more than our <hi>own Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is high time to lead you to the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and Distinct Consideration of the two
things here mention'd, 1. The Operation or
Means in order to a Noble End, <hi>Seek that ye
may excel.</hi> 2. The End it self, <hi>to the edifying
of the Church.</hi> I begin with the latter first,
for in Practical Discourse the <hi>End</hi> doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
challenge the first Place. And indeed,
true Wisdom instructs its Followers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107741:67"/>
a Right <hi>End</hi> to themselves, and then
to make Choice of such <hi>Means</hi> as are proper
for that End. We are liable to miscarry in
<hi>both</hi> of These; for sometimes we Aim right,
but shoot awry, our Actions bearing no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Goodness of our Intentions:
At other times we are in a right Course, but
propound a wrong End; so that Good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
are marr'd by Ill Purposes. Now,
the Apostle here meets with both these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and labours their amendment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
to us the End together with the
Means; the best End, <hi>the Church of God,</hi> and
<hi>the edifying thereof;</hi> the best Means, <hi>seek that
ye may Excel.</hi> Every Action is design'd to
some Purpose, and according to this we aim
either Right or Wrong; we either deport our
selves laudably, or hugely miscarry in our
Lives. It will concern us therefore to fix our
selves Aright at first, and to propound to our
selves such an End as we may not be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to own in the whole Course of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And such certainly is <hi>the Church of God,</hi>
which is most deservedly the Scope of all our
Enterprizes, Prayers and Wishes. This baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles
all sneaking Designs and Projects; this
bravely leads us out of our selves, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
us directly to the Supreme Good, and
there stints and determines all our Passions
and Desires. We at once become Lovers of
God and of his Church, the one absolutely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing
upon the other; the Glory of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107741:68"/>
Almighty and the Good of Souls being so twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
together, that it will be found a thing
wholly impossible to divide them. For the
<hi>Church</hi> being that Society of Holy Men where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God is more peculiarly acknowledged and
glorified, it must needs be that whilst we
tender the Welfare of that Society, we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
more signally advance <hi>God</hi>'s Glory. Our
Love, if it be true and real, will reflect from
<hi>God</hi> to his <hi>Church;</hi> and through the <hi>Church</hi> it
will ascend to <hi>God</hi> again.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Edifying</hi> or <hi>Building</hi> of the Church,
which is the thing here design'd, principally
belongs to <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> himself. It looks like
a Paradox, but is certainly true that the
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. iii. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Foundation</hi> and<note n="†" place="bottom">Ephes. ii. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Chief Corner-stone</hi> in the
Building are the <hi>Chief Architect</hi> also. <hi>On this
Rock,</hi> saith he to St. <hi>Peter, I will build my
Church.</hi> This Glorious Fabrick is rais'd by
<hi>Christ's</hi> own hand. Yet this Work in some
measure belongs to all Holy and Exemplary
Christians; they are useful and necessary for
the promoting of this Structure. But more
especially the Guides and Rulers of the Church,
the Ministers of the Gospel, the Dispensers
of God's Holy Word are employ'd in this
Work; they are in a peculiar manner appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and set apart on purpose to be Artificers
and Builders in the Erecting of the Christian
Church; they are particularly design'd <hi>for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107741:68"/>
the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the
Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ,
i.e.</hi> his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Our great Care must be to lay the
Foundation; and what that is our Apostle
tells us, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 11. <hi>Other foundation can no
man lay than that which is laid, which is Iesus
Christ, i.e.</hi> the Meritorious Undertaking of
the Son of God, Christ Jesus the Blessed.
There is no Salvation but by a lively and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Faith in the Blood of this Lamb of God.
This is the same with <hi>the Foundation of the
Apostles and Prophets, Eph.</hi> ii. 20. which St.
<hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Ephesians</hi> they are <hi>built upon,
viz.</hi> the Doctrin of the <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Christ,</hi> delivered by these Inspired
Men, and which they received from Christ
himself, who in the same place is called <hi>the
Chief Corner-stone.</hi> This is the Great Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Point of the Christian Institution, this
is the main Truth on which all Christianity is
founded, and therefore we must be very
Faithful in the Asserting and Vindicating of
this. The whole Fabrick of our Religion
sinks, and that irrecoverably, without this
firm and steady Basis. And all the <hi>other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
and <hi>Rudiments</hi> of Christianity, which
are also justly stiled <hi>the Foundation, Heb.</hi> vi. 1.
are our proper Concern: We are indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
obliged to instruct our Charge in all those
Divine Truths of the Gospel which the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Evangelists and Apostles furnish
us with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:107741:69"/>
And having laid the <hi>Foundation</hi> with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Care and Skill (as knowing that it is
this which Supports the Fabrick) we must
proceed to erect our <hi>Superstructure,</hi> to build
upwards as well as downwards. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
all the Holy Doctrines and Rules
conducing to Christian Knowledge and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
are to be produced, and made use of.
We must remember the Apostle's Advice, to
<hi>build upon the Foundation</hi> nothing but <hi>Gold,
Silver, and precious Stones, 1 Cor.</hi> iii. 12. Such
Sound and Orthodox Conclusions as are of
real Worth and Value; and not <hi>Wood, Hay,
and Stubble, i.e.</hi> unnecessary and useless Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins
or Inferences, muchless such as apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Confront the Faith of the Gospel, and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Lewd and Wicked Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.
<note n="*" place="margin">Colloqu. Mensal.</note> 
               <hi>The Pope</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi>
expresses it) <hi>is for Building up the Church,</hi> ex
Accidentibus, <hi>of Outward things of little value;
but we</hi> (saith he) <hi>Build it</hi> ex Substantia, we
urge those Doctrines which are Substantial,
we press those Practices which are of Moment,
which are Essential to Religion, and have
real Worth and Excellency in them. Thus
we should behave our selves, remembring
that the <hi>Superstructure</hi> ought to be suitable to
the <hi>Foundation;</hi> this being Solid and Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
that must be so too. Briefly, this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Metaphor of <hi>Edifying</hi> or <hi>Building</hi>
(which our Apostle seems much to delight in,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107741:69"/>
as we may gather from his<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xv. 20. 1 Cor. iii. 10. Gal. ii 18. Eph. ii. 22. Col. ii. 7.</note> frequent using of
it) imports no less than an Impartial deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and teaching the whole Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
whether it consists in Fundamentals,
or in such Important and Necessary Matters
as are to be grounded on them, all that our
Hearers are to know, and all that they are to
do, the Whole Will of God, and the Whole
Duty of Man. In a word, to enlighten Mens
Minds, to reform their Lives, to convert Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
from the Errors of their Ways, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and strengthen Converts in the ways of
Truth and Righteousness, by any Holy Arts
and Methods to further the real Good of
Christ's Flock, by any good Means to promote
the Churches Welfare is <hi>to Build it up.</hi> This
is the Divine Architecture, this is the Art of
Spiritual Building. So that if we hearken to
this Proposal, we shall assuredly advance the
Good of the World, and at the same time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
our own Bliss and Happiness. In seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Churches</hi> Good we shall not fail of a
Blessing; and that Charity which raiseth our
Hearts to endeavour the Welfare of the Church
Militant will at last Exalt us to the Glories and
Consummation of the Church Triumphant,
when <hi>they that be wise shall shine as the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Firmament, and they that turn many
to Righteousness, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>

            <p>

I proceed now to the next thing propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Means</hi> in order to this Noble End
which I have been speaking of, and that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in those words, <hi>Seek that ye may excel.</hi>
Take care to fit your selves for this Grand Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of building up the <hi>Church,</hi> which
is <hi>the House of God, 1 Tim. iii. 15. 1 Pet.</hi> iv. 17.
Passionately desire and endeavour that you

of the Choicest Gifts, and strive to possess

must strive to be Masters of all those Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Qualifications which tend to Edification,
and to arrive to what Perfection we can in
them. In short, seeing the Edifying of the
Church is the proper Office of an Evangelical
Minister, he must make it his great Business
to pursue this effectually, and to Excel in it by
such Means and Methods as these,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Prayer:</hi> Which seems to be here sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107741:70"/>
in the word <hi>Seek.</hi> This <hi>Excelling</hi> and
this <hi>Edifying</hi> must be <hi>sought</hi> at the Hands of
God by humble and earnest Addresses. If
<hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> were<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xxxi. 3, &amp;c.</note>

<hi>Holy Spirit</hi> that the Apostles and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
are endued with eminent Abilities for the
Service of the <hi>Spiritual and Mystical Tabernacle.</hi>
And if we are convinc'd of this, we cannot
but see it necessary to apply our selves to this
Sacred Author and Donor of all those Gifts,
whereby we may be made capable of serving
the Church of God. You know whose words
those are,<note n="†" place="bottom">

which is given to me, as a wise Master-builder
I have laid the foundation.</hi> And if it be by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace and Bounty, then we know whose
work it may properly be said to be; and
therefore in the foregoing Verse he tells them
they are <hi>God's Building;</hi> it is from Him that
they make any progress in Christian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Goodness, in Faith and Holiness.
To this Great Operator and Architect we are
therefore to repair, and to implore his Aid

are not able to effect any thing in this great
and weighty Undertaking without his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

and Blessing; at least, we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <hi>above all things pray that the Gates of Light
may be opened to us,</hi> that we may have a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Divine Understanding, whereby we
may be taught to teach others. <hi>Building up of
others,</hi> as well as of <hi>our selves, in the most holy
Faith,</hi> must be joined with <hi>Praying in the Holy
Ghost, Iude ver.</hi> 20, 22, 23. We may observe
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> is frequent in <hi>Prayer,</hi> that he may
be assisted in his Ministerial Employment,
and he is often requesting others to pray for
him, that his Labours in the Gospel may prove
really Advantageous and Successful. This is
that which <hi>We</hi> also are concerned in, if we
expect any Blessing on our Enterprizes. We
must remind those who are the peculiar Charge
of our Ministry to solicite Heaven in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half;
and we must with singular Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Earnestness beg the Divine Aid our
selves. If thus with the devout Supplications
of others we join our own fervent Petitions,
we shall certainly Prosper, we shall derive
the Grace and Blessing of Heaven upon us in
the Performances and Offices belonging to
our Calling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To this first Method of <hi>Edifying</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:107741:71"/>
and <hi>Excelling,</hi> we must add that Apostolical
Direction to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him to all the
Spiritual Instructors in the Church, <hi>Give at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
to Reading, 1 Tim,</hi> iv. 13. Diligently
peruse the Law and the Prophets, be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in the Writings of the Sacred Volume.
Though <hi>Timothy</hi> was an Inspired Person, yet
he is commanded to read the Scriptures, and
<hi>to give attendance to them;</hi> which is the same
with that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> (where<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the
same <hi>Greek</hi> word is used, and
therefore might have been rendred as it is
here) <hi>To take heed to,</hi> viz. <hi>the more sure word
of Prophecy, 2 Pet.</hi> i. 19. The word denotes
great Attention and Application of Mind, and
obliges us to be very Careful and Diligent in
consulting these Sacred Oracles. Nor are
Other Books excluded here, nay, they are
partly meant, as <hi>Historians, Moralists, Poets,
Orators,</hi> and other Humane Authors. For it's
likely the Apostle's Advice here was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to his own Practice, who reckon'd
his <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Parchments</hi> (which some think
to be the same, because the Antient Books
were made of <hi>Skins</hi> or <hi>Parchments,</hi> and roll'd
upon a Cilinder, as our <hi>Maps</hi> are) as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to him as his <hi>Cloak</hi> in Winter, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 13.
What <hi>these Books</hi> were I have no <hi>Catalogue</hi> to
tell me, but I know of some others that he
dealt in, as those three Poets, <hi>Epimenides, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi>
and <hi>Menander,</hi> the quoting of which he
thought not unworthy of an Inspir'd Apostle
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107741:72"/>
And he was not only Skill'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets
and other Good <hi>Greek Authors,</hi> that wrote in
Prose (for if he was Curious to read the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
it is not to be questioned but that he was
acquainted with the latter) but he had Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers: For he sat at the
Feet of <hi>Rabbi Gamaliel,</hi> who was a Famous
Doctor of the Law, Nephew of the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Hillel,</hi> and Prince of the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> by
whom this his Scholar was created a Member
and an Elder of that Renowned <hi>Councel;</hi> as
the Learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> affirms, who was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary
sufficient to make it good. This
Great Apostle tells us himself, that he was
<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. i. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Exceedingly zealous of the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Fathers;</hi> he had a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
desire to be acquainted with the Antient
Doctrines and Customs of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and
accordingly he searched into the <hi>Talmudick</hi>
Writings; and there it was that he found the
express Names of two of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
<hi>viz. Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> and hath left
them upon Record in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 8. From these
Hints we may guess what other <hi>Authors</hi> he
was versed in, and how he came by his Polite
Learning, and by that which was Severe, and
how exactly he was fitted to be a Doctor of
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi> both: Which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
demonstrated from his Profound
<hi>Epistles,</hi> which speak him a Master of <hi>Logick</hi>
and <hi>Oratory,</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Eloquence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:107741:72"/>
Nor was it thought in the succeeding Ages
of the Christian Church that this sort of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments
was unworthy of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Ministers; nay, it was reckon'd to be of
great Use and Advantage. Whence it was
that <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, by a Decree, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
Christians the Reading of <hi>Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi>
giving this reason for it, that they
by the studying of these Writers, would
know how to Wound the Pagans with their
own Weapons. And on other Accounts it
might be shew'd, that Prophane Writers are
serviceable among Christians. There is no
sober Man will give heed to that strange Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> who dreamt that an Angel
Scourg'd him for Reading <hi>Tully's Orations,</hi> and
other good <hi>Latin Authors,</hi> as if to be a <hi>Cicero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
and a <hi>Christian</hi> were inconsistent. It is
enough to say that it was a <hi>Dream,</hi> and that
his composed Thoughts, when he was awake
and throughly sensible, corrected such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Fancies, and represented to him
how useful some of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Writings are,
and that a Man cannot understand the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Texts of the Old and New Testament,
without some Skill and insight into them.
How requisite the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
are to a Christian Divine, is shew'd by
<note n="*" place="margin">Cont. Faust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I. 13. c. 15.</note> St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and other Antient
Fathers, who particularly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to us the Usefulness of this
sort of Learning in Sacred Studies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:107741:73"/>
But our Chief Converse should be with the
<hi>Bible:</hi> This we should constantly look into,
and be always perusing. <hi>Why do you not spend
all your time, in which you are not employ'd in the
Service of the Church, in reading this Book especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally?</hi>
said a very Pious<note n="*" place="bottom">Ambros. Offic. 1. 20.</note> Bishop, treating of the
Office of a Clergy-Man. Concerning <hi>Basil</hi>
and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> we are told by<note n="†" place="bottom">Eccles Hist. I. 2. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus,</hi>
that for Thirteen Years together they
laid aside all Books that treated of Secular
Matters, and applied themselves wholly to the
Reading of the Volumes of the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
This most truly may be said, that
though we are not to neglect other Writings;
yet <hi>these</hi> are indispensably <hi>Necessary,</hi> and we
must lay aside all other Books rather than not
find time to read These. And the Reason is
plain, because no Man can pretend to Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Studies, who hath not acquainted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the Sacred Text. For see how it is
in Other Arts and Faculties; there are Books
proper and peculiar to them, and without
which there is an utter despair of attaining any
Skill in them.</p>
            <p>Thus to offer one Example only, the <hi>Civil
Law</hi> is gain'd by Reading the <hi>Digests</hi> or <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dects</hi>
(of which the <hi>Institutions</hi> are an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract)
compiled out of the Immense Volumes
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers, some of which were
Writ before our Saviour's Time, and others
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107741:73"/>
afterwards; and they are no other than the
Sayings, Responses and Decisions of the Chief
of the Learned in the Law; by reading the
<hi>Code,</hi> which is made up of the Rescripts, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Constitutions of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi>
and their Wise <hi>Councel,</hi> from <hi>Adrian</hi> to
<hi>Iustinian.</hi> (So that this Volume differs from
the <hi>Pandects,</hi> as among us the <hi>Statute-Law</hi> or
Acts of Parliament differ from the <hi>Common-Law,
i. e.</hi> the Judgment of Lawyers, call'd
<hi>Reports.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Pandects</hi> must give
way to the <hi>Code,</hi> this being more Valid than
they, as the <hi>Commands of Princes</hi> are of greater
Force than the <hi>Dictates of Lawyers</hi>): More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
by reading the <hi>Authenticks</hi> or <hi>Novels,</hi>
called so because they were New Laws added
to the other: Lastly, by looking into the
<hi>Feuds, i.e.</hi> the Customs and Services for the
Lands held by Vassals of their Lords, which
last Volume of the Imperial Laws was not
added till about the Year 1150. under the
Emperor <hi>Frederick Barbarossa.</hi> There is an
utter Despair, I say, of gaining any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Knowledge in this Excellent sort of
Learning, unless a Man peruses these Books,
and the Commentators on them. And so in
the Study of <hi>Physick,</hi> no Man can arrive to
any Perfection in it, unless he be conversant
with the <hi>Particular Authors,</hi> whether Antient
or Modern, that are Famous in the Faculty.
And the same may be said of all other Arts
and Sciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:107741:74"/>
But this is in a special manner true in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi>
the Knowledge of which no Man can
possibly reach, without a diligent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Perusal of the Books which Constitute
the <hi>Holy Canon,</hi> the Writings of the <hi>Old</hi> and
<hi>New Testament;</hi> for both are necessary, as we
see plainly in the Quotations out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
which we meet with in the latter. There
are Four and twenty Books of the one cited
or referr'd to in the other, and out of<note n="*" place="bottom">Genesis <hi>and</hi> Exodus.</note> some
of them there are above Forty; out of<note n="†" place="bottom">Psalms <hi>and</hi> Isaiah.</note> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
above Sixty Passages alledged and made
use of. The <hi>Bible</hi> then is a Volume of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Necessity, and cannot be out of the Hands
of one that is devoted to the Ministry. For
this cause it was heretofore ordered, that this
Sacred Book should be read at Bishops and
Priests Tables even at Dinner; and still there is
a perpetual Obligation on those of the Sacred
Function, to give themselves daily to the Study
of the Scriptures, the Divine Writings of <hi>Moses</hi>
and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the Books of the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists</hi>
and <hi>Apostles.</hi> And there is good reason
for it, because they must <hi>Build</hi> (which is the
thing we are now speaking of) by a <hi>Rule;</hi>
and the Scripture is that <hi>Rule.</hi> But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
we should make use of it to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
unless we be very well acquainted with
it. We cannot Regulate our own or other
Mens Actions by this <hi>Canon,</hi> we cannot Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107741:74"/>
apply this <hi>Rule,</hi> this <hi>Square,</hi> if we be not
very conversant with it, and have a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of its Excellent Doctrines and Precepts.
These are the Writings that have this Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
and Matchless Character, That <hi>they are
able to make us wise unto Salvation, 2 Tim.</hi>
iii. 15. for (as it follows) <hi>All Scripture (i.e.</hi>
all Holy Scripture, which he had mentioned
in the Verse before) <hi>is given by Inspiration of
God, and is profitable for Doctrin, for Reproof,
for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness;
that the Man of God</hi> (the Minister of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel)
<hi>may be perfect, throughly furnish'd unto all
good Works,</hi> may be enabled to perform all the
Parts of his Duty, more especially those which
appertain to his Sacred Calling.</p>
            <p>Besides, on other accounts the Scriptures
are to be admir'd, and to have the preference
to all other Books whatsoever. The Great
Admirers of <hi>Homer</hi> tell us, That they find all
things in his Poems; what is Excellent in any
Art or Profession is to be met with there.
But upon better grounds I could make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that the Writings I am speaking of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that Character and Testimony. There
is no Man of clear Reason but is fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that there is more Undoubted <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
more Excellent <hi>History,</hi> more profound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
more delightful <hi>Eloquence,</hi> more Choice
<hi>Learning of all sorts</hi> in the Bible, than in any
other Writings extant in the whole World.
There need then no Elaborate Perswasives to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107741:75"/>
read this Sacred Volume, which is the best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heaven, not only in respect of <hi>Divine</hi> but
<hi>Humane</hi> Literature (and that of all kinds) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it. Even as to this latter, there is
none can be said to be an Accomplish'd <hi>Scholar,</hi>
if he be not acquainted with this Book.</p>
            <p>Next to the Infallible Records of <hi>both Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
the First and Antientest <hi>Fathers</hi> of the
Church call for our Esteem and Enquiry.
Antiquity in Monuments is Venerable; in
Religion it should be much more so. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
corroborates the Civil Rights and
Tenures; I see not why it should not fortify
the Ecclesiastical. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> are Great
Names, and will ever be so in the True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church; but yet they ought in some
respects to Veil to those Greater and Earlier
Lights of the Church, <hi>Ignatius, Iustin Martyr,
Iren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>us, Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Tertullian, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
and others of the Antients, from whom
we learn what Defections there were from
the Truth, what were the Errors, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
and Corrupt Practices of the First Ages
of Christianity, and how the Virgin Purity
and Simplicity of the Church were almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
by them. Especially from those that
were the Learn'd <hi>Apologists</hi> in those Times,
and afterwards, who Asserted Christianity
against the <hi>Iews</hi> on one hand, and the <hi>Pagans</hi>
on the other, we may in a great measure dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what is Orthodox and Authentick, and
what is of a different Nature. And it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107741:75"/>
to infer hence, that the Church at this
day should for the most part be Defended and
Vindicated by the Writings of those who
were its <hi>First Defenders,</hi> they being so Great
Judges of the Primitive Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To <hi>Reading</hi> I must necessarily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
<hi>Meditation;</hi> both which perform'd by
due Turns, is properly <hi>Studying.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this is of singular Use: we cannot more
effectually fit our selves for our Great and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Work that we are call'd to, than by
serious, and sober Reflections on our Minds,
by Sifting and Examining our Notions, and
observing what Conformity they bear to our
Unprejudiced Faculties; by being intimately
acquainted with our Thoughts, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our selves to a familiarity with Rational
and Solid Principles, and by causing them to
bring their utmost Aids to Support and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Articles of Christianity. Our Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will be of little use without this; for it is
by Pondering on the things that we have
Read, and by Comparing them among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that we are able to digest our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to arrive to the true Understanding
of Matters propounded to us. The Royal
Psalmist's Experiment concerning himself is
worthy of our Observation, <hi>I have more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
saith he, <hi>than all my Teachers; for
thy Testimonies are my Meditation,</hi> Psal. cxix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
99. I find a mighty Increase and advance in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107741:76"/>
Divine Knowledge, because I use my self to
a serious Contemplation on those Heavenly
and Sublime Truths, and thereby I am ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of penetrating into the profound Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of them, and to discern those wonderful
things in them which are hid from others.
We may take notice, that after many season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Instructions and Precepts given by St.
<hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> his Faithful Assistant in the
Work of the Gospel, he adjoins this, which is
of as great use as any of the rest, <hi>Meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these things, 1 Tim.</hi> iv. 15. And so again,
after several Pious Admonitions and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
he adds, <hi>Consider what I say, 2 Tim.</hi>
ii. 7. Which Advice reaches all of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s
Character, and is as much as if he had said,
Revolve these things often in your Minds,
and let this Charge which I leave with you
be continually in your Thoughts. Accustom
your selves to <hi>Thinking,</hi> and know that it is
the part of a Christian, as well as of a Man:
but especially it is an indispensable Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a Publick Instructer, in one that is to
Amend and Rectifie the Sentiments of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
If therefore we are desirous to attain
to any Improvement and Excellency in our
Ministry, we must not herd with the Crowd,
but retire from it, and hold converse with
our own Minds, and thereby Teach and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
our selves, and so we shall be fit to do
the same to others: Which is the next thing
I shall treat of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:107741:76"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another way whereby we are to
<hi>Edify</hi> the Church, and <hi>Excel</hi> in it, is the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of <hi>Preaching,</hi> or (as the Apostle stiles it)
<hi>Prophesying.</hi> He gives this the Precedence to
all the other Gifts which he mentions either
in this or the Twelfth Chapter of this Epistle.
<hi>Covet earnestly spiritual Gifts, but rather that ye
may Prophesy.</hi> This is that Endowment which,
according to him, makes most <hi>for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry,
and for the Edifying of the Body of Christ.</hi>
which Character shews it to be this Gift which
I'm now to speak of. This is a Complicate
Office, and contains many Excellent things
in it; as first, the Informing of Mens Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and setting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them into Right Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
concerning things in Religion.
The Leading Requisite, as I conceive, in a
Preacher, is Orthodoxy. He is to be one that
owns those Principles and Articles of Faith
which have been always profess'd by the
Universal Church. Let us not assume the
Title of <hi>Protestants,</hi> and yet reject some of
the Great Heads of Divinity which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
by all Sober Persons of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
Let us not say we are of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> and yet deny some of the
Chief Doctrines contain'd in her <hi>Articles.</hi> Let
us not profess our selves to be Ministers of the
Word, and yet renounce those Truths which
are formally contain'd in it, or are according
to it: For either Express words of Scripture,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107741:77"/>
or Natural and Plain Consequences from it,
are to be the Standards of that Doctrin which
we deliver.</p>
            <p>It is required of us not only to Establish
<hi>Truth,</hi> but to Detect and Confute <hi>Falshood</hi>
and <hi>Heresy,</hi> therein following the Example of
those Great Men, <hi>Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,
Theodoret.</hi> And truly this is become
necessary in this Extravagant Age, where so
many Wild Notions are entertain'd, and so
many Old Errors revived. The Christian
<hi>Structure</hi> cannot but be expos'd to great Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
and Dangers, when its <hi>Foundations</hi> are
Undermined by some, and its <hi>Superstructure</hi>
hath continual Batteries made against it by
others. In such Circumstances how Careful
and Watchful should we be? How Vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Concernedly should we act? Like those
<hi>Builders</hi> at the Restauration of the <hi>Iews,</hi> with
a <hi>Trowel</hi> in one hand, and a <hi>Sword</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
We must be in a Defensive and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Posture at once, securing and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apostolical Faith, and grappling with
the Opposers of it at the same time. But yet
I must insert this Caution, That we ought
carefully to avoid all Unnecessary Disputes,
for nothing is more unbecoming a Preacher
of the Gospel, and nothing doth more hinder
the Success of his Ministry. Accordingly we
may observe, That <hi>the Doctrines which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
questions,</hi> are opposed to <hi>Godly edifying,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Tim.</hi> l. 4. We shall effect but little in our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107741:77"/>
Employment if we indulge Controversies,
and delight in Quarrels, and promote Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies
and Perplexities in Religion. Our task
is to avoid these with all care, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our Hearers with the Necessary Doctrines
of Christianity, such as depend not on the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Deductions of Men, but are fixed and
unmoveable, founded on the Holy Oracles,
and deliver'd by Christ Jesus and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
            <p>Again, a Minister and Guide of Souls is not
only to rectifie Mens Judgments, and to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
them in the Necessary Articles of Religion,
but further it is required of him, that he take
care of their Lives and Manners. For though
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Epist. l. 4.</note> True Notions of Religion and Godliness
are to lead the way, yet to make
a Man Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and Complete there must be Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Life. Nay indeed, unless this latter
be look'd after, the former will soon decay.
By Unholiness and Wickedness we see often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that Men Hazard their Principles. If
the Practice be Debauch'd, if the Life be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
if the Manners be depraved, there will
be a Corruption in the Judgment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we that are Dispensers of the Word,
ought to be as concern'd for Practical Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107741:78"/>
as for Truth of Doctrin. We ought
not only to Instruct our Hearers in Right Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
but with all freedom to reprove their
Sins and Vices, and pathetically to Exhort
and Perswade them to all Vertue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
remembring always, that a Holy and
Exemplary Conversation is the True <hi>Edifying</hi>
of the Church; yea, 'tis the very Top-stone
of the Building. It is not meer Speculation
or bare Discourse that will atchieve this great
Work. This is as if a Man should undertake
to Build a House by Contriving it in his Head,
or by Talking of it. It is the utmost Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a Christian, to Live according to his
Excellent Principles. And consequently it is
the chief Business of a Preacher to beat down
all Immorality, Wickedness and Prophaneness,
and to set up and promote whatever is Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Laudable, and especially to advance
the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Vertues and Graces, and such
Duties as are more especially commanded by
Christ and his Apostles in the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
And this very thing shews the Excellency of
our Office, when it is rightly discharg'd; for
the Worthiness and Esteem of Employments
are according to the Usefulness of them. Thus,
to instance in other Faculties, he is the Best
<hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yer</hi> that most successfully directs Men to
the Securing of their Estates and Properties;
and he is the Best <hi>Physician</hi> that saves Mens
Lives. So it is here, he is the Best <hi>Divine,</hi>
he is the Best <hi>Preacher</hi> that reforms Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107741:78"/>
and effectually shews them how to save
their Souls. The True <hi>Preaching</hi> is to answer
to <hi>Prophesying</hi> in the Primitive Church, which
is the thing more particularly design'd in the
Text, by <hi>Excelling to Edification;</hi> and this you
find was esteemed by the Apostle as the Best
and most Valuable Gift, because it was most
Advantageous to the Church: <hi>He that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieth,</hi>
saith he, <hi>speaks to men to Edification, and
Exhortation, and Comfort,</hi> 1 Cor. xiv. 3. This
is the proper Task of the Evangelical Preacher,
<hi>viz.</hi> not only to Build Men up by Instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in their Holy Faith, but by Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Exhortations to the Practice of all Christian
Vertues to make them Better, and to enable
them to feel the Comfort and Satisfaction of a
Religious Life.</p>
            <p>In Order to this, his Instructions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
must be Plain and Intelligible, and
easy to be comprehended. We read of some
<note n="*" place="bottom">Euseb. Eccles. Hist.</note> 
               <hi>Hereticks</hi> of old, that were wont to use a
great deal of <hi>Hebrew</hi> in their Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and in their Discourses to the People,
thereby to Astonish and Amaze the Vulgar.
But he that would Preach so as to Edify,
must not use any such Arts; he must not soar
above the Capacities of those that hear him.
Or, if any one will needs call this <hi>Building,</hi> it
is like that of <hi>Babel,</hi> where they understood
not one another. We justly Condemn the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107741:79"/>
               <hi>Papists</hi> for Praying in an unknown Tongue;
but let me be so free as to say, that to Preach
in a Stile which is not understood by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is every whit as unlawful, and as absurd,
<hi>Therefore thou, O Man of God, flee these things,</hi>
and let the Great <hi>Apostle</hi> be thy Example,
Who<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 19.</note> 
               <hi>would rather speak five words to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,</hi>
and to Edify others, than utter <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi>
which could not have that effect upon
them. The<note n="†" place="bottom">2. Kings iv. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Prophet</hi> shrunk himself into the
proportion of the Child he meant to revive:
And so must Spiritual Instructers and Publick
Exhorters to Vertue deal with those they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to recover out of their Sins wherein they
are dead, they must adapt themselves to their
Measures, they must suit themselves to their
mean Understandings, and condescend to
their Weaknesses, and often Inculcate the same
Divine Lessons, therein having regard to the
Forgetfulness as well as the Ignorance and
Shallowness of their Common Hearers.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Mode</hi> of delivering our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
whether by Book, or without, that
is of the meanest Consideration, and no Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Person will be very solicitous about it,
so it be Grave and Proper. Certainly it is not
Necessary we should commit every Sermon
to our Memories: Such perpetual Conning is
too like a School-Boy's Task, methinks; as if
our Auditors were <hi>Pedagogues,</hi> and we stood
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107741:79"/>
in continual Fear of the <hi>Ferula,</hi> if we should
not have all our Lesson by Heart. Much less
is <hi>Preaching</hi> a needless Mustering up of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi>
an unmerciful haling of the <hi>Fathers</hi> out
of their Graves to no purpose, a rude claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Acquaintance with <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
for the sake of a Sentence or two out of
them. It is not pleasing the People with
Little and Trifling things, or astonishing them
with too Great and High ones. Nor is it yet
any thing made up of an Affected Tone or
Gesture, or any thing of that sort. But (as
I represented it) it is a sober informing of
Mens Judgments, and establishing them in
the Grand Points of Religion; it is a plain and
bold rebuking of Vice, and a warm Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to Vertue; it is an affectionate Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Truth to the Hearts and Lives of the
Hearers. This is <hi>Preaching,</hi> and thus the
<hi>Church</hi> of Christ is <hi>built up;</hi> thus this Great
Pile is raised, and reaches with its utmost Top
even to Heaven, where it is Triumphant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In the next place I must not forget
to add, that we are to mind those things also
which respect the <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> the
<hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of the Church. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
its Solemn <hi>Censures</hi> were Instituted by
Christ and his Apostles; that if there should
happen any Dilapidations in the Building of
the Church, it might by these be speedily
Repair'd, that Persons of Unholy and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd
Lives might be debar'd Communion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107741:80"/>
with so Holy a Society. And the Laws of
<hi>Decency</hi> were prudently design'd to extirpate
all Confusion and Distraction, and to render
the Church and all its Services Beautiful and
Venerable. The Apostle concerning his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
of <hi>Colosse,</hi> professes, that <hi>he rejoiced in
beholding their Order, Col.</hi> ii. 5. A <hi>Military</hi>
word, and signifies the orderly disposal of
Soldiers in an Army. Such should be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Marshalling of the Church Militant. It
is requisite for its Security and Welfare, that
all keep their proper Ranks and Stations, and
that a <hi>Decorum</hi> be every where observ'd. We
find that Circumstances as well as Substantials
are to be look'd after; the Apostle in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh
Chapter of this Epistle controuls the
Solecisms of their External Behaviour in the
Service of God. He checks their Rudeness
and Irreverence, and gives Rules for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Deportment and Carriage in Praying
and Prophesying. It is fit that some care
should be taken of Religion's Outside, that
she have a comely Equipage. Decent and
Fitting Circumstances are the <hi>Wall</hi> about the
Spiritual Building; they are the <hi>Hedge</hi> about
the Field of the Church, which contributes
much to her Preservation and Welfare. It
is such a Fence to her as the <hi>Bark</hi> is to the
Tree, which, when it is utterly neglected,
the Fruit, and sometimes the Tree it self, is
endangered. Even those things which are
but Accessary and Accidental to Devotion,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107741:80"/>
are of great use; and the Devotion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
themselves would not be long kept up
without these.</p>
            <p>But let us remember that they are but <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi>
and <hi>Appendages,</hi> and that the things
which we are chiefly to be concern'd for in
Religion are of an higher Nature, and that
the Mind is principally to be employ'd here.
The main care in God's Worship must be,
that it be Spiritual and Sincere, that the Heart
be rightly disposed; for this is the Sacrifice
which he chiefly requires and regards. All
must be so done in his Service, that the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of Christianity be not abated, that
Real and Internal Religion be not diminish'd,
and that the Visible Face of it be never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Vitals and Spirit of it. Let Religion
outwardly appear as comely and beautiful as
the Rules of Christian <hi>Edification</hi> will allow,
but by no means let her exceed in Ornament
and Bravery; for she will soon vanish when
she grows Pompous, and runs into External
Shew and Pageantry.</p>
            <p>With Decency and Comeliness are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
coupled <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Concord;</hi> and these
we are to be concern'd for likewise. It is the
Harmony and Uniformity of the Parts of a
Building that makes it both Beautiful and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Without this it would not be a well-ordered
Edifice, but a confused Heap. And
'tis certain, that by our love of Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
we shall successfully contribute towards
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107741:81"/>
the Building of the Church: For there is Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
enough to convince us, that the Antient
Hereticks and Schismaticks betray'd the <hi>Faith</hi>
when they destroy'd the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the Church.
At the same time that they made a Breach in
her Walls, they undermined her Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It behoves us of the Clergy, then to
maintain mutual Amity and Agreement both
among our selves and others. It is high time
to banish all Dissention, to put a Period to all
our Animosities and Vain Janglings, to doat
no longer on Fruitless Disputes, but to pursue
the One thing Necessary, and to imbrace our
Religion with an Entire Affection, and to
commend it to the World by our Practising
of it.</p>
            <p>And so I pass to the last thing which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to Name, Seek that ye may Excel in
a Holy Life. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Visitation Sermon</hi>
to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> enjoins
them <hi>to take heed to themselves,</hi> as well as <hi>to all
the Flock, Acts</hi> xxviii. 28. And he commands
<hi>Timothy</hi> to be <hi>an Example of the Believers, in
Word, in Conversation, in Charity, in Spirit,
in Faith, in Purity, 1 Tim.</hi> iv. 12. And more
briefly, <hi>ver. 16. Take heed unto thy self, and to
thy Doctrin, i.e.</hi> to thy Life, as well as to thy
Preaching. And he charges <hi>Titus,</hi> That <hi>in
all things he shew himself a Pattern of good Works,
Tit.</hi> ii. 7. As there is a Special Designation
to the Office of the Ministry, so there must
be a Special Holiness accompanying it. There
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107741:81"/>
must be a <hi>Consecration</hi> of their Lives, as well
as of their Persons. As their Function Exalts
them above others in Dignity, so they should
surpass them in all Laudable Actions; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those words used by our Church in her
<hi>Canons,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Can. 75.</note> 
               <hi>They must have always in mind that
they ought to Excel others in Purity of Life, and
should be Examples to the People to live well and
Christianly.</hi> Let not that which was part of
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> Character be fastned on them,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. xxiii 3.</note> 
               <hi>They say, but do not,</hi> they Preach well, but
Live not accordingly. Let not that which
the Apostle saith of Seducers and False Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
be applied to them,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Tit i. 6.</note> 
               <hi>They profess that they
know God, but in works they deny him.</hi> If they
be Guilty of this latter, they pull all down
that they have Built, they render all their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
Admonitions, Reproofs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
ineffectual, <hi>they obstruct the Truth in</hi>
or <hi>by their Vnrighteousness</hi> (for so <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 18.
may be read according to the sense of the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;) they <hi>hinder</hi> the Force and
Vertue of the <hi>Truth</hi> on themselves, and the
Propagation of it to others by an Impious Life,
yea, they take a course to Ruin Religion it
self. Thence it was the usual Speech and
Maxim of the Learned and Pious Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
The Exemplary Vertue of the Clergy must
restore this Church.</hi> It is that must commend
us to the Hearts and Consciences of Men, it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107741:82"/>
is that must powerfully Influence upon them,
and teach them to be Religious in good Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.
A Minister cannot chuse a more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
way of prevailing with others to be
God, than by letting them see that he is so
himself. But on the contrary, 'tis no marvel
that the Sheep wander, if the Shepherd strays.
Every ones Eyes are upon their Guides; all
Men are looking up to these Stars, these
Torches of the World: If they burn dim, it
will be observ'd, and, which is worse, it will
be Imitated. It is observ'd by a <hi>Traveller</hi> of
good Repute, that <hi>Atheism</hi> thrives in <hi>Italy,</hi>
because they see so much of the Cheats and
Juggles of many of the <hi>Priests,</hi> and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is all their Religion. Wherefore let it
be known by our Exemplary Lives, that we
are not enclined to gratifie Atheists, and to
promote Irreligion in the World: Especially,
let it be seen that we act not out of Worldly
Designs, that we make not the Ministry a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Calling, but that our Principles are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and that we do all for the Glory of our
Great Master. In brief, one of our Character
should, like <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, be
<note n="*" place="margin">John v. 35.</note> 
               <hi>a Burning and a Shining Light;
Burning</hi> in his own Breast with entire Flames
of Goodness and Devotion, with pure Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Honouring God, and Promoting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and <hi>Shining</hi> in his Life and Actions by
an Uniform Practice of Piety, by an Holiness
that is conspicuous and resplendent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:107741:82"/>
Indeed, some of us are apt to entertain this
False Apprehension, That the things before-mention'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> Right Opinions, Preaching
of True Doctrin, Conformity to the Church's
Order and Discipline are sufficient, though
they be abstracted from Holiness. Thence
some labour to be accounted Orthodox, and
yet mind not their Lives: They teach others
what they are to do, but are regardless of
their own Actions. They are hot for Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
but cool and indifferent in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Religion. But nothing can be more
unreasonable and absurd, for the things before-named
are in order to a Holy Life. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
tendency of the Articles of Faith is to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
The Exercise of Discipline, and
the keeping up of Decency and Order, were
originally designed to beget and nourish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Vertue. Let us therefore Correct our
Conceptions concerning these Matters, and
perswade our selves that a Vitious Life is as
contrary to God and Religion as Erroneous
Doctrines; that to break one of the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
is as bad or worse than to deny an
Article of the <hi>Creed;</hi> that Drunkenness, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Uncleanness, are as black Crimes as
Schism. Yea, let us be convinced, that by
Prophaness and Wickedness the Comliness of
our Worship is rendred Deformed, our most
Decent Rites become Sordid, our White Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are Stain'd and Polluted. Let us fix
upon our Minds that of the Devout Abbot of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107741:83"/>
               <hi>Claraval, What will our Canonical Ordination
profit us if we live Vncanonically?</hi> To be sound
in the Faith, to Preach it to others, to be
Peaceable and Orderly, and to observe the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Rules and Laws are of no worth and
value if our Lives be Impure and Irregular.
Wherefore (to sum up all in a few words) let
him that earnestly contends for the Faith, for
the Order and Discipline of the Antient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
think himself obliged also to live the
Life of a Primitive Saint.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You see your Calling, Brethren;</hi> you see what
is your Office, your Work, your Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and you cannot but see that it is of
Singular Weight and Consequence, and such
as is not easily to be performed. The Fable
goes of <hi>Amphion,</hi> that he did but play on his
Lute, and the Stones presently came together
of their own accord, and raised the Walls of
<hi>Thebes.</hi> There is more to be done in the
<hi>Building</hi> that I have been Discoursing of, in
the Erecting of the Walls of the Spiritual <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
It is a Work of great Difficulty, and
requires exceeding great Skill and Pains. It
is the Office of the Person, whose Character I
have been giving you, to teach and live well, to
be acquainted with the True Notions of things,
and to frame his Words and Practice suitably
to them; to maintain the Antient Orthodox
Faith, and to be<note n="*" place="margin">Tit i. 9.</note> 
               <hi>able by sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
both to exhort, and to convince
the Gain-sayers;</hi> to keep the Old Heresies from
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107741:83"/>
reviving, and to stifle the Modern Follies and
Fancies; dexterously to reclaim the Erring
World, manfully to confront the Disorders
of a degenerate Age; to confound the Atheist,
and vanquish all his Absurd Reasonings against
his Maker; and to Exalt the Best Religion,
and cause it to Prosper and Flourish in the
World; finally, to bear up the Pillars of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
by Pure Doctrin, Strict Discipline,
and Stricter Example and Conversation; and
to let the People see in him, as in a Mirrour,
what they are to do, and how to Order their
Lives.</p>
            <p>Who now is not ready to infer, that so
Weighty a Function, requires such<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim ii. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that need not to be ashamed?</hi>
Every <hi>Block</hi> will not make a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>

            <p>IF some of you, upon the reading of these
words, shall put the same Question to
me that the <hi>Ethiopian Eunuch</hi> did to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,
Of whom speaketh the Prophet this?</hi> you
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107741:85"/>
may soon have this Demand assoiled by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
the Context and Neighbouring Verses.
There you will see is foretold the Ruin of <hi>Tyre,</hi>
a City in <hi>Syrophoenicia,</hi> one of the three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Syria.</hi> There is described the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of that Great and Famous City, so
noted for <hi>Trading</hi> and <hi>Merchandizing,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed the Great <hi>Empory of the World.</hi>
This whole Chapter, wherein my Text is, is
no other than a Passionate <hi>Lamentation</hi> of the
Destruction of that Place. You will find this
expressed according to the usual Skill and Art
of <hi>Orators,</hi> who are wont to comply with
that Maxim, that Contraries being set one
against another are the more advantageously
display'd and illustrated. The Riches of <hi>Tyre</hi>
inhanse her Ruin, and her Ruin discovers her
former Riches and Greatness. Accordingly
this Chapter consists of these two Principal
Parts, <hi>1st.</hi> A Description of the former Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Glory of that City, (from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Chapter to the <hi>26th ver.) 2dly.</hi>
Its unavoidable Ruin and Destruction, with
the sad Allarm it gives to other Nations and
Neighbouring Countries (from the <hi>26th ver.</hi>
to the End of the Chapter.)</p>
            <p>I begin with the First Division of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which compriseth in it the Former Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Grandeur of <hi>Tyre:</hi> And there these
Five Topicks are remarkable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> Her Fit and Convenient <hi>Situation,</hi> at
once both <hi>Lovely</hi> and <hi>Vseful, ver.</hi> 3, 4. She
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107741:85"/>
was inviron'd with the <hi>Waters,</hi> and all the
Compass of that Great City was but as one
Main Port. Like a <hi>Promontory</hi> it stood into
the <hi>Sea,</hi> and so was Commodious for Resort
unto from divers Countries. But besides the
Natural Commodiousness of its Situation,
here is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Described her <hi>Naval Force</hi> (in the
five next Verses.) The sum of all that is said
there is This, That she was famed for Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Shipping, that the Vessels she sent Abroad
for Trafick were bravely Adorned, that their
Tackle was Rich and Costly, their <hi>Sails</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not of plain Canvas, but of <hi>fine Linnen
Embroider'd,</hi> as if with that Finery and Gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they would seem to Court the Winds, and
make them pliable and favourable to the
Passengers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> You read in the two next Verses of
the <hi>Military Glory</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> her Strength and
Ability to grapple with a considerable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
The Strongest and Stoutest Nations
came thither, and <hi>hung up their Arms</hi> as in a
Garison: They were Trained and Tutored
here, and were in Pay under these Noble <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
The <hi>Persians, Lydians,</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi>
were all glad to be Listed and Entertained
Soldiers under them. The<note n="*" place="margin">à <hi>Gon ed,</hi> cubiius.</note> 
               <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madims</hi>
(or, according to the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Latin,</hi> the <hi>Pygmeys) were in
their Towers:</hi> The meaning of which proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
is this, that the Tallest of these Foreign
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107741:86"/>
Soldiers, or of the Martial <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
themselves seem'd to be of a very Low
Stature, when they were beheld out of those
High Towers. Or, they might be called
<hi>Gammadim, Elbow-Men,</hi> because they were
Strong and Robust in those Joints, their Arms
and other Limbs were well set.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> Their <hi>Negotiation, Merchandize</hi> and
<hi>Trafick</hi> with other Nations, and consequently
their Wealth and Riches are most excellently
deciphered from the 11th Verse even to the
25th. So large is the Description of that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<hi>Mart,</hi> that Catholick <hi>Fair,</hi> to which
all Countries resorted, and kept up a General
Trade and Commerce. As their <hi>Soldiers</hi> so
their <hi>Chapmen</hi> came from far Countries. All
People, whether of the Isles or the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
flock'd hither to vend or exchange the
<hi>Wares</hi> which are reckon'd up in this Chapter.
We read that <hi>Hieram,</hi> a former King of this
Place, and of all <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> was a Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizer
by Sea, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ix. 27, 28. So that we
need not wonder at what is said here, that
<hi>the Merchants were Princes.</hi> And that all that
Country was Famous for this way of Trafick
is attested by<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 5 p. 217.</note> 
               <hi>Diodore</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and by
<note n="†" place="bottom">In Homer. Odys. O.</note> 
               <hi>Eustathius,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>But from the Huge <hi>Bill of Trade</hi> which you
meet with here I might take occasion by the
by to enter this Caution, that we are not to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107741:86"/>
imagine that Trafick and Commerce are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
and that Merchandizing is in it self
Blameable and Vitious. No; it was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for very Useful and indeed Necessary Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of Man's Life. If it lie under any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses,
these ought to be corrected, and not
the Thing it self to be condemned. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<hi>whipp'd the Buyers and Sellers,</hi> but it was
because he found them in the <hi>Temple,</hi> which
was not a fit place for them, and because (as
we are told by the<note n="*" place="bottom">Selden de Dis Syr. Syntag. 2.</note> Learned) <hi>those that sold
Doves</hi> were reckon'd by the <hi>Iews</hi> as Infamous
Persons, in the same Rank with Gamesters,
Panders, and Thieves. <hi>Tyre</hi> is threatned here
to be Punished, not for her <hi>Merchandize</hi> and
<hi>Fairs,</hi> but for her Abusing them. And so
much for the Fourth Topick remarkable in
the Description of the Flourishing State of
<hi>Tyre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Particular remains, which is the
<hi>5th</hi> and last, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Renown</hi> which that Great
City had gain'd among all Nations, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Applause which it had purchased, <hi>ver.
25. Tyrus</hi> was not only Rich and Happy at
Home, but grew Famous and Eminent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and nothing now could be added to
her Glory.</p>
            <p>But Sin and Vice deform and discredit any
Place, and fit it for <hi>Ruin.</hi> And so now I am
to pass (but loth I am to do it) from the <hi>former
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107741:87"/>
Felicity</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> to her <hi>present Misery and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;</hi>
(and this is enlarg'd upon from the
25th Verse to the End of the Chapter.) Her
<hi>Overthrow</hi> is represented in an Excellent <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,</hi>
in <hi>v.</hi> 26. [<hi>Thy Rowers have brought thee
into great Waters, the East Wind hath broken
thee in the midst of the Seas.</hi>] <hi>Tyre,</hi> that was
so brave and stately a Ship, richly Laden and
well appointed, is now miserably Cast away.
<hi>Thy Rowers,</hi> that is, thy Rulers and Great
Ones, have brought thee to this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and now leave thee to suffer Shipwrack.
Both they and thou must perish, and sink
into the Deep. <hi>The East Wind hath broken
thee,</hi> that Wind being most Tempestuous and
Dangerous in that Country: Or <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
that Blustering Prince, is here meant,
who lay East from <hi>Tyre,</hi> and came thence and
destroy'd it. And this Metaphor of a <hi>Broken
Ship</hi> is fitly continued in the next Verse, the
Words which I have chosen to entertain you
with. I might observe to you here, that this
is no Unusual <hi>Similitude,</hi> and that the Poets
and Orators are much in love with it. It
would savour too much of <hi>School</hi> to repeat
<hi>Horace</hi> his<note n="*" place="margin">Ode 14.</note> Verses, wherein he Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
compares <hi>Rome</hi> to a <hi>Vessel on
the Main.</hi> And if you consider that these <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
were Situated on the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and
so were in the constant sight of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and
daily beheld their own and others Ships riding
on the <hi>Waves,</hi> you will not then deny that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107741:87"/>
This Comparison and Allegory are most fitly
here applied. And I might further Embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
this, by observing to you that in the <hi>Old
Coin</hi> of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> there was a <hi>Ship</hi> stamped;
and their common Brag was, that they were
the First Inventors of Shipping, the First Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of Navigation.

and Shipwrights employ'd in the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thy Vessels) <hi>and the Occupiers of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
(i.e.</hi> all thy Chapmen, and Fellow-Traders
and Merchants) <hi>and all thy Men of
War that are in thee and in all thy Company</hi>
(these are not <hi>Men of War</hi> in the <hi>Naval</hi> sense,
but they are Soldiers and Warriors on Land)
<hi>all these shall fall into the midst of the Seas in the
day of thy Ruin</hi>]; <hi>i.e.</hi> they shall utterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and sink like a laden Vessel to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107741:88"/>
of the Deep. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> shall come
and Invade them, and lay them wast. And
it follows in the 28th Verse, <hi>The Suburbs shall
shake at the sound of the cry of thy Pilots,</hi> which
most elegantly and Poetically expresseth the
Horrid Noise and Outcry of the perishing <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
(as indeed the Stile of the Prophet in
this Chapter is not inferiour to the best of
Poets.) The three insuing Verses relate the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment</hi>
which other Nations that traded with
them shall have of their Ruin, which is sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
up in those few words (comprehending
all that had been said in the <hi>Antithesis</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Chapter concerning their Preceding
Glory and Present Misery) <hi>v. 32. What City is
like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the Sea?</hi>
What City was like <hi>Tyrus</hi> once for its Riches
and Commerce, for its Military Force, Fame
and Renown? And what City like <hi>Tyrus</hi> now
for its sudden but inevitable Calamity? She
sat like a Lady, abounding in Bravery and
Luxury, encircled with all manner of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Felicity, but now she is robb'd of all her
Gayety, strip'd of her Glory, and clothed
with nothing but Shame. The <hi>Fairs</hi> are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the Wares are rifled and carried away,
and her End is most Miserable and Deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
which you will find inlarged upon to the
close of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>It is high time now, after this Brief Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
on the whole Chapter, to confine my
self and my Discourse to the Words which I
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107741:88"/>
first read unto you: On which we may
ground these two Propositions, 1. That all
Warlike Provision shall prove Successless, all
Weapons Useless and Insignificant in the hands
of a Sinful People. <hi>All thy Men of War shall
fall into the midst of the Sea.</hi> 2. Decrease of
Wealth and Riches, Decay of Trade and
Merchandising, and consequently Scarcity
and Penury are the Judgments which a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Nation may expect. This Proposition is
derived from the Front and the Close of the
Text, <hi>Thy Riches, thy Fairs, and thy Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
shall fall into the midst of the Sea in the day
of thy Ruin.</hi> Thy Domestick and Foreign
Trade, thy Commerce at Home and Abroad
shall Decay and Die. This is the Proposition
which I intend to insist upon, as most suitable
to our present purpose, and the Occasion of
our Meeting here. That we may not find
the Real Experiment of This Observation in
the Land of our Nativity is the design of what
I am to deliver to you this day. And to that
end let us earnestly supplicate and implore the
God of Heaven, that it may make such an
Impression on our Hearts and Lives, that we
may never Actually feel and suffer what I
am to treat of.</p>
            <p>This is the main thing, I say, which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in the Text, that the Decay of Trade
and Trafick, and consequently Poverty and
Scarcity are one kind of Judgments which,
amongst others, are inflicted on a Sinful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107741:89"/>
Thus it was with <hi>Tyre,</hi> the Famous
<hi>Tyre,</hi> the Make and Situation of which place
seem'd to render it altogether Impregnable. It
was built on a Rock, and there had its<note n="1" place="bottom">

in the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and it is likely the Prophet
<hi>Zachary</hi> alludes to this in his 9th Chap.<note n="2" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> a strong Hold.</note> v. 3.
<hi>Tyre</hi> was not only surrounded and guarded
by the Sea, the Waves whereof stood up as
in a Body to protect and defend it, but the
Garisons and Redoubts which they had erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within made the place almost Unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Thus both the Natural and Artificial
Structure of it concurr'd to let in Riches and
Prosperity, and to keep out Want and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
and by both to make them Happy.
Yet behold! when by the Abuse of their Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Prosperity they grew Loose and
Wanton, and unworthily provoked Him
who was the Donour of those earthly Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
then Poverty like an Armed Man broke
in upon them, and they were not able to
withstand his Assaults. First, <hi>Tyre</hi> was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
by <hi>Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> and that in a short
time after this Prophesy; and though it held
out Thirteen Years (as<note n="3" place="bottom">Antiqu. Jud. l. 11. And Cont. Apion. l. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Iosephus</hi> relates) yet
at last it was taken, and laid wast: This Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the effect of which lasted about<note n="4" place="bottom">Isai. xxiii. 17.</note> Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107741:89"/>
Years (the time of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Captivity,
and the very same time that Theirs was)
made them not Better, for the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
saith concerning this City,<note n="1" place="bottom">Isai. xxiii. 17.</note> 
               <hi>She shall turn to
her hire, and commit fornication with all the
Kingdoms of the World.</hi> Therefore most justly
did God visit them a second time, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Diodor. Sic. l. 17. Plutarch vit. Alex. M. Curtius l. 4.</note> in the
days of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> who made way
through the Sea to them, and by unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Labour and Toil, by a Bridge of Stones
which he had amassed together in the Deep,
he reached them at last, and miserably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
them. Thus in a sense more Literal
than perhaps you imagined, <hi>all their Men of
War did fall into the midst of the Sea.</hi> Some
think the Destruction of <hi>Tyre</hi> by the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
was foretold in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 23. 1. where by <hi>the
Land of Chittim</hi> is meant <hi>Macedonia,</hi> others say
<hi>Cilicia,</hi> whence <hi>Alexander</hi> came to them. This
Great Warrior killed<note n="3" place="bottom">Arrianus.</note> Seven or eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
in the Siege, which lasted Seven Months;
and after the Siege, when the Fury of the
Slaughter was over,<note n="4" place="bottom">Diodorus. Curtius.</note> Two Thousand of the
Inhabitants were Hanged up and Crucified,
and Thirteen thousand were made Captives
and Slaves. Thus <hi>Tyre</hi>'s <hi>Riches and Fairs
and Merchandise fell into the midst of the Sea,</hi>
were utterly consumed and destroyed, <hi>in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107741:90"/>
day of her Ruin;</hi> and she felt the Fatal Doom
and Judgment of <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> xviii. 11.
<hi>No man buyeth their Merchandize any more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will give you a Brief Account of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in these Three Particulars; <hi>First,</hi>
Sometimes <hi>in the Nature of the thing it self</hi> it
so happens that Poverty and Scarcity, and
Decrease of Trading are the Products of Sin.
Some Vices there are which of themselves
stop the Course of all Trafick, and drag Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury
and Want along with them, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
plunge Men into a Necessitous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Is it not evident that Prodigality and
Luxury, Revelling and Rioting, Pride and
Idleness, Whoredom and Adultery by their
own proper Efficacy and malign Influence
blast the fairest Estates, and throw Men into
the most Lamentable and Miserable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances?
as I shall have occasion to shew you
more largely anon. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That a Sinful
and Rebellious Nation should be despoiled of
its Riches and Plenty, happens not only in
the nature of the thing it self, but <hi>by the Iust
Iudgment of God</hi> upon Sinners. And you
will confess this to be Rational, if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Grounds why God is pleased to bless
a People or Person with the Affluence of
Wealth and Worldly Goods, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
may use them to the setting forth of his Praise
and Glory, that they may make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the designs of Vertue and Religion,
that they may by Them serve their Maker
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107741:90"/>
with a chearful and contented Spirit, that
they may be encouraged to do Good and to
communicate, and that they may by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the Good things of this World lay
up for themselves a Treasure in another, even
in the Mansions of Eternal Glory. To such
worthy purposes as these doth the God of
Heaven bestow Earthly Riches and Plenty.
If then we frustrate all these noble Designs,
and by the worldly Blessings conferr'd upon
us dishonour our Great Benefactor, and make
our Wealth and Abundance administer only
to the promoting of Wickedness and Vice; if
thus we pervert the Intentions of the Donor,
it is but just that we should be deprived of
them, and left in a Poor and Forlorn Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Now</hi> you may expect to hear the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
say, [<hi>I will take away my Corn and my
Wine, my Wooll and my Flax,</hi> Hos. ii. 9.] <hi>Mine</hi>
they are, and to <hi>my Glory</hi> they ought to have
been employed; but since <hi>they are not,</hi> I will
strip the Possessors of them, and leave nothing
but Want and Penury in their room. It is
the Blessing of the Lord that maketh Rich,
and if we will not study to gain that Blessing
by consecrating our selves and services unto
Him, it is no wonder that we lie under the
Curse of Poverty and Necessity. If we will
not faithfully serve God, he will not suffer us to
be serviceable to our Selves. If we forget and
despise Him, he will give us over to a neglect of
our own Concerns and Interest. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107741:91"/>
inflicts This Judgment on a Wicked and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
Land, because it is the Basis and
Groundwork of many Other Calamities. If
Trafick and Commerce, if Plenty and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
fail, a whole Train of Evils will soon
follow. So that this is a Curse which is big
with many more, and those as Dreadful as it
self: and therefore this is a most proper Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for an Ungrateful and Disobedient
People.</p>
            <p>Having thus given you a short Account of
the Remark which I made upon the words,
I am to shew you now of what Great <hi>Vse</hi> it
may be in our Lives and Conversations, which
is the chief thing I intended.</p>
            <p>1. This informs you what is the Great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of a Nation, what is most Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Profitable to a People, even with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the things of This Life. <hi>Godliness
is</hi> their <hi>greatest Gain,</hi> it having the Promise
of This Life as well as of that to Come. The
Poets feign, and fancifully tell us, that their
<hi>God</hi> wooed in <hi>Gold,</hi> and descended in such a
<hi>Glistering Showr.</hi> Certain it is, and out of
the reach of all Fiction, that with <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Religion</hi> we shall be blessed likewise with such
a Portion of <hi>Riches</hi> as shall be most service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to our best Ends. God oftentimes
showrs down <hi>Wealth</hi> with a plentiful Hand
on his Friends and Favourites. You see then
the true way and Method of <hi>Prospering</hi> in the
World. If you fear God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107741:91"/>
you shall be recompensed with
the good things of this Life. A Person or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that sincerely endeavours to purchase
True <hi>Wisdom</hi> (which consists in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Holiness) shall find that
<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. iii. 16.</note> 
               <hi>in her left hand are Riches and
Honours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thank God that you have so long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the Blessings of <hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Trafick:</hi> Bless
his Holy Name that you are not deprived of
these Earthly Benefits and Favours, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Forfeiture you have made of
them by your repeated Provocations, by your
multiplied Enormities, and Rebellions against
God. Yet,</p>
            <p>3. You are invited from what hath been
said to observe God's Hand lifted up against
you. Though he hath not utterly Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
this Nation, yet it can't escape your
Notice that he hath brought it Low, and by
many Passages and signal Acts of Providence
hath designed to Humble it. Let us acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Tokens of his Wrath and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and tremble at the various Instances of
his Displeasure. Look back and forget not how
God hath dealt with you heretofore; he hath
held the point of the <hi>Sword</hi> to your Breasts;
he hath blown upon you with Infectious and
<hi>Pestilential</hi> Vapours; he hath singed and
scorched you by a Dreadful <hi>Fire.</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
call to mind this last, and remember how
the Great Metropolis of this Nation, the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107741:92"/>
Royal Chamber, the Universal Exchange for
Trafick, was by a most astonishing Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
laid in Ashes in four days. I mention
this the rather because I look upon it as one of
the Greatest and Notablest Instances of God's
consuming the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Merchandize</hi> of a
People <hi>in the day of their Ruin</hi> that ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd.</p>
            <p>4. Be reminded by all this to <hi>hearken to the
Rod, and who hath appointed it,</hi> to call your
Sins to remembrance, and to amend your
Lives for the future. For This, this alone will
either prevent the like Judgments and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
hereafter, or it will shield you from the
Evil of them. This will guard you against
your Enemies Swords, this will be a Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
and Antidote against the Pestilence,
this will be your Skreen against the Flames:
In brief, this will succeed and prosper all your
Secular Enterprizes, secure and increase your
Incomes, restore and establish a Free Trade
and Commerce, crown you with Plenty and
Abundance, and drive away Distress and
Indigence from your Doors. As you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
then to avoid the Judgment which my
Text tells you of, as you consult your Profit
and Advantage in this World, as you are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>to buy and sell, and get gain,</hi> as you wish
for Earthly Happiness and Success, as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to Thrive in all your Negotiations and
Traficks, be careful that you addict not your
selves to any known Vice, that you shun all
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107741:92"/>
the Paths of Sin and Wickedness, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
let me request you to renounce those
Lusts which do more immediately and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
call down this Punishment which is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
in the Text, and which it is likely were
the Cause of the Decay of <hi>Tyre</hi>'s Riches and
Merchandize.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then, <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleness,</hi> the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Source of all Poverty, must be banished
and discarded. <hi>He that is slothful in his work,
is brother to him that is a great waster,</hi> saith the
Great Master of Oeconomicks and Politicks,
<hi>Prov.</hi> xviii. 9. <hi>He becometh poor that dealeth
with a slack hand, but the hand of the diligent
maketh rich,</hi> saith the same Inspired Author,
<hi>Prov.</hi> x. 4. Which is expressed in other words
in Chap. xiii. ver. 4. <hi>The soul of the sluggard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth,
and hath nothing, but the soul of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
shall be made fat.</hi> The meaning is that
Poverty is the Fruit of Idleness, but God will
give a Blessing to Industry and Diligence,
and Families and Kingdoms thrive by this
means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the usual Companion of Idleness
is <hi>Pride,</hi> and that likewise must be discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
if ever you hope to prosper in your
Worldly Affairs. The <hi>Tyrians</hi> were a very
Proud and Haughty People, as appears from
<hi>Ezek.</hi> xxvii. 3. <hi>Thou sayst, I am of perfect beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
And in the next Chapter it is recorded
not only of the <hi>Prince of</hi> Tyrus, <hi>that his heart
was lifted up, and he said he was a God, and sat
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107741:93"/>
in the seat of God;</hi> but of the People it is said,
<hi>Their heart was lifted up because of their Riches,
ver.</hi> 25. And they were not only conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their <hi>Beauty, Preferment</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> but
their Extravagant Vanity and Pride of <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi>
may be guess'd from their Fantastick and
Gaudy Trimming of their Ships, which this
Chapter mentions. They that were so Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and Profuse in decking their Vessels, were
questionless as Lavish in adorning themselves.
And perhaps <hi>Tyre</hi> was more than ordinarily
proud of its <hi>Purple,</hi> for which it was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
for on this shore were gather'd those
<hi>Shell-fishes</hi> the liquor whereof made that Noble
Colour wherewith the Robes of Emperors and
Senators were died. I have heard some say,
that this sort of <hi>Pride</hi> is a Friend to <hi>Trade</hi> by
the New Fashions and Modes it daily invents:
but I can assure them on good Grounds that
in the close it rather causes the decay of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
and is the readiest way to introduce Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
and Beggery; for <hi>Pride of Habit</hi> is the
Mother of Idleness, Luxury and Wantonness,
and these are usually maintain'd and upheld by
Fraud, Deceit, Lying, and Theft, which are all
destructive things. Do we not daily see (and
may we not lament it?) that many to indulge
and satisfy their Pride, neglect their Lawful
and Honest Callings, and by that course ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves and Families to Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?
May we not see others (and we
need not go far to spy them) who are so lavish
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107741:93"/>
in their Garb and Apparel, that it is to be
thought their almost starv'd Bellies cry shame
of their Pride?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Intemperance</hi> and <hi>Excess in Eating
and Drinking</hi> are Sins which in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
prove the Overthrow of the Wealthiest
and most Thriving People. Before <hi>Babylon</hi>
was taken by <hi>Cyrus</hi> it is observed by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian,
that<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Xenophon.</note> they spent whole Nights in
Drinking and Debauchery. Where this Vice
prevails and gets the mastery, all Serious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
is laid aside, and Gratifying the
Wanton Appetite is the only Business and
Dispatch. Now no other Penalty can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
to be the result of This than what the
Wise Man hath awarded, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxiii. 21. <hi>The
Drunkard and the Glutton shall come to Poverty.</hi>
How often is the indulging of Superfluities
punish'd with the Want of Necessaries? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Provision makes way for None at all.
May it not too frequently be observ'd in Great
Cities, that the <hi>Dining Room</hi> empties the
<hi>Shop;</hi> the <hi>Overloaded Board</hi> impoverisheth
the <hi>Counter,</hi> and the <hi>Table</hi> devours all the
<hi>House?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The inseparable attendant of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury
is <hi>Lewdness</hi> and <hi>Vncleanness;</hi> and I wish
the lamentable Experience of this Age did
not too notoriously verify what I am to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107741:94"/>
to them, That<note n="*" place="bottom">Tob. iv. 13.</note> 
               <hi>in Lewdness is Decay and
great Want; for Lawdness is the Mother of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
Or hear what a more Authentick
Writer saith,<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. vi. 26.</note> 
               <hi>By means of a whorish woman a
man is brought to a piece of Bread.</hi> The Lowest
and Vilest Condition is the just Reward of so
Abominable a Sin. If you would then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
your Temporal Good, and advance even
your Secular Welfare, you are concern'd to
use all Holy Arts to guard your selves against
this Vice, and the rather because it is now
grown so Fashionable, and in this degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Age of ours brought into Repute and
Credit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Perswade your selves that all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi>
and <hi>Extortion</hi> (although they may seem
to be Thriving and Profitable for a time)
shall at last redound to your greatest Loss and
Damage even in this World. Where-ever
these are practised, they will certainly end in
the Ruin of the Persons, Families or Nations
that are guilty of them. You read that this
was part of the Complaint against <hi>Tyre,</hi> That
<hi>by the multitude of her Merchandize she filled the
midst of her with Violence, Ezek.</hi> xxviii. 16. As
they were Great Traders, so they were Great
Oppressors, and by being the former they
learnt to be the latter, that is, they found they
had great Opportunities of Defrauding and
Exacting, and they made use of them. But
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107741:94"/>
my Text tells you what was the direful Issue
of this, it ended at last in the Destruction of
all Trade and Commerce, and in the Ruin
of the whole Nation. Thus it was with the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> when <hi>they swallowed up the Poor, and
made the needy of the Land to fail;</hi> The Prophet
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. viii. ver. 4, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Amos</hi> lets them know, That <hi>the Land shall
tremble for this, and every one shall mourn that
dwelleth therein, and it shall rise up wholly as a
Flood, and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by
the Flood of Egypt;</hi> alluding to the River <hi>Nile,</hi>
which used to ascend with Violence, and
overflow the Fields of that Country. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Aphorism of that Infallible Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whom I have so often cited,<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xxii. 16.</note> 
               <hi>He that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the poor to increase his Riches, shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come to want.</hi> Assure your selves that all
your Revenues and Incomes which are gain'd
by the Cries of Widows and Fatherless Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
will never prosper. But rather expect
that for your being Hard-hearted to the Poor,
and denying them what is due to their Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitous
Condition, you shall one day come to
Poverty your selves; or if <hi>you</hi> escape, your
<hi>Posterity</hi> shall bear your Punishment.</p>
            <p>Again, as Oppression towards Man, so <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi>
towards God will bring a Curse upon
your Estate. Never think to Thrive by that
Trade and Trafick which Intrench upon
God's Holy Day and Worship. Let me tell
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107741:95"/>
you, by Prophaning the Christian Sabbath,
you set your selves back for the whole Week.
It is just with God to Curse you in your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Six
Days labours, when you will not devote your
selves to him on the Seventh, which he hath
Blessed and Hallowed to himself. If your rob
God of <hi>his Due,</hi> he may justly permit others
to purloin <hi>from you.</hi> If you be <hi>neglectful of
God's House,</hi> why should you look that he will
<hi>prosper you in yours?</hi> If you will not find <hi>Time
for God,</hi> how can you hope to have <hi>any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
to your selves?</hi> If your cry be like that
of the prophane and wordly <hi>Israelites, Amos</hi>
viii. 5. <hi>When will the New Moons and Sabbaths
be over, that we may set forth Corn and Wheat,
that we may buy and sell, and get gain?</hi> Never
hope by that Buying and Selling to be real
Gainers. In short, if you wholly slight the
Things of Heaven, you must not expect to
prosper in your Earthly ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Love of the World</hi>
(which yet perhaps you can hardly imagin)
do oftentimes prove the Bane of Worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and Profit. Some Avaritious Persons
are like those foolish Animals which love to
steal Money, only to Hide it. Their Ambition
is to Hoard up great Treasures, and make
their Gold and Silver as useless as they were in
the Mines. He is as truly Poor, that hath
Much, and Useth it not, as he that hath No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
His Blessing is turn'd into and absolute
Curse, and the more he Possesseth the less he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107741:95"/>
Enjoyeth. Besides, how often doth it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that the Covetous and Ravenous Desires
of Worldly Men are blasted by the just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God? As our Saviour observes of the
<hi>Sodomites,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Luke xvii. 28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>They bought, they sold,</hi>
and then <hi>it rained Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
from Heaven, and destroy'd them
all.</hi> They were over-eager and busie about
their Earthly Affairs, they were wholly swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up of the World, and then no wonder
that the Divine Vengeance baffled their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
and Enterprizes.</p>
            <p>And thus you see <hi>what Sins</hi> they are which
either in their own Nature, or by the just
Hand of God, undermine the Temporal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
and Prosperity of a Nation. You see
<hi>what Vices</hi> are likely to Impoverish and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust
a People: and I doubt not but most of
these were instrumental in the Destruction of
<hi>Tyre.</hi> The Design of this Discourse is, that
they may not be so of <hi>England.</hi> That Place
and This run parallel in many things; I pray
God they may not also in their Ruin. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is seated in the Waters, and imbraced in
the Arms of the Sea, as <hi>Tyre</hi> was, for she was
an Isle before <hi>Alexander the Great</hi>'s time,
who with almost incredible Labour join'd it
to the Continent, that he might the more
easily come at it and conquer it. <hi>Tyre</hi> was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
for its Delightful and Happy Soil, in
so much that the Inhabitants of it are said to
<hi>be in Eden the Garden of God, in Paradise,</hi> as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107741:96"/>
the LXX render it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxviii. 13. And
this Country of ours on the same account hath
been taken of old for the <hi>Fortunate Islands.</hi> It
is divided from the World, as being a more
Noble and Worthy Part: It seems to thrust
the rest from her, as if she were a World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her self. That Antient flourishing City
seated on the <hi>Phoenician Sea,</hi> was deservedly
reckon'd the Greatest Mart and Empory of
that part of the Universe: Thither were
brought the Riches of all <hi>Asia, Europe</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica.</hi>
In this also <hi>Britain</hi> resembles her, and
was justly stiled by <hi>Charles the Great</hi> the Store-House
and Granary of the Western World.
The Great City of this our Isle may be call'd
the <hi>Mart of Nations,</hi> as <hi>Tyre</hi> is, <hi>Isai.</hi> xxiii. 3.
It may deserve that High Character which is
given in<note n="*" place="bottom">ver. 8.</note> the same place, <hi>The Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
City, whose Merchants are Princes,
whose Trafickers are the Honourable of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you resemble <hi>Tyre,</hi> but O may ye
never do so in her Desolation and Final Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity!
The <hi>Tyrians</hi> heaped up all their Vast
Stock, and amassed together their Prodigious
Riches and Treasures for the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> O
that We may not by our Crying Sins and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
call in as Merciless Enemies to seize
on us, and devour us! Let us remember
that after so many Mercies and Deliverances
vouchsafed to us, our Destruction must needs
be exceeding Great. Let us read and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at our Saviour's words in <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 21, 22.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107741:96"/>
               <hi>Woe unto thee Chorazin, woe unto thee Bethsaida,
for if the mighty works which were done in you had
been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say
unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
at the day of Iudgment than for you.</hi> And
we of this Nation are like those <hi>other</hi> People
whom our Saviour mentions in that place; like
<hi>Capernaum</hi> we have been <hi>exalted unto Heaven</hi>
by the Enjoyment of the Gospel, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
affluence of all other Blessings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may expect to be <hi>brought down to
Hell</hi> for our shameful Unthankfulness and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence.
Our Sins are far greater than those
of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> than those of <hi>Capernaum</hi> and
<hi>Bethsaida.</hi> Yea, <hi>Sodom</hi> was burnt to Ashes
for the very Sins that reign amongst us, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Pride and Fulness of Bread, Idleness, and
Oppression, and Uncleanness. But these are
more Heinous in us, than they were in them,
because our Mercies have been far Greater.
What therefore remains now but that we
find our Punishment to be far more Grievous
and Intolerable? Though we are yet a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet know this that the Judgments of
God will certainly visit us, unless we reform
our Lives: And know withal, that they
will be the Heavier the longer they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.
<hi>Nineveh</hi> was destroy'd Forty Years
after its Repreive. About the same space of
Time, or longer, stood <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in a flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishing
Condition after Christ's Passion and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107741:97"/>

            </epigraph>
            <p>WE read in the beginning of this
Chapter, that four <hi>Assyrian
Kings,</hi> or Petty Princes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in an Hostile manner
Invaded some parts of <hi>Palestine,</hi> fought with
the five <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Governors</hi> that were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107741:98"/>
concern'd in those Places, and in a
pitch'd Battle defeated them, and put to flight
the remaining part of the Army. In the heat
of their Conquest they came to <hi>Sodom</hi> and
plunder'd it, and carried away all the Goods
and Provisions of that City: And more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
it is recorded, that <hi>Lot, Abraham</hi>'s Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
was taken Prisoner by them, and all
his Goods made a Booty. The Tidings of
which being brought to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolv'd to rescue his Nephew in a like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and hostile manner as he was taken away.
For he had <hi>Trained</hi> Men of his own, such as
he had Disciplined in Feats of <hi>Arms,</hi> in order
to their being capable of defending themselves,
and assaulting their Enemies if there should
be occasion. It appears from this place that
this Holy <hi>Patriarch</hi> had brought up his House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
to handle their Arms, that if he and
they should be Invaded by Sons of Violence,
they might be <hi>able,</hi> and have <hi>Skill</hi> too to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themselves, and to Annoy the unjust Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors.
These <hi>Trained,</hi> these <hi>Instructed</hi>
Men he now actually <hi>Arms,</hi> and puts them
upon Service; and he took Others to assist
him in this Expedition, <hi>viz.</hi> some of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of that Country, as may be gather'd
from <hi>ver.</hi> 24. He march'd himself at the
Head of these Forces, and overtook the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and vigorously engag'd them, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
them, and brought back those that were
taken Captive, and among the rest his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107741:99"/>
and regain'd all the Booty and Prey
which had been taken from them.</p>
            <p>And that you may know that this was a
Lawful Act, and a Laudable Enterprize, you
find this Renowned Warrior at his return
from the Battle entertain'd by the <hi>Priest of
the most High God.</hi> The Famous <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,
King of Salem,</hi> went out to meet this
Conqueror, and shew'd his Approbation of
what he had done by a double Testimony;
First, as a <hi>King</hi> he nobly Regail'd him, <hi>he
brought forth Bread and Wine, ver.</hi> 18. He
generously and liberally Treated him and his
Trained Soldiers after the Fatigues of War,
thereby shewing how well he resented that
Brave Military Action. And then secondly,
as he was a <hi>Priest, he Blessed him, ver.</hi> 19.
And it is observable that the <hi>Blessing</hi> hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
respect to that Warlike Expedition, and
the Success of it: <hi>Blessed be the most high God,
who hath deliver'd thine Enemies into thy hand,
ver.</hi> 20. Whence it is manifest that when
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his Confederates return'd from
the Victory over the Four <hi>Eastern Kings</hi> that
had Sack'd <hi>Sodom,</hi> the Fact was approved of
by God's High Priest. And moreover, the
Legitimacy and Goodness of it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the Behaviour of the Generous
<hi>Patriarch</hi> himself, who (as it is expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded)
<hi>gave Melchisedech Tithes of all, v.</hi> 20.
He presented him with the Tenths of the
Spoils which he took in that War; hereby
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107741:99"/>
assuring us of the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of <hi>War</hi> on just
Occasions. For it is certain he would not have
offer'd to God and the High Priest the <hi>Tenths</hi>
of what he had taken in the Fight and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,
if that Enterprize had not been justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(as on the other hand God's Priest would
not have accepted of that Present, if it had
not been so.) So then, from this Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Example of the Holy Patriarch, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Faithful, and from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of it, which commend it to us, I will
offer this Proposition to you, and insist upon
it, That on just occasions it is Lawful, and even
Necessary to go to War.</p>
            <p>We read nothing of any Military Exploits
before the <hi>Flood;</hi> Scripture is altogether silent
as to that, though we cannot thence conclude
there were no Wars in those days: But we
are informed that <hi>afterwards</hi> there were; and
the first Instance is that which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the Kings of the <hi>East</hi> Warring
with the Kings or Rulers of the Five Cities in
<hi>Canaan.</hi> And the first Good Man we read of
that Exercised in Military Fears, and Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up his Family to them was <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
Friend of God. The Peaceable <hi>Abraham,</hi>
who meekly yielded to his Nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between
thee and me, and between my Herdsmen and thy
Herdsmen, Gen.</hi> xiii. 8. and accordingly let
him take his Choice of what Ground he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for Pasturage: This Condescending Man,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107741:100"/>
who was of so Excellent a Temper, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
from his Right, though he was the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet when this very same Kinsman of his
was taken Prisoner, and his Goods and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
carried away by Force, he thought this
was a good and sufficient occasion for taking
up of Arms, and he let the World see that
<hi>Peaceableness</hi> is not inconsistent with a <hi>Iust
Quarrel;</hi> he Arm'd his Houshold, and with
them and Auxiliaries whom he had in the
Neighbourhood, he follow'd after the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and rescu'd <hi>Lot</hi> out of their Hands, after
a Bloody Encounter. The Holy Patriarch
and Father of the Faithful was a Warrior.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Iacob,</hi> his Grandson, who was a Meek
and Patient Man (of which there are several
Proofs in the History of his Life) tells us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
That <hi>he took a portion of land out of the
hand of the Ammorites with his sword and with
his bow, Gen.</hi> xlviii. 22. He speaks of the <hi>Land</hi>
which <hi>Abraham</hi> had purchas'd of <hi>Hamor</hi> the
Father of <hi>Shechem</hi> for a Hundred Pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
designing it for a Burial Place, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
both he and <hi>Isaac</hi> lay buried there;
but afterwards, when this Patriarch had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to remove to some part of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which
was at a considerable distance from this piece
of Ground, some <hi>Shechemites</hi> (of the Race of
the <hi>Amorites</hi>) seiz'd on it, and detain'd it from
the right Owner, <hi>viz. Iacob.</hi> But the Good
Man would not suffer them quietly to possess
and enjoy it; he made use of his Instruments
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107741:100"/>
of War, his <hi>Sword</hi> and his <hi>Bow,</hi> to reduce the
wrongful Possessors, and he regain'd his Right
by Violence; and it is probable sent some to
their <hi>Graves</hi> for their unjust withholding from
him this <hi>place of Sepulture</hi> This shews that
Acts of Violence, and even open War it self
undertaken on good grounds, are not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>And this further appears from the known
Examples of <hi>Moses, Iosuah,</hi> and some of the
<hi>Iudges,</hi> who even by God's Appointment
were Men of <hi>War,</hi> and actually engag'd in
Battels. In the Book of <hi>Iob,</hi> who is thought
to have liv'd about <hi>Moses</hi>'s time, there is an
admirable Description given of the <hi>War-Horse,</hi>
and that by the <hi>Almighty</hi> himself, <hi>Chap.</hi> xxxix.
<hi>ver. 19, 20, &amp;c.</hi> which intimates, yea more
than intimates the Usefulness of that Noble
Creature (if there be Occasion) in Affairs of
<hi>War.</hi> We know that God prescribed the
<hi>Iews</hi> certain <hi>Laws</hi> concerning their <hi>Battels,
Deut.</hi> xx. 10, 15. and therefore the Practice of
them was not displeasing to him. <hi>Captains</hi>
renowned for their <hi>Martial Exploits</hi> are taken
notice of, and mention'd with Honour in the
Sacred Records, as <hi>Iephthah, Gideon, Ioab,
Abner,</hi> and others of King <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Worthies:</hi>
Yea, <hi>Warlike Women</hi> are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mention'd with
Praise in those Inspired Books, and in other
<hi>Iewish</hi> Writings, as <hi>Deborah, Iael, Iudith.</hi>
The Wars of the <hi>Israelites</hi> are call'd <hi>the Wars
of the Lord,</hi> a very High and Honourable
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107741:101"/>
Title, <hi>Numb.</hi> xxi. 14. xxxi. 3. And <hi>the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of the Lord, 1 Sam.</hi> xviii. 7. xxv. 8.</p>
            <p>It is very observable what is said of King
<hi>David, 2 Sam. 1. 18. He had them teach the
Children of Iudah the use of the Bow;</hi> he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Commanders and Officers to discipline
his Subjects, and instruct them in the Arts of
War. I know some would have us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
here by <hi>the Bow</hi> King <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
on the Death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by the <hi>Philistin Archers:</hi> For this
reason, say they, the Funeral Song it self is
call'd <hi>the Bow.</hi> Or, others think it may have
that Denomination with respect to the <hi>Bow</hi> of
<hi>Ionathan, which turned not back from the blood
of the slain,</hi> as the Elegy it self saith, <hi>ver.</hi> 22.
But I do not see any Reason at all for such an
interpretation: If we examine it, we shall
find it to be precarious and groundless; and
therefore I will adhere to the plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Meaning of the Words, which is this,
<hi>David</hi> hearing of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi>'s Death,
lamented them, and gave Order that the Young
Men of <hi>Iudah</hi> should learn the use of the <hi>Bow,</hi>
that they might be avenged on the <hi>Philistins</hi>
who had slain so many of the <hi>Israelites</hi> by their
Skilful and Valiant managing of that <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von.</hi>
Wherefore the Wise Prince would have
his Subjects (for now they are such) to be as
expert in <hi>Archery</hi> as their Enemies; he would
have them to handle their <hi>Arms</hi> with Skill
and Dexterity, especially the <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:107741:101"/>
which were most in use at that time
(as they were indeed among all other Nations
of the World, and even among our Ancestors
in this Country; nay, the Act for <hi>Shooting</hi> is
not repealed at this day) and therefore <hi>the
Bow</hi> or <hi>Shooting</hi> is put here for the Whole <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Exercise. David,</hi> like a Faithful <hi>Friend,</hi>
laments and mourns for the Deceased, but,
like a Prudent <hi>King</hi> (for so we must look
upon him now) takes care of the Living, and
provides for the Safety of the People, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up to Martial Exercises. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
without Skill are useless, nay, they
may do themselves harm, as the <hi>Eastern</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were sometimes destroy'd by their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
Therefore it was wisely taken care of
that this <hi>Iewish</hi> People should be taught their
Military Postures, that they should know the
Word of Command, that they should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
to handle their Weapons aright (for
this is implied in <hi>the use of the Bow</hi>): And this
supposes the Lawfulness of the Military Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
yea, that it is in some Cases Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
as well as Lawful.</p>
            <p>I might mention in the last place the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the <hi>Iews</hi> after their Return from the
Captivity; we read that <hi>one half of them
wrought in the work (i.e.</hi> Building the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
<hi>and the other half held the Spears, the
Shields, the Bow, and the Habergeons, Neh.</hi> iv.
16. And at other times some of the same Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>wrought with one of their hands in the work,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107741:102"/>
and with the other held a weapon, ver.</hi> 17. The
<hi>Sword</hi> was thought to be as useful as the
<hi>Trowel;</hi> The former was necessary to defend
and promote the latter. And thus it was the
Sense and Perswasion of all the Holy and Wise
Men that lived in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> and
before it, that it was Lawful by Military
Force to resist the Enemy; and the most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and Pious Persons practised according
to this Perswasion, they used Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
as proper Means for their Preservation,
though they had the Almighty to assist and
back them, and that in an immediate manner
sometimes.</p>
            <p>Nor is it, or ought it to be otherwise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Gospel;</hi> for even under this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
the Calling, of a <hi>Soldier</hi> is not in it
sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sinful; otherwise this Employment and
the Persons that belong to it, seeing they
are so often mention'd in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
would at one time or other have met
with a Rebuke; but on the contrary, it is
observable that there are very great and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Commendations</hi> of that particular Rank of
Men. There are at least Four <hi>Centurions</hi> or
<hi>Roman Captains</hi> spoken of in the Evangelical
Writings, and all of them are mention'd with
a particular, but just Elogy. The first was
he that humbly besought our Saviour to heal
his Sick Servant; and his Words and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
are such, that our Lord was fill'd with
<hi>Wonder</hi> at them, and at the same time added
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107741:102"/>
this Testimonial, <hi>Verily I have not found so
great Faith, no not in all Israel, Matth.</hi> viii. 10.
He did not Reprove and Condemn this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Man when he heard him say, <hi>ver. 9. I
am a Man under Authority, having Soldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me:</hi> I pay Obedience to an Higher Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
and so am under Command my self; but
I have likewise those that are under my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
who as soon as I give the Word of
Command, fail not to Obey it without the
least delay. Our Saviour did not bid him lay
down his Commission, and quit a Soldier's
Life as Unlawful: No, he rather allow'd of it,
and approved of his Faithful Managing of it.
And at the same time he plainly saw what the
Noble Captain meant by thus displaying his
Military Office and Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> that he
thereby intended to Magnify the <hi>Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
which <hi>Christ</hi> had over all Persons and
Things, and that therefore he was Able to Cure
his Paralytick Servant, who then lay at the
point of Death. This strong and firm Belief,
and this open Acknowledgment of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power</hi> which resided in JESUS, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
Applauded by Him, and he declares
he had not found such a Faith and Confession
among his own People and Countrymen, as
he met with in this <hi>Roman Soldier,</hi> who was
a <hi>Proselyte of the Gate,</hi> a Convert from <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi>
to the Acknowledgment of the True God,
for otherwise he would not have <hi>built the Iews
a Synagogue, Luke</hi> vii. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:107741:103"/>
The next <hi>Centurion</hi> is he that acted the
<hi>Sherifs</hi> part at the Execution of our Blessed
<hi>Saviour,</hi> concerning whom it is particularly
recorded, that upon seeing the Strange and
Prodigious things which happen'd at that
time, <hi>he glorified God, saying certainly this was
a Righteous Man,</hi> Luke 23. 47. or (as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Evangelists) <hi>truly this was the Son of God,</hi>
Mat. 27. 54. So willing and ready was the
Evangelist to tell posterity what were the
Convictions and Acknowledgment of this
military Person, with relation to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
An other <hi>Centurion</hi> is mentioned in the
<hi>10th.</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Acts;</hi> he was an <hi>Italian
Captain</hi> of the Soldiers that belonged to the
Garison at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and became a <hi>Proselyte:</hi>
For which cause he is stiled <hi>a devout Man,</hi>
v. 2. and he had <hi>devout Soldiers</hi> under him,
<hi>v.</hi> 7. The Character of this Man of Arms
is very remarkable, He was <hi>one that feared
God with all his House, who gave much Alms to
the People, and pray'd to God always,</hi> v. 2. Nor
doth this suffice, his Character is touch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
again, <hi>v.</hi> 22. where it is said, <hi>he was a just
Man, and one that feared God, and was of good
report among all the Nation of the Iews.</hi> And
this was he that was so signally honour'd
with a <hi>Vision</hi> in order to his Conversion to
Christianity. But we do not find that he
was warn'd in his Vision to throw up his
<hi>Centurious</hi> place, to relinguish his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Soldier. Nor did St. <hi>Peter</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107741:103"/>
reprove him for being of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Men, or advise him to quit that Post.
But we are sure that he preach'd <hi>Christ</hi> to
him, and that thereupon he embraced the
<hi>Faith,</hi> and was admitted into the Society of
the Faithful by <hi>Baptism.</hi> Some Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Historians mention the <hi>Centurion</hi> at
Christs Passion (of whom before) as a true
Convert to Christianity, and I do not see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reason to disbelieve it: But St. <hi>Luke,</hi> an
Infallible Writer, puts it beyond all doubt
that <hi>this Centurion</hi> we are now speaking of,
was a <hi>Baptized Convert.</hi> This is much for
the honour of <hi>Military Men,</hi> that the first
Persons among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were brought
over to the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith were of that Rank,
that <hi>Soldiers</hi> were the First-fruits of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
among those that had been <hi>Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An other <hi>Centurion</hi> to be named on the
present occasion is own <hi>Iulius, a Centurion of
Augustus's Band,</hi> Acts xxvii. 1. whose singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Kindness towards the Apostle, who was
his Prisoner in his Voyage toward <hi>Rome,</hi> is
expresly recorded, <hi>viz.</hi> that when some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
<hi>to kill</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> left he should escape in
the Shipwreck, this <hi>Centurion being willing to
save him, kept them from their purpose.</hi> v. 43.
Thus the sacred Writers thought fit to take
notice of the <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Convictions,</hi> the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
and <hi>Alms,</hi> and the extraordinary <hi>Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of those of that Profession whom I am dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of, but they never disparage or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107741:104"/>
of the Profession and Calling it self,
but rather, whilst they so often mention the
Persons with Commendation, they tacitly
approve of their Employment.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Wars</hi> were unlawful in the time of
Christianity, then those Soldiers, who came
to <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, and ask't him <hi>what they were
to do,</hi> Luke iii. 14. would certainly have been
advised to lay down their Arms, and leave
off the Military Life, as<note n="*" place="bottom">Ad Marcel, Epist. 5.</note> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> very
well notes upon that passage: But that Holy
Preacher and Reformer, instead of this,
counselled them <hi>to do violence to no Man,</hi> or
(according to the <hi>Greek</hi> more exactly) <hi>to
shake or terrify no Man</hi> (for nothing more
scares and strikes Terror into People than the
Violence of Soldiers) to extort from no Man
Mony or Goods by forcible means, thence the
<hi>Title</hi> in the <hi>Pandects de Concussione: Neither to
accuse any falsly,</hi> viz. in order to Plunder them
and bereave them of their Goods, but <hi>to be
content with their Wages,</hi> with their Pay. This
implies that Soldiers behaving themselves
well, should be Incourag'd and should not be
defrauded of their Allowance. They can't
bear the toil and fatigue of Battel without due
Maintenance. They must <hi>Eat</hi> as
well as <hi>Fight,</hi> yea the same<note n="*" place="margin">Lacham.</note> 
               <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Word signifies both. And when they have
their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (which is a <hi>Latin</hi> word Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciz'd,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107741:104"/>
of which sort there are several besides
this in the New Testament) when they are
pay'd their just <hi>Debentures,</hi> they ought to be
<hi>content,</hi> and not murmure and mutinie. Thus
the <hi>Gospel</hi> hath legitimated the <hi>Military Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,</hi>
and besides, it hath regulated it.</p>
            <p>But some make use of those Words of
Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvi. 52. <hi>Put up again thy Sword
into its place,</hi> as a Prohibition against all
Fighting. To which may be answer'd, that
this is a singular Instance, and therefore
thence cannot be infer'd or prov'd the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Duty of a Christian. Christ would not
let his Disciples fight <hi>at that time:</hi> They
must lay down their Weapons when he was a
to lay down his Life. When there was a
Necessity of his being deliver'd up to the
<hi>Iews,</hi> there was no Resistance to be made.
This was an extraordinary Case, and it doth
not follow hence that <hi>at no time</hi> we may
Fight. Again, it is implied in that forecited
Text that the Apostles sometimes were
Sword-men. <hi>Put up thy Sword</hi> supposes <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had a Sword, and wore it. And indeed
we are told by <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the <hi>Iewish Historian,</hi>
that some parts of <hi>Iudea</hi> were infested with
Highway-Men and Robbers, so that it was
necessary for Travellers to go Arm'd, that
they might defend themselves. Or if any
shall insist on that former place, we may
urge an other, <hi>Luke</hi> xxii. 36. <hi>He that hath no
Sword, let him sell his Garment, and buy one:</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:107741:105"/>
Where our Saviour himself pronounces a
Sword to be more necessary than Apparel,
and that even to the Apostles. Though it
is true these Words of Christ may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in an other Sense; He either upbraids
them for their carnal Fear and Distrust, and
so speaks Ironically, or he hath a Spiritual
meaning, and bids them provide Weapons
of an other sort, as Faith and Patience.</p>
            <p>That the using of Military Force is lawful
seems very clear from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s practice,
<hi>Acts</hi> xxiii. 17, 23. He having notice of the
<hi>Iews</hi> Confederacy against him, informed the
<hi>Chief Captain</hi> of it, and accepted of the help
of his <hi>Armed Soldiers,</hi> both Horse and Foot,
to guard and defend him in his Journey
against those that lay in wait for him, and
if occasion should be, to fall upon them.
This shews what the Apostle's sentiment
was in the Case.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he lets us know that this <hi>Force</hi>
resides chiefly in the Magistrate, <hi>he bears not
the Sword in vain,</hi> Rom. xiii. 4. Where by
the <hi>Sword</hi> is meant undoubtedly the Judicial
and Hostile Sword, the Power to punish
Criminals, and with Arms to repulse the
Enemy. In short, by the <hi>Sword</hi> is meant all
<hi>Coercive</hi> Power: This the Magistrate is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with, to animadvert upon Offenders,
and to resist the violence of unjust and cruel
Invaders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:107741:105"/>
I could add that the Apostle reckons it as
a remarkable act and effort of <hi>Faith</hi> that the
Holy Warriors of old <hi>waxed valiant in Fight,</hi>
Heb. xi. 34. thereby acquainting us that
Warlike Enterprizes are not unbecoming the
best Men, and that the good Success of them
is even the result of an Active <hi>Faith.</hi> We
read that the <hi>Christians</hi> fought in the <hi>Roman
Emperours</hi> Armies; witness more especially
the <hi>Thundering Legion</hi> under <hi>Antoninus.</hi> It
was the judgment of an eminent and pious
Writer of the Primitive Church<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Greg Naz. Apolog. Orat.</note> that a
just Laudable <hi>War</hi> is more eligible than a
<hi>Peace</hi> which separates us from God. And
lastly, I will adjoin the Words of Our own
Church, in one of her <hi>Articles,</hi> viz. that<note n="†" place="bottom">Artic. 37.</note> 
               <hi>it
is lawful for Christian Men, at the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Magistrate, to wear Weapons, and
serve in the Wars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to the Authority of the Old and New
Testament, and the Practice of the Primitive
Christians, and later Times, let us add the
Reasonableness and Equity of the thing it
self. The Lawfulness of War appears from
this, that it is necessary sometimes in order
to the recovery of our Right, and in order
to our Safety and Peace. It will be granted,
I suppose, that Religion and Conscience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the use of <hi>Means</hi> that are proper to their
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107741:106"/>
               <hi>End,</hi> supposing that End to be Good. And
therefore seeing it is impossible in some Cases
to attain to what is our Right and Due,
and to secure our Safety and Repose (which
are good and lawful <hi>Ends</hi>) without milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Execution, and taking up of Arms, it is
not to be doubted that these are such <hi>Means</hi>
as Religion and Conscience will allow of.
When Peace cannot be purchas'd without
War, then in such a Case the best <hi>Leagues</hi>
and <hi>Confederacies</hi> are made (as the <hi>Eastern</hi>
Covenants of old) with <hi>Blood,</hi> Swords drawn
on one side may keep those on the other in
the Scabbard. Hostile actions prove often
times the Parents of a lasting Tranquility.
And truly sometimes it happens that this
latter cannot be obtain'd without the former.
At certain times the publick <hi>Maladies</hi> are of
that nature that <hi>Preparations of Steel</hi> are found
to be the most proper <hi>Medicines</hi> and <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
There is no possibility of curing them
without these <hi>Chalybeats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not be mistaken here, I am not
designing a Laudatory Oration upon <hi>War:</hi>
The very Name and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Warrior is with confused noise, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

but Disorder and Distraction, the Laws cease,
and the Judge hath his <hi>Quietus</hi> given him by

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107741:106"/>
Tears are mingled with the Blood of the Slain:
Cruelty, Ravage and Rapine prevail every

Dead Bodies. <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Harvest</hi> are express'd

let us be apprehensive of the Cognation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. Men are <hi>reaped</hi> and <hi>mowed
down, Swords</hi> are turn'd into <hi>Sithes</hi> and <hi>Sickles.</hi>
And, in a word, it can't be denied that <hi>War</hi>
is one of the most Direful and Destructive
<hi>Iudgments</hi> that God is wont to inflict.</p>
            <p>But that which I offer is this, that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
War is so Dreadful and Dangerous a
thing, yet there is a Lawful Use of it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and on certain Reasons and Grounds
it becomes Necessary, and on that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Good and Laudable. War is not to be
Praised for it self, but yet it hath, according
as it is managed, an appendent Convenience
and Usefulness. We see that some things have
a Secondary Goodness and Excellency in them,
though they can't boast of an Original and
Primary one, as Physick and Chirurgery, and
all Harsh and Troublesom Applications which
are required in some Diseases. These are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in order to Bodily Health, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of it, and therefore are good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable.
<hi>War</hi> is of this Nature, it is not Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
Good, or to be wish'd for, but as it hath
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107741:107"/>
a Tendency on a Great Good, it is on that
account desirable and eligible. And though
it be difficult and hazardous, yet so are <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Cauterizing,</hi> and <hi>Amputation,</hi> which yet
we know in some Cases are indispensable.
And there are other Enterprizes that are very
Perillous, which Men willingly venture upon,
as Navigation and Sea-Voyages, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing
into Foreign Countries, which
are liable to as great Hardships and Dangers
as <hi>War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, by God's particular <hi>Providence</hi>
War is made serviceable to Good Purposes;
for when by Peace and Plenty Nations are
grown Wanton and Luxurious, Idle and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
the Martial Trumpet and Drum rouze
them, and give them a sensible apprehension
of Want and Scarcity, Difficulties and Perils,
and make them abandon their Sloth and
Drowsiness, and betake themselves to such
wise and manly Methods as may best secure
their Safety. Thus<note n="*" place="margin">Polyb. 1. 6.</note> it was the
Judgment of one of the <hi>Scipio's,</hi>
that <hi>Carthage</hi> was not to be Demolish'd and
Destroy'd, that thereby the <hi>Romans</hi> might be
kept in Exercise and Breath.</p>
            <p>But the main Reason of the Lawfulness of
War depends on the Principle of <hi>Self-Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
The standing Law of Nature bids us
guard our selves from Injuries; it allows us
when we are unjustly Invaded and Assaulted,
to make Resistance. It pushes us on to assert
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107741:107"/>
our Civil and Natural Rights, and to defend
our Country against all Violent Aggressors.
And therefore that Kingdom is happy which
is furnish'd with Valiant and Brave Men,
that are willing and able to appear in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
when it is Injur'd by Unjust Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
As on the contrary, it is reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Calamities and Curses of a Nation,
that God will <hi>take away from them the Man of
War, and the Captain of fifty, Isai.</hi> iii. 2, 3.
<hi>i.e.</hi> Persons of such Valour and Spirit as are
requisite for the Security of their Country.
And lastly, <hi>Sovereignty, Laws</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> were
designed for the same End, and thence it is
evident that they are <hi>alike</hi> useful to Mankind.
When People first United into a Body and
Society, they made certain <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions;</hi>
and <hi>Magistrates</hi> were appointed by
them to be the Preservers of those Laws, and
at the same time they Voted <hi>Arms,</hi> or Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
Power to be necessary, both for Assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Governors</hi> and the <hi>Laws,</hi> and indeed
the <hi>Whole Community.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what hath been thus briefly Suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it may be Concluded, that it is Lawful,
even in the Times of the Gospel, to make use
of Warlike Provisions on Just and Necessary
Occasions. All that we have to do is to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
our selves as to the <hi>Cause</hi> we Fight for; for
the War is Just when the Cause is so. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Numa,</hi> that Religious King of the <hi>Old
Romans,</hi> knowing that an Unjust War was
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107741:108"/>
not like to be Successful, instituted a College
of Priests, on whose Arbitrement the Decision
of War should depend: These <hi>Feciales,</hi> (as
they were call'd) enquir'd into the Nature of
the Quarrel, and after great Deliberation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the War Just before the <hi>Romans</hi>
fought. In this we are to imitate them; we
ought in the first place to be satisfied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lawfulness of what we do, and that
our Cause is Good. And we may assure our
selves that it is so when the War is undertaken
for the Defence of our Country, our Religion,
our Lives, our Laws; for the subduing or
weakning of a Powerful Enemy, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaches
upon others Territories, and in time
may Invade ours; for the Defence and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of those Neighbouring Kindoms or States
that stand in need of and implore our Aid,
and would in all probability be swallow'd up
by the Potent Adversary without our timely
Assistance. This is a Just and Honest Cause,
and this is ours at present, and consequently
we may Lawfully engage in it. We have a
Warrant from Nature and Reason to justify
our Arms.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied that some of the Antient
Christian <hi>Fathers</hi> seem to Condemn all going
to War. <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> and in
his <hi>Dialogue with Trypho,</hi> utters Words to this
purpose. But <hi>Tertullian</hi> is more direct and
positive in this Matter; he will not allow
Christians either to make War, or serve in it,

that it is not Lawful for a Christian to be a
Soldier, and to bear Arms; but their favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such a Notion as this proceeded from
their mistaking of that Prophesy in <hi>Isai.</hi> ii. 4.
<hi>They shall beat their Swords into Plowshares, and
their Spears into Pruning-hooks. Nation shall
not lift up Sword against Nation, neither shall
any learn War any more:</hi> And other Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
there are which speak to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Whence they inferr'd, that all Warlike
Preparations are inconsistent with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Coming into the World, and with his
Evangelical Kingdom. Whereas the True
Meaning of such Prophetick Passages is this,
That the Principles of the Gospel, if attended
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107741:109"/>
to, inspire Men with Peace and Amity, and
that Outward Wars and Hostilities shall in
time actually cease; that as there was this
<hi>Cessation</hi> in part at the time when our Saviou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

came into the World, so there shall be a more
Remarkable and Compleat one before the
Consummation of all things, when the Church
of Christ on Earth shall enjoy a profound and
entire Repose.</p>
            <p>And this I add further (which may give us
a brief Account of the whole Case of taking
up of Arms under the Gospel) Our Saviour
without doubt intended in his Sermon on the
Mount, and more especially in that part of it
which is the close of the Fifth Chapter of St.
<hi>Matthew,</hi> that <hi>his Followers</hi> should be more
exact than the <hi>Iews,</hi> and accordingly he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
there a Higher Pitch of Religion than
they were capable of. He would have <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
be of such a Temper that no <hi>Swearing,</hi>
no <hi>Going to Law,</hi> no <hi>Fighting</hi> should be used
by them. He would have them deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and be much Better than others, and
refuse <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Suits of Law,</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> on
slight Occasions, and never be engaged in any
of them, but on Necessary and Unavoidable
Grounds; and more especially not in the last
of them, <hi>viz. War,</hi> till they have tried all
Mild and Peaceable Ways, and have found
them ineffectual. And perhaps this is all that
<hi>some</hi> of those forementioned Writers meant
and design'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

yet in<note n="*" place="bottom">Epist. 1. ad Dudithium.</note> another place he speaks in

sufficiently proved that there is no Ground for
this Conceit, and that to defend our Rights
Civil and Religious, is according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Unbiass'd Reason, and the Practice
of all Sober and Wise Men, and the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of our Blessed Saviour and his Apostles.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107741:110"/>
All these are ample Proofs and Confirmations
of this Doctrin: And therefore if we attend
to these, we shall see no reason to listen to
the fond Suggestions of Enthusiatick Heads:
But on the contrary, we shall be convinc'd
that as long as Men carry the Evil nature in
them, there will be Wars in the World, and
consequently it will be necessary to make
Provision against them, and to secure our
safety even by violent Methods, if we are
compell'd to it.</p>
            <p>That which we are next concern'd in is to
understand our selves aright, and to know
how to <hi>behave our selves</hi> when there is occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to take the Field. When you are call'd
to Fight, forget not these things,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> Go with great <hi>Caution</hi> and <hi>Circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
The Errors of War are Dangerous
and Desperate, and perhaps we shall not
Err any more. Wherefore it is requisite to
use all the prudent Methods we can, to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
up our Wit and Skill, and by no means
to deceive our selves.<note n="*" place="bottom">

Man (as One of the Antients said rightly)
will not despise the strength of his very

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107741:110"/>
him in so weighty a Concern. We should
be mindful of what a Great and Expert War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
long since said, It is a shameful thing in
Military Affairs to excuse our selves by saying
<hi>we thought not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Fight with <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Resolution:</hi>
To which you have Incentives sufficient. If
Honour be a Spur, you have that to prick
you on, for it is well known without any
profound skill in <hi>Heraldry</hi> that all <hi>Titles of
Honour</hi> are derived from the <hi>Sword</hi> and from
<hi>Martial Affairs.</hi> If the Welfare of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and of those that are Dearest to you in
it hath any force and prevalence with it, you
are not destitute of that. And if you look
to an other World, you have yet greater
Motives to shew your selves Valiant and
Couragious. The Famous <hi>Titus,</hi> when he
was haranguing his Soldiers just before they
assaulted <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> told them that<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ioseph.</hi> De Bello Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Iib. 7. chap. 1.</note> the Souls
of them that die in War are receiv'd up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
into the Pure <hi>Aether,</hi> and thence trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Stars; but the Souls of those
that die in Peace by Diseases and Sicknesses
are detain'd in the Bowels of the Earth, and
are forgotten. And <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a Man of Arms, animated his Followers
by instilling this into their Minds, that those
who expire in Battle, especially against the
Christians, are immediately dispach'd to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:107741:111"/>
But though you justly despise such
empty Deceits as these, yet by <hi>a sure Word
of Prophesy</hi> you are ascertain'd of a Better and
Glorious Life after this, and that if you fall
in Battle, it is your Corporeal Part only that
dies, but that of you which is Spiritual and
Divine shall Survive, and at last shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
to your Bodies, and both shall enjoy
a Glorious Eternity. There are other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
might be offer'd to you, as you
are <hi>Men,</hi> and as you are <hi>Christians:</hi> But I
will not insist upon them, lest it be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
that I question your <hi>Valour,</hi> or that I
think you need <hi>Incitements</hi> to increase it, like
the Blood of Mulberries spread before <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants</hi>
to raise their Choler, and make them
Fight with greater fury.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>dly.</hi> Look up to <hi>God,</hi> and be sensible that
all your Military Provisions signify nothing
without him. The most exquisite Humane
Prudence and the Highest degree of Valour
(which are the two things I have already
mention'd) will avail little without the
Divine Assistance and Heavenly Conduct.
Which was the sense of the very <hi>Pagan</hi>
World, for no War was undertaken by them
of old till they consulted their <hi>Oracle,</hi> and
made Addresses to their <hi>Numens.</hi> But this
was much more the sense and hearty perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the People of the True God. Their
<hi>Ark,</hi> which was the Symbol of the <hi>Divine
Presence,</hi> always accompanied the <hi>Army</hi> when
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107741:111"/>
they went out to Battle against any Nation.
That <hi>Royal Warrior,</hi> who bears so great a
part in the Writings of the Old Testament,
most freely acknowledges that it was God
that <hi>taught his hands to War, and his fingers to
Fight,</hi> Psal. xviii. 34. cxliii. 1. and therefore
we find him constantly imploring His aid
and strength. Self-Confidence hath lost ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Battel: Presuming on their Forces, or
on their Success in the beginning of the
Fight hath proved fatal to Armed Men. And
therefore if we are desirous to Prosper in our
Warlike undertakings we cannot more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
compass it than by confiding in the
Lord of Hosts, and relying with an unshak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Faith on his Presence and Blessing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Let our Wars be designed to <hi>Good
and Laudable Ends,</hi> and especially to God's
Glory. Indeed there is too just occasion given
to some to preach up the Unlawfulness of
War, when they behold the base and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<hi>Designs</hi> men generally pursue in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of Arms. Their <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Fightings</hi>
are intended to gratify their <hi>Lusts,</hi> and avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<hi>Desires,</hi> which St. <hi>Iames</hi> takes notice of
Chap. iv. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. They Fight to satiate
their greedy thirsting after Blood and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in order to the obtaining what their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and intemperate affectation of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Dominion prompt them to. On
this account <hi>War</hi> is generally a set and solemn
Violation of the sixth Commandment; it is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107741:112"/>
no other than Murdering by whole-sale; and
<hi>Soldiers</hi> usually are Homicides in Pay. These
Men (as it is excellently express'd, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
xxxiii. 26.) <hi>stand upon their Swords,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ide
in and brag of their Cruelty and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and glory in their Ability to do Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
in the World. Such War is not only
Inhumane, but Devilish; and as it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from, so it tends to the Infernal Pit: And
therefore it is the just Doom of those that
foster this Practice to <hi>go down to Hell with
their Weapons of War,</hi> Ezek. xxxii. 27. We
must be careful therefore to War with Good
and Lawful Intentions, with a sincere aim at
the real welfare and tranquility of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:
For (as the Great <hi>Plato</hi> long since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
it)<note n="*" place="bottom">De Legib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> No War is to be undertaken
for it self, but only for Peace sake. The
Shakings of War are in order to a firm Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement.
This <hi>Blood-letting</hi> is for the <hi>Health</hi>
of the Body Politick. Therefore this is that
we must design, in conjunction always with
the Advancement of <hi>Religion,</hi> without which
the secular Concerns of the Publick cannot
long thrive. But the ultimate End of all is
the <hi>Divine Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought to have chiefly in our thoughts.
It was not unusual with the Old <hi>Gentiles</hi> to
lodge their Arms in their <hi>Temples;</hi> and it
hath been a Custom even in some <hi>Christian</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:107741:112"/>
Countries to hang up the <hi>Armour</hi> of Great and
Eminent Warriors in the Places set apart for
Religion, as if they did devote them to <hi>God.</hi>
We may most effectually do this by dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our Arms to God's Honour, and not to
sinister and unworthy Ends. Hereby we
may turn all our Warlike Expeditions into
<hi>Crusades,</hi> and whenever we Fight, ingage in
a <hi>Holy War.</hi> We are told that the Antient
<hi>Romans</hi> in a great distress made use of the
Weapons which were deposited in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and fought with them, and attributed
the Success to the Holiness of their Arms.
But this we are sure of, that if Kindoms did
hallow their Weapons by Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Designs, they would thrive and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in their martial Attempts, and meet the
Foe with good Success.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> It is not enough to have a Good
Cause and Right Ends, unless our Lives be
Good and Holy. We must always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that our <hi>Sins</hi> are our greatest <hi>Enemies,</hi> and
therefore it is our Interest to vanquish these
first, which must be done by putting on the
<hi>Spiritual Armour.</hi> A Good Soldier must be
a Religious Man. To which purpose I will
offer a Criticism to you; You may observe
that <hi>to prepare</hi> or <hi>make War</hi> is express'd in the
Stile of Scripture by <hi>Consecrating of War, Ier.</hi>
vi. 4. and again in <hi>Mic.</hi> iii. 5. Which <hi>Hebraism</hi>
may remind us now of <hi>Consecrating</hi> or <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi>
our <hi>Wars,</hi> namely by unfeigned Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107741:113"/>
and Righteousness. Let us not <hi>prophane</hi>
our Warlike Weapons by an Irreligious and
Wicked Life. But let us remember that the
Contrary will bring down a Blessing from
<hi>Heaven</hi> upon us; besides, that in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and genuine Efficacy it will prove Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to us; for a Good Conscience, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a firm Trust in the Almighty,
will inspire us with the greatest Courage and
Resolution, and give the most undaunted
Boldness and Valour to our Spirits. Or, if
we meet not with Success, this Comfortable
Principle within us will not suffer us to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
but will rather Chear us, as the <hi>Roman
Senate</hi> did their General when he was flying
Home after he was defeated by <hi>Hannibal;</hi>
they met him, and heartned him, and gave
him this Commendation, That <hi>he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of the Safety of the Commonwealth</hi> after so
great a Defeat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly.</hi> If you be <hi>Victorious,</hi> know how to
demean your selves. Ascribe your Success to
him who is the Grand Arbiter and Disposer
of War, and to whom belong the Issues of it.
Herein you may take that Holy and Warlike
Prince for your Pattern, who not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
that it was the Supreme Lord of
Heaven and Earth that had <hi>girded him with
strength unto the Battel,</hi> but that it was he who
had <hi>subdued under him those that rose up against
him.</hi> It was he that <hi>gave him the necks of his
Enemies, that he might destroy those that hated
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107741:113"/>
him, Psal.</hi> xviii. 39, 40. Or, let us use such
humble and thankful Language as is suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us in <hi>Psal.</hi> xliv. 3. <hi>We got not the Victory
by our own Sword, neither did our own Arm save us;
but Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the
light of Thy countenance, because Thou hadst a
favour unto us.</hi> To this Almighty Sovereign
and Lord of Hosts be all Glory and Honour
now and unto Eternal Ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>GOD had chosen out a People from
the rest of the World, whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to discover his Will to in a
more singular Manner, and on
whom he purposed to confer Mercies of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
nature: These he preserved in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107741:114"/>
               <hi>Egypt,</hi> conducted through the Wilderness, and
brought at last into the promised Land. But
behold, they were unmindful of this marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Goodness of God toward them, and
took not care to observe those strict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
which he had given them, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
That of <hi>utterly destroying every accursed thing</hi>
in the Cities which they took. They were
more signally guilty of this when <hi>Iericho</hi> was
taken by them, and therefore God punish'd
this gross Violation of his Command, by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
them to be Defeated in their next En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
When they went against the Men
of <hi>Ai,</hi> some of them were smitten and fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, others not being able to endure the
Shock shamefully fled away. This, with
the Reason of it, is represented to us by God
himself in the Text, <hi>Therefore the Children of
Israel could not stand before their Enemies, but
turned their backs before them, because they sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about the Accursed thing.</hi> The hiding and
detaining of the <hi>Golden Wedge</hi> and the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Garment,</hi> became their General Crime,
and were the Cause of their unexpected Defeat.
And withal here is added what they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<hi>for the future,</hi> namely nothing but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats
and Overthrows; <hi>Neither will I be with
you any more, except ye destroy the Accursed from
amongst you, i.e.</hi> unless you destroy your Sins
which make you Accursed, and for the future
strictly keep the Command which I gave
concerning the Utter Destroying of whatever
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107741:115"/>
belongs to those Cursed Nations: Unless you
do this, I will never assist you to overcome
your Enemies, but they shall continually van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
you, and prevail against you.</p>
            <p>From the whole take this Observation,
that <hi>the Sins of a People are like to hinder their
Success in War, and to cause them to turn their
Backs, and slie before their Enemies.</hi> Besides
the Instance in this Chapter there are sundry
others which we meet with in other places
of the sacred History. I will begin with that
in <hi>Iudg.</hi> ii. 11. <hi>&amp;c. The Children of Israel did
evil in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim,
and they forsook the Lord God of their Fathers,
and follow'd other Gods, and provoked the Lord
to anger: And they forsook the Lord, and served
Baal and Ashtaroth.</hi> These were their hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sins: Now observe the Effect of them,
which follows in the next Verse, <hi>The anger of
the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered
them into the hand of spoilers that spoiled them,
and he sold them into the hand of their enemies,
so that they could not any longer stand before their
enemies.</hi> This refers unto the Time between
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>'s Death and God's raising up of the
<hi>Iudges:</hi> Then it was that their Enemies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
against them in Battel, and miserably
Overthrew and Destroy'd them; which is
here ascribed to their Idolatry and other Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sins, which provoked God to deliver
them as a Prey to their Enemies. And even
in the Days of the <hi>Iudges</hi> the same Cause had
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107741:115"/>
the same Effect, <hi>the Children of Israel did evil
again in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord
strengthned Eglon the King of Moab against Israel,
because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord:
And he gather'd unto him the Children of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and Amalek and went and smote Israel,</hi> Judg.
iii. 12, 13. Markit, the Sin of <hi>Israel</hi> was the
Strength of <hi>Eglon; Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
against God's People because they
walked not as such, because they acted Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and Wickedly. And at several other
times it is particularly recorded in this Book,
that when the Israelites <hi>did evil in the sight of
the Lord,</hi> then <hi>he gave them into the Hands of their
Enemies,</hi> who <hi>prevail'd over them</hi> and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
<hi>oppressed them.</hi> To this refer the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist's
Words, in Psal. lxxviii. 56. <hi>&amp;c. They
tempted and provoked the most high God, and
kept not his Testimonies. They provoked him to
anger with their high places, and moved him to
jealousy with their graven Images. When God
heard this he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
Israel; he deliver'd his strength into Captivity,
and his Glory into the Enemies hand: He gave
his People over also unto the Sword.</hi> So God
by his Prophet acquaints us that <hi>they rebelled
and vexed his Holy Spirit: Therefore he was
turned to be their Enemy, and he fought against
them,</hi> Isa. lxiii. 10. I will only add that
notable Instance in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxiv. 23, 24. <hi>It
came to pass that the Host of Syria came up against
him,</hi> (viz. King <hi>Ioash) and they came to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107741:116"/>
and Ierusalem, and destroy'd all the Princes
of the People from among the People, and sent all
the spoil of them to the King of Damascus. For
the Army of the Syrians came with a small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Men, and the Lord deliver'd a very great
host into their Hand.</hi> The <hi>Syrians</hi> were but
few, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> were many, yet These
were defeated by Them; and if you would
know the <hi>Reason</hi> of it, the next Words will
inform you, <hi>because they had forsaken the Lord
God of their Fathers.</hi> For this it was that
God forsook them, and gave them up to their
Enemies, to be destroy'd by them. All this
which I have produced is an undeniable proof
of what I asserted, that Sin hinders Success in
War, this is the cause of Armies being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited.
All warlike Provisions prove Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessless,
all Force and Artillery become use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and unable to repulse the Enemy, when
a Nation by their Sins fight against God.</p>
            <p>This must needs be so if you consider ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Nature of the Thing it self, or the
just Judgment of God. First, it is so in the
Thing it self. Immorality and Vice do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
impede the Success of War, and give
a check to the Military proceedings of any
People. Especially there are some Vices
which more visibly hinder the Thriving of
Warlike Undertakings and Exploits. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery</hi>
takes away the steady use of Men's
Reasons, and renders them uncapable of mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and attending to their Safety. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:107741:116"/>
after their Success at <hi>Ziklag lay spread
all over the Ground, eating and drinking,</hi> 1 Sam.
30. 16. And this was it which exposed them
to the Enemy, who (as we read in the next
Verses) took the advantage of their Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and slew them all except a few, who it
is likely were those that retain'd some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Sobriety. <hi>Belshazar</hi> was set upon <hi>in
the Night of his Pleasure</hi> (as it is call'd <hi>Isa.</hi> xxi.
4.) i.e. in the time of his Feasting and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
which was in the Night. Then it
was that <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> took <hi>Babylon,</hi> viz.
when the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Nobles were in the heighth
of their disorder'd Mirth, <hi>Dan.</hi> v. 1, 30.
which we may find confirmed by <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi>
in the<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 7.</note> Life of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Our
Chronicles tell us that the <hi>English</hi> Army, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion of King <hi>Harold</hi>'s birth Day, had
been Drinking and Revelling all Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to Fight with the <hi>Normans,</hi>
which was one great Reason of their losing
the Day, and being Conquered. <hi>Intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
and <hi>Sottishness</hi> have been pernicious and
fatal to Men of Arms: These darken and
cloud their Minds so that they are not able to
see into the Projects and Designs of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
nor to apprehend what is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be done on emergent occasions: These
are the cause of their neglecting the fit Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Opportunities of action, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lost, they are so too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:107741:117"/>
Again, <hi>Incontinence</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Love
of Pleasure</hi> weaken and enervate Mens Bodies,
and cramp those Hands that should War, and
those Fingers that should Fight. Hence it
was that <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Prodigious great Army of
above a Million of Men proved ineffectual to
the purposes he had formed. Their Delicacy
and Luxurious way of living spoilt all their
military Conduct. They were more eager
to Fight with their Teeth than with their
Hands and Weapons: They were not so
much for devouring the Enemy as their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands.
They wish'd work for their Knives
rather than their Swords; they thirsted after
Wine more than Blood. Who could expect
but that their Softness and Dalliances should
unfit them for harsh Encounters? In a word,
Being sunk into Sensuality they hated to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their Lives, and being fill'd with Guilt
they dared not. And when we remember
that in the Princes of <hi>Asia</hi>'s Armies there were
Troops of Women and Eunuchs, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Persons, design'd only for Pleasure and
Diversion, we need not wonder that they
were so often Defeated, and that their
vast Numbers fled away in disorder. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it is requisite in Military Officers that
they be Masters of great Continence and
Moderation: For, as <hi>Tully</hi> well observes,

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107741:117"/>
himself, cannot rule an Army. Wherefore
for this excellent Virtue we find some of the
greatest Commanders (<hi>Agesilaus, Fabritius,
Scipio</hi> the <hi>African,</hi> &amp;c.) commended by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,
Valerius Maximus,</hi> and others. Tho'
<hi>Cesar</hi> made his Vaunt that he won Battels
with Perfumed Soldiers, yet you shall rarely
hear that Commanders do so. For Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
exhausts their Spirits, dries up their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and shrinks their Nerves. An <hi>Armed
Venus</hi> among the <hi>Romans</hi> was but an Image,
a Fiction; but in reality 'tis known that <hi>Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is destructive to the <hi>Camp.</hi> In short, no
Debauched or Effeminate Man can be a Good
Soldier. For he can never do the things that
are required of a Man of Arms, and he can
never undergo the Hardships which that Life
is subject to; and consequently he is wholly
unfit for Warlike Service.</p>
            <p>There are other Vices also which hinder
the Prospering of Military Undertakings.

too much imitate him, else there would not

               </note> there
is no Faith nor Honesty to be found in them.
<hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi> have made many Armies
Unsuccessful. The Faithless and Persidious,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107741:118"/>
whilst they have seem'd to take up Arms for
their Country, have really betray'd it, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
secret Correspondence with the Enemy,
and promoting that Cause which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to fight against. It is not incredible that
<hi>We</hi> have had some ground to complain on this
account: If we had not been betray'd at Sea
and at Land in some of our Engagements, 'tis
probable our Fleet and our Armies would
have given a better account of themselves.
And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambition</hi> or <hi>Avarice</hi> are always the Sins
that soment this Treachery: The Love of
Honour, or the Desire of Gain, have prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
these Armed Men to listen to the Profers
of their Enemies, and falsly deliver up the
whole Forces to them for their own Private
Advantage. Or else they Protract and <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
the War</hi> (as they are pleas'd to speak)
only to make themselves Rich and Wealthy.
Yea, and in the heat of the Battel, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after it, <hi>Covetousness, Rapine,</hi> and a
<hi>Greedy Desire of Booty,</hi> have proved destructive
to Armed Forces. When, with <hi>Achan,</hi>
their Minds are intent upon <hi>Stealing</hi> and
<hi>Hoarding,</hi> when the <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>the Silver,</hi> and
<hi>the Goodly Garments</hi> are chiefly thought of,
the Concern of the Battel is forgot, and even
when Victory was inclining towards them,
it on a sudden left them, and went to the other
side.</p>
            <p>Lastly, when we go to meet the Enemy
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107741:118"/>
with Prejudice, Grudgings, Animosites, yea
downright Hatred among our selves,<note n="*" place="bottom">Nihil praestare majus Fortuna potest quàm hostium discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam. <hi>Tacit. de morib. German.</hi>
               </note> we
can't expect that our Military Expeditions
will be Blessed with Success. When <hi>Israel</hi>
was to go forth against <hi>Iabin</hi> and <hi>Sisera,</hi> it
was a sad reflection to take notice that they
could not agree among themselves:<note n="†" place="margin">Judg. v. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>For the
divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts,
there were great searchings of heart,</hi> and it was
from the extraordinary Hand of God that
these did not prove their Overthrow at that
time. Thus you see <hi>some Sins</hi> directly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the Good Success of War; as, on the
contrary, some Virtues, as Temperance and
Sobriety, Continence and Chastity, Truth
and Faithfulness, Self-denial and Contentment,
Mutual Peace and Concord do in their own
nature promote it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is so not only upon Human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
but <hi>by the Iust Iudgment of God,</hi>
by the Divine Conduct and Providence. Our
Sins fight against Him, and he sends <hi>Wars,</hi>
and <hi>Ill Success</hi> with them, to Punish us for
those Sins. When the <hi>Israelites</hi> provoked God
by their Idolatry and other such abominable
Offences, he allarm'd them with the Noise of
War and Battel: When <hi>they chose new Gods,
then was War in the gates, Iudg.</hi> v. 8. Since
they were for introducing Heathen Deities, it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107741:119"/>
was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it that <hi>Mars</hi> should be one of them. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they would have Strange Gods, they must
grapple with Strange Nations, and be severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treated by them. Amongst the Judgments
and Curses which God denounceth against an
Impenitent and Profligate People, This you
will find to be one, in <hi>Deut.</hi> xxviii. 25. <hi>The
Lord shall cause them to be smitten before their
enemies, they shall go out one way against them,
and flee seven ways before them.</hi> That this was
a Judgment purposely design'd against them
for their Sins may be further learnt from <hi>Lev.</hi>
xxvi. 23, <hi>&amp;c</hi> where God expresly tells that
People, That <hi>if they will not be reformed, but
will walk contrary to him, he will bring a Sword
upon them, that shall avenge the quarrel of his
Covenant.</hi> The <hi>Covenant</hi> was that he would
be their God, and they should be his People,
<hi>i.e.</hi> that they should serve and obey him, and
do whatever he commanded them: So that
every Sin is a Breach of the Covenant; and
where God sends the Sword, <hi>i.e.</hi> War, with
the dreadful Effects of it, there he hath some
quarrel of his Covenant to revenge, there
some Sin or other is to be Punish'd. The
<hi>Eastern</hi> People always used <hi>Blood</hi> in <hi>making</hi> a
<hi>Covenant.</hi> Here you see God will send a
<hi>Bloody Sword</hi> to avenge the <hi>Breach</hi> of his. <hi>War</hi>
and <hi>Bloodshed</hi> shall be the Penalty of Mens
dealing falsly in Religion, and prevaricating
with God. This then is according to what
he had Threatned against Sinners; so that if
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107741:119"/>
This did not come to pass, God could not be
Faithful to his Word. Besides, he is obliged
by virtue of his Pure and Holy Nature to
shew his Dislike of Sin; which he can no ways
better do, than by severely Animadverting
upon it. On this account an Army of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and Wicked Men, who have no Sense
of Religion, but defy it, and blasphemously
declame against it, cannot expect their Arms
should prosper; their Guilt must needs weigh
down their Swords, or rebate the Edge of
them. The Divine Vengeance may justly
blast all their Warlike Attempts at Land, and
make their Enterprizes at Sea like those of
<hi>Caligula,</hi> who made a shew of a Descent upon
<hi>Britain,</hi> but took up at the Shore, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
his Army to gather Cockle-Shells, and so
return'd with the Mock-spoils of the Ocean.
Or, which is far worse, the Incensed Majesty
of Heaven may turn their Martial Weapons
and Forces against themselves.</p>
            <p>Are these things so, then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ist.</hi> Let us Tremble at the Thoughts of
the Condition we are in at present. A potent
Enemy is lifting up his Warlike Weapons
against us, and we at the same time Fight
against God by our daily and repeated Sins.
What can we think will be the Issue of this?
<hi>If the Children of Israel turn'd their Backs before
their Enemies because of the accursed Thing,</hi> how
can we imagine <hi>we</hi> shall stand before ours,
when we cherish such <hi>a Multitude of accursed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107741:120"/>
Things</hi> amongst us? Was <hi>Israel</hi> defeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of <hi>one single Achan?</hi> May not we then
fear that we shall be so, having so <hi>many Achans</hi>
in our Camp? <hi>What Peace</hi> can we look for
<hi>so long as the Whoredoms</hi> and Debaucheries,
the Prophane Swearings and Cursings of this
Nation <hi>are so many?</hi> So long as Pride and
Luxury, Irreligion and even Atheism prevail
in the midst of us? And as <hi>no Peace,</hi> so <hi>no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious War</hi>
can be expected as long as these
are countenanced and maintained: For these
most Exorbitant and Flagitious Vices make
the greatest Warriors Successless. Let us not
then flatter our selves, and boast of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Safety, and confide in our Strength and
Forces, and the great Preparations we have
made. Let not us of this Island brag that
we, like <hi>Populous No,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Nahum. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>have the
Waters round about us, and that
our Rampart is the Sea, and our Wall</hi> (i.e. our
Defence) <hi>is from the Sea.</hi> Let us remember
what it was that spoil'd King <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi>'s
Design at <hi>Sea,</hi> and <hi>broke all his Ships</hi> in pieces,
<hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Ioyning himself with one who did very
wickedly,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. Much more then if
the Generality of a Nation join together to do
very wickedly, may not they expect that
their Ships will be shatter'd and broken,
that their Naval Force will be brought to
ruin? And though through the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Forbearance they may seem to pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for a time, yet it will be <hi>Bitterness in the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107741:120"/>
latter End.</hi> Although we have had Unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Success of late, and God hath appear'd
for us in an Extraordinary manner, yet let us
not make us such an <hi>Image of Victory</hi> as was
at <hi>Athens, without wings:</hi> Let us not fancy
that it hath taken up its Seat with us, and
will not fly from us. Or, let us not imagine
we have <hi>Mars in Fetters,</hi> as the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
represented and pourtrayed him; that we
have so <hi>chain'd up War</hi> that it is wholly at our
disposal, and that it cannot hurt us. Let such
vain Confidences disappear, and let us know
that we are in the Hands of God, and that
Peace and War, Victory and Overthrow, and
all the Comfortable or Dismal issues of either
are wholly from Him. Presume not of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
because you are Strong and Valiant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Force and the Courage of <hi>England</hi>
have been tried, and are well known to the
World. Let not this make you Confident
that you shall prevail against your Enemies.
I must tell you that if <hi>England</hi> were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times Stronger and Valianter than it is,
the Sins, the Crying Sins which are in the
midst of it are able to Weaken and Dispirit
it. <hi>It could never be believed that the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and enemy should enter into the Gates of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Lam.</hi> iv. 12.
That City was of almost incredible Strength;
it was so admirably Fenced and Fortified that
there are in the Old Testament several e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant
Allusions to this very thing. Yet this
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107741:121"/>
place which was so Strong, and in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
not only of themselves, but of strangers,
Invincible and Impregnable, was taken, and
fack'd and burnt with Fire; yea, even a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time it met with the same fate.</p>
            <p>May we learn then not to Vaunt of our
Strength, but rather to be sensible of our
Weakness, <hi>viz.</hi> of our Sins, which Enfeeble
and Disable us. By reason of these it is that
<hi>the People in the midst of us are Women,</hi> as it
was said of <hi>Nineve,</hi> Nahum. iii. 13. And
then will follow what is there added, <hi>The
Gates of the Land shall be set wide open to our
Enemies,</hi> i.e. we shall be subdued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
by them. Our Vices will blunt all
our Weapons, our Sins will discomfit our
Forces on Land, and sink our Ships at Sea,
We abound with those ill Practices which
(as I have shew'd you) do naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ill Success in War, as the nourishing of
Discord and Animosities, Covetousness and
Ambition, Treachery and Perfidiousness,
Luxury and Wantonness, Drunkenness and
Sottishness, Lust and Uncleanness, and all
manner of Debauchery and Prophaneness.
These with the Guilt of them on Mens minds
do emasculate their Spirits, and render them
Cowards and Poultrons. To these may be
imputed the ill Conduct of Affairs, to these
Men may ascribe their Miscarriages in War:
This is the true Source of those cross Events
and Disappointments which they meet with.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107741:121"/>
The Oaths, the Horrid Oaths which you
frequently hear out of the Mouths of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Wretches do <hi>England</hi> more harm than
so many Cannons discharged by the Enemy
against us. As many Debauched and Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Livers as there are in this Nation, so
many <hi>Plagues</hi> are there to the Kingdom, so
many <hi>Traitours</hi> to the King, so many <hi>Enemies</hi>
in the Camp, so many <hi>Fire-Ships</hi> among the
Navy, so many Hindrances to the good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of War, which otherwise we might look
for. It is certainly an Unhappy War where
those who are employ'd in Military Action
are led by the Evil Spirit, and follow his
Dictates in their Lives and Practices. Such
cannot reasonably think to be Prospered by
God in their Enterprizes of War. Or, if
God shall be so Merciful and Indulgent as to
pass by their Enormities, and to bless their
Martial Endeavours, yet, if afterwards they
be not exceeding Sensible of God's Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Goodness to them, but persist in their
former evil Courses, their Success will prove
a Curse instead of a Blessing: Their Lawrels
will be blasted, their <hi>Victories</hi> and <hi>Triumphal</hi>
Rejoycings will soon be turned into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Lamentation; and those Enemies
whom they at present seem to prevail against
shall increase in Number and Strength, and
over-run them, and destroy them with a
great Destruction. You may take this for an
undeniable Truth, that those who are out of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107741:122"/>
God's way, cannot but make false Steps. You
must not expect that they should Thrive any
considerable time; nothing will long Prosper
under their Conduct. Let this check your
Fond Presumption, and teach you to <hi>stand in
awe,</hi> and <hi>not to sin</hi> against God with that high
hand you formerly did. Which brings me
to the next Inference from the Premises;</p>
            <p>2. Remove the Cause of all your Fears and
Dangers, that is, renounce your Sins, which
either in themselves or through the Judgment
of God do not only procure Wars, but make
them Unsuccessful and Fatal to us. That
you may fight your Foes victoriously, see
that you combate your Sins, that you grapple
with your Vices. This is a War that is
fought without Noise, a War that makes no
Widows nor Orphans, a War that is always
crown'd with Victory and Peace. That you
may not, like the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Text, <hi>turn
your backs before your enemies,</hi> you must take
care to <hi>put away the Accursed thing,</hi> the Cursed
Uncleanness, the Cursed Oaths, the Cursed
Intemperance and Drunkenness, the Cursed
Uncharitableness, Enmity and Malice which
are amongst us. These are all <hi>Execrable</hi> things,
and every one of them are able to blunt our
Swords, to damp our Powder, to stifle our
Cannon, and to render all our Martial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
useless and ineffectual. Think you
heard God speak to <hi>You</hi> as he did to <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
or rather to the Whole People, <hi>O Israel, O
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107741:122"/>
England, thou canst not stand before thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
until ye take away the Accursed thing from
among you,</hi> Verse 13th of this Chapter. All
<hi>Sin</hi> is <hi>Accursed;</hi> lay This aside, and then go
forth against your Enemies, and Prosper. You
may read in <hi>Iudges</hi> x. 16, 17. That <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel put away the strange Gods from
among them,</hi> as a Necessary Introduction and
Preparative for undertaking a Successful War
against their <hi>Enemies, who were</hi> at that time
<hi>gathered together, and encamped against them.</hi>
And this was done in Obedience to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Rule which was given them in <hi>Deut.</hi>
xxiii. 9. <hi>When the Host goeth forth against thine
enmemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing;</hi>
then be sure to be watchful over your selves,
that you indulge not any sort of Wickedness;
for Vice at Home will spoil your Forces A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
Here I might pertinently remind
you to remove more particularly those Sins
which are wont to be the <hi>Immediate Causes and
Procurers of War,</hi> those <hi>Lusts that War in your
Members (Iames</hi> iv. 1.) those Insatiable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and Wishes which breed in Men a strong
Inclination to Quarrel with others; such are
Ambition, Anger, Cruelty, Revenge, Pride,
Desire of Glory,<note n="*" place="bottom">Una &amp; ea vetus causa bellandi cupido divitia um &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>i. <hi>Salust.</hi>
               </note> Covetousness, Thirsting
after Command and Greatness, and sometimes
Luxury and Prodigality, which reduce Men
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107741:123"/>
to Streights and Wants, whereupon they are
necessitated as 'twere to <hi>Fight</hi> that they may
<hi>Eat,</hi> (as the<note n="*" place="bottom">Lacham, comedere: pugnare.</note> same word among the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
signifies both;) in brief, a being Dissatisfied
with our present State and Condition. These
are the Load-stones that draw <hi>Steel</hi> to them;
these are the grand Procurers of War and
Fighting, of Blood and Slaughter in the
World, and we are particularly concern'd to
root out these Vices.</p>
            <p>Especially I might remind you not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
your selves to the Sins of those Persons
whom you Fight against. How absurd and
unaccountable is it (think you) that when we
have Proclaimed War against a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nation, and even whilst we are Fighting
them, and hope to get the better of them,
yet we are in the mean time Conquer'd by
their Vices? We treat them as Loathed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and yet are in love with their Follies,
and doat upon their Vanities and Excesses.
Let me tell you, we must take another course
before we can look for Success and Victory.
If we would have This declare it self on our
side, and even fling it self into our Arms, we
must make sure of the Conquest over the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and Vices of those we take up Arms
against. Briefly, we must examin our Lives
and Manners, and whatever we discern to
be amiss in us must be forsaken. We must
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107741:123"/>
first vanquish all our Lusts, and then we may
with some confidence engage the Adversary.
We may hope for Success against our Bodily
Enemies, when we have subdued our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ones. What you read of <hi>Ionas</hi> may be
a good Emblem to us in this present Affair.
He was in Rebellion against God, and was
become a Great Sinner in his sight, and <hi>for his
sake</hi> (as himself saith) a Great Tempest arose
at Sea, and exceedingly endangered the Ship
wherein he was. There was no way to allay
this Tempest and save the Ship, but by <hi>taking
up Ionas, and casting him forth into the Sea;
then the Sea ceased from her raging.</hi> It is <hi>Sin</hi>
that raises the Tempests of War among us:
They are <hi>Sinners,</hi> especially such as <hi>lie fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep</hi>
(as <hi>Ionas</hi> did) that endanger the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Vessel wherein we are Embark'd. We
shall all sink and be cast away, unless the
Troublesom <hi>Ionas</hi> be thrown over-board,
unless Sin be cast out. But,</p>
            <p>3. It is not enough to cast away your Sins,
to abstain from those Vices which you former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
committed, but you must betake your
selves to the serious Practice of all Holiness.
The first thing you are to do is to give your
selves unto <hi>Prayer.</hi> This is a proper Duty at
this time, and is commended to us by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod xvii. 2. 1 Sam. vii. 9. 2 Chron. xiv. 11. 2 Chron. xx. 6. 2 Kings xix. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Moses, Samuel,</hi> King <hi>Asa, Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi>

and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> whose Prayers on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
are recorded. <hi>Let God arise, and let his
Enemies be scattered,</hi> was the usual Form of
Prayer or Collect which the <hi>Israelites</hi> used in
their Marches against their Enemies. And
we read that there were<note n="1" place="bottom">2 Chron. xii. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Priests</hi> among them
that waited on the <hi>War,</hi> Persons set apart on
purpose to go forth with their Armies, and
Pray with them upon any Expedition. Yea,
that you may see that this is a part even of
Natural Religion, the <hi>Pagans</hi> invoked their
Gods in a special manner when they went
forth to Battel: Thus it is particularly record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that<note n="2" place="bottom">Xenoph. de Expedit. Cyri. lib. 6.</note> he very earnestly implored
their help in his Wars. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans</hi> were the most noted for this; and
therefore both<note n="3" place="bottom">Apolog cap. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> and<note n="4" place="bottom">Institut. l. 2 c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Lactantius</hi>
make mention of the special Addresses made
to the Gods by those People in time of War.
<hi>Scipio</hi> (that Great Thunderbolt of War) was
an Example of this among the <hi>Romans,</hi> as
<note n="5" place="bottom">Lib.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Livy</hi> testifies: He endeavoured to render the
Gods favourable and propitious to him in
Battel, by his importunate Supplications to
them; and there are other Notable Instances
not only in this Historian, but in<note n="6" place="bottom">Vale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

They generally acknowledg'd that their Help
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107741:124"/>
was in the Divine Power, and that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to have the Gods on their side, if they
hoped for Success in Battel. The very <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
of War</hi> among the Old <hi>Romans,</hi> was
in a Religious and Devout manner: It was
accompanied with a solemn invoking of their
Gods, and with Ceremonies of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
The <hi>Herauld</hi> was a kind of <hi>Priest.</hi> It
might be observ'd that the <hi>Prince of Poets</hi>
throughout his whole <hi>Iliads,</hi> makes his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
invoke <hi>Iupiter</hi> before they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
any Warlike Enterprize; yea, there is
not any single Person but craves his Aid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before he ingages his particular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.
Hereby this Antient Sage would
give the World to understand that <hi>Praying</hi> and
<hi>Fighting</hi> were not to be separated.</p>
            <p>Shall the <hi>Christian</hi> World then fall short of
<hi>Pagans</hi> in this Religious Practice? Shall we
not with most ardent zeal beseech the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to bless our Arms with Success? Do
the <hi>Turks</hi> begin their March, and make their
Onset in Battel with a loud Cry of <hi>Allah, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,
Allah, i.e.</hi> they thrice repeat the Name
of God: And shall not <hi>Christians</hi> devoutly
Supplicate their <hi>Iehovah Sabaoth,</hi> their <hi>Lord
of Hosts,</hi> their Sacred and Undivided Trinity,
Father, Son and Holy Ghost? Yes; this we
find to have been the constant Course and
Practice of the Servants of God in all Ages.
<hi>Nobiscum</hi> was the Word used among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of old in their Military Clamour: When
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107741:125"/>
they were to engage the Enemy they all out

Prayers on the occasion of <hi>War</hi> in all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Churches of the Christians: and so it
should be now. The Gates of our Temples,
like those of <hi>Ianus</hi>'s, must stand open in these
times of War. Whilst so many among us
are belching out Oaths and Curses, do <hi>you</hi>
strive to call down a Blessing by your devout
Petitions and Addresses at the Throne of
Grace. Drown the Noise of their Prophane
Swearing and Blasphemy by your Louder and
Sacred Cries in the Ears of God. Let your
Supplications be as prevalent and successful as
those of the Christians of old, who were sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Thundering Legion,</hi> who procured Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to themselves, and a Defeat to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
by their Urgent and Incessant Cries to
Heaven. See then that you be very warm in
your Addresses, urge and solicite the Divine
Goodness by your continued Applications.
God may be pleas'd to give that to our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which he denies to our Courage; we
may prevail more by our Humble Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107741:125"/>
than by our Valorous Enterprizes.</p>
            <p>And with <hi>Prayer</hi> join all other Acts of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship,</hi> devote your selves wholly to
the Service of God, and never think your
selves Safe whilst you abandon that. <hi>Plutarch</hi>
tells us in the Life of <hi>Numa,</hi> that when Word
was brought him that the Enemy was near
at hand, his answer was, I fear them not:
Let them come at their perill, for I am Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
unto the God's. He thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Safe in that Religious Employment, and
reckon'd it his best Protection against his
Enemies. Shall not <hi>we,</hi> who are to <hi>offer Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Sacrifices by Iesus Christ,</hi> esteem those
as our greatest Safety and Security in time of
War and Slaughter?</p>
            <p>And let us be daily employed not only in
all Holy Exercises of <hi>Devotion,</hi> but let us
live in the constant Practice of those Religious
Duties which respect our Selves and our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as well as God. We must think it to
be our present Concern to live Soberly,
Righteously, and Godlily. Those more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
that are in <hi>Authority</hi> ought at this
time to discharge their Great and weighty
Office with all Faithfulness. It is requisite
that these Persons give some remarkable
Proof of their hearty Desire and Endeavour
to Amend their own Lives, and of those that
are committed to their Charge. If it would
please God to stir up the Hearts of the <hi>Great
Ones</hi> of the Land to do some Eminent thing
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107741:126"/>
in the sight of the whole Nation for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming

               </gap>
at the Crying Sins amongst us by letting them
go Unpunish'd, but would from henceforth
severely check (as they might easily do with
great Success) the Prophaning of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and Evangelical Sabbath, the Impious
Swearing and Cursing, the Wild Intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Debauchery, the Excessive Pride
and Luxury, the Impudent Lewdness and
Wantonness which reign among us, if (I say)
they would curb and chastise these Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and thereby testify their utter Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of them, we might then entertain good
hopes that God will go forth with our Armies,
and remove this great Judgment of War by
a happy Victory on our Side. The Lord of
Lords and King of Kings inspire their Hearts
with full resolutions to do these things Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
and Speedily, that the whole Nation
may partake of the Blessed Fruit of it.</p>
            <p>And this is in some sort the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of you <hi>All:</hi> For here you may observe in
the Instance which is before us, that the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Israel</hi> executed Judgment on <hi>Achan:</hi>
They brought out this grievous Offender and
his Family, and first stoned them, and then
burnt them: They also brought forth the
<hi>Accursed</hi> things which had been stolen and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id, and dealt with them as things <hi>Devoted</hi>
and <hi>Cursed, i.e.</hi> they utterly destroy'd and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107741:126"/>
consumed them with Fire, and therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
obeyed the Order and Command that
God had given. When they had done this
they went against the King of <hi>Ai</hi>
and his People, and<note n="*" place="margin">Jos. 8. 22.</note> 
               <hi>smote them,
so that they let none of them remain or escape.</hi>
Let <hi>us</hi> learn hence our indispensable Duty at
this time: We must reform our selves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
The <hi>Magistrates</hi> are obliged more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
to punish Sin wherever they find
it, and we are <hi>All</hi> of us obliged to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what God hath enjoyned us; and then
we shall be a Victorious People. Never look
to thrive and prosper in Battel till you leave
off Fighting with God, till you resolve to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
his Commandments, and to conform your
Lives to the Laws which he prescribes you.
This is the very thing which was inculcated
by <hi>Ioshua</hi> when he was taking his farewell of
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and going the way of all Flesh;
he lets them know that if they will <hi>keep and
do all that is written in the Book of the Law of
Moses, so that they turn not aside therefrom, to
the right Hand or to the left,</hi> but that <hi>they cleave
unto the Lord their God,</hi> then <hi>one Man of them
should chase a Thousand,</hi> and <hi>the Lord their God
should Fight for them,</hi> Jos. xxiii. 6, 8, 10. then
they should see the happy Success of their
Arms. We who own the Honourable Name
of <hi>Christians</hi> have a <hi>Written Book of Laws, viz.</hi>
Those which were given us by Christ Jesus
our Blessed Lord. If we <hi>turn not aside from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107741:127"/>
these,</hi> but carefully endeavour <hi>to keep and do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
all that is contain'd in them, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
our Obedience by enabling us to chase
our Enemies, though they be never so Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
If we may credit Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
there appeared to <hi>Constantine the Great</hi>
in his Expedition against <hi>Maxentius</hi> a <hi>Cross,</hi>
an Auspicious, Sign, in the Heavens with
this Inscription on it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>In or by this
overcome.</hi> The <hi>Cross</hi> without Doubt was the
Emblem of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which is the Holy
Institution of a Crucified Saviour. By this
you shall Conquer, by conscientiously Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Rules of this most Holy Religion, by
Living and Acting according to the Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Gospel you shall vanquish your
most implacable Foes.</p>
            <p>You see then your Duty and your Interest:
You must abandon your Sins and cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God with full purpose of Heart, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
you can never prosper. The very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
had this Notion that the only way to
be Conquerors was to have the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
with them: Accordingly when ever
they went to War (as well as in other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and difficulties) they constantly pack'd
up their <hi>Gods,</hi> and carried them with them,
thinking that they were never safe without
them, and especially that they could not
prosper in Battel unless their Gods went
with them. Upon this perswasion the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans</hi>
thought themselves Secure whilst they
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107741:127"/>
had the Image of <hi>Pallas</hi> with them: And the
City is said to have been destroy'd as soon as
that was gone. Upon the same Ground it
was the usual Custom of the <hi>Pagans</hi> to call
forth the <hi>Gods of the Place</hi> before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd
it, they perswading themselves that as
long as They were there, it was in vain to
assault it, for They would defend them from
all Danger. Upon the like apprehension some
of the Heathens used to tie up their God's,
and fasten them with Chains, that they might
not go away and leave them, as several Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Witness. All this shews that they
were perswaded of this, that <hi>God's being with
them</hi> was the Foundation of Success and Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.
Let <hi>us</hi> much more, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the only True God, fix this upon our
Minds that his Presence is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in order to Success and victory. There
is never any Good Fighting without his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
And 'tis as certain that we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have This as long as we continue in our
Sins. We cannot with any reason expect the
Blessing of God to be with us till we amend
our Lives. Indeed it is a high piece of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
and Effrontery to imagine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
A Vitious and wicked Life will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
quash and frustrate all our Warlike
Enterprizes. I hope the serious Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this will make you improve the Time
of <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Humiliation</hi> which is set apart
Monthly by our Church to the great and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107741:128"/>
worthy Designs of it, namely the Abhorring
of your former evil Ways, and the speedy
Reforming of your Lives. We are apt to
trust too much to the Goodness of our Cause,
in the mean time looking not to our Sins, nor
taking care to Remove that which provokes
God. But let us remember this, that it is not
enough to have a Good Cause, unless our
Lives be Good also. There is a necessity of
our being Religious and Righteous in order
to being blessed in the Enterprizes of War.
Let every one of you then begin to amend
and reform himself, and by this means you
will promote a General Reformation. If one
<hi>Achan</hi> brought a Curse on the whole people
of <hi>Israel,</hi> then one Holy Penitent who hath
been a Great Sinner, but becomes as Eminent
for his Repentance, may bring a Blessing on
the whole Community. Not only the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to which such a Person belongs, not only
the City or Town he lives in, but the whole
Nation may fare the better for him. If but a
few of you will be brought to a sight of your
Sins and a reformation of your Ways, I hope
even <hi>that</hi> will derive a Blessing on the whole
Kingdom. Or, if you will but come to this,
to be <hi>Ashamed</hi> of what is past, and heartily
to <hi>Intend</hi> and <hi>Purpose</hi> to amend your Ways
for the future, even <hi>this</hi> may be accepted of
God, and our Forces both at Land and Sea
may feel the happy Effect of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:107741:128"/>
You see, my Brethren, what is the Design
of This Discourse: It is no other than This,
to put you into the way of being Victorious.
That which I have said doth indeed <hi>more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi>
concern Those who personally and
actually engage in the Wars at this time.
They must leave their Sins behind them, their
Prophane and Blasphemous Swearing, their
Love of Drunkenness and Uncleanness, and
the rest of their Sins which they formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
themselves in. If I had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of speaking in the Ears of These Men, I
should be very Plain with them, and let them
understand how they endanger both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and us by the Cherishing those Vile and
Abominable Vices. I should very warmly
urge upon them their Present Duty, and most
affectionately beseech them that they would
not destroy both themselves and us, and the
whole Nation, by continuing in the Love or
Practice of those Crying Sins. Can those
Forces prosper which are led forth against
the Enemy with Oaths and Curses in their
mouths? Will not this almost spoil <hi>the Word
of Command?</hi> Can Men of Prophaneness and
Debauchery successfully defend a <hi>Reformed
Religion?</hi> The God of Heaven, who hath
the Hearts of all Men at his disposal, and can
change and turn them as he pleaseth, reform
and reclaim this sort of Persons, and inable
them to ingage in the Service of their <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Country,</hi> and (which is above these) of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107741:129"/>
their <hi>Religion,</hi> with a hearty renouncing of
their former evil Ways, and with a hatred of
their past Miscarriages, that God may be
pleas'd to cover their Heads in the Day of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
and to make them the happy Instruments
of conveying Victory and Peace, Safety and
Prosperity to the Whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But you that hear me this day, you that
are at Home as well as they that are in the
Camp, you that are on Land as well as those
that are Abroad at Sea, are nearly concern'd
in This Discourse. You that are not engaged
in Battel, are to abandon and forsake your
Sins no less than those who are actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Wars. This is evident from the
forenamed place, <hi>Deut. xxiii. 9. When the Host
goeth forth against thy enemy, then keep thee from
every wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ked thing.</hi> It is a Text that we should
constantly bear in our Minds whilst the War
continues. Our Host is now going forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Enemy; see that you observe this
Injunction; dare not to act those Sins which
you have heretofore been addicted to. Whilst
the Host is gone to fight with the Adversary,
do you grapple with your Sins, endeavour to
subdue and conquer them, and bring them
under. <hi>Keep your selves now, now</hi> especially
<hi>from every wicked thing.</hi> Let him that Swore
swear no more, let him that Cheated and
Defrauded, him that Injur'd and Oppress'd
his Neighbour, be no longer guilty of those
Crimes. Let him that lived in Drunkenness
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107741:129"/>
or Lewdness leave off those Wicked Courses:
And whatever other Sin any Person was given
to, let him do so no more, but let him pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
the contrary Virtues and Graces. This
must be done if you hope to hear any good
Tidings from our Forces and Fleets. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as you behave your selves here, you must
expect your Success will be there. There is
nothing more certain than this, That the Sins
and Disorders of a People at Home are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
punish'd and reveng'd Abroad, in the
Field, or on the Sea. Therefore take heed
what you do; sin not wilfully against God,
especially at such a Juncture as this. If you
would subdue your Enemies, you must make
God your Friend; and this you cannot do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you renounce your Lusts, and leave off
the Practice of Vice. Observe it, before God
would send <hi>Gideon</hi> against the <hi>Midianites (i.e.</hi>
to fight them) he caused him to purge the
Land of Idolatry, as you may read in <hi>Iudges</hi>
vi. 25, 26. <hi>Baal</hi>'s Altars were pluck'd down,
and the Worship of the True God was set up.
If <hi>Baal</hi> stands, <hi>Israel</hi> falls; if Idolatry be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
the <hi>Midianites</hi> will get the better; but
whilst the <hi>Israelites</hi> draw their Swords, and
hew down <hi>Baal,</hi> they do but whet them, and
sharpen their Edge against their Enemy. You
see then how greatly you are concerned to
amend your Lives, and to renounce your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sins, for those are your <hi>Idols.</hi> Unless
you do this you cannot reasonably expect that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107741:130"/>
God will will give a Blessing to our Military
Undertakings, that he will stem the Raging
Torrent of <hi>France,</hi> and curb the Fury of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces. <hi>Moses</hi>'s words are remarkable,
<hi>O that they were wise, that they would consider their
latter End,</hi> and thereby be stir'd up to amend
their doings: <hi>How should one chase a Thousand,
and two put ten thousand to flight? Deut.</hi> xxxii.
29, 30. As much as to say, a Religious and
Penitent people are a <hi>Wise</hi> people, and such
will prove <hi>Victorious</hi> in a most wonderful
manner. That you may be the latter, be
careful to be the former: That your Arms
may be bless'd with Conquest, lay down
your Sins, forsake every beloved Vice. To
conclude all with the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s words,
<hi>Through God we shall do valiantly,</hi> but then we
must vanquish our Lusts: <hi>He it is that shall
tread down our Enemies,</hi> but not unless we do
so to our Vices, unless we heartily bewail our
Sins, and the Sins of the Nation, and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolve from henceforth to abandon our
Wicked Ways, and to reform our Lives, and
to live more like <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> than
we have hitherto done.</p>

            <p>But I shall wave this Consideration of them
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107741:131"/>
at present, and take them in their Absolute
capacity and meaning; that is, as they are
an excellent Maxim or Aphorism, or a most
Useful Observation in Government, and the
ordering of Publick Societies and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Being thus consider'd they are resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into this Proposition, that <hi>there is not a
more infallible Crisis of the Ruin and Downfal
of a Kingdom than their Divisions and Breaches
among themselves.</hi> I say, <hi>not a more infallible
one,</hi> for of all the Signs and Fore-runners of a
Nations Ruin, this proves the most Certain
and Unquestionable, this proves the most
Unerring and Fatal Omen, When you see
Intestine Quarrels, Contentions and Digla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations
grow high in a Nation, and when
you observe a general aversness in Men to
Peace and Reconcilement, then conclude that
an Universal Devastation is hastning on. It
is a Memorable Parable which you meet
with in the Prophecy of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> where
under the Representation of <hi>Bottles filled with
Wine</hi> the Ruinous Estate of the <hi>Iews</hi> is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. xiii. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>I will fill all the Inhabitants of the Land,
saith the Lord, with Drunkenness: And I will
dash them one against another; I will not pity
nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.</hi> A
Spirit of <hi>Drunkenness</hi> shall possess them, they
shall experience the worst sort of <hi>Intoxication,</hi>
they shall <hi>be drunk, but not with Wine</hi> (as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ther Prophet expresseth it) they shall Reel and
Stagger, they shall be Dissettled and Divided,
they shall (like the Clubs of Debauched Men)
be fill'd with Noise and Clamour, they shall
Quarrel and Fight with one another; there
shall be no Harmony, no Concord and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thus <hi>the Inhabitants of a Land are fill'd
with Drunkenness:</hi> And this is always the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sign of their <hi>being dashed one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
of their being Ruined and Destroyed.

that <hi>We</hi> of <hi>These</hi> Nations, We of this Island

Take the <hi>Four Great Monarchies</hi> of the
World, and there you will find the Truth of
this exemplified and confirm'd. The Division
of the First Universal Empire, by reason of the
<hi>Babylonians, Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi> mutually stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
among themselves, and breaking in upon
one another, procured their Dissolution, and the

               <hi>Babylon is fallen;</hi> which
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107741:132"/>
had reference to the Ruin of that Monarchy by
the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians, viz.</hi> when <hi>Belshazar</hi> the
last King of <hi>Babylon</hi> was slain, and <hi>Darius</hi> the
<hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> took the Kingdom.
It is true, this Monarchy lasted thrice as long
as any that succeeded it, but the reason was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was not so much Division in the
World at first. And if we look into the
next, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Medo-Persian Empire,</hi> mixt and
various in its very Make, which is express'd
in <hi>Daniel</hi> by<note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. vii. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Three Ribs,</hi> we shall find that
its <hi>Different</hi> and <hi>Disagreeing Temper</hi> contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to its Downfal, and that in a short time.
But this is more evident and visible in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
that is, the <hi>Greek Monarchy,</hi> which
was whole and entire all the time of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
the Great (the First Founder of it) but
afterwards being divided among his Captains
(who are meant by the<note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. viii. 8.</note> 
               <hi>four horns of the Ram</hi>
in <hi>Daniel)</hi> they and those that succeeded them
by their constant Jarrings and ambitious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachings
upon one anothers Allotments,
thereby rendred all those spacious Countreys
fit for the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest; and at last their
<hi>Divisions</hi> caused the actual Translation of the
Empire to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And so the <hi>Fourth
and last Monarchy</hi> was set up, which soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to have the same Fate with the others,
<hi>viz.</hi> when it came to be split into Two, the
<hi>Eastern</hi> and the <hi>Western Empire;</hi> which Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

Dream, materials of a <hi>different</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi>
Nature, which were not able to fasten and
cement together for any considerable time.
When the Empire was thus divided, it lasted
not long, for that part of it which was in the
<hi>West,</hi> was extinct in <hi>Augustulus;</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Moiety in the <hi>East</hi> decay'd in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Heraclius</hi>'s Reign, when the <hi>Saracens</hi>
revolted from him, and flock'd to <hi>Mahomet;</hi>
and it had its period in <hi>Constantine</hi> the Fifth;
for as for what remains in <hi>Germany</hi> in the House
of <hi>Austria</hi> at this day, it is a meer Title and a
Shadow.</p>
            <p>But I will be more <hi>Particular:</hi> The Sacred
History assigns This very thing which I am
now speaking of as the reason of the Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Destruction of the Antient <hi>Egyptian
Dynasty;</hi> for we read in the <hi>Burden of Egypt
(Isai.</hi> xix.) <hi>i.e.</hi> the Prophetick Denuntiation
against it, That <hi>the Egyptians were set against
the Egyptians, and they fought every one against
his Brother, and every one against his Neighbour,
City against City, and Kingdom against King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
ver. 2. And this is further express'd in
ver. 14. <hi>The Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit
in the midst thereof;</hi> which points at the Cause
and Source of their mutual Distractions: These
proceeded from a <hi>Spirit of Perversenesses</hi> (as 'tis
in the <hi>Hebrew) a Spirit of Giddiness,</hi> as the

                  </gap> Latin</hi> well explains it. Being acted by
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107741:133"/>
this, they cross'd and plagued one another;
their Counsels, Designs and Undertakings
were contrary. Being intoxicated with this
Vertiginous Spirit <hi>they stagger'd like a drunken
man,</hi> as it follows in that forementioned Verse.
This weakning of one another by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Oppositions gave occasion to <hi>Psammiticus,</hi>
who was then King but of one Province, to
encroach upon the rest, and to engross the
whole Dominion of <hi>Egypt</hi> to himself, by help

Or, as we are more fully to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Words, their Wars and Dissentions
among themselves made way for the <hi>Assyrian</hi>
Invasion (of which you read in <hi>Isai.</hi> xx. 4.)
which proved very Fatal and Mischievous to
them.</p>
            <p>The Sacred Records acquaint us that the
unhappy Dividing of <hi>Israel</hi> into two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
which before was One and Entire, so
enfeebled that People that at length it ended
in their Ruin. For from the Ten Tribes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Separated and Rent from the other Two,
proceeded all their Civil Wars and Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at Home: And this also made way for the
Conquests by the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Kings, and was at

Enemies to be the most advantageous and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing that could have happen'd,</hi> and crying
out, That <hi>it was from a Divine Hand that their
Enemies were turn'd against themselves.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Emperor's Son (as the same Author
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:107741:136"/>
informs us) observing these deadly Feuds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, told his Soldiers, when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them to be very eager of falling upon
the <hi>Iews,</hi> That <hi>he delay'd a while to do this,
that thereby their Dissentions might be increas'd
and grow more raging, and by that means they
might fall by their own hands, and be consumed
by their implacable Quarrels among one another:
Whereas, if he should break in upon them present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this would be a cause of their Agreement, and
move them to join together against the Common
Foe.</hi> Therefore, to pacify his Soldiers, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
them that <hi>God knew what was better for
them than themselves did, and had so ordered the
present Affair, that the</hi> Jews <hi>should be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up to them without labour, and that Victory
should be given them without undergoing any
great Fatigue and Danger. Whilst their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Perish'd by their own hands, and were Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
by the greatest of Evils,</hi> viz. <hi>Their Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Sedition, they should only be Spectators of their
Mischiefs, but not be forced to fight with those Men
who greedily sought after Death, and were grown mad
with intestine Slaughter and Bloodshed.</hi> Thus <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
represents <hi>Titus</hi> speaking to his Soldiers.
It is true, at last (as the same Historian goes
on to observe,) when it was too late, all
their Discords ceas'd, all the Seditious Parties
began to unite in one: When the War grew
hotter, and the <hi>Romans</hi> approach'd nearer to
them, then they began to bewail their former
Madness, and to say to one another, <hi>we have
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107741:137"/>
hitherto shew'd our fortitude and va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Quarrels we have weakn'd our selves and

            <p>To pass from <hi>Iudea</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> it is manifest
that the Inhabitants of this Country, after

            <p>To pass from <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> even to

Empire</hi> became <hi>Christian,</hi> one cause of
its declining was the Division of it by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Great, <hi>viz.</hi> when he Translated
the Imperial Seat into <hi>Greece,</hi> whereby in a
short time the <hi>Eagles</hi> Head was divided, and
its Body by degrees Impair'd and Shatter'd.
Whilst the Government was One and Entire,
it was Stable and Firm, but as soon as it
came to be Parted, it lost its pristine Vigour,
and grew Weak and Feeble. It was upon
this Division of the Empire that those <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
Nations the <hi>Gothes</hi> (distinguish'd into
<hi>Vise Gothes</hi> and <hi>Ostro Gothes)</hi> the <hi>Hunns,
Vandals, Longobards,</hi> and Others (whose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Names</hi> are as Barbarous as Themselves
were) left their Cold and Barren Countries,
and cross'd the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Danube</hi> to settle
themselves in warmer Habitations.</p>
            <p>But (which is yet more to our purpose)
when these <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations, like a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Deluge, over-ran the fairest Realms of
<hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Frayes</hi> and <hi>Dissentions</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
made way for them. That which chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Encouraged and Promoted the incursion
of these Barbarians was the Disagreeings and
Animosities in the Church. <hi>Socrates</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
observes this, that at the same time
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107741:138"/>
that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Clergy persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
other Dissenting Christians, the <hi>Gothes</hi> and
<hi>Longobards</hi> invaded <hi>Italy.</hi> The fourth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
had abounded with <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> (as
well as Heresies:) And behold, as the Effect
as well as Recompence of these, the fifth
Century labour'd under an other sort of
Plagues, <hi>viz.</hi> the Irruption of those Savages,
partly <hi>Pagans</hi> and partly <hi>Arians,</hi> who miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
Persecuted the Orthodox Christians in
<hi>Italy, Spain, France,</hi> and other Countries.
The Church might justly ascribe this to their
own Home-Divisions. Those Dreadful things,
it is probable, had never come to pass, if the
<hi>Christians</hi> had not been Shatter'd and Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
among themselves, if they had not
swarm'd with Various Opinions, and fill'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place with Disputes and Controversies; if
they had not mangled and corrupted many
Heads of the Christian Faith, if their Bishops
had not been Haughty and Proud, and not
only despised and vilified their Inferior Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
but likewise had Jarr'd with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
in short, if both Governors and People
had not been given to Tearing and Rending
amongst themselves, and if a Spirit of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
had not possess'd them beyond all Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism.
Thus it happen'd to the Church in the
fifth Century.</p>
            <p>Again, to touch upon an other Coast of
History, when in <hi>Arabia Felix</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and
the adjoyning Countries, several Sects and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107741:139"/>
Parties of Christians had sprung up, as <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites,
Maronites, Eutychians, Nestorians,
Monothelites,</hi> &amp;c. then in that very <hi>Arabia</hi>
(but no longer to be call'd the <hi>Happy)</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
the Grand Impostor <hi>Mahomet.</hi> He
and his Successors got up, and gain'd Ground
not only there but in other Places by the
many Disputes and Parties which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Christians. And whilst the Churches
of <hi>Ierusalem, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianly
contended about Priority, and
such like Points, the <hi>Turks</hi> came and decided
the Controversy. This is now known to be
a Great Truth, and not to be doubted of, that
the <hi>Mahometan Empire</hi> arose from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
in the <hi>East,</hi> when the <hi>Churches</hi> were
torn asunder with the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Manichean</hi>
Doctrines. For this <hi>Dissention</hi> bred in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Men an hatred of the Christian Religion,
and of the very Name of it; and then any
Opinion or Doctrine, especially if grateful
to the Flesh, could not but be easily enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
and embraced. Is it not fad to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that the Vilest Cheat in the World,
That of <hi>Mahometism</hi> was foster'd and set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by the <hi>Differences</hi> of those who were
of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion? And afterwards it
was no wonder that when the <hi>Greek</hi> Church
was divided within it self (into <hi>Armeni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns,
Georgians, Iacobites</hi> &amp;c.) it was oppressed
by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> and quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
by them. Their own Divisions armed
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107741:139"/>
these People against them, their Quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves put Weapons into the
Hands of their Enemies, and helpt them to
Vanquish them. To make this Reflection
the more Authentick, I will give it you as
it is represented in<note n="*" place="bottom">Against the peril of Idolatry. <hi>Part</hi> 2.</note> one of the <hi>Homilies</hi> of
our Church: Where after it was observ'd
that the Dissention of the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi>
Christians was very much promoted by the
Quarrel about <hi>Images,</hi> the Conclusion is this
<q>So that when the <hi>Saracens</hi> first, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Turks</hi> invaded the Christians,
the one part of Christendom would not
help the other. By reason whereof at last
the Noble Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the City
Imperial <hi>Constantinople</hi> was lost, and came
into the Hands of the Infidels.</q> And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after, <q>Thus a Sea of Mischiefs
was brought in, a horrible Schism between
the <hi>East</hi> and the <hi>West</hi> Church, an hatred
between one Christian and another, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
against Councels, Church against
Church, Christians against Christians,
Princes against Princes, at last the tearing
in sunder of Christendom, and the Empire
in two Pieces, till the <hi>Infidels, Saracens</hi> and
<hi>Turks,</hi> common Enemies to both parts,
have most cruelly Vanquish'd, Destroy'd
and Subdued the one part, and have won
a great Piece of the other Empire, and put
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107741:140"/>
the whole in dreadful Fear and most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Danger.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Still in pursuance of the Argument I am
upon, I might remind you that the <hi>Discord
of Christians</hi> was it which lost <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it had been held by them Successively a
long time, after it had cost them so much
Blood in their several Expeditions and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sades.
The <hi>Saracens</hi> strength in the Holy
Land accrued by the Misunderstandings of
the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> when the <hi>Holy War</hi>
was turn'd into <hi>Civil Dissentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Turcism</hi> arose and increased by the
Dissentions of Christians, so it is easy to prove
that <hi>Popery</hi> had the same Rise and Advance;
for there is abundant History to make it
clear that by Divisions in Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in the Church in the first Ages those
Corruptions first crept in. Especially by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the Dissention among Christian <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> the Papal Religion ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to what it is: For whenever These fell

was<note n="*" place="bottom">Isaac. Voss. de artib. Sinarum,</note> the Discords of this Kingdom

            <p>But I will not wander so far, but come

with relation to this Land of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
They were the Civil Wars of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Britains</hi> which tempted <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> to
invade this Island at first. This was the Rise
of the <hi>Romans</hi> coming hither, and this was
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107741:141"/>
the occasion of the <hi>Britains</hi> being conquered.
It is evident from the most Credible Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that our <hi>Ancestours,</hi> a very warlike and
valiant People, were vanquished rather by
the Perfidiousness of their own <hi>Androgeus,</hi>
and the Quarrels of others among themselves
than by the valour and force of the Invaders:
For they tell us that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was invited
over by that <hi>Androgeus,</hi> who at that time
quarrell'd with <hi>Cassibelan</hi> and other Great
Men; and so <hi>Caesar</hi> fought and overcame,
and made this Island tributary to <hi>Rome.</hi>
Though it is true, this was not presently Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
but after several Assaults: For the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
who were not inferior to the <hi>Roman
Legions</hi> in Valour, repuls'd them at first, and
<hi>Caesar</hi> fled from <hi>Britain.</hi> Of this Juncture of
Affairs <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaks, acquainting us that the
<hi>Britains</hi> fell into Factions and Parties, and
could not agree among themselves to resist
the common Danger:<note n="*" place="bottom">Ita dum singuli pugnant, universi vincuntur. Tac. in vit. Agricolae.</note> So whilst they fought
divided, they were joyntly defeated. And
in succeeding Ages there never was any great
Enemy entred this Kingdom but when there
were Schisms and Distractions at home.
Whether other Nations were invited over
hither, or invaded us, it was always occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
by Dissention among our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:107741:141"/>
There different People successively took
the Opportunity of overrunning our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
when our Bickrings and Digladiations were
great in our own Bowels. It was this which
gave occasion to the <hi>Saxons</hi> to <hi>invade</hi> this
Land, or (if you will rather) to our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
to <hi>call them in;</hi> for the <hi>Picts,</hi> who
were the Old Barbarous <hi>Britains,</hi> were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the rest of the Nation, and held
Confederacy with the <hi>Scots.</hi> Therefore <hi>Gildas</hi>
expressly sheweth that one cause of the fatal
Councel of sending for the <hi>Saxons</hi> to come
and assist them, was their Disagreement and
Contention among themselves: The <hi>Southern</hi>
and <hi>Northern</hi> Inhabitants were at odds, which
moved <hi>Vortigern</hi> the Head of the Natives at
that time to send for those <hi>Saxons,</hi> who came
over and miserably requited the <hi>Britains</hi> for
the care they shew'd to them, and the kind
Entertainment they gave them, and with
many and long Battels made this Land a
place of Slaughter, Ravage and Bloodshed.
And afterwards, these very <hi>Saxons</hi> (who
seem'd to have made amends for all their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
and mischief by the ardent Zeal which
they shew'd to the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith as soon as
'twas Preach'd among them, by their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

In brief, the former State of things
in this Nation, immediately fore-going the
several devastations by Foreign Invasion, hath
in <hi>This</hi> (as well as in some other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances)
too near an Alliance and Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with our Present Times. I pray <hi>God</hi>
avert the Omen.</p>
            <p>And let <hi>us</hi> endeavour (for now I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to turn my History into <hi>Application)</hi> let
<hi>us,</hi> I say, endeavour to avert it by the most
Proper Means we can use, that is, by studying
Peace and Unity, and by promoting Love
and Goodwill among one another. This is
the Practical Inference which we are to make
from the Premises. And certainly, if ever
there was need of Preaching and Practising
this duly, there is <hi>now</hi> more especially. We
have been, and are at this Day a People <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
against our selves,</hi> and therefore it is a
wonderful Prodigy that we have not had our
final Downfal before this. But <hi>now</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reasonably expect <hi>to stand any longer,</hi> if
we continue in our Divisions, and persist in
our mutual Antipathies. Let us then <hi>in this
our Day know the things which belong to our
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:107741:142"/>
Peace, before they be hid from our Eyes,</hi> and
that for ever. Let us agree as Members of
the same Community, and banish all Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Animosities. I know this hath
been a very Common and Trite Subject: But
assure your selves that at this time it is the
most Proper and Suitable one that a Preacher
can entertain you with: For on the speedy
Practice of this depends all your Safety, all
your Security, all your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wellfare and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in this World. If you neglect this, you
plunge your selves into Ruin; but if you are
so wise as to attend to it, you contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Establishment of the Nation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the lasting Prosperity of the Publick.
<hi>Amphion</hi> is said (in a Poetick rant) to have

But it is no Fiction, but a solid Truth

and acknowledge none to be our Enemies

to our Religion, that is, those who have a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:107741:143"/>
design to Rob us of that which is dearer to
us than our Lives. And to urge this Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
upon you, I will offer these following
Considerations to you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> Consider the <hi>Scandal</hi> of our Divisions.
It is a Reproach to our Religion, as we are
<hi>Christians,</hi> that we nourish so many Feuds
and Disturbances among us. For the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Author and Founder of our Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the <hi>Peace-makers blessed,</hi> and made
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> the honourable Badges of our
Profession; and we find that all the excellent
Principles of the Gospel lead to these, and
that Christianity it selfe inculcates nothing
more than the Practice of them. But not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus in general, as we are <hi>Christians,</hi> but
in a more Especial manner as we are <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
we are under a strict Obligation of
mutual Amity and Agreement. There are
two things (among others) which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> glories in, first that they
perfectly agree among themselves; secondly
that we (on the contrary) are divided, and
break out into passionate Heats and Contests.
That there is too much of Truth in this their
Boasting we cannot den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> though with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the former part it must be said (and
that with equal Truth) that <hi>they</hi> have their
Divisions and Parties no less than we (as I
could easily prove if I were at leisure to do
it:) but 'tis granted that as to the Main they
are at Unity among themselves, that is, they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:107741:143"/>
perfectly agree to oppose the <hi>Protestant</hi> Cause:
<hi>They consult together with one consent, and are
confederate against it.</hi> This is the Great Prop
and Preservative of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this
buoys up the whole Papal Interest, <hi>viz.</hi> their
Agreement among themselves, their being all
of a Piece, <hi>viz.</hi> with relation to us. And is
it not a shame that <hi>we</hi> should learn of them
how to behave our selves? Do not our own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Necessity, and the Cause it self require
that we maintain an entire Concord? Must
we go to the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to be taught
our Duty in this Point? This is very Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
and I cannot mention it without a
peculiar Disdain and Regret, nor can you
hear it without Blushes. If <hi>we</hi> had been as

are for the <hi>Roman,</hi> we should long since have
baffl'd their Cause, and defeated their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
against us. But alas herein we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
and with shame we may publish it
to the World. Do they agree together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, and shall not we do so against
them? Can they friendly Unite to do us Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and shall not we as amicably Agree to
hinder that Mischief? Let us not suffer our
selves to be outdone by them here. If they
shew themselves such Fierce Disturbers of
our Peace both Ecclesiastical and Civil, let
us be as Forward and Zealous in promoting
Peace in our Church and State, a Religious
and a Politick Peace. Let us agree as <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:107741:144"/>
who are but a small Number in the World
(a Sixth part of it, as is computed:) And
let us agree as <hi>Protestants,</hi> whose Numbers
are yet sewer, and therefore we are oblig'd
to adhere to one another, and to maintain a
firm League among our selves. In short, let
us not by our Quarrels and Dissentions scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
<hi>Christianity,</hi> or (more particularly)
the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> which is the Choisest
part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Consider the <hi>Vnseasonableness</hi> of our
Divisions. Though by the late Change of
Affairs, and the Happy Revolution in this
Nation God hath vouchsafed us such a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
as is next to a Miracle; such a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
as the present Age ought to stand
astonish'd at, and which future Ages will
scarcely believe, by reason of the strange sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
and unheard of Circumstances which
attended it, especially this one (which is most
remarkable) that whereas such Great<note n="*" place="bottom">

this had nothing of that Nature, but was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
wholly by gentle and free Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
Yet what great Numbers of Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us shew themselves Discontented, and
therein Unthankful for that Amazing Blessing
confer'd on this Nation? All the Return they
make for God's singular Mercy and unparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd

and are for going back into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
though (blessed be God) they are not in a

some Persons; When God's wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
invites them to Thankfulness, and
to join in one Common Affection, as they
are Fellow-Christians and Fellow-Protestants,
at this time especially when we are of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
ingag'd against a Foreign Adversary, they
(notwithstanding this) are unwilling to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten

up their former Antipathies, yea add greater
and fiercer ones to them. <hi>France</hi> lifts up its
Bloody Weapons against us; and shall we at
such a time Fight with one another? Sons of
<hi>Belial</hi> are conspiring against the Life of our

of our Enemies is to have us divided from
one another; that they may all unite in our
Ruin. Their business hath been to set us at
odds, with a respect wholly to their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
Advantage: For 'tis certain that
whilst we <hi>devour one another,</hi> we shall become
a Prey to them. Any considerate Man may
see that it is the studied Practice of those that
are Agents for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to sow
the Seeds of Discord in <hi>Protestant</hi> Countries,
and more especially in this of ours. They
have a long time made it their Work, and at
this Day they pursue it with more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

they may thereby smooth the Way to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

is that which our Adversaries of <hi>Rome</hi> have
labour'd to effect ever since the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
and we find that they have been too Success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in it. Let us learn to defeat this Politick
Design by being Entire and Unanimous,
which they so much dread and tremble at.
Let us never be so Sottish as to side with our
Profess'd Enemies: But since we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
that it is their main Study and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
to raise Dissention among us, and
then to increase it, let us be Masters of so

to prevent all Breaches, or else with all
speed to close them up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Consider the Extreme Danger of
our Divisions. What can we expect but
Confusion, and even an utter Extinction if
we are thus miserably Disjoyn'd? We shall
unavoidably bring down all mischiefs upon
us if we take no care to cure our Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Distractions within us. It hath been
observ'd that <hi>England</hi> hath ever been so
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107741:148"/>
               <hi>Strong and Long-lived an Animal that it could

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine with our own Hands,
we need not fear the Attempts of others.
We can never Perish unless we are <hi>Felons
of our selves.</hi> O that this Nation were so
wise as to understand this! O that they
were so Prudent as to consider that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Papal Beast</hi> breaks in upon us, so
as to do us any great Harm, it must be
occasion'd by our own Discords and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions!
Our Divisions at home will make
us feel the Mischief of Invasion from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
Nay, let it be remember'd that a
<hi>Kingdom divided against it self,</hi> although it
be assaulted by no Foreign Foe, <hi>cannot
stand, but shall be brought to Confusion. If
we bite and devour one another, we shall be
consumed one of another:</hi> Not unlike the
Dragons Teeth <hi>Cadmus</hi> is said to have sown,
which grew up into an Army combating
one another. By our own unnatural Heats
we not only prepare our selves to be ruin'd
by Others, but we may be undone this
way by our Own Hands.</p>
            <p>Sit down then, and seriously represent
to your selves the <hi>Danger</hi> you are in. Fix
this on your Minds as an unquestionable
Truth, that we may despair of the Safety
and Welfare of this Nation so long as
we are divided into Disagreeing Parties,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107741:148"/>
so long as we love to keep up our Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels.
Though we may think we have
shut out <hi>Popery,</hi> yet these will open the
Door for it, and let it in again. This
very thing was the Ground of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Pious <hi>Vsher</hi>'s fearful Apprehensions
and prophetick Intimations concerning the
return of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion into these
Kingdoms, and the miserable State they
were like to fall into on that Account, as
you may read in his <hi>Life. We</hi> may on
the same Ground fear the same dismal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
at this time. If we continue our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
the Great <hi>Italian Pontif</hi> will step
in, and turn Moderator, and put an End
to our Disputes: <hi>The Romans will come, and
take away both our Place and Nation:</hi> And
we shall then wish (but in vain) that we
had attended to the Dictates of peaceable
Men, and that we had lay'd aside all our
Differences. So for <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi>
though we imagine that they are shut out,
yet let me tell you, whilst we disagree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our selves, and retain Bitterness and
Rancour towards one another in our Minds,
and carry on Different, yea contrary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
we are making way for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Foe</hi> to enter, who (if he gets footing
here) will reduce us and our Posterity to
the utmost Servitude and Bondage, and
that without all hopes of Remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:107741:149"/>
These are the <hi>Considerations</hi> which I thought
fit to tender to you. And now perhaps it
may be expected (before I put an end to this
Discourse) that I should set before you the
<hi>Particular Methods</hi> of Peace in this unhappy
Day of Dissention. If you would permit
me to be free with you, I could, methinks,
entertain good hopes of being an <hi>Vniversal
Reconciler,</hi> of making Dissenting Parties <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
one another aright</hi> (the want of which
hath been the Source of all their Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies)
and so of Accommodating the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between them, and of creating a firm
Love and Respect to one another. I could,
I think, suggest such <hi>Healing,</hi> such <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick</hi>
Principles, as would assuredly Cure and
Consolidate all our Wounds, if they be taken
in hand in time, and not suffer'd to grow In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate.
But seeing I cannot at present so
Particularly and Fully pursue this great Work
as I would, (and perhaps some here are not
able to bear it now) the only Direction I
will propound, the only Expedient I will
leave with you is this, That <hi>you would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
your Differences in some lesser Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to hinder your Vniting in the Great and
Common Concern of the Nation.</hi> This one thing
alone, if duly thought of and practis'd, will
make our <hi>British</hi> State Impregnable, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
us to defy all our Enemies. Many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us are to foolish as to think that they
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107741:149"/>
must not join with those that are of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Perswasion from themselves; because
they disagree in some Points of Religion,
therefore they must not unite in the Common
Cause of the Nation; or, at least, they find
they can't prevail with themselves to do it
Unanimously and Chearfully. This very
thing may prove our Ruin, and therefore I
thought my self obliged to take Notice of it;
and I hope I need not use many Words to
convince you of the Folly and Unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it. Let me be plain with you, an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion</hi>
will make no Difference between a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist</hi>
and a <hi>Dissenter;</hi> a <hi>Foreign Enemy</hi> will
not distinguish between <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houses;</hi>
Assassines and Cut-Throats will
not ask whether we be of this or that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
And therefore let all of both Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
<hi>jointly</hi> agree to withstand the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Ravage which are design'd against
us all indifferently. This is the Course we
must take, unless we would have <hi>the Enemies
roar in our Congregations, and set up their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
for signs,</hi> viz. of Victory. And to this
purpose let us remember that we are <hi>All</hi> of us
Embark'd in the same Vessel, we Espouse the
same Common Interest, we profess the same
Holy Religion, and we are Candidates of the
same Eternal Happiness. Wherefore let us
twist all our Interests together: Let us in this
Critical Season make no distinction between
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:107741:150"/>
the different Denominations of <hi>Sober Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
that are among us. When we are to
ingage the Publick Enemy, let us make no
nice <hi>Detachments,</hi> but go with <hi>All our Forces.</hi>
Let us freely mingle with all that abhor the
designs of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> Let there be a
Free, an Universal Commerce, without any
Stop, any Imbargo. In short, let us take all
Persons into our Embraces that love the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion</hi> and their <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for our Disagreement in <hi>some</hi> Religious
Matters, that should not hinder us from join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, for there are several Points re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to Religion in which we shall never
all concur (and truly I am of Opinion it was
not intended we should) till that Blessed
Time predicted in <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 15. be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd.
<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. iii. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> as the
Apostle speaks, <hi>whereunto we have
already attain'd, let us walk by the same Rule,
let us mind the same Things.</hi> I will be
bold to say, if the <hi>fourteenth Chapter</hi> of the
<hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> were read over once
and again with serious and hearty Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
it would end all our disputes about
Indifferent matters in Religion, and put a
period to all our Divisions about them.
Contesting Parties would thence effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
learn to lay aside <hi>Censuring</hi> and <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
one another, and to sacrifice their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Opinions and Sentiments, yea their
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:107741:150"/>
greatest Heats and Passions, to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good</hi> and <hi>Edification.</hi> Let this be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously
Practis'd by us, and then we
cannot miscarry. Let us not contend with
Fierceness and Eagerness for any thing but
the Indispensable Concerns of Religion and
a Holy Life. Lay aside your nice Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisms,
stand not upon Punctilio's, be not
religiously Pedantick or Morose. Away
with fond Disputes which engender no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Strife: And let us in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
study the plain way of Salvation by
<hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> let us mind the Unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and Practical matters of Christianity,
where there is sure Footing, and a firm
Basis to build upon. Let us mind these in
good earnest, and then our varying from
some of our Brethren in lesser Concerns
of Religion, in some Points of Discipline,
or Circumstances of Worship, will not
hinder our friendly Conjunction with them
in those Publick Enterprizes which are
for the Safety of us all, and for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> which
I hope we all (without any reserve or
hesitation) center in.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the thing which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
offer, that the Interests of all Parties
may become One in this present Juncture,
that all Hands may be employ'd in this
Great Work, that there may be an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:107741:151"/>
Concurrence in the Cause which we
have undertaken. And this is the Way
to unite us more intimately among <hi>our
selves</hi> for the future, and to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a Profound and Lasting Peace: For
when we join together against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Adversary, surely we shall learn to
be friendly among one another. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this, I think, is as clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as any <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and therefore
there is no need of urging it. Let us with
united Hearts and Hands endeavour to
stem the Fury of the Great Oppressors and
Ravagers of Christendom, and not so much
as think of any of our Particular Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
so long as this General Concern requires
our Thoughts and Assistance.</p>
            <p>Suffer me to speak to you in a very
plain and familiar way: Suppose some great
City or Town were on Fire, do you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that that would be a fit time for
the Inhabitants, who are concern'd in that
Calamity, to come forth and busy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
only in renewing their former Grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and repeating the little Contests which
had heretofore been among the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
whilst in the mean time they are
unmindful of using the proper means for

               </gap>opping the Raging Flames, and hindring
their furious Advance towards their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings?
Just such is the Folly and Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:107741:151"/>
of those Persons who stand contending
and wrangling with one another, and revive
their former Debates at a time when there is
a General Conflagration in the World, at a
time when we are threatn'd by the Great
<hi>Boutefeues</hi> the Tremendous <hi>Firebrands</hi> abroad
at a time when there is so great a Number of
<hi>Incendiaries</hi> at home, striving to put us all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Combustion, at a time when our Divisions
are like to prove most Successful to our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Let us then all be Exhorted this Day
to Christian Agreement. Let us hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
become perfect <hi>Vnisons,</hi> and let no
Jarring be found amongst us. Let us wear
off our former Roughnesses, and become
Smooth, even and gentle, heartily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with one another, breathing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Love and Peace, that thereby
we may be a Happy and a Prosperous
Nation, and that <hi>Glory may dwell in our
Land.</hi> Though the <hi>Antient Britains</hi> (as
<hi>Tacitus</hi> truly observ'd of them) were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Faction and making of Parties,
yet let it not be said that the same Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
yet possesses this Nation. Let us shew
that we have the true Spirits of <hi>English</hi>
Men by being more Manly and Generous.
Let us detest and avoid those ill Men who
are forward rather to lay open the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies</hi>
of the Church and State than to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a <hi>Cure;</hi> who are more desirous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:107741:152"/>
our <hi>Diseases</hi> than to make use of
a <hi>Remedy:</hi> Who would continually raise
Commotions and Distractions amongst us,
and put us all into Flames: A most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
sort of Men, that are born to
Trouble, Plague and Embarass their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
who, if you will give them <hi>Footing,</hi>
(as he of old required) will <hi>shake the
Earth,</hi> and move the <hi>World</hi> out of its place:
A generation of Men that would involve
three Kingdoms in Blood and Slaughter
merely to indulge their groundless Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and to satisfy their own Lusts and
Bigotry. Let us shew our selves to be of
an other Temper by endeavouring to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond
with one another both in our
Sentiments and Affections: And where we
cannot wholly agree in the former, let us
perfectly accord in the latter. And let
us know this assuredly that we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
expect nothing but Confusion till
we be all touch'd with the same Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of Love and Charity, and so point
the same Way, and turn to the same Coast,
and till we conspire in one General and
Unanimous pursuance of the same Cause.
Then (and not before that time) the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Interest and Benefit of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
will, through the Blessing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
be advanced; then this Island
may enjoy many <hi>Halcyon</hi> Days, and be

Crown'd with an undisturbed Quiet and
Repose.</p>
            <p>What need I say more? Having spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to Wise and Understanding Persons, I
think I have said enough: And therefore
I have only this now in the Close to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

I request you then by all that is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
Religious and Venerable to compose
your selves into a quiet Posture, to purge
out your sower Ferments, to forget your
former Animosities and Oppositions. I
most Passionately beg of you that you
would not repeat your former <hi>Iustings</hi>
and <hi>Tiltings</hi> against one another, that you
would think no more of your unkind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections

Cancel your <hi>Philippicks</hi> and Invectives, and
burn all your <hi>Pasquils.</hi> Now, if ever, be
prevail'd with to bestow your <hi>Pardons</hi> and
<hi>Indulgences</hi> on one another; for this will be
the best <hi>Iubilee</hi> for procuring our Peace.
Now, if ever, forget not to pull down
your Rams of Battery, to cease your
Cannonading one another, to give check
to your former Hostilities, and to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all your Warlike Weapons. If you
must needs Strive, <hi>Strive</hi> and <hi>Contend for the

to assert and maintain the Necessary and

of late are so much Corrupted and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted:
Strive to excel and surpass one

Strive who shall be most Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary

In a Word, Strive to transcribe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

            <p>O God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ
our only Saviour, the Prince of Peace,
look down in much Pity and Compassion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Church and Nation, stir up, we beseech
thee, every Soul among us, to cast forth the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed

and causeless Iealousie, all Hatred and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,

hinder us from discerning the things that belong

do thou dispose all our Hearts to such meekness
of Wisdom, lowliness of Mind, Patience, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and long-suffering, and forbearance of
one another in Love, and such Honour and
Reverence of those whom thou hast set over
us, as becomes the Sons of Peace, that so the God

            <p>There is a fourfold <hi>Vse</hi> or <hi>Design</hi> of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.</hi>
The <hi>First,</hi> whereof is to hide, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d

               </gap>e
State of Innocency, when the Image of
God shined bright in the Soul of Man, the
very Nakedness of his Body was Beauty;
nor needed he any other Covering than his
Original Integrity and Righteousness;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:107741:155"/>
with God had adorn'd him; yet, when
he offended against Heaven, and defaced
the Image of his Maker, and became a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Creature, he was ashamed of the Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Body, and accordingly made
himself <hi>a Garment of Fig-leaves,</hi> 3 Gen. 7.
Afterwards God himself was pleas'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him, how to make a more substantial
and solid sort of Cloathing, <hi>viz. Coats of
Skins,</hi> v. 21. <hi>i.e.</hi> of the Skins or Hides of
Beasts. And ever afterwards, among the
Civilized Nations of the World, <hi>Garments</hi>
have been in use for the same End that they
were at first; that is, for Modesty sake.
About the Middle of the Fourteenth <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,</hi>
there arose an Heretical sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
call'd <hi>Adamites,</hi> who gain'd that Name,
because they imitated <hi>Adam</hi>'s Nakedness in
<hi>Paradice;</hi> for they contended, that since
the Restauration wrought by Christ, the
Pristine Nakedness should be resumed; and
Men and Women being now reduced to
the Primitive State of Innocency, ought to
go without Cloathing. But this silly Sect,
who divested themselves of Sobriety and
Reason, before they stript themselves of
their Apparel, were justly exploded by
wise and sober Men, and their Practice vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be unlawful, because the Fall hath
left a great Depravity in Men; and the best
of them are not perfectly healed of it: So
that we now have the like Reason to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:107741:156"/>
of our Nakedness, that our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
had to be of theirs, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we have need of a Covering, as they
had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Garments are for <hi>Distinction</hi>
sake. Different Habits are not only for the
differencing of the Sexes (and therefore the
<hi>Old Testament</hi> makes the promiscuous Use of
Men and Womens Apparel unlawful) but
for making a Discrimination between the
Qualities or Ranks of Persons. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in all Ages, (except the very first, when
there were but few People in the World,
and there was not such an occasion for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating
of Persons from one another)
the Qualities of Men were distinguish'd by
their respective Garbs. Not only Kings and
Queens were differenc'd from their Subjects
by their <hi>Royal Apparel, 6 Est.</hi> 8. but there were
Vestures proper and peculiar to other <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
and <hi>Dignities, Offices</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> of
Men, 1 <hi>Sam. 18. 4. 1 Iob 20. 4 Lam. 5.
15 Luk. 22. 16. 19. Ioseph</hi> refus'd not to
wear <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Ring, that he put upon his
Hand, nor <hi>to be aray'd in Vestures of fine
Linnen,</hi> and <hi>to wear a Gold Chain about his
Neck,</hi> 41 Gen. 42. <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi>
were cloath'd with rich and stately Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
suitable to the Degree they were
advanc'd to, 8 <hi>Esth. 15. 5 Dan. 29.</hi> We
read of <hi>precious Cloaths,</hi> or, according to
the <hi>Hebrew, Cloaths of Freedom, 27 Ezek.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:107741:156"/>
20. i.e.</hi> such Garments as became <hi>free</hi> and
<hi>ingenuous</hi> Men, such as those of the better
Quality were cloath'd with. Among the
old <hi>Romans,</hi> the Rank of Persons was
known by their Habits: The <hi>Purple Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd</hi>
Vesture, with large Studs, like broad
Nail's Heads (thence call'd <hi>Laticlavia)</hi> was
used only by the Senators and Noblemen.
Divers kinds of <hi>Shooes</hi> were worn at <hi>Rome,</hi>
according to the different Quality of the
Inhabitants: And the like Distinction of
Garbs hath been among All Nations. When
our Saviour tells us, That <hi>they who wear soft
Rayment are in Kings Houses,</hi> 11 Mat. 8.
he doth not condemn the Use of rich and
goodly Attire (which are meant by <hi>Soft Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</hi>
but he intimates this Distinction,
which I am now speaking of: And so it is as
much as if he had said, By their Habit you
may know them to be <hi>Courtiers.</hi> He allows
Men to be attir'd according to their Place
and Degree: Christianity doth not disrobe
Men of their Distinctive Garments: For this
was one Design of Apparel, <hi>viz.</hi> To discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
between Persons of an higher, and
a lower Degree. Yea, we read, that the
immediate Ministers of Religion among the
<hi>Iews,</hi> were according to God's Command
distinguish'd from the People, by a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Manner of Garb: Which was imitated
by others afterwards, and would, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
have been practis'd by the <hi>Apostles;</hi> and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:107741:157"/>
first Ecclesiastical Persons in the Christian
Church, if their Conspicuousness of the
Cloathing would not have made them too
much known to their Enemies, and so would
have been unsuitable to those Times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Garments are for Defence and
Protection: Those Primitive Ones of <hi>Skins</hi>
(not dress'd, but raw, it is likely) serv'd
for this Purpose also; for they were so
worn, that they were not only cool in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but warm in Winter (for it is not to
be doubted, that the Year had its <hi>Vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>
then.) I say it is probable, these <hi>Skins</hi>
were a Cool sort of <hi>Garment, viz.</hi> when
they wore the plain and smooth side next
them, and they were warm when the other
side, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Wool or Hair were worn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
It is certain, that one principal
Use of Cloaths hath been to shelter Persons
from the Injury and Inclemency of the
Weather: For which Reason it becomes a
great Act of Charity, to cloath the Poor
and Naked; and therefore is so often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in Scripture. And hence we read,
that upon the Death of that Religious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Dorcas,</hi> her pious Female Friends dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd
the Ensigns of her Charity (as well as
good House-wifery) <hi>viz. The Coats and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which she made whilst she was with them,
9 Acts 29.</hi> For this, without doubt, relates
to <hi>the good Works and Alms Deeds, which
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107741:157"/>
she did,</hi> v. 36. Such is generally the frail
Constitution of our Bodies, that they want
some Defence; and therefore Apparel is
useful to this Purpose: This not only keeps
out the Cold, but keeps in the Heat, the
inward Warmth, and vital Heat. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in excessive hot Climates, some sort of
Rayment is requisite to be a Guard from
the Scorching Sun. Thus on the Account
of <hi>Necessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> as well as <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,</hi>
Cloathing is serviceable to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is for Decency and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Though this be not one of the
chief Ends and Uses of it, yet it may be
reckon'd among the rest; as it is by those
who compiled our <hi>Homilies. If we consider</hi>
(say<note n="*" place="bottom">Homilies against the Excess of Apparel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> they) <hi>the End and Purpose whereunto
Almighty God hath ordained his Creatures, we
shall easily perceive, that he alloweth us Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
not only for Necessity's sake, but also for
an honest Comeliness.</hi> It may be observ'd,
that there are <hi>Extreams</hi> in this Matter of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel;
some are too effeminate and delicate
in their Attire, others are too neglectful
and sordid.
<q>Pastillos Rufillus olet, Gorgonius hircum.</q>
The one is too much Perfumed, the other
is Rank and Fetid: These are faulty in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Manner, but one is as blameable as
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:107741:158"/>
the other. There is a <hi>Middle</hi> Way between
these two, and that is most eligible, <hi>viz.</hi> a
Graceful and Comely Attire, that is neither
Lavish nor Loathsome. An utter neglect of
Apparel is certainly very culpable; especially
to place <hi>Religion</hi> in it, and to think (as some
Monks and Retired Devotionists do) it is
acceptable to God to put on a coarse Habit,
or to go in rags and tatters, to be patch'd and
clouted, and to wear old and torn Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
nay, to be nasty and sordid, to be
unclean and filthy in their Cloathing, is
intolerably ridiculous. Reason and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
forbid this, and more especially Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
which dictates Purity, not only of
Soul but Body. In this double Sense, the
Spouse of Christ may be said, to <hi>be arayed
in fine Linnen, clean and white,</hi> 19. Rev. 8.
There can be no doubt, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a Neatness or
Comeliness of Attire, is allowable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
if we consider, that there is a
lawful Use of the Creatures, not only for
the Supply of our Necessities, but likewise
for Ornament and Decency, according to
that Degree and Order wherein God hath
plac'd us in the World. There are (as you
may observe) several Things created that
are not absolutely necessary in the Life of
Man, and yet you can't deny, that they
were designed for some use, God having
made nothing in vain. God hath given
not only <hi>Bread to strengthen Man's Heart,</hi>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:107741:158"/>
but <hi>Wine to make it glad, and Oyl to make
his Face to shine,</hi> 104 Psal. 15. to add an
Ornament and Lustre to his Countenance,
as well as to gratifie the Sence of Smelling
with its sweet Odour. And the like Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Indulgence he hath shew'd to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
with Respect to their Rayment. He
hath bestow'd several Things to administer
to Beauty and Comeliness, to the Graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Cloathing; as Gold, Silver,
Pearls, Diamonds, and other precious
Stones, fine Linnen, Silk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the <hi>World</hi> it self hath its Name
among the <hi>Greeks</hi> from its <hi>Ornate</hi> and
Comely Make, its beautiful and rich Dress:
Where-ever we look, it is gay and trim,
and shews a Bravery worthy of its Maker.
The Heavens are deck'd and garnish'd with
the Stars, as with so many glittering and
sparkling Gems, besides that great flaming
Ruby the Sun, Which out-shines them all.
The Sea is embelish'd with the richest
Pearls: The Earth is furnish'd and enrich'd
with its precious Stones and Minerals. Who
can sufficiently admire the Gaiety of its
Herbs and Plants? Their very Leaves have
a peculiar Trimming; they are with great
Curiosity notch'd indented, engrail'd, scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopp'd,
laced, fringed, adorn'd with most
elegant Figures: But especially, the Bravery
of Flowers invites and gluts our Sight:
The Richness of their Native Cloathing is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107741:159"/>
wonderful and amazing: In respect of
which our Saviour tells us, That <hi>even</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
<hi>in all his Glory was not arayed like one
of these.</hi> Among Brutes there are many
that are remarkable for their Gorgeous
Trappings, wherewith Nature hath set them
forth, especially several of the Feather'd
Animals are noted for the Variety of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
in which they are dressed.</p>
            <p>And if God thus decketh the Irrational,
and even Inanimate Creatures, surely he
hath not forgot <hi>Man.</hi> No: In making
him such he hath sufficiently adorn'd and
beautified him; for his Soul is the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Image of the Deity, and the admirable
Structure of his Body hath all the Marks
of Divine Art and Wisdom upon it: And
must this Rich Jewel be sordidly used?
May not this Choicest Creature be decently
arayed? If God hath given it this Natural
Decking, shall an Artificial one be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?
If you may adorn your Houses, and
deck your Chambers, and trim up your
Closets, why may not you do so to your
selves? For here I may say as our Saviour
in another Case,<note n="*" place="bottom">6 Mark 26.</note> 
               <hi>Are not ye much better
than they?</hi> The Scripture Records acquaint
us, that there were some innocent Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
used heretofore, and that by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and Vertuous. It is St.<note n="†" place="bottom">In 35 Gen. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Austin</hi>'s
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107741:159"/>
Observation upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s presenting <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi>
with <hi>Ear-Rings</hi> (for so he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the Word <hi>Nesem)</hi> and <hi>Bracelets,</hi> and
her accepting of them, that it is lawful to
use these and the like Ornaments; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
the Holy Patriarch would not
have sent them to her, and she being a
vertuous Maid would not have receiv'd
them, and worn them, as we read she did,
for his sake. And from other Places of
the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> we may infer, That
these were the most universal and innocent
Piece of Finery, and that of all Ornaments
they were the most Ancient. <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who
was the Beloved of his Father, was distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
from the Rest of his Brethren, by
a better sort of Apparel, <hi>a Coat of many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi>
37 Gen. 3. a Garment wrought or
embroider'd with sundry sorts of Figures,
either of Flowers or Fruit, or both, and
these set out with different Colours.</p>
            <p>Nor do the Laws of the <hi>Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
prohibit the Use of decent Ornaments,
if there be no Inordinacy in the procuring
or wearing of them. I could observe to
you, that our Saviour himself refused not
to use the <hi>Borders</hi> and <hi>Fringes,</hi> which were
at that time in Fashion among the <hi>Iews,</hi>
and even among the <hi>Pharisees:</hi> He wore
these at the Bottom of his Garment; as we
may gather from 6 <hi>Mark</hi> 56. where we
read, that they besought him in behalf of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107741:160"/>
the Diseased, that they were brought to
him, <hi>That they might touch, if it were but
the Border of his Garment.</hi> And in 8 <hi>Luk.</hi>
44. we read, that a Woman came and
<hi>touch'd the Border of his Garment. <gap reason="foreign">

is the Word, and it properly signifies a
<hi>Fringe,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> Notes upon the Place; and
this is the very Word that is used in 23 <hi>Mat.</hi>
5. where our Saviour blames the Pharisees,
for <hi>enlarging the Borders of their Garments;</hi>
but though he check'd them for their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
in so doing, yet he complied
with the Garb so far, as it was harmless
and lawful. The Apostle asserts, that there

his Place and Function. Christianity is
not altogether neglectful of the outward

Cloathing; for this may be used not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a Cover for our Nakedness, and a

            <p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:107741:160"/>
But is not this repugnant to the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text, <hi>That Women
should not adorn themselves with Gold or
Pearls, or costly Aray?</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 9. And
what is said to one Sex is said to another;
for if the wearing of Gold or Pearls be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
in Women, it is so in Men. And
is not what I have said contradictory to
that parallel Place of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epist.
Chap. 3. Ver. 4. <hi>Whose adorning let it not
be that outward adorning of plaiting the Hair,
and of wearing of Gold, or of putting on of
Apparel:</hi> Which seems to disallow of; yea,
wholly to condemn the wearing of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental
Attire.</p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Quakers</hi> have understood
this and the fore-going Text, thus, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
have cried out against all Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Gold and Silver, or of any other
Nature: Yea, they have pretended, that by
Vertue of these Texts, they are authorized
to leave neither Lace nor Ribband upon
their Cloaths, but to wear plain Garments,
without Welt or Gard; though (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the World, that they did not believe
themselves, when they made this Comment
on these Texts) they have lately contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
this in their Practice. This was, it
seems an old Conceit, and prevail'd among
the <hi>Montanists:</hi> Whence it was that<note n="*" place="bottom">De Idololatriâ. De Cultu mulierum.</note> 
               <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:107741:161"/>
was infected with this Enthusiastick
Notion: He holds, that it is unlawful for
a Christian to be adorn'd with Purple or
Gold, or to wear any other Things of the
like Nature. This was the Result of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreting
these Places of Scripture, which
(if we examine the true Meaning of them)
will be found to give no Allowance to the
casting off of all Ornaments: Nay, my Text
plainly disallows it; for, <hi>I will,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith the
Apostle, <hi>that Women adorn themselves;</hi> and
he tells us further how they may be adorn'd,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in habitu ornato,</hi> vulgar
<hi>Latin</hi> an Attire, that hath some <hi>Decency</hi>
and <hi>Comeliness</hi> in it, for so the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
imports. Here, then they are not
only forbid to be sordid in their Apparel,
but here is a Licence given them to adorn
themselves. The next Words therefore
cannot denote the utter Unlawfulness of
adorning themselves with <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Pearls,</hi>
and the like.</p>
            <p>But what then is the true Sense of these
Words, That <hi>Women must not adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with broided,</hi> or <hi>braided Hair</hi> (for
so it should be read, and the other was the
Mistake of the Printer, which ought to be
corrected in our Bibles) <hi>nor with Gold or
Pearls, or costly Aray?</hi> I answer, the Apostle
here (as is very usual in other Places of
Scripture) seems to speak in an absolute
Manner, though what he saith is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:107741:161"/>
(as he meant it) in a limited one.
Thus it is our Saviour's Injunction, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
rather, <hi>When thou makest a Dinner
or a Supper, call not thy Friends, nor thy
Brethren, neither thy Kinsmen, nor thy rich
Neighbours, 14 Luk.</hi> 12. where Christ seems
to condemn all Feasts, unless those where
the Poor are invited; and consequently,
no man is permitted to entertain any at his
Table but these: But who sees not, that the
Words are not to be taken absolutely, but
in a restrain and comparative Sense? Christ
doth not forbid us to invite our Friends
and Relatives, but he would teach us this
Lesson, that we must <hi>rather</hi> do Good to
the Poor and Needy, and such as can never
recompence us, then shew our Kindness
and Friendship to those that are Rich, and
able to do us the like Office of Friendship.
We may lawfully entertain our Friends and
Neighbours, though they be not poor; for
Christ himself was present at such a Feast;
by the same Token, that when they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Wine, he was pleas'd to supply them
with it by a Miracle: But we are to prefer
Charity toward the Poor, before our Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Friends. Our Entertainments,
which are meerly for Friendship and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
must give way to necessary and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensable
Acts of Piety and Charity. So
here, in the Case before us, the Adorning
of the Body with comely Apparel must
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107741:162"/>
yield to a higher and nobler Adorning, <hi>viz.</hi>
That of the Soul, with <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
which are here mention'd; yea, we
must wholly neglect the one in comparison
of the other: And so, that other Text, <hi>viz.</hi>
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is to be understood; not as if
all outward Adorning were sinful, for you
see, that <hi>putting on of Apparel</hi> (in that place)
is mention'd no less then <hi>wearing of Gold;</hi>
and consequently all Apparel should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
here, as well as wearing of Gold,
if the Apostle's Words were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
absolutely.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is evident, that we must
take them in a Comparative Sense, as that
Place in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> before mention'd, and
as that other, in 6 <hi>Mat. 19. Lay not up for
your selves Treasures upon Earth.</hi> Not that it
is sinful to lay up in store against a Time of
Need; not that it is unlawful to treasure
up Earthly Riches; but the Meaning is,
we must not look upon Riches as our best
and only Treasure, and set our Hearts upon
them. It is like that of the Apostle, <hi>1 Tim.
6. 17. Charge them that are Rich in this
World, that they trust not in uncertain Riches;</hi>
that they rely not so upon these, as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
trusting in God. You may have
Wealth; that is not forbid, but you are
forbid to be so Careful and Solicitous about
it, as to neglect the True Riches: Nay, you
are commanded in these Words, to neglect
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:107741:162"/>
the former in respect of the latter. So here,
you may <hi>put on Apparel,</hi> you may adorn
your outward Man: but then you must
be careful above all to deck your Souls.
Your chief and principal Ornament must
be (as it follows in that place) <hi>the hidden
man of the heart, the ornament of a meek
and quiet spirit.</hi> This must be your great
and main Concern: and the other kind of
Adorning must be esteemed as nothing in
respect of this. This is the plain meaning
of the Apostle. He doth not in a rude
manner ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le and rend asunder all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental
Attire of that Sex, he doth not
tell us that all Bodily Decking, is vitious
under the Gospel, and unworthy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Men and Women, but he only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the Spiritual Adorning before it, and
warns us to avoid all Excess in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>But do you encourage us, you will say,
to conform our selves to the vain guise of
the World, and to comply with every Idle
Fashion and Dress that comes up? Do you
intend by this Discourse (at the entrance of
which you undertook to chastise, and, if
it were possible to reform the Abuse of
Apparel) to justifie the Scandalous Excess,
which is now generally practis'd? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
there is an Innocent, and there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a Vitious Complying with the customs
of the place we live in, and with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:107741:163"/>
we converse with as to this matter,
which we are now speaking of. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
we may safely submit to, because what
is innocent is blameless. Thus I observ'd
before, that our Saviour condescended to
the Garb of his Country-men. And in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things he shew'd himself no Morose
and Refractory person: he disdain'd not
the use of the <hi>Odoriferous Oyntment,</hi> which
was then much in use at all Great Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
<hi>Mark 14. 3. Luke 7. 38. Iohn</hi>
2. 12. 3. And he would not have used
that language to the Person whose Guest
he was at that time, <hi>Mine head with Oyl thou
didst not anoint,</hi> if he had not thought it
lawful to use it, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 46. He also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
to the <hi>Iewish</hi> custom of <hi>Discumbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
i.e.</hi> lying with their bodies stretch'd
out upon beds at their feasts and times of
solemn Eating, though it was not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Primitive posture at meals, but
arose first from Effeminacy and Luxury, but
was now by a long custom grown into a
laudable, at least an innocent practice, and
was complied with as such by our Saviour
himself, and his Apostles, and the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
People of that Country.</p>
            <p>This teaches us what our behaviour
should be in respect of Indifferent Modes
of Apparel, and such are in themselves
harmless; though they are not of any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
standing, but are lately brought up.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:107741:163"/>
Nay, though they are used by others to
pride and wantonness, yet if they be in
themselves innocent, and we are resolved
to use them innocently, I cannot see how
they become unlawful. To instance in
<hi>Borrowed Hair,</hi> which is now so much in
use: it is not to be doubted, that it is a
very Vitious sort of Attire in too many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
because they had no sufficient occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to part with their own hair, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no need of wearing another's: but
vanity and pride moved them to do it, and
these are the principles which make them
still retain this practice. But as this sort
of Covering for the head <hi>may</hi> be used, and
<hi>is</hi> by <hi>some,</hi> it is innocent and useful, and the
ends of wearing it are good and lawful.
If our fore-fathers had known the way of
making it, I question not but they would
have used it. One Age invents what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knew not, as <hi>Printing, Guns,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other things: Shall therefore these be
unlawful because they were not known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
They used <hi>Caps</hi> one upon another
heretofore: but <hi>Hair</hi> to supply the defect
of hair is most proper. Every Age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
new Habits, which at first seem strange
and uncouth, because persons are not used
to them. Some weak and scrupulous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
think that every New Fashion or Mode
of Apparel, that was not heard of in our
fore-fathers days, is unlawful: but this is
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:107741:164"/>
a great mistake, and if they pursue it, they
must run back to the primitive <hi>Coats of
Skins,</hi> which at first were worn raw and
undress'd, before the <hi>Fellmongers</hi> and <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
Trades began to peep out. These were
the first Apparel of our Fore-fathers, yea,
and of the softer Sex.</p>
            <p>These things I say, that we may have a
right apprehension concerning this matter,
and that we may not conceit that no Attire
is commendable but what can plead Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
as if it were absolutely necessary that
there should be now (as in former times)
in every considerable family a Standing
<hi>Wardrobe.</hi> And these things I say, that we may
have a true and just notion concerning the
<hi>Ornamental</hi> part of Cloathing; that with
that wise and pious Father<note n="*" place="bottom">Nolo ut de Ornament is auri vel vestis praeproperam habeas in prohibendo sententiam. <hi>August. Tom. 2. Epist. 37,</hi> ad Possid.</note> 
               <hi>we may not be
too hasty in censuring and condemning of it,</hi>
seeing we do not find it condemned by the
Scripture, or by virtue of any Arguments
that can be brought thence. But though
the thing it self be lawful, and may by the
conduct of Prudence be harmlesly made use
of, yet it is certain, that nothing hath been
and is at this day more Abused. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that you may not mistake me, and
from what I have said be incouraged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the wild practice of this Degenerate
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107741:164"/>
Age, which is scandalous for its Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
in Attire, I will now in the next
place proceed (and 'tis high time to do so,
lest you should draw false Inferences from
what I have said) to shew you wherein this
Excess doth consist, and in what respects
persons may be truly said to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Vitiously in this matter. As I have
asserted the Lawful and Innocent use of
Decent and Graceful Apparel, so now I
will discover the gross Abuses which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
accompany the wearing of Apparel.
I will distinctly mention the particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies
and Inordinacies, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Habits of persons unlawful, and
which were never more Visible and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
than in these Licentious Times.</p>
            <p>1. To be Curious and Solicitous about
Apparel, and to Affect New Modes of
Dressing are a very evil disposition of mind,
and unbecoming the Sobriety of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
There were a kind of Ornaments used
by the <hi>Iewish</hi> Dames, which are called, <hi>Batte
hanephesh, houses of the soul,</hi> Isa. 3. 20. What
particular species of Finery these were, is
difficult to tell, but these terms may be fitly
applied to all the other kinds of female
habiliments, which are mentioned in that
Chapter, and so to all the other sorts of
Garniture, which are in fashion at this day:
they are generally <hi>houses</hi> and <hi>receptacles of
the Soul,</hi> they that wear them set their hearts
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:107741:165"/>
upon them, and by this means they become
sinful and unlawful. This is the fault of
the greatest number of the Fine people of
this Age: it may be plainly discern'd, that
their <hi>minds</hi> are set upon their Georgeous
Attire; their great delight and pleasure is
in Genteel and Fashionable Apparel. All
their <hi>thoughts</hi> are to be Neat and Spruce, to
be Polite and Trim: nay, they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with ordinary Gaiety, but they must be
Superfine: they strive to be Exquisite, and
care for none but a Studied Dress. The <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Fashions</hi> so frequently as is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
some persons, is generally the effect
of this Vanity: for they who are thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
affect Novelties, and are taken with
every light and vain, every idle and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
thing, so it be new. 'Tis said of
<hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> that they never wore
the same Garment twice. Those whose
Purses will not suffer them to arrive to this,
yet are well-willers to the practice, and
would be imitating it as near as they can.
There are some of no extraordinary figure
that think a Good Suit is antiquated before
half of a Summer is expired: and there are
others that reckon the Months of the Year
by their Change of Rayment. Heretofore
this very rank of persons were wont to leave
off their Cloaths because they were worn
out, but now they do it meerly because they
are out of fashion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:107741:165"/>
Where this vain humour prevails, it causes
them to look after <hi>Foreign</hi> and <hi>Exatick</hi>
Modes of Finery. What was the <hi>Iews</hi> fault
of old, is theirs now, <hi>they please themselves in
the children of Strangers,</hi> Isa. 2. 6. They affect
and ape their Manners, which hath of late
been very Ominous, and had like to have
prov'd destructive. They, like those whom
the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> reproves, love to
be <hi>cloathed with strange apparel,</hi> Ch. 1. v. 8.
What is domestick pleases not; but their
minds run after Outlandish and far-fetch'd
Dresses. And indeed generally they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with These most of all: and even
whilst they are at War with a Country,
they are in a League with their Fashions.
Or if they can't be supplied fast enough
from abroad, they then set their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
on work, or are very earnest with
others at home to befriend them in that
kind. And truly, they cannot Oblige them
more than by presenting them with some
New-invented Garbs, and such as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
known before. All this shews how
Solicitous they are about their Attire and
Aray, how mightily concern'd they are for
their Tricking and Bravery. Which is a
perfect contradicting and confronting our
Saviour's Counsel, <hi>Take no thought what ye
shall put on,</hi> Mat. 6. 25. And again, <hi>Why
take ye thought for Rayment?</hi> v. 28. and
further, <hi>Take no thought, saying, wherewithal
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:107741:166"/>
shall we be cloathed?</hi> v. 31. As much as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing which takes up your minds, let it
not be the grand business you concern your
selves in, and busie your thoughts about:
for this is unworthy of a Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and much more of those that profess
the Strictest Religion: it is the mark of a
<hi>Beau</hi> rather than a <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another Instance of the Inordinacy
of Apparel, is, when it is unsuitable to the
<hi>Condition</hi> of the persons that wear it. Thus,
though an Extravagant Finery be unlawful
in both Sexes, yet it is much more so in a
<hi>man.</hi> For <hi>him</hi> to be fantastick and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in Attire is unpardonable. It is next
to <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>'s Spinning among women.
<hi>Art thou not ashamed, when Nature hath
made thee a Man, to make they self a Woman?</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">

Gentleman who he saw finely trick'd up,
and dress'd in too gay and light an habit.
And <hi>Seneca</hi> justly takes notice of this as an
inexcusable folly in some of the Manly Sex,
that they were of such an effeminate temper
and genius, <q>That <note n="†" place="bottom">Quis est iseorum qui non malit Rempublicam turbari quam comam? qui non solicitior sit de capitis sui decore quam de sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:107741:166"/>
have the Commonwealth out of order

about trimming and sprucing up
their Heads than they were of their own
Health, or of the Safety of the Publick:
they were more careful to be Fine than
to be Honest and Vertuous.</q> This the
Moralist upbraids them with as a reproach
to their Masculine nature, and a very defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of their Manhood. Again, Apparel
becomes unlawful by being unsuitable to
the <hi>Years</hi> of those who wear it: for there
is a Decorum belonging to Age as well as
Sex. Those Garments are unfitting for
Men of years, which were not unbecoming
them when they were youthful. And so
how unseemly is it for Matrons not to be
clad according to their Age, but to affect
the florid dressings and polishings of those
of green years? Of <hi>the aged women</hi> more
especially the Apostle requires, that <hi>they be</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>in habit</hi> (for so we may render it)
<hi>as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
holiness,</hi> Tit. 2. 3. Though Excess
in Habit be very blameable in Youth, yet
it is much worse in those of declining years,
because it is supposed, that they should by
this time be brought to a Sense of the
World's Vanity, and should be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
that they are more nearly approaching
to the Grave, and therefore should be
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:107741:167"/>
dressing their Souls for eternity. Wherefore

these persons very smartly, because the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
is more inexcusable in them than in any
others.</p>
            <p>Moreover, then the Attire may deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be condemned as Inordinate, when it is
not according to the <hi>Station</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> the
<hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Employment</hi> of the person. Thus
when a Magistrate wears the Habit of a
mean Citizen, or much more, if out of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice
and baseness of Spirit he delights to
appear in sordid rayment, wholly unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the dignity of his Place, he
offends in a very visible manner. And on
the other hand (which is the more general
and common fault) if those that are of a
low degree assume the garb and habit which
are proper to those that are in an Eminent
Station, they act very irregularly and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.
For, to use the words of the Poet,
<q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Martial.</note> Non quicunque capit saturatas murice
vestes.</q>
Every one (for that is the meaning of his
<hi>quicunque</hi>) is not to wear Purple and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:107741:167"/>
to put on the Vesture and Garb of such
as are in High places. And so when Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
presume to be dress'd after the rate of
their Masters and Mistresses, it is a very
scandalous Enormity, and not to be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a Civil, much less in a Christian
Commonwealth. For, as hath been said
before, Garments are for Distinction: but
this promiscuous and levelling use of them
takes it away, and brings in disorder and
confusion. This is, as <hi>Seneca</hi> speaks, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versa
vestis,</hi> an untoward cross Attire, such
a Habit as is no ways befitting. Therefore
we may entertain it as a True Proposition,
that that manner of Cloathing is faulty,
and justly blameable, which is unbecoming
the Place or Station wherein persons are
set.</p>
            <p>And so is that, in the next place, which
is not according to their <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
that Dress which exceeds the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their <hi>Incomes.</hi> We need not doubt,
that that Apparel which is too Chargeable
and Costly is unlawful. Whence it was,
that the fore-mention'd Moralist checks the
<hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, and other Women of his
time for their Prodigality of this nature;
he complains how intolerably Expensive
their perforated Ears were, (for as he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
remonstrates against them) there were
seen dangling at them whole <hi>Islands</hi> and
<hi>Towns.</hi> And the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:107741:168"/>
Church were as smart against the <hi>Christian</hi>
Women, that were guilty of this Profuse
Vanity.<note n="*" place="bottom">

Mannors and Lordships, saith St. <hi>Ierome.</hi>
And this is the fault, yea (which is the
Aggravation of it) the Common fault of
this present Age. The Luxury of Apparel
is such, that they are enclined to lay out
the greatest portion of their Revenues in the
supplying of this: they are prone to waste
and consume their Estates in changing of
Fashions; and they would (if they might
be permitted) weae whole Kingdoms on
their backs. And even others, who are of
a mean sort, and cannot afford in any point
to be Lavish, yet here shew how willing
they are to be so. They will not let their
Purse be their Director, but vainly aspire
to the Ornaments of the Rich and Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
This is the Epidemick folly of these
Times, which runs counter to all Reason,
Modesty and Decorum, and is an Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
which was never known in former
Ages to have climb'd to that heighth, which
it is now arrived to. Such persons must
be plainly told, that their Rayment must
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:107741:168"/>
not surpass their ability, that it doth not
become those who can scarcely find bread
for their mouths to hang Gold in their ears.
This certainly is part of that <hi>costly aray</hi>
which is forbid by the Apostle in the Text.
To conclude this Head, every ones Attire
should be according to their Condition:
and this Condition (as you have heard)
respects either the Sex, or the Age, or the
Calling, or lastly, the Estate and Fortune
of persons. Whatever Habit is disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to these is not an Ornament, but a
Blemish, a Deformity, a Disgrace.</p>
            <p>3. That Habit is justly to be censured
and condemned, which is a Badge of <hi>Pride.</hi>
Thus in the third Chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> where
the Finery of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Women is <hi>disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
of and threatned; it is said, <hi>The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Sion are haughty,</hi> their inward Pride
and Elation of mind were discover'd by
their outward Garb and Guise, by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Trappings and Accoutrements, by
their setting themselves forth with all that
Spruce Tackle and Trimming. This Vanity
argues their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haughtiness</hi> on a
threefold account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Some use this Profuse Adorning
to make a shew of their <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Ability.</hi>
They would have the world make an esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

the bravery of their Habit. By these Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous

of, and admire their Plentiful Revenues,
and applaud them for their Prosperity. We
need not be backward in asserting, that if
their Appareling themselves proceeds meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from this <hi>Ostentation,</hi> it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Pride of Apparel</hi> is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
in its being purposely design'd to
gain <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>Honour;</hi> and that they and
their Garniture may be Reverenc'd by those
that see it. For this sort of <hi>Pride</hi> is quite
starv'd and stifled if there be no <hi>Spectators.</hi>
But then by <hi>these</hi> I mean Themselves as well
as Others: and accordingly there are too
many that make this division of their Time,
<hi>viz.</hi> they employ the Morning in looking
on Themselves, and the rest of the day in
being seen of others. And thence they
first become their own Admirers and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and then perswade themselves, that
others pay the same Respect to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their Rich Pageantry, wherewith
they outshine them. For they are so foolish
as to imagine, that their Splendid Dress
gives a real worth and excellency to them,
and that they are to be preferr'd before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
because they surpass them in their
Goodly Aray. It is not to be doubted that
this is <hi>Pride,</hi> and one of the worst kinds
of it. Can a Rational Person be proud of
that which was the effect of the Primitive
Apostacy? Sin brought in Shame, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:107741:171"/>
Shame introduced Cloathing: so that to
take a Pride in this is to glory in our shame.
Wherefore the Advice of the Wise <hi>Iew</hi>
should take place here, <hi>Boast not of thy
cloathing and rayment,</hi> Eccles. 11. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the <hi>Beasts</hi> generally supply us with
our Rayment; and one would think there
is little reason <hi>to be proud of the Cast Suits
of the very basest Creatures,</hi> as a<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Bishop</hi> Hall<hi>'s</hi> Occasional Meditat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Worthy
Person expresses it. Who can deny that
<hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Defect</hi> have been the original
of some of the most Fashionable Habits?
The <hi>Roman</hi> Senate could not have voted
<hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> an higher Favour, than the
wearing of the <hi>Lawrel</hi> perpetually, but he
promoted it himself, because being Bald he
was glad of such a Covering. The <hi>Turkish
Turbant</hi> commenc'd from <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Scald
Head. And some tell us, that a certain Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
which was in such repute in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s day, was first brought up to
hide an Excrescence which blemish'd her
fair Neck. And if we should search into
the rise of some of the most Modish Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
among our Women at this day,
perhaps we should find them to be of a
more scandalous nature, and it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that some <hi>French Prostitutes</hi> have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
birth to our most Celebrated Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that our Dames are but the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:107741:172"/>
humble Imitators of the Worst of their
Sex.</p>
            <p>Or, to speak more generally, can that
person be proud of Cloaths who considers
what they cover? As the Philosopher of
old, told the people that stood gazing on
the Stately and Sumptuous Tomb of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solus,</hi>
All this <hi>Pompous Fabrick which you
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee, contains nothing in it but Dust;</hi> so it
may be said of the Goodliest and Richest
Vestures, They are a Covering only for
Dust and Ashes, they contain in them Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Materials design'd for the Grave
and Putrefaction. If notwithstanding this,
they can value themselves for their Dress
and Garb, for their precious and gaudy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipments,
and can admire the Beauty of
a Painted Sepulchre; especially if they do
not only think themselves to be really bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than others, because of their Handsom
Trimming, but despise and scorn those that
are meanly clad, this may be justly be call'd
<hi>Folly</hi> as well as <hi>Pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It might be added in the third Place, that
the <hi>Haughtiness</hi> of those who are Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
in their Garb is seen in this, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they confound that <hi>Order</hi> which God
hath set, they take away that <hi>Distinction</hi> of
persons, and of their qualities which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in the world, and they are for
making all alike. This Vain Inordinacy is
an argument of their Lofty and Ambitious
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:107741:172"/>
Spirit, it shews that they affect Grandeur,
and would be as high as the Greatest;
for the Levelling Equality, which they
they are now for, is to make way for that.
Thus their <hi>Habit</hi> is a certain indication of
<hi>Pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet here I must adjoyn this (that I
may not be partial in what I say) There
may be <hi>Pride</hi> (as <hi>Plato</hi> told <hi>Diogenes)</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mean Apparel. The <hi>Cynicks</hi> generally
took a pride in their cropt and circumcised
Hair: and so the <hi>Stoicks</hi> shaved their heads
close, and valued themselves upon it. And
and at this day perhaps some may be proud
of their Unborrow'd Hair, because a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
practise is so much in use. There may
be those that refuse to comply with the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
that are in Vogue, meerly out of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Singularity. And consequently,
their keeping the Old Fashion may be a
mark of their <hi>Pride;</hi> for <hi>this Vice</hi> acts its
part in Different and seemingly Contrary
Shapes.</p>
            <p>But that which I mention'd before is its
most usual guise; that is, it affects a Flaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Gorgeous Attire, it struts in its
Rich Caparisons, it makes a goodly shew
in its Delicate Vestures, in its Elegant and
Polished Aray. Ornaments become vitious,
though not so in themselves, by being spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Pride and Vanity, and a Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Mind. <hi>The man with a gold ring, in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:107741:173"/>
apparel,</hi> is not condemned by St. <hi>Iames,</hi>
for wearing that Garb, but his being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
by others, as well as by himself, for
his Gay Cloathing is the thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<hi>Iam. 2. 2, 3. If a woman were as
'twere cloathed with the Sun,</hi> (to borrow
that expression) were all shining and
bright, were most richly deck'd according
to her place and quality, yet if she had
(with the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> woman) <hi>the moon
under her feet,</hi> if she had a mean and low
opinion of this Changeable World, if she
were of great Humility and Condescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and were attired with <hi>the Ornament of
a meek and quiet spirit,</hi> she would be so far
from incurring our censure, that she would
desire the highest praises that we can heap
upon her, especially in such an Age as this,
when Bravery of Habit is generally the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
as well as the sign of a <hi>Proud</hi> Mind.
And this is it which renders it both Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
and Sinful.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Other Particulars</hi> behind, with
the <hi>Reflections</hi> on the whole, but I have not

and the Vain Amorists were wont

this usage) because it was the Mode of the
Times, and because that Colour was then
esteemed as Alluring and Tempting. The
short is, neither this nor any other Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Ornament relating to the Dress and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
of Persons, which any ways conduces
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:107741:176"/>
to Effeminacy and Lust is to be approved
of: for we are to remember, that Garments
were for Modesty sake at first: and 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that they still ought to be used to that
purpose, and therefore all Immodesty and
Lasciviousness in Apparel are to be shunn'd,
and a Wanton Garb is to be reckon'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
            <p>In the next and last place, so is that
which is any ways <hi>prejudicial to Religion
and Devotion,</hi> and the concerns of them.
And first, that Habit must needs prove such
which is unsuitable to the time and place of
Divine Worship. It is the undue practice
of this Age, that they never more exceed
in their Gay Deckings than when they are
to appear in God's Presence. Upon This
Day especially they muster up all their Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and shew themselves in all their
Change of Rayment, which they think is
some part of the Observing of the Lord's day.
It is true, this is a Holy Festival, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Decent Habit becomes it: but it is
contrary to the pious design of this Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to come into God's House to shew
your Finery, and to display all your Gaiety,
to invite Spectators, and to distract your
own and others thoughts. This is not to
be allow'd of in the Congregations of the
Faithful. And if St. <hi>Paul</hi> were permitted
to descend from the Mansions above, and
to speak to you from this place, he would
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:107741:176"/>
certainly reprove you, as he did his <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
for your Indecent Behaviour and
Garb in the Publick Assemblies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he uses this Particular Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to engage the women not to appear
with Uncover'd heads in the time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, <hi>viz. because of the Angels.</hi>
As much as to say, Those Glorious Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
those Ministring Spirits, which are
generally present at the Solemn Meetings
of the Christian Worshippers, take notice
of their outward carriage and deportment,
and particularly of their Garments and
Dress. And do you believe this (as you
needs must if you give credit to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle)
and yet can you with your Staring
Attire outface the very Angels, yea, and
the Infernal Spirits too, for some of this
sort may perhaps be tempted to come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and behold a Sight so agreeable to
them.</p>
            <p>I appeal to those of you that have not
lost all sense of good and evil, whether
you can think and really perswade your
selves, that such an Extravagant Furniture
as some of you are set up with, is fitting
for this Place where you now are, and to
the Sacred business you are employ'd about.
Can any of you that are sober and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
serious and religious, think that this
is a Garb agreeable to this occasion? Do
you look like those that are offering your
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:107741:177"/>
Petitions to the Almighty, and come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to attend to his Voice? Is it acceptable
to look Heaven in the face with a Spotted
visage? Can you perswade your selves, that
this Vanity and Pride become True Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers?
I know what some of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
dictate to you upon this Appeal
which I make to you. They tell you, and
that plainly and loudly, that this posture
which some of you are in is no ways suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the present Work you come hither
to be engag'd in. Your Natural Reasons
inform you, that you are not fit to Pray,
and to Hear the Word of God, <hi>i.e.</hi> with
any fervency and devotion. Your own
hearts tell some of you, that you look
more like <hi>Revellers</hi> than <hi>Devotionists,</hi> that
you are fitter for the <hi>Theatre</hi> than a <hi>Temple,</hi>
that a <hi>Play-house</hi> becomes you far better
than a <hi>Church,</hi> and that a <hi>Comedy</hi> would be
a more acceptable entertainment than a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
But I hope that some of you, who
attend to what I say, will find the benefit
of this <hi>latter,</hi> and will from this instant,
date your serious Reflections on your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
miscarriages in this kind that I have
been speaking of, that you will be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced, that there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between God's House and your own,
that that which may be tolerated in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is wholly unbecoming the former, that
you ought to shew that Gravity, Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:107741:177"/>
and Composedness of Spirit here,
which are not always required of you in
another place. And from a sense of this,
I hope you will be induced to be more
Cautious in your Habit on this Solemn day
than on another. Let me desire you, that you
would not come hither with all your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry,
Shew not your Pride here, where
you ought to be most Humble. Or, if I
cannot prevail with you so far, if you must
needs come with all your Towering Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentry,
let me perswade you to bring with
you at the same time, that modest <hi>Veil</hi> or
<hi>Covering,</hi> to put over some part
of it, which the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 6.</note> Apostle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
his <hi>Corinthians</hi> to make
use of in the time of Religious Worship in
the Publick Assemblies.</p>
            <p>And further, I would Caution you, that
upon days of <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Humiliation</hi> you
would wholly lay aside your Gaudy Dress.
It is fitting at such a time you should lour
your Top-sails, and strike your Flags. I do
not wish you to turn them into <hi>sackcloth</hi> and
<hi>ashes:</hi> that may favour of the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
Dispensation too much: but I only wish you
to leave off your Superfluous Ornaments at
such a season: and methinks there should
be no need of urging this upon you, seeing
it is absurd for <hi>Mourners</hi> to put on Gay and
Gorgeous Apparel. In this time of <hi>War</hi>
and <hi>Publick Disturbance</hi> these are very unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:107741:178"/>
and unsuitable. One would think you
intended to ridicule our <hi>Martial</hi> Affairs with
your <hi>Mock-Head-Pieces.</hi> Some of you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may entertain these things with a
Smile, and when you leave this Place im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it into something more; but; let me tell
you, you have little reason to behave your
selves thus; and you must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it your selves, when you consider,
that you are oblig'd to come hither (on
such serious and important Occasions) to
<hi>Humble</hi> your selves before God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to behave your selves <hi>Reverently</hi>
and <hi>Modestly,</hi> and to abandon all lightness
and vanity in your Attire: yea, that Garb
which is lawful or tolerable at some other
times is not to be allow'd of now.</p>
            <p>Again, that Attiring and Decking must
needs be prejudicial to Religion which take
up too much of your <hi>Time.</hi> If you rightly
understand what Christianity is, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but know that you have a great deal of
Business upon your hands: there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Work to be dispatch'd by you, and
you have but a little (some of you especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but a very little) time to dispatch it in:
wherefore Excess and Pride of Apparel,
which are always accompanied with great
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </note> loss of Time, and are known to be great
wasters of your precious Hours, are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:107741:178"/>
impediment to Religion. I am
satisfied, that there is none here of a sober
and stayed mind, but will relish what I
have said, and therefore I need not enlarge
on this Particular.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is nothing takes, the
mind off from <hi>Serious Thoughts</hi> so much as
the Vanity of Attire. Those that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to this, trouble not their heads with
the Concerns of an higher nature. The Great
Work of Dressing is their Main Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To be Gay, Modish and Trim, to
be Fine, Brave and Splendid, is that which
engrosses all their Care and Solicitude: and
thereby they are rendred unfit for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, and all Religious Exercise.
They banish the thoughts of their present
Duty, and of Death and Judgment to come,
of another World after this. Thus you see
on what accounts the <hi>Habit</hi> which persons
wear may be a hindrance to <hi>Religion</hi> and
<hi>Piety.</hi> And when it is so, we are sure that
it becomes Sinful and Unlawful. Though
it may seem to adorn the body, it is the
blemish of the Soul, and the deformity of
the whole man.</p>
            <p>And now, having more generally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd
the nature of that Excess, which I
undertook to give you an account of, and
having shew'd the Unlawfulness of it, I
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:107741:179"/>
now desire you to make some <hi>Reflections</hi>
upon what I have said. For it is certain,
that we live in an Age that is egregiously
Criminal as to this very thing. Most of
the <hi>Ornamental</hi> part of men and womens
Apparel is at this day unlawful, <hi>i. e.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as it proceeds from Vain Curiosity and
Affectation of Novelty, or as it is a Badge
of Pride and Vain-glory, or as it admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to Lust and Wantonness, or as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the Condition and Quality of those
that wear it. As to this last especially, the
Disorder among us is unsufferable, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
disagreeable to the laws of Reason,
Prudence and Religion. These things I
plainly and impartially set before you: and
let me not be accounted <hi>your Enemy because
I tell you the truth;</hi> and that with great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and sincerity. And herein I follow
the example of the Greatest Lights in the
Christian Church. The two Chief Apostles
thought it part of their Ministerial Office
to rebuke their female Converts for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty
and Vanity of their Head-Attire,
in my Text, and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. And we
shall find that the Pious <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
of the Christian Church afterwards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
it their indispensable duty to take
notice of the like disorder, and to repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it with great severity.

Religious Writers and Preachers of the

Martyrs and Confessors) yea, if we will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the example of our own Pious Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
in this Nation, who with great plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

If this was truly and honestly spoken,
and commanded to be publish'd in those
times, surely it may with as much truth,
honesty and faithfulness be proclaim'd in
ours. Nay, indeed, I do not see how a
Preacher can be faithful, unless he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
this part. He must openly declare
his dislike of this Indecent Garb, he must

Officers appointed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at <hi>Athens,</hi> to oversee
the Apparel of the people, that it might be
modest, grave and comely, and where they
found a default to punish the offenders:
and more especially, they had a sort of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseers
who took care of the Attire of
Women. There was a Sumptuary Law
made by <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> to reform the
Excess in Garments, which was among the
Old <hi>Romans.</hi> And among these people af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
it was order'd, that all persons
and their qualities should be distinguish'd
by their Habits. Our Ancestors likewise
did not forget to retrench the Vanity and
Disorder, which they observ'd in Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
thus in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time
an Act was made, to appoint every degree
of persons the Vesture they should wear:
and Great and Eminent persons only were:
permitted to wear Gold, Silver, Silk,
Furs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the extravagancy of the people, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
a particular sort of Habit to every
rank and order, yea, determining the very
fashion of their Shooes. And as there were
Laws and Statues of this nature before the
<hi>Reformation,</hi> so there have been <hi>Homilies</hi>
since publish'd by Royal Authority against
the same Excess. And Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:107741:183"/>
was wont to be Gorgeous and Splendid in
her Dress her self, took care in her <hi>23d</hi>
year to repress by Proclamation this
growing Vanity in those of a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>It is high time now to undertake it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
seeing it of so great a Growth. And
what though herein we tread in the Steps
of the present <hi>Pope?</hi> Our being <hi>Protestants</hi>
will not excuse us from imitating him, yea,
it rather pushes us on to do some Greater
and more Eminent thing of this sort, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
all persons to use a modest and decent
way of Araying themselves, and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
to restrain and regulate that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuousness
of Habit, which those of a lower
degree (and consequently the greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of persons) are guilty of. For, though
it is true, they had notorious exorbitancies
heretofore in this Nation, as to the matter
of Apparel, yet they were not <hi>Vniversal,</hi> as
they are now. Those of the middle and
of the inferior rank are the greatest Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
at this day: for they are run even
into that heighth of Bravery, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
only in those of the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
Heretofore it was said,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 11. 8.</note>
               <hi>They that wear soft Cloathing</hi>
(or as it express'd in<note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 7. 25.</note> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Evangelist) <hi>they that are
gorgeously apparell'd are in Kings houses:</hi>
but now the Excess is such, that they are to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:107741:184"/>
be found almost in every house.
It was said of <hi>Tyre,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek.</note> 
               <hi>Her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
are Kings,</hi> but it may as
truly be pronounc'd of <hi>England,</hi> that her
Ordinary men and women are Kings and
Queens, they appear in the Garb of such
persons. Nay, the Apparel which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was thought fit for Crown'd Heads
and Princes is now despis'd by the Vulgar.
This is a very deplorable consideration, and
may justifie the most severe Reproof that
can be given of these disorders among us.
Wherefore I hope I shall not be thought to
be Rigid and Censorious in what I have
suggested to you. I hope you will bear
with my Freedom, which is now become
so Seasonable and so Necessary, when we
see that the Inordinacy, which I have been

circumstances? How are you to behave
your selves? The Answer is obvious, <hi>viz.</hi>
It is your Concern to detest and avoid the

For though there is a lawful and harmless
use of Ornaments (as I have before asserted
and made good) and this is freely granted
to those who are capable of it, yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that the use of them is generally
perverted, and they are made by most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
serviceable (as you have heard) to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:107741:184"/>

esteem a Plain Habit, and the Neglect of

that Ornaments must always be used spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly,
and that sometimes (<hi>viz.</hi> when

at all. The Ladies of <hi>Carthage</hi> cut off their
Hair, in a great necessity, to serve instead
of Cords and such like Tackle, for Engines
of War. Yea, we have Ancienter and
more Authentick Examples than this in the
Sacred Records. The <hi>Israelites</hi> did the
like for Religion, which these women did
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:107741:185"/>
for their Country; for we read, that they
offer'd their <hi>Bracelets</hi> and <hi>Ear-rings</hi> and

women offer'd their <hi>Looking-glasses</hi> for the

serv'd to Religion, so now their
<hi>Speculums,</hi> wherein they used to behold
their Finery, are made use of to the same
purpose. The sum is, your Gaiety must
always vail to your Devotion: you must
look upon that as a mean and inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing in respect of this: and you must
with all care and resolution shun a Vanity
which hath nothing at all to commend it,
but is attended with many and great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, let me offer these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
particulars to your consideration.</p>
            <p>1. This is a <hi>Childish</hi> and <hi>Foolish</hi> Vice,
especially in a Man, and argues great Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Shallowness of judgment. For it
is here as it is in <hi>Heraldry,</hi> those Scutcheons
and Coats of Armoury that have the <hi>most
Colours</hi> are generally the less Honourable.
According to the true and impartial esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of things, a great Variety and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseness
of Ornaments are badges of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and Dishonour, and they proclaim
the Emptiness and Vanity of those that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:107741:186"/>
wear them and delight in them. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for the most part (for I do not speak
Universally, because here and there a Man
of a Brave mind may be incident to some
particular Vanity) such, I say, are most
commonly men of little or no worth: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
resembling <hi>Tulips,</hi> and some others of
the finest and most beautiful Flowers, which
are very useless and unprofitable Vegetables
in the life of man. Wherefore, to prize
our selves or others for our Outside, for
our Dress is a sign of a weak and light
mind: it is an argument of a vulgar and
common Spirit. Thus <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> (whom
you read of <hi>Acts 12.</hi>) was call'd and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
as a <hi>God</hi> by the silly <hi>people</hi> for the
brave Shining Suit which he wore, saith
<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiqu. <hi>l. 19. c.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>Ioseph</hi> the <hi>Iew.</hi> They are the words of
a Judicious Man,<note n="†" place="bottom">Judge <hi>Hale</hi>'s Letter to one of his Sons,</note> 
               <hi>The Vanity of loving
fine Cloaths and new Fashions, and valuing
our selves by them, is</hi> (saith he) <hi>one of the
most Childish pieces of folly that can be.</hi> Or,
if there be any exception against this Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if it were taken from one who had
some inclination to the other Excess (as I
find he is partly charg'd) then hear what is
said by another, a Noble and a Gallant
Person, the Great and Learned Sir <hi>W. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi>
whose testimony is unexceptionable,
because he was conversant with Courts and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:107741:186"/>
Bravery, and bore a great part of this him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Yet this is his brief determination in
the case,<note n="*" place="bottom">Advice to his Son.</note> 
               <hi>No man is esteemed for Gay Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
but by Fools and Women.</hi> This may
seem to be somewhat sharp and severe, but
you cannot disallow it, if you remember,
that it was the result of his deliberate and
studied thoughts. He was sensible (and
the more because of the Experiment he had
made himself) that Light and Vain Apparel
doth most commonly shew the Soul to be
such, that much Ornament is too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an indication that the Heart is pleas'd
with Painted Vanities, that the person can
entertain himself with <hi>Butter-flies,</hi> and that
he can fall in love with the gaudy tinctures
of a <hi>Peacock's Tail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This is an Excess that is <hi>Troublesome,</hi>
as well as Foolish. A Good man would
find himself over-burden'd under the Pomp
of Apparel: he would think himself clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the multiplicity of Attire. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and sober woman would esteem it a
very Irksom Employment, to bear about
her all the Ornamental Implements of the
vainer sort of that Sex. She would count
it more than <hi>Atlas</hi>'s work, to sustain such a
Weight. This was the sense of the Sober

               <hi>She labour'd under the load of
her Finery.</hi> In short, it is not to be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
that there are some Fashionable parts
of Attire, which are in themselves a <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and would be really thought to be
so by them that wear them if they were
<hi>compelled</hi> to it. Then we should hear them
complain and cry out against their now
applauded Aray, and it would fit as unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
on them as the <hi>Tunica molesta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This Extravagance is the nurse of
<hi>Idleness.</hi> For it is not a <hi>Working</hi> Habit
which they wear, but calculated only for
Holidays and Festivals. Besides, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:107741:187"/>
Pranking and Decking themselves,
and minding those things which appertain
to it take up their Time, and they scarce
have leisure for any serious business. And
further, this Pride which they nourish will
not suffer them to bestir themselves, and set
about any laborious employment. We read
therefore that <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>abundance of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
met together in <hi>Sodom, Ezek. 16. 49.</hi>
Thus their immoderate love of Delicate
Cloathing is an advancer of Sloath and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness.</p>
            <p>4. It is usually attended with <hi>Luxury.</hi>
Their Eating and Drinking are answerable
to their Garments. The Dining-room and
the Dressing-Chamber hold correspondence
with one another. It is true, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that it is not always thus; there are
some Fashion-mongers who half starve
themselves to feed their Pride: they flaunt
it in Cloaths, but are very poor Eaters, not
that they are not willing to indulge their
Palates, but only because their Incomes
will not afford it. They can't purchase
provision for their backs and bellies both.
That they may be lavish in their Garb, it
is necessary that they cut themselves short
of their Food, and fare very meanly. But
generally it is otherwise, the Table bears
Proportion to the Attire: the Feeding is
as high and sumptuous as the Cloathing.
Thus <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Fulness of bread</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:107741:188"/>
               <hi>Ezek. 16. 49.</hi> And (as it is

Wanton Woman who wore the Richest
<hi>Pearls</hi> at her ears, <hi>drank</hi> them at last.</p>
            <p>5. This Exorbitancy in Apparel is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with <hi>Immodesty</hi> and <hi>Lewdness.</hi> For
as Vain Attire arises oftentimes from Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness
(according to what was said before)
so it begets it. The natural Bashfulness and
Reservedness of the Sex are put off when
this is put on. Blushing, the Loveliest co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
in the world, disappears when these
Gay Varieties shew themselves, Now they
apparently endanger themselves. and hazard
their chastity. Nay, they wilfully expose
it, by making their Habit the fuel of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
and an Incentive to Lust. They
generally trim themselves, that they may
be more Saleable. <hi>Dinah went out to see
the daughters of the land,</hi> Gen.

upon some great Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
day she went to see the Finery of the
women of that Country. And I may add, it
is as likely that she went to shew her Own:
and we read what was the dismal Event of
it. She that is extravagantly Dress'd doth
thereby tell Spectators what her inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are. Her hanging out those Flags is a
sign that she is ready to Surrender. Or take

               <hi>Homily,

            <p>6. Vanity in Apparel is the great bane of
<hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> There are many that
lay others Revenues on their backs, and
run into Debt to cloath themselves in a
gaudy dress. These men and women wear
not their Own Cloaths, as proud as they
are of them: but are fine and gay at others
charges, yea of poor and mean Tradesmen
sometimes, which is is an intolerable piece
of Injustice. It is by their Profuseness that
they put themselves out of a capacity of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
their Creditors, and doing many
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:107741:189"/>
other just and honest acts which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be done. But their Expensive Pride
is much more an hindrance to Relieving
the poor: for they can't afford to be La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
on themselves and Liberal to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous.
And if some of them cannot or
will not pay for their Bravery, how can it
be expected, that those who are in Want
should partake of their Alms? If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to be Just, what hope is there that they
will be Charitable? Here we might lament
how the Extravagancy of some persons Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery
is a hindrance to their acts of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
What they superfluously and vainly
lay out on their Attire might serve to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
some necessitous people's Nakedness.
How many a poor Orphan or Widow
might be cloathed, how many a poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Hospitals might be reliev'd, if
the superfluous bravery of some persons did
not make them uncapable of doing such a
generous act? In a word, how many good
deeds of Charity and Hospitality (which
are so acceptable to God and man, and for
which some amongst you are so Eminent
and Renowned) I say, how many of these
noble acts are daily lost in this Great City,
upon this very account, <hi>viz.</hi> because they
expend that on their Vain Decking which
would afford necessary Covering for the
poor? But, to proceed,</p>

               </hi> and <hi>lastly,</hi> Let me disswade you
from this Vice, by the consideration of the
<hi>Fatal Consequences</hi> of it. In the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> where the Superfluous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
of the Sex, and those Ornaments that
were abused by Pride and Wantonness are
particularly enumerated, there is also added
the <hi>Punishment</hi> which shall be inflicted on
those proud daughters of <hi>Sion;</hi> such a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
as answers to their Sin, <hi>And it shall
come to pass that instead of sweet smell, there
shall be stink; and instead of a Girdle, a rent;
and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and
instead of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth;
and burning instead of beauty,</hi> V. 24. And
because this Pride of Apparel was Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,
it was to be avenged by a General
Plague and De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olation, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. It is observable, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>'s
approaching Misery was set forth
by <hi>a Girdle hid in the ground and marred,
Ier.</hi> 13. 6, 7. which fore-signified the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of their <hi>Finery</hi> (for the <hi>Girdle</hi> was a
Signal part of it, and therefore you find
it mention'd in the fore-nam'd Chapter of
<hi>Isaiah,</hi> where the whole Wardrobe of the
Sex is reckon'd up:) I say it fore-signified
the utter decay of their Affected and Vain
Bravery, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Captivity</hi> which was
drawing near. Among the Judgments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
against <hi>Iudah,</hi> in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. this is
one, that <hi>God will punish all such as are
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:107741:190"/>
cloathed with strange apparel,</hi> v. 8. He will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
animadvert on those vain persons,
who out of their greedy desire of new modes
of Attire, seek after those that are brought:
from foreign Countries. And we find it
not only thus in general, but there are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Judgments inflicted on individual
persons for this Sin which I have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
you from. Immediately before the
mentioning of the singular vengeance of
God upon <hi>Iezebel, viz.</hi> how <hi>Iehu</hi>'s horses
trod her under foot, and how the dogs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
her carkase, it is taken notice of,
that <hi>she painted her face, and tired her head,
2 Kings 9. 30. i.e.</hi> she was addicted to
that Vain Excess which I have been repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and you hear what was the End of
her, you read what was the recompence of
her Pride as well as of her other notorious
enormities. In the <hi>New Testament</hi> we have
<hi>Herod</hi> a remarkable Example of God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the like kind. He was proud of
his <hi>Bright Apparel</hi> and his <hi>Gay Oration,</hi> both
which caus'd him to be ador'd by the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
who saw and heard him: and for this
his prophane Insolence he was struck by
an Angel from heaven, and died misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>Though there are no Instances of this
sort in these our days (we being under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Oeconomy of Divine Providence) yet
still the Justice of God is the same; and
<pb facs="tcp:107741:190"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:107741:191"/>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:107741:191"/>
though it be not visibly and presently exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
on the Sons and Daughters of Pride,
yet it is always due to them, and it now
conveys a real Curse along with it, and
shall be consummated in Eternal Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Their Immodest Habit, with all
the Vices that are retainers to it (of which
I have particularly spoken) will procure
them a very severe Punishment. They,
like the Beasts of old crowned with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
are gay and trim, but it is in order
to their being Sacrificed. They are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray'd
and Bedeck'd, that they may fall a
Splendid Victim to the Divine Justice. I
request you to ponder this in your thoughts,
that you may not be convinc'd of the Truth
of it by an Experiment in your selves.
Whatever apprehensions you have had of
this matter heretofore, I wish you may
for the future conceive aright of it. And
this you cannot do, unless you be really
perswaded of the intrinsick Evil of the
thing, and likewise of the Certainty of
that Judgment which will follow it. It
is a commonly receiv'd notion among the
generality of persons, that the Variety of
Fashions, and the Excess of Vain Apparel,
which are now so usual in this Nation,
contribute much toward the advantage and
welfare of it: For hereby, say they, the
poor are set on work, many families are
maintain'd, thousands daily get their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:107741:192"/>
and consequently this Vanity of
Attire is for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
If this be good Arguing, then it
is equally for the Publick Good to be
Drunk, and to be arrant Gluttons, and to
indulge all manner of Debauchery: For
hereby the Wine-Merchants and Vintners,
all that sell or dress the choicest Vineyards
are enrich'd, and under these a great many
poor and indigent Folks are maintain'd
and provided for: and therefore we may
conclude, that Intemperance and Sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are Publick Benefits to the World, as
well as the Inordinacy of Apparel. But
how can we with any Reason defend this
latter, when it hath been proved (and all
that have their Eyes open cannot but see
it) that this Excess brings with it Idleness,
Luxury, Lewdness, and is an Enemy to
Justice and Charity (the two great Props of
a Nation) and therefore must needs be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous
to the Commonwealth? Hence
it will follow (notwithstanding these Mens
false Reasonings) that this Pride of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
is the nurse of Poverty. And there are
abundant Instances to prove this. Too rich
and gorgeous an Habit hath brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a one to a Mourning Dress. Their Cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Aray hath reduced them to Rags, to
want and penury. And let me tell you,
this will be the Publick Fate, if you do
not speedily prevent it. Our Expensive
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:107741:192"/>
Vanity in Attire, with the Pride and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness
and other disorders, which are its
constant retinue, will be our Ruine.</p>
            <p>This may seem to be an Harsh way of
treating you from the Pulpit: but I assure
you, it is such as your Condition calls for,
and therefore think not these Reproofs and
Menaces to be unseasonable. Though I
must needs say, I had not dealt thus with
you, but that I saw no other person would
undertake this work. Or, if any hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
it, it is evident that their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
hath proved successless. Wherefore
it was requisite to urge this matter afresh,
and freely to set before you your Fault
and your Danger, that you may seriously
reform the one, and happily avoid the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This is the grand design of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Enterprize, and I hope it will not be
altogether void of success. To which end
I will conclude with an <hi>Exhortatory Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress</hi>
to those who are most concern'd in
this Discourse, because they are generally
the most Criminal.</p>
            <p>Let it be your chief study to deck your
selves with those Ornaments that embelish
the Soul, and adorn the Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
<hi>Put ye on the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> as
the Apostle is pleas'd to express it, <hi>Rom. 13.
14. Put on bowels of mercies, kindness, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of mind, meekness, long-susering:
and above all these put on charity, which is
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:107741:193"/>
the bond of perfectness,</hi> which is as it were
the rich gridle that ties all your spiritual
Attire together. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. More especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
be exhorted in the same Apostle's
Words, to <hi>adorn your selves with shamefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedness
and sobriety;</hi> and in the language
of another Apostle, <hi>Let your adorning be
the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek
and quiet spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 3, 4. Which
Words (as I told you before) do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all Ornaments of the Body. If they
exceed not Christian Modesty and Gravity,
and offend not against the other Rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
laid down; and (in a word) if they
are <hi>not unbecoming women professing godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
(as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10.)
you may lawfully use them. But then you
must be sure that you do not by means of
these, or in the use of them forget and
neglect the Inward and Spiritual Adorning.
Nay, you must be Chiefly concern'd for
this latter: for this is the sole Ornament
of the Spouse of <hi>Christ, who gave himself
for his Church, that he might sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie and
cleanse it with the washing of water by the
word, that he might present it to himself a
Glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle,
or any such thing; but that it should be holy
and without blemish,</hi> Eph. 5. 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is
the Beauty and Finery which you are to
be solicitons about: and let the Care
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:107741:193"/>
which others take in beautifying and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the Bodies remind you of a much
Greater Concernedness, which you ought
to shew for your Immortal Spirits.</p>
            <p>It was a Specimen of a great Devotion
and Religion in that Good Father, who
one time observing a Harlot, and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how curiously she had trick'd up her
self, and how elaborately she had made
her self fine, stept aside and retired into
his own breast, and there sharply chid
himself, because he had never taken half
so much care in adorning his Soul, for
the entertaining of the Holy <hi>Iesus,</hi> as
that vile Curtezan had done in trimming
of her body for the pleasing of her lewd
guests. Thus we may make the Vanity and
and Sinfulness of others administer to
our Pious Thoughts and Reflections. Let
him who beholds the utmost gallantry and
splendor of the most Polished Creature,
presently turn his eyes inward, and look
upon his Naked Soul, and blush at his
neglect of it. How nice and exact are
Vain persons in accoutring and furbish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves? And that their Bodies
may not be disproportionable to their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
what cost are they at to repair and
beautifie those houses of clay? What lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Arts and Methods do they use to set
off themselves? They are not ashamed to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:107741:194"/>
borrow the Beauty which they boast of
from a Drug or a Dark Spot. Some of
them are at the trouble every day of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on a New Complexion.</p>
            <p>But be not you of the number of these
Gaudy Fools: let your principal design
be to beautifie your Minds, in adorning
of which you cannot spend too much
time, or take too much pains. To this
purpose, think seriously of the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Worth of your Souls, remember
that this is your Better Part, and therefore
you ought to be solicitous above all things
to have this adorn'd with Divine Vertues
and Graces. And consider likewise, that
these are the only True and Valuable Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
these alone deserve that Name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have an intrinsick worth in
themselves, and convey an inward and
substantial Excellency to those that have
them: and (which is the highest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of them) they

               <hi>are in the sight of God of
great price,</hi> as the Apostle
informs us. These Rich Jewels and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds

in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are to be infinitely preferr'd in your

of the <hi>New Testament</hi> can possibly

Here we read of <hi>hidden wisdom, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.

the same Verse, <hi>of the deep things of God,</hi>

a <hi>Mystery</hi> be a <hi>Religious Secret</hi> (as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
afterwards) then there are many <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi>
things in the Gospel, and Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it self is a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and a <hi>Great</hi> one, as
the Apostle here assures us.</p>
            <p>The Reasons of which Denomination,
if we particularly enquire into, I conceive
this Account may be given of it. It is sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
so upon this double ground, 1. In way
of <hi>Comparison.</hi> 2. On a <hi>Positive</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
consideration.</hi> As to the former, I
will prove that the Christian Religion is
a <hi>Mystery,</hi> as it may be <hi>compared with,</hi> or
<hi>distinguish'd from Other Mysteries,</hi> viz. <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
Pagan, Heretical,</hi> or <hi>Antichristian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is stiled a <hi>Mystery</hi> in opposition
to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rites and Observances, which
it is well known were Mystical and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:107741:196"/>
The <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> it self was dark,
and receiv'd no Light at all into it. The
<hi>Ark</hi> was viel'd from the eyes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
All the <hi>Mosaick Ceremonies</hi> were <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious</hi>
in that they signified something
else; they pointed at some Greater and
Hidden thing. Wherefore it is no impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
and groundless thought that our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
who in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
so often compares Christianity with, and
opposes it to the <hi>Iudaick</hi> Rites, hath an
eye to them here, and denominates <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
from them, telling us, that it is a
<hi>Mystery,</hi> not such as was under the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Pedagogy, but a <hi>Mystery</hi> of a peculiar and
a higher nature.</p>
            <p>Besides, there were <hi>Other</hi> sorts of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>
among the <hi>Iews;</hi> thus, though the
<hi>Cabala</hi> was afterwards made up into a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which is now the <hi>Talmudick</hi> System,
yet even in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s days, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the <hi>Dark</hi> and <hi>Intricate Conceits,</hi> the
<hi>Mysterious Criticisms</hi> about Words and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
contain'd in it, and constantly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by Tradition, were much in vogue.
So the <hi>Gematrian</hi> Art, whereby they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to shew the Numbers and Years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in certain words in Scripture, was
in use among the <hi>Iewish Rabbies</hi> betimes.
And further, it is not to be doubted, that
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors began before the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
time to turn the <hi>Old Testament</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:107741:196"/>
               <hi>Allegories,</hi> and to offer Mystical Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of the Bible, excluding the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
one, or much to the prejudice of it.
To all these perhaps the Apostle might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude,
when he pronounces Christianity to
be a <hi>Mystery,</hi> such a one as consists not of
Curiosities and Niceties, much less of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representations
of Scripture, but is in it self
both Weighty and True.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a <hi>Mystery</hi> in opposition to,
and defiance of the <hi>Healthen</hi> Prophane S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,
which likewise were Obscure,
Abstruse and Intricate. The <hi>Pagans</hi> in
imitation of the <hi>Iews</hi> (for they aped them
in many things) built their Temples, but
especially one part of them, Dark: they
had <hi>Sphinxes</hi> and Puzzling Pourtraitures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to them. They hid many of their
Rites and Usages from the people, lest they
should be prophan'd (as they thought) by
being exposed. Several of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances,
which related to Religion, were
known to the Priests only, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
to be discover'd, unless upon some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
occasion, to any others. The
<hi>Gentile</hi> Worshippers generally delighted
in <hi>Groves</hi> and <hi>Dark Recesses:</hi> and indeed
some of their Superstitious, Ceremonies
were so <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>seandalous,</hi> that they
on that account forbore to make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,

call'd <hi>Great;</hi> but let me tell you, the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
of <hi>Christianity</hi> far surpasses them all,
and therefore deservedly challenges that
Title.</p>
            <p>And further, the very <hi>Morality</hi> of the
Pagans was wrapt up in <hi>Mysteries.</hi> The
Ancient <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> used this
way of Teaching. And 'tis well known,
that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> delighted to express their
conceptions in <hi>Hieroglyphicks.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi>
more especially <hi>affected</hi> to muffle up their
Ethicks in <hi>Fables, Allegories,</hi> and <hi>Emblems.</hi>
Particularly <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his followers
were much pleas'd with <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols.</hi>
And in a word, all the Ancient way
of Moralizing was by <hi>Symbolical</hi> Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:107741:198"/>
               <hi>Parables</hi> and <hi>Mysteries.</hi> But the

of another kind and way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is call'd so in <hi>opposition</hi> to
some of the fond Inventions of <hi>Hereticks</hi>
and <hi>Seducers</hi> in the Church. Thus <hi>Simon</hi>

And it was the constant genius

<hi>Hereticks</hi> to amuse men with Vain
and Strange Terms, to darken the notion
of things, to render the doctrines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
obscure, to cast a Mist before mens
eyes, by making use of a wild, uncouth
and unintelligible <hi>Iargon.</hi> Several of them
affected Mysteries in <hi>Letters, Names,</hi> and
<hi>Numbers,</hi> and thereby studied to confound
mens minds with Perplexed and Abstruse
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:107741:199"/>
Notions. They pretended to, and boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of particular Choice <hi>Secrets,</hi> which
were appropriated to themselves, and hid
from all others, for they were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
only to <hi>the Wise</hi> and <hi>the Coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
(as they call'd them,) but those that were
<hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Carnal</hi> were not able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into them. In contra-distinction to
these, the Apostle, who <hi>foresaw</hi> these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
Cheats and Impostures in the
Church, and who in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4. and in
other places of his <hi>Epistles</hi> plainly foretold
them, is pleas'd to call the <hi>Christian</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
a <hi>Mystery,</hi> to signifie that they are
such of a <hi>singular</hi> kind and nature.</p>
            <p>In the last place, <hi>Christianity</hi> in its Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Simplicity is most justly stiled a
<hi>Mystery,</hi> in opposition to that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the same Holy Pen-man, <hi>the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Iniquity,</hi> 2 Thess. 2. 7. Conformably
to which stile we read of <hi>Mystery, Babylon
the Great,</hi> Rev. 17. 5. by which question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
is meant the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the
Corrupt and Idolatrous part of it at least.
Yea, we are inform'd, that this very word
<hi>MYSTERY</hi> is found inlay'd in plain
and legible Characters within the <hi>Roman</hi>
Pontif's <hi>Triple Crown.</hi> Indeed the Main of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion is <hi>Mystery</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise.</hi>
They pretend one thing, and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are another. They seem to have cast
off Pagan Idolatry, but yet they too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:107741:199"/>
symbolize with it in a great part of
their Worship. Heretofore they paid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
to <hi>Venus,</hi> and now to the Virgin
<hi>Mary:</hi> of old they pray'd to False Gods,
and now to Saints and Angels; before
they fell down to an Idol, and now to the
Cross. Thus they have given the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Old Heathen Rome</hi> a little finer Turn:
otherwise it is the same that it was. They
boast of their <hi>Miracles,</hi> but
they are not other than<note n="*" place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Lying
wonders,</hi> a sort of Religious
Legerdemain or Juggling. They at some
times pretend to greater Strictness, Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and Austerity than others, but
none are generally more Loose and Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.
Thus there is a False and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Shew of things in the <hi>Papal</hi> Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
there is an horrid <hi>Mystery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
call'd, <hi>The Mystery of the Woman and
of the Beast,</hi> Rev. 5. 7. In contra-distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to which the Apostle, who by a
<hi>Prophetick</hi> spirit foresaw what would come
to pass, gives the name of <hi>Mystery</hi> to the
True Primitive <hi>Christianity,</hi> this being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
such, but of quite another nature
than the Superstitious and Corrupt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>But I am to give a <hi>farther</hi> and more <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
account of this matter; wherein I
will clearly and distinctly assign the true
acception and meaning of the word <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:107741:200"/>
in the Writings of the <hi>New Testament,</hi>
which hath of late been very much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and grosly perverted, meerly to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an Opinion, which some persons think
serviceable to the Cause they have espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Christianity is entitul'd, a <hi>Mystery,</hi>
not only <hi>Comparatively,</hi> or in a way of
<hi>Opposition</hi> to other things (as I have shew'd
already) but <hi>Absolutely</hi> and <hi>Positively,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is really so in it self. Take this
in these two Particulars; it is call'd a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
by the Apostle, because, 1. It <hi>was so.</hi>
2. Because it <hi>is so now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I say, it is justly stiled a <hi>Mystery</hi>
in regard of what <hi>it was heretofore.</hi> The
doctrine of <hi>Christianity</hi> was hid, and shut
up a long time: and to this the following
Texts refer, and therefore ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
Christianity is said to be a <hi>Mystery
which was kept secret since the world began,
Rom.</hi> 16. 25. for it is evident, that by
<hi>Mystery</hi> here is not only meant <hi>the Calling
of the Gentiles</hi> (as some imagine) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was <hi>Mysterious,</hi> and kept secret till
Christ's Coming, but the way of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, in general, by <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi>
which is the grand thing contain'd in the
Gospel. That <hi>this</hi> is here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
may be gather'd from the preceding
words of the Apostle, <hi>my Gospel and the
preaching of Iesus Christ,</hi> which are syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous
with <hi>the Mystery;</hi> and from the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:107741:200"/>
subsequent words, <hi>made known to all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the obedience of faith,</hi> where the
great end or design of Christianity is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> that men may be brought to
yield obedience to the divine Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by believing the Gospel, for in this
very form of words the Apostle had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this Epistle told them what was the
design of his Apostleship, and of his
preaching the Gospel, it was <hi>for obedience
to the faith among all nations,</hi> Rom. 1. 5.
This Faith and this Preaching of it, saith
he, were a <hi>Mystery heretofore;</hi> in all those
past <hi>perpetual ages,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (which
we render <hi>since the world began</hi>) men had
but a very dark Notion of these things:
in all those preceding Dispensations they
were scarcely thought of, for though it is
true, there were constantly, through all
the several Models and Administrations of
Religion some <hi>Intimations</hi> of this, and
<hi>Tendencies,</hi> as it were towards it, yet the
notices that could be gather'd thence were
but mean and obscure, and they were at
the best but faint glimmerings of that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Light, which was afterwards to break
forth.</p>
            <p>Of this the Apostle speaks again, <hi>Eph. 3.</hi>
3, 4, 5. where the Gospel is call'd, <hi>the
Mystery,</hi> and <hi>the Mystery of Christ, which in
other ages was not made known unto the sons
of men.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 9. he calls it, <hi>the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:107741:201"/>
which from the beginning of the world
had been hid in God.</hi> For though the word
<hi>Mystery</hi> in this place also hath a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and special respect to that fore-nam'd
Secret of the <hi>Conversion of the Gentiles</hi> (as
appears from the 3, 4, 5 and 6 Verses of
this Chapter) yet it is not wholly restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this, but comprehends in it the whole
Gospel-Dispensation, the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and Redemption by Jesus Christ,
which he calls <hi>preaching the unsearchable
riches of Christ,</hi> v. 8. And then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
in the next verse he calls it a <hi>Mystery,</hi>
a hidden, secret, unsearchable Mystery;
that is, it was so with respect to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Times, <hi>it had been hid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
from ages</hi> (as 'tis in the Greek) and that <hi>in
God,</hi> namely according to his Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
and Purpose. But because the Apostle
applies it to the wonderful Converting and
Reclaiming of the Pagan world, therefore
some hence conclude, that it is not meant
of the doctrine of the Gospel and of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
it self. But they are mean Arguers
that talk thus, and they discover themselves
to be no Genuine Sons of <hi>Reason,</hi> for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one knows that Particulars are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with Generals, and that one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not the others. And besides, they
shew that they are not acquainted with
the <hi>Comprehensive Sense</hi> of Scripture, and
have not studied the Sacred Stile, which is
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:107741:201"/>
of a wonderful Latitude, and at the same
time contains in it both a Singular and a
Common, a Special and a General, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
and a Larger Meaning.</p>
            <p>There is another Text that confirms this,
<hi>Col. 1. 26.</hi> where the Evangelical Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
is call'd a <hi>Mystery, which hath been
hid from ages and from generations.</hi> They
palpably misinterpret these words, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them wholly to the admitting of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> into the Church, for the word <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
refers to <hi>the dispensation of God,</hi> i. e.
the Evangelical Preaching, <hi>and the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his word,</hi> viz. by the Ministry of the
Gospel, in the immediately foregoing
verse. These, saith the Apostle, are a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi>
because the things which are now
preach'd and proposed in the Gospel were
hid from those that lived in the former
ages. And though it is added, that <hi>God
hath made known to his Saints the riches of
the glory of this mystery,</hi> yet this is spoken
Comparatively, and not Absolutely, for
these <hi>riches</hi> are <hi>the unsearchable riches of
Christ,</hi> as we heard before, that is, they
still remain in a great measure hidden and
unknown to us.</p>
            <p>Thus in these three places it is evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the Evangelical Doctrine is call'd a
<hi>Mystery</hi> chiefly in respect of the <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> of former ages. It was conceal'd
from the one under Types and Shadows
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:107741:202"/>
and Mystical Rites: it was kept secret from
the other by their adhering only to Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Philosophical Principles. In short,
the first knew little of it, the second knew
nothing; therefore it is deservedly call'd
a <hi>Mystery.</hi> And there are <hi>no other</hi> Texts
but these can be produc'd where the word
<hi>mystery</hi> is mention'd, with relation to what
Christianity <hi>was heretofore.</hi> It is true, when
our Saviour arriv'd, it was reveal'd, and
in some manner laid open; but yet not so
as that it ceases to be a <hi>Mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is the next thing I propounded,
<hi>viz.</hi> that Christianity <hi>is still a Mystery.</hi> In
this respect, and not with reference to what
it <hi>was before,</hi> it hath this denomination in
these Texts of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which I
shall now produce, and briefly glance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
First, our Saviour himself calls the
Grand Doctrines of the Gospel, <hi>the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Mat. 13. 11.
where not the <hi>Parables</hi> (as some fancy) in
which those Evangelical Truths were
couch'd, but the Truths themselves are
meant: for if it were otherwise, Christ
would have call'd them <hi>Parables,</hi> and not
<hi>Mysteries:</hi> but we find that he calls them
by this latter name, and that in plain contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinction
to <hi>Parables,</hi> as may be observ'd
not only in this <hi>v.</hi> 11. but in 10 and 13.
And this is more plain from the Parallel
places in <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 11. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 10.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:107741:202"/>
Those therefore that confound <hi>Parables</hi> and
<hi>Mysteries</hi> here have not learn'd to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of things aright, they make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Comparisons or Dark Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of Spiritual things, and the
Things that are Compared and Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Parables</hi> are the former, but <hi>the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of the kingdom of heaven</hi> are the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And the reason why many of the
Substantial Truths of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or <hi>the
kingdom of heaven</hi> (for in the stile of the
<hi>New Testament</hi> these are the same) are thus
denominated, is, because of the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
and Difficulty which attend them.</p>
            <p>Again, not only our Saviour but the
Great Apostle uses this language, when he
speaks of the Great Matters of Religion:
these are said by him to be <hi>the wisdom of
God in a Mystery,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 7. not only
because they were <hi>hidden from former ages,
and from the Princes of this world,</hi> v. 8. (both
<hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Rulers) but because they
are in themselves Mysterious and Obscure,
as the Apostle explains himself in <hi>v.</hi> 9. by
applying that passage, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor
ear heard, neither have entred into the heart
of man the things which God hath prepared
for them that love him.</hi> It is no wonder, saith
he, that they are ignorant of these Great
things, <hi>viz.</hi> the Method of Redemption
and Salvation by <hi>Christ</hi>'s Undertaking for
us, and all the Benefits and Priviledges
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:107741:203"/>
that attend these (for these are <hi>the things
which God hath prepared</hi> and provided in
the Gospel:) it is no wonder that these
are not fully known and perceived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are <hi>Mysteries,</hi> they surpass all
humane understanding, they are not to
be comprehended by our weak and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow
intellects; though, it is true, the
knowledge of these Great Articles of the
Christian Faith, so far as it is conducible
to <hi>Salvation</hi> is imparted to all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
as it follows, <hi>God hath reveal'd them
unto us by his Spirit,</hi> v. 10. And these
things are said in several other places of
the <hi>New Testament</hi> to be <hi>revealed;</hi> which
is not to be understood as if they were so
reveal'd, that we can <hi>fully</hi> comprehend
them, and see <hi>throughly</hi> into the nature of
them, but they are so reveal'd and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
that we have <hi>some</hi> knowledge of
them, and as much as is requisite (and no
Wise man would desire more:) but more
is unknown than is known. Hence we
may understand that Paradox of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>to know the love of Christ, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3. 19. The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
of Christ wherein he shew'd his
transcendent <hi>Love</hi> to us may be <hi>known,</hi> and
yet they <hi>pass knowledge,</hi> they far exceed the
utmost conceptions we can form of them.</p>
            <p>Next I might add, that the Apostles are
call'd <hi>the stewards of the mysteries of God,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:107741:203"/>
1. Cor.</hi> 4. 1. where all Commentators of
Note understand by <hi>the Mysteries of God,</hi>
the Dispensation of the Word as well as
of the Sacraments, and other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Evangelical Ministry. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the whole Administration of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
is meant here: this is a <hi>Mystery,</hi>
yea, even <hi>now</hi> it is so, for the Apostle actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
applies this Appellation of <hi>Stewards of
the Mysteries of God</hi> to himself and <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ.</hi> Christianity then is a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery:</hi>
there are several things in it of that
exalted and elevated nature, that humane
understandings cannot possibly comprehend
them: some doctrines lie under perpetual
Obscurity, they will by no means undergo
a scrupulous examination, they will not
bear a strict and severe scrutiny manag'd by
mere Reason.</p>
            <p>Again, the Apostle makes mention of
<hi>the mystery of his (i. e.</hi> Gods) <hi>will,</hi> Eph. 1.
which, as the Context plainly shews, is
meant of the Wise, but Mysterious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Man's Salvation contain'd in the
Gospel as it is <hi>now</hi> preach'd, for there is
not any one word or syllable in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
or following verses, that seems to
restrain it to what it was <hi>before,</hi> viz. before
Christ's Coming.</p>
            <p>And again, in chap. 6. of this Epistle,
v. 19. we read of <hi>the mystery of the Gospel,</hi>
where it is simply and irrespectively spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:107741:204"/>
(that is, without any regard to <hi>former</hi>
Times and Ages) of <hi>Christianity,</hi> or the
Gospel it self, and the true nature of it.
And that the Apostle refers not to what was
past, but speaks of the Gospel as it was at
that time when he preach'd it, is plain
from this that he immediately adds, that
<hi>for</hi> this very <hi>Mystery of the Gospel he was</hi>
then <hi>an Embassador in bonds,</hi> v. 20. But
it may be Objected, how could the Gospel
be <hi>Mysterious</hi> and Abstruse in it self, when
the Apostle in the same place would have
the <hi>Ephesians pray for him, that he might
make it known?</hi> The Answer is plain from
what we observ'd before upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19.
Though it be Mysterious and Dark, and
may be said to <hi>surpass knowledge,</hi> yet it is
in some degree to be <hi>known,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
may be <hi>made known,</hi> i.e. so far as
the things are capable of it. The Truth
and Certainty of all the doctrines of the
Gospel may be discover'd, yea and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
to the minds of those who are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and prepared for it: but still the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of sundry Evangelical Truths is kept
secret from some persons for a time, and
some of them are of that quality, that they
will ever surmount and baffle the utmost ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forrs
of our Intellectual Powers.</p>
            <p>In another place, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. the Apostle
mentions <hi>the mystery of God and of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:107741:204"/>
(or rather it should be rendred, <hi>even
of the Father) and of Christ,</hi> that is, the
Gospel or the Christian Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God the First Person in the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Trinity is declar'd to be the <hi>Father</hi>
of Christ, and Christ the Second Person
is declared to be the Eternal <hi>Son</hi> of
God, and God himself. These and the
like Fundamental Principles of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are Dark and Mysterious; and because
of these Sublime Truths <hi>Christianity</hi> it self
hath the name of <hi>Mystery</hi> given to it. If
there were no other place in the <hi>New
Testament</hi> but this, where the word <hi>mystery</hi>
is found, it could not create wonder, that
the <hi>Socinians,</hi> even for the sake of this
alone, contend that Christianity is not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and absolutely call'd a <hi>Mystery</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for here the <hi>Godhead</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as
well as of the <hi>Father</hi> is asserted, for the word
<hi>God</hi> is attributed to both Persons (<hi>God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Father and Christ</hi> being the same
with <hi>God, who is both Father and Christ)</hi>
and consequently if they deny <hi>Christ</hi> to be
very <hi>God,</hi> (as they do) they must deny the
<hi>Father</hi> to be so too.</p>
            <p>I proceed to another Text in the same
Epistle, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 3. whence it is manifest,
that in the stile and idiom of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>
the Gospel or Christianity hath the
name of a <hi>Mystery,</hi> for the Apostle expresly
calls it <hi>the mystery of Christ</hi> (the same with
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:107741:205"/>
               <hi>the mystery of the Gospel,</hi> in the place before
mention'd) and he requests the Prayers of
the <hi>Colossians</hi> for him, that <hi>God would open
unto him a door of utterance to speak</hi> this <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Christ,</hi> i.e. freely and openly to
preach the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as appears further from
what follows next, <hi>for which I am in bonds,</hi>
that is, a Sufferer, a Prisoner for my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hs of the Gospel. So that it
is impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sible (whatever is suggested to the
contrary) to understand the word here any
otherwise than of the do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>trine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
as it was <hi>then</hi> preach'd by this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle:
this is <hi>Mysterious</hi> and Hidden, and
in many things Inexplicable.</p>
            <p>So again, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9. by <hi>the mystery
of the faith,</hi> which the Ministers and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Church are exhorted to <hi>hold,</hi> i.e.
to defend and maintain, must needs be
meant the Evangelical Truths and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.
<hi>The holding the mystery of the faith,</hi>
is the same here with <hi>holding fast the form
of sound words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13. that is, the
Articles of the Christian Faith, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>And lastly, in that Text, on which I
found the present Discourse, Religion is
call'd, the <hi>Mystery of Godliness:</hi> for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the Apostle had made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Truth,</hi> which is held forth as
on a <hi>Pillar</hi> in the Christian <hi>Church,</hi> he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
some of the greatest and fairest
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:107741:205"/>
branches of it; and in order to that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us (that we may the better know
the true nature of them) that they are a
<hi>Mystery,</hi> and that not with relation to the
ages and generations before the Gospel,
but to the present Mysteriousness of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Institution; for by consulting the
Context you will find that the words are
spoken Absolutely and Entirely, without
any respect to the past times of the world
under <hi>Iudaism</hi> or <hi>Gentilism.</hi> They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to us the condition of Christianity as
it is <hi>at this day,</hi> and as it is <hi>in it self</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.
And so this and all the other Texts
that I last mention'd, are a baffle to what
some late Advocates of <hi>Socinianism</hi> pretend
to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the <hi>New Testament</hi>
the word <hi>Mystery</hi> is always used to signifie
something that is intelligible and clear in
it self, and in its own nature, but clouded
with figurative and mystical words; but
never to denote a thing that is dark and
unconceivable in it self. The contrary is
plain and evident from the fore-cited
Texts, and every unprejudiced man that
duly scans them must needs acknowledge,
that Christianity is there call'd a <hi>Mystery,</hi>
not in regard of what it <hi>was,</hi> but what
it <hi>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, there are some other Texts in
the <hi>New Testament,</hi> where the word <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
is mention'd, but it hath there no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:107741:206"/>
at all to the present Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Gospel</hi> or <hi>Christianity</hi> in it self consider'd.
Thus in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. the General and
Final Conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> in the last
ages of the world is call'd a <hi>Mystery.</hi> In
1 <hi>Cor. 13. 2. mysteries</hi> is a general word for
all matters of knowledge that are abstruse
and dark, and it refers more particularly to
the knowledge of future things, for <hi>to
know all mysteries</hi> seems to be explicatory of
the foregoing phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>to have
a gift of Prophesying,</hi> that is, foretelling and
declaring things to come, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is
taken in the preceding chapter, v. 10. In
1 <hi>Cor. 14. 2. mysteries</hi> is a large and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
term, and used by the Apostle to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
those divine doctrines which are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
and difficult, but it is not <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi>
applied by him, and therefore I have
not made use of it. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51. it
is restrain'd to a particular Truth, which
was unknown to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> at that
time, but <hi>St. Paul</hi> reveals it to them, <hi>behold,</hi>
saith he, <hi>I shew you a mystery,</hi> viz. this, that
<hi>we shall not all sleep,</hi> those that are alive at
at Christ's Coming shall not die, after the
manner of all other men, but <hi>we shall all
be changed,</hi> they shall undergo such an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
that their corruptible state shall
be chang'd into that which is incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and immortal. The Conjugal State is
said to be a <hi>mystery,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ph. 5. 32. because it

shadows forth the Union of Christ and the
Church: as the <hi>Sacraments</hi> were stiled <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>

<hi>Mystery</hi> is applied in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> chap.
1. v. 20. and chap. 17. v. 7. to particular
<hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations,</hi> which had a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
and spiritual meaning in them. In
<hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7. the <hi>mystery of God</hi> is said to be
<hi>finish'd,</hi> or <hi>fulfilled,</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here is as
much as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and it is meant of the
Glorious and Flourishing state of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church in the last times of the world,
which hath been kept as a <hi>Mystery</hi> from the
generality of men, but when the <hi>Seventh
Angel</hi> sounds his Trumpet, then (as we are
there assur'd) that <hi>Mystery</hi> shall actually be
accomplish'd and fulfill'd. But none of
these Texts refer to our present Matter, as
any Understanding Reader may perceive;
only I thought fit to produce them, that
they might not be misinterpreted.</p>
            <p>And now I have produced every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
place of Scripture, where the word
<hi>Mystery</hi> occurs, and I have faithfully and
impartially set them before the Considerate
in their true and proper light, that they
may have a view of the right and genuine
meaning of them, and not misunderstand
and misapply the word (as some have done)
to the great prejudice of Truth; but that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:107741:207"/>
more especially they may be convinc'd of
this, that <hi>Mystery,</hi> as it is applied in the
Sacred Writ to the Christian Doctrines, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
the <hi>Nature</hi> of them, and lets us
know that <hi>Christianity</hi> hath this Title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it, because it is a Real <hi>Mystery</hi> in it
self.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (after I have thus clear'd the
way) I will offer this <hi>Proposition,</hi> and make
it good, that <hi>the Sublime Truths of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion still retain, and ever shall the
nature of a Mystery.</hi> This in general is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from that idea and notion which we
have of a <hi>Mystery</hi> (which we learn from
the Original denotation of the<note n="*" place="bottom">

whether we borrow it from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or

the Chief Doctrines and Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
they are in a great measure hid, and
as it were lock'd up from us. Many of
the Articles of our Christian Faith are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with great Darkness: a Veil is cast
over them, and we are not able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into them. Thus Christianity is a
<hi>Mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But particularly and distinctly to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
this, I will insist upon these two
Heads, 1 Christianity is an incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:107741:207"/>
Mystery <hi>in a special manner to some.</hi>
2. In a more extensive way of speaking, it
is so to all.</p>
            <p>I begin with the first, Christianity is in
a special and singular way a <hi>Mystery</hi> to <hi>some</hi>
persons, and ever will be. Those whom I
here mean are all such as (according to the
Apostle's Emphatick stile)<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Iohn 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>lie in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,</hi>

and Corruption, and have felt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Divine Birth and Renovation,
which are the sole gift of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
These, as long as they remain in this
wretched state, are<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Iohn 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>in darkness</hi> (as the
same Inspired Writer speaks) that is, they
have no Effectual and Saving Knowledge
of the divine Truths of the Gospel, they
understand nothing of them to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
for these cannot be thus known but
by Divine Illumination, by a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
discovery from above, which they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
debar themselves of. <hi>Thou hast hid
these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast reveal'd them unto babes,</hi> saith our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 33. Therefore to the
former of these the Fundamental doctrines
of the Gospel concerning the Redemption
of mankind by the Blood of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and
much more the doctrines of Regeneration,
Faith, Self-denial, Mortification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:107741:208"/>
no other than <hi>Mysteries,</hi> yea insignificant
<hi>Iargon</hi> to them. We hear the same Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Master speaking at another time thus,
<hi>It is given</hi> (it is a Particular Donation; a
Special Grant) <hi>unto you</hi> (my Disciples) <hi>to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven,
but to them (i.e.</hi> the whole Multitude, who
are not Enlightned) <hi>it is not given,</hi> Mat.
13. 11. There are such representations of
those Heavenly and Divine things made
by the Holy Spirit in the hearts of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
as are not to be found in others.
Which is according to those other Sayings
of our Saviour, <hi>The Spirit of Truth the
world cannot receive, because it seeth him not,
neither knoweth him (i.e.</hi> in a Saving way)
<hi>but ye know him,</hi> Joh. 14. 17. <hi>O righteous
Father, the world hath not known thee.</hi> Joh.

               <hi>Grotius, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not the same

This Interpretation of this Learned Writer
is the more considerable, because the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
I'm concern'd with at present have so
great an esteem and veneration (and that
not unjustly) for him, and boast that he
is theirs. It appears they are mistaken, for
now he is ours, whilst he directly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
avows the Apostle's <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Man</hi> to be one that is wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by the light of Natural Reason and
Humane Wisdom. Such a one, having no
Supernatural guidance and direction, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
(as long as he is such) attain to a
Right Knowledge of the things of God,
because <hi>they are foolishness unto him,</hi> as the
Apostle here subjoyns. Nay, he adds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>he cannot know them,</hi> there is no Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of the thing. That the Natural
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:107741:209"/>
man should rightly perceive the things of
the Spirit of God, <hi>implies as evident a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
as to say, a Blind man should be
able to see things visible.</hi> So a<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Iackson,</hi> Vol. 1. Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. 3. Book 4.</note> Judicious
Divine of our Church expresses himself
concerning this matter. The ground of the
Apostle's Assertion follows, which is very
remarkable: <hi>These things</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the
Spirit of God</hi> can't be known by a Natural
man, <hi>because they are Spiritually discerned.</hi>
Spiritual things are discover'd and known
in a peculiar way, and such as is proper to
Good and Holy men only. These persons
have an inward sense and conviction of
the Reality of the things, and they know
the true Value and Worth of them. They
know them so as to make them their own
proper Concern, they know them so as to
feel an influence from them on their hearts,
affections and lives. Thus a <hi>Religious</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
knows and discovers these things in an
other manner than <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
men do.</p>
            <p>It is true, the knowledge of both these
is alike as to some sort of discoveries rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Holy things. Thus not only the
Grammatical, Critical, Rhetorical, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,
and Philosophical part of the Bible
may be understood by the one as well as
the other (for the Worst men may have as
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:107741:209"/>
great an insight into these as the Best) but
even the Theological part of this Inspired
Book, so far as is meant by it the meer Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
and Notional discovery of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Truths, may be equally known by
both. But to know the Truths contain'd
in this Sacred Volume so as to be better'd
by them, is from Supernatural Light alone:
and this is it which distinguishes the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
from the <hi>Natural</hi> man. This latter
falls short of the other in this, that he hath
not attain'd to that <hi>Spiritual discerning</hi> of
Evangelical truths which the Apostle speaks
of, and without which it is utterly impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to have such a knowledge of them
as will be effectual to Salvation and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I will add only one Text more, 2
Cor. 4. 3. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to
them that are lost in whom the God of this
world (i.e.</hi> Satan) <hi>hath blinded the minds of
them who believe not, lest the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Gospel of Christ, who is the image of
God, should shine unto them.</hi> Here it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that the Gospel is <hi>hid</hi> from some
persons, yea, and we are told from <hi>whom,
viz.</hi> such as (according to the foregoing
stile of the Apostle) are <hi>Natural</hi> men, those
that live in their sins, and suffer their minds
to be blinded and perverted, to be corrupted
and debauch'd by the Diabolick Spirit, the
Prince and Ruler of this lower world. To
such the Gospel and the Truths of it
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:107741:210"/>
are meer Darkness. Thus it abundantly
appears from the Sacred Writ (whence we
are to fetch our discoveries concerning
these things) that the Proposition which I
laid down is an impregnable and unshaken
Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christianity retains <hi>still</hi> the
nature of a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and that more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as so <hi>some</hi> persons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reason</hi> is plain, because Natural
Strength is not sufficient of it self to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
these Divine Truths. Unless the Soul
be illuminated by the Holy Spirit, these
remain unintelligible, and wholly inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
and useless as to any Saving vertue
and efficacy. This I take to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Saviour's words, <hi>Iohn 3. 3. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a man be born again, he cannot see the
kingdom of God.</hi> Unless (as the Apostle
speaks) he be <hi>renewed in the spirit of his
mind,</hi> and that by the power of the Holy
Ghost, he cannot understand aright the
Truths of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which is call'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>the kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>of heaven:</hi>
he cannot <hi>see,</hi> he cannot <hi>enter into</hi> (as 'tis
express'd in <hi>v.</hi> 5.) those divine things. This
is that which our Saviour avers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.
27. <hi>Neither knoweth any man the Father but
the Son, and he to whosoever the Son will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
him,</hi> viz. by an Inward and Effectual
Discovery, for they had the Outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
then. When the Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi>
acknowledged <hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:107741:210"/>
God,</hi> our Saviour told him, that <hi>flesh
and blood had not reveal'd this to him, but
his Father who is in heaven,</hi> Mat. 16. 17.
It was not the work of Nature, but of the
Spirit of God the Father that had effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
wrought this Knowledge in him. This
sort of Light is peculiarly from <hi>the Father
of lights:</hi> this Singular <hi>Wisdom</hi> is <hi>from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove:</hi>
and accordingly (as some interpret
that place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 13.) the knowledge of
these Heavenly and Spiritual things is call'd
<hi>ascending up to heaven.</hi> From thence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
that Insight into the things of God,
which no Natural man hath attain'd to. For
in this Degenerate State of mankind the
Great Points of our Religion are under a
Seal, and lock'd up from us, and are never
to be disclosed till a Divine Light opens
our eyes. We must of necessity remain
Blind till that <hi>Eye-Salve,</hi> Rev. 3. 18. be
effectually applied. And it can be applied
only by the Holy Spirit, whose proper
work it is to dispel that spiritual dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
whereby the mind is indisposed to
understand and discern divine matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
            <p>This is variously express'd in the Holy
Writings, <hi>viz.</hi> by such terms as these, <hi>shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in our hearts, to give the light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
2 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>giving us an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to know,</hi> 1 John 5. 20. <hi>enlightning the

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:107741:211"/>
Vnction from the Holy One,</hi> 1 John. 2. 20.
Which cannot be better paraphras'd and
explain'd than in the words of an Eminent
Prelate of our Church,<note n="*" place="bottom">Bishop <hi>Pearson</hi> on the Creed. <hi>p.</hi> 327, 328.</note> 
               <q>The same Spirit

to the Universal Church, doth

There is, they say, in all men that natural

in a spiritual way. They are enabled by

(abstract from what is Supernatural) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Evangelical doctrines propounded to them.

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:107741:212"/>
approach to an <hi>Heresie</hi> long since condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

known, that it was the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Error to
assert, that men can attain to a perfect
knowledge of their duty and an ability to
perform it by meer Natural Reason, by
the bare help of that light which Nature
gives them. And in this (as well as some
other Points) the <hi>Socinians</hi> symbolize
with those Ancient Hereticks. They cry
up <hi>Reason</hi> as the Only thing in Religion:
this with them, like the <hi>Archaeus</hi> among the
<hi>Chymists,</hi> doth all feats, produces all ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
Though these men<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

great Abhorrers of those who talk of <hi>the
Light within them,</hi> yet it is evident, that
they allow of the very same Principle and
Practise: they equal the Light of Reason
to the Holy Scripture, and say it will serve
instead of this, and that it is as good as
Scripture, because all men may be Saved
by it. Therefore this they urge as the One
thing Necessary in Religion, and assure
their Proselytes, that this alone is sufficient
to conduct them to Eternal Happiness.
Which is not unlike the Attempt of those
late <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who would teach the people
of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Siam</hi> the way to Heaven by

            </p>
            <p>2. This gives an account of that Scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of true Divine Knowledge and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is observable in the world. There
are <hi>Secrets</hi> in the Christian Faith which are
known but by a few, and therefore <hi>True
Christians</hi> must needs be Rare. There is
indeed an Equivocal sort of <hi>Christians</hi> in
the world, who boldly assume the <hi>Name,</hi>
but are strangers to the Thing it self: they
boast of that Honourable Title, but are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless
of the True Import of it, and (to
use the Apostle's words) though <hi>they think
they know something, they know nothing as
they ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 2. These are
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:107741:213"/>
very Numerous, and every place swarms
with them; but the number of those who
have a Practical Knowledge and Sense of
Gospel-Truths is very mean and low. The
Multitude of those who derive their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
from <hi>Christ</hi> have not attain'd to
this Accomplishment; and the reason is,
because it is by their own default <hi>hidden</hi>
from them, they are unwilling to receive
the Divine Supernatural Light into their
minds. Let us implore the assistance of
the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the Great and Heavenly
<hi>Mystagogue,</hi> the Effectual Interpreter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Secrets, and who alone can discover
them to us, that he would vouchsafe to
enlighten and irradiate our souls in such a
manner as shall be really beneficial to us.
Let us beg the aid of the Spirit of Truth, to
lead us into the Advantageous Knowledge
of all Evangelical Truths, and to enable
us to feel them as well as know them. Thus

               <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that it is such, even in

There would be no farther Contest about
these if the abovesaid Proposition did but
take place in mens minds. This must needs
be so, at least in the nature of the thing it
self, because when it shall appear, that there
are Fathomless Secrets in Christianity, and

            </p>
            <p>That one Text alone, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9, 12.
is sufficient to prove this, <hi>We know in part,</hi>
saith the Apostle, which refers to the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
mention'd in the foregoing verse, by
which (as it is agreed by all) is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the knowledge of <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical</hi>
matters: and then it follows by
way of natural consequence, <hi>We prophesie
in part,</hi> for our <hi>instructing</hi> of others must
be answerable to our <hi>own knowledge,</hi> which
is but in part. He superadds, <hi>Now we see
through a glass,</hi> that is, either as men look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through a <hi>Perspective</hi> on an Object a
great way off, and therefore made Obscure
by its great Distance from the eye; or, as
persons <hi>beholding themselves in a Glass</hi> or

this sufficient to set forth the Meanness and

matters, but he adds another Emphatick
expression, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in a riddle,</hi> i.e.
in a very Obscure, dark and intricate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and therefore our Translators render
it [<hi>darkly.</hi>] The sum of what the Apostle
saith, is this, that we have but a Partial
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:107741:215"/>
discovery of some Divine Truths, our
Sight of them is very Imperfect: there
are certain Points of Christianity which are
not within the sphere of our Capacities,
but are in themselves Aenigmatical and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse.</p>
            <p>And these passages are the more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
if we call to mind the peculiar qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the <hi>Person,</hi> who writes thus: It
was that Apostle who was famous for his
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> he, who among all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
was the only man that was brought up
a <hi>Scholar,</hi> for we read that he was educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the School of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a Celebrated
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctor and Professor, and thence
was stock'd with all the <hi>Iewish</hi> Literature.
And he that was well skill'd in the <hi>Heathen
Poets</hi> (as his Quotations in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
let us know) was questionless not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in other parts of <hi>Humane Learning,</hi>
which he had the advantage of furnishing
himself within his own Native City, that
of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> which was at that time a famous
<hi>Vniversity.</hi> And these Excellencies joyn'd
with his own Natural Parts and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which, (as we may gather from his
Acute Reasonings and Arguings on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions)
were of the highest pitch, could
not but render him a very Accomplish'd
Person, such as was able to discern and
judge of things in the best manner, and to
know and comprehend whatever was to be
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:107741:215"/>
known and comprehended of them. But
we are to remember this further, that his
knowledge in <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Sacred things</hi> was
as eminent, for even as to these he had
those Helps which other Christians had not,
yea, which the rest of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were not
honoured with, for he tells, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 11,
12. That <hi>the Gospel which was preached of
him was not after man, for he neither recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it of man, neither was he taught it but
by the revelation of Iesus Christ.</hi> He was in
an Extraordinary and unparalell'd manner
call'd to the Office by <hi>Christ</hi> himself then
in heaven: he had Immed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate declarations
of God's will by <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations,
2 Cor.</hi> 12. 1. yea, by <hi>abundance of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
v. 7. for he had the matchless digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and priviledge to be <hi>caught up to the
third heaven, into paradice</hi> (as he other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
expresses it) the Seat of the Divine
Majesty, and the place of the Blessed; and
there <hi>he heard those unspeakable words</hi> (those
Doctrines and Truths) <hi>which it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a man to utter,</hi> i. e. fully, <hi>v.</hi> 4.
Then were display'd before him those <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>
and Profound Doctrines which his
Writings every where abound with; seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of which are not so much as mention'd
in the Writings of the other Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which plainly shews, that he far excell'd
them in Spiritual Knowledge, and in the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:107741:216"/>
understanding of some of the Main Heads
of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>And yet, behold! this Apostle who was
thus bless'd with all manner of Intellectual
Accomplishments, and was possessor of all
the Knowledge that Nature or Art and his
own happy Genius could furnish him with,
and (which is unspeakably much more) all
that Knowledge that God himself vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to infuse into him, and inspire him
with: Behold! this very Apostle is the
man who uses here this humble and mean
language, <hi>We know in part, we see through
a glass darkly.</hi> When he saith <hi>we,</hi> he means
himself as well as other Christians; nay,
it appears that he chiefly and principally
intends <hi>himself,</hi> for he changes the plural
into the singular, <hi>v. 12. Now I know in
part,</hi> as much as to say, notwithstanding
all my advantages of Knowing much more
than others, I acknowledge my self to be
but a Smatterer, a Novice: I own my self
to have but a mean and imperfect insight
into the <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Mystical</hi> Points of the
Gospel: and if they were not such, I
should not have so short and partial a
knowledge of them. This is an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
place of Scripture, to prove that
there are <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Christianity, such
Divine Truths which no quickness of
thoughts, no sharpness and sagacity of
mind can wholly reach. And therefore

if St. <hi>Paul</hi> be in the right, we know who
have taken the wrong part. If <hi>Plato</hi> could

I question not but it may be made
evident from Strict Reason that the Main
System of the <hi>Christian</hi> Theology is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and harmonious in it self, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to all the Divine Attributes and
Perfections, that the Coming of Christ in
the flesh was requisite in order to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of lost Man, that his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
were the most Rational Expedient
for the restoring of mankind, that they
were the most Proper and Suitable Method
to reduce lapsed creatures, and raise them
up again after their fall, and that Christ's
Divinity was no more impair'd by being
joyned to the Humane Nature, than the
Soul of Man is by its Union with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
These and several things of this kind
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:107741:218"/>
I could make clear and evident, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shew that Christianity is consonant to
the most sober Reflections we can make
on things, that it is agreeable to the most
solid and natural Reasonings we can form.
For we are not to imagine (as some Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
Spirits do) that Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
contradicts the principles of Reason:
this being a certain Truth, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to know that any <hi>Revelation,</hi> i. e.
any Reveal'd doctrine is from God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we be first <hi>Reasonably</hi> satisfied that it is
from him. Besides, <hi>Reason</hi> is from God as
well as <hi>Revelation,</hi> and therefore if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the latter, we must on the very same
ground attend to the former, because that
is from God no less than this. Wherefore
those who oppose one to the other make

            <p>And here I cannot but take notice of the
Injustice of some late Penmen, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

This they craftily urge and aggravate, to
blacken the Cause which they have set
themselves against: but there is nothing of
Truth in the accusation, but (as they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it) a great deal of Falshood and
Wrong. For we give unto <hi>Reason</hi> the

and necessity of it in Religion, yea in the

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:107741:219"/>
unutterable Abstrusities and Difficulties in
the notion of an Eternal Self-subsisting Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
We cannot penetrate into the Omnis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience
and Omnipresence of God: we
have not adequate conceptions of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability,
his Justice, his Faithfulness:
and none of his Perfections and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are throughly understood by us. So
that according to the way of Arguing,
which some men use, <hi>viz.</hi> that Nothing
must be receiv'd in Religion but what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
according to plain Reason, they may
renounce the <hi>Deity</hi> it self, for in the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we have of the Nature and Attributes
of God there are some things above our
Reason.</p>
            <p>The Manner how Three real Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are united in One Essence or Substance
of the Godhead is not comprehensible, but
the Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> puts it beyond all doubt
that it is so. There are many Principles
and Propositions in Christianity which are
far above our weak capacities. There are
several things in the Conduct of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and Salvation, the exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of which is hidden from us: at least
the Modes and Circumstances belonging to
them are not to be comprehended, though
we are sure of the General Truth. There
are sundry Difficult things occur concerning
the Incarnation of the Son of God, but we
have no reason to disbelieve the Doctrine
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:107741:220"/>
it self.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <q>I know, saith St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
that the <hi>Son</hi> was begotten of the <hi>Father,</hi>
but <hi>how</hi> I know not. I know he was born
of a Virgin, but I can't tell the Manner
of it: for we acknowledge the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Both Natures, and yet the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of both we are not able to declare.</q>
So as to the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Natures in Christ's Person, we
have not an accountable idea of it, though
the thing it self is agreeable to Reason. We
cannot answer all the doubts concerning
Christ's <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> but upon incontesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grounds we may be convinc'd of the
Truth of it. The <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the same
Body at the last day is an unquestionable
Article of the Christian Faith: but if we
be ask'd how a dead body crumbled into
dust, and perhaps dissipated by the winds
into several quarters, or how a body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into the substance of other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
after innumerable introductions of
new shapes, preserves its proper Identity

               </gap> no other than this, We cannot tell. But
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:107741:220"/>
it will be said, This is an unbecoming An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for any man that pretends to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Understanding in the matters of
Religion. I reply, This is no ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming,
but to pretend to give Reasons
and Accounts, when we are not able to
do it, is very unbecoming and absurd. And
many other Points of Christianity are hid
from our Natural Reason, and are Inscru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Secrets. Our Religion hath many
Mazes and Labyrinths in it which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
extricate our selves out of. The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
not only <hi>was,</hi> but <hi>is</hi> a Mystery: it is
so <hi>now,</hi> and will continue so to the end of
the world.</p>
            <p>If we enquire into the <hi>Reasons</hi> of this,
so far as we are able to judge, there may
be this Account given of it:</p>
            <p>1. That which <hi>Solomon</hi> suggests to us
ought to have the preference to all other
Reasons that can be assign'd, <hi>It is the glory
of God,</hi> saith he, <hi>to conceal a thing,</hi> Prov.
25. 2. The Supreme Being is pleas'd to
hide the knowledge of several things from
men, because this redounds to the Honour
and Glory of the Divine Majesty. Hereby
the Sovereignty of the Great Disposer of
all things is displayed to mankind: hereby
his Transcendent Nature, which infinitely
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urpasses that of all Created beings, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
to the world. This was the sense
of another Wise and Holy man, who speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:107741:221"/>
of the Almighty, saith, <hi>He giveth not
account of any of his matters,</hi> Job 33. 13.
Though sometimes, yea, frequently he
vouchsafes to render a Reason of what he
saith, as well as of what he doth, yet in
many cases he thinks fit to deal with us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
and not <hi>to answer, or account for
all his matters,</hi> as the <hi>Original</hi> hath it.
Though we demand a Reason, he is not
obliged to give, because (as it is rightly
suggested by the same Pious Observer) <hi>God
is greater than man,</hi> v. 12. He is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exalted above the nature of mortal men,
and therefore it is unsufferable boldness to
search into his Divine Secrets, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
our selves a full comprehension of
them. For these things are conceal'd from
us on purpose to give us an assurance of
the Infinite Nature and Wisdom of our
Maker. We hence are effectually taught,
that <hi>God</hi> is not like one of us, that his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Properties are of an immense and
unsearchable nature, not to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by us. Even concerning Visible

Much more then may we, nay ought we to
pronounce the same concerning <hi>Divine</hi> and
<hi>Heavenly</hi> matters: the <hi>Transcendent</hi> Nature
of them discovers a Wisdom much more
so. This is a convictive proof to sober and
thoughtful minds, that God is Great and
Wise above what humane intellects can
conceive. This then is a sufficient account
(if there were no other) of the Unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of the Divine Nature, and those
things that immediately depend upon it,

of these Sacred things, and our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
concerning them are useful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and uphold the Reverence and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of them. If the sacred doctrines of
the Gospel were to be prostituted to the
capricious reasonings of vain men, if we
could exactly fathom all the depths of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
we should not have that superlative
Admiration and Regard for them which
they deserve: and we plainly see, that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:107741:222"/>
those who pretend to lay them open, do in
reality undervalue them, and lower the
Excellency of them. We have reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the Abstruseness of Divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
should inhanse our Esteem of them,
and render them in our apprehension
(what they are in themselves) August,
Great and Venerable. And consequently,
we must not reject the doctrines conveyed
to us in the Holy Scripture, because they
are thus Obscure, and exalted above our
natural light, but we are rather to admire
and reverence them because they are so, <hi>i. e.</hi>
because they are of so high and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a nature.</p>
            <p>3. This likewise might be added, that
it is the divine will and pleasure, that not
only our Estimation and Reverence, but
our <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Sedulity</hi> should be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by this means. For though we cannot
reach to a full knowledge of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
matters, and though we are forbid
a bold and saucy prying into them, yet
there is always something gain'd by a Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Modest Searching into them, and
by an industrious and careful Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Holy Oracles, where these infallible
dictates are. For as there are Plain and
Obvious Truths in the Sacred Writings,
so there are others that are Abstruse and
Perplexed, to check our Negligence and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:107741:222"/>
Oscitancy, our carelesness end unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and to rouze our Industry, and
encourage our pains and study: for those
portions of Scripture wherein these Truths
are contain'd, will abundantly employ
these, and recompence our labour. Even
on this account it was fitting that there
should be some <hi>Mysteries</hi> in our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>4. The Chief and Grand Reason to be
assigned of this matter (and which I will
more <hi>amply</hi> insist upon) is this, that the
very <hi>Nature of the things themselves,</hi> which
we are treating of, renders them <hi>Mysterious</hi>
and <hi>Difficult.</hi> For things of an Infinite
and Transcendent nature are above the
reach of finite understandings. Such is <hi>God,</hi>
such is the Sacred <hi>Trinity,</hi> and such are
those Doctrines which I mention'd before,
which immediately relate to the Godhead it
self and its Attributes, or the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
subsisting in the Godhead, or more
particularly <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and his Blessed
Undertakings for us, which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
matter of the Gospel, the knowledge
of which depends wholly on the Will of
God; for no mortal man could have any
notice of them, unless God himself had
been pleas'd to discover them. And now
when they are discover'd, they are of that
high and soaring nature, that no humane
creature can reach them: they are of that

towering pitch, that they are above all
finite intellect. More especially the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Sacred <hi>Trinity</hi> is such, that it is
above being described: which we are not
to be dissatisfied with, for if the Holy <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
were not abstruse and mysterious, it
would not be what it is, and what it
cannot otherwise be. Therefore he that
expects this doctrine should be Clear, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
an Impossibility, both as to the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it self, and as to us. For this Infinite
and Perfect <hi>Trin-Vnity</hi> is in its <hi>own nature</hi>
unsearchable, and in respect of our finite
and imperfect Understanding is much more
so. Wherefore those Propositions which
belong to this Infinite Subject must needs
be dark and intricate, and cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
How can we imagine we should be
able to grasp these things which consider'd
in themselves are of so elevated a nature?
It is certain we cannot with reason imagine
or expect this.</p>
            <p>And we may be convinc'd of it from
this one Consideration (which I will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
enlarge upon) <hi>viz.</hi> that many things
of a <hi>meaner and lower degree,</hi> such as the
Common Works of Nature, and the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
of the Visible and Sensible World
have rais'd great Disputes, and after all
the exactest enquiries into them, remain
still hidden and obscure: How then can
we expect that <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Supernatural</hi>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:107741:223"/>
things should be void of all Obscurity?
An Acute Naturalist speaking of things of
the former sort, tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Nobis rimari illa &amp; conjecturare in occulto tantùm licet.—Neque enim omnia Deus humanis oculis not a fecit. Quota pars operis tanti nostris oculis committitur?</hi> Senec. Nat. Quest. Lib. 7.</note> 
               <q>That he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not to Science, but contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with bare guessing; for God (saith
he) hath not laid open all things to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
sight and perception: there is a
considerable part of this great Work,
which the Wise Maker of all things hath
thought good to hide from our Eyes.</q>
Thus this Great Philosopher ingenuously
owns his Ignorance, and at the same time
the Wise Disposal of Heaven. That No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Trite Problem of the <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Matter</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> hath posed all
the Learned heads in the world: and yet
upon this one Property of Matter depends
the whole System of Geometry, and all
the Mathematick Arts and Sciences, which
(above all others) boast of their Certainty
and Demonstration. It is not to this very
day unanimously agreed what the True
<hi>Scheme of the world</hi> is, and whether the
<hi>Sun</hi> or the <hi>Earth</hi> be the Center of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse.
If we consider it well, it is a
manifest Argument of our shallow Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and Sense, that we can't tell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
we are, and which part of the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:107741:224"/>
World is our Situation. It is another proof
of our Ignorance, yea of the defectibility
of our Senses, that we dispute whether the
Earth <hi>moves</hi> or no. A great many Learned
and Wise Men of late, and some profess'd
Mathematicians (not the worst Judges in
the case) hold it doth: and yet ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of Considerate heads before this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought of it. And our <hi>Senses</hi> tell us
no such thing, but the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the Earth stands Still, and is Immoveable.
This is certain that the Sense and Feeling of
<hi>all men</hi> in the world are mistaken, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their <hi>Proper Object,</hi> and that <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
(which is somewhat hard to digest) or
else the Earth is not moved, is not a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
hath no diurnal Revolution.</p>
            <p>That the doctrine of the <hi>Earth</hi> is Obscure
and Difficult, we have a Remarkable Proof
in the late <hi>Theorists,</hi> and others that have
appear'd on the stage. They have been
pleas'd to thrust very <hi>Harsh</hi> and <hi>Incredible</hi>
things upon us; and (to speak freely) there
are some of them that are so far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and giving a rational account of
the <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nomena</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> that they have
rendred this doctrine more obscure and
perplexed than ever it was: besides that,
they have entrench'd upon the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Verity, and have abandon'd that Account
of the <hi>Creation,</hi> and particularly of the
<hi>Earth,</hi> which the Inspired Writer hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:107741:224"/>
This is certain, that seeing they
run a tilt against one another, they cannot
<hi>all</hi> of them be in the right about their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Earth;</hi> and it is a question
whether <hi>any</hi> of them have light upon the
Truth, excepting what One of them hath
deliver'd as matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and built upon
Clear <hi>Experiment</hi> and <hi>Observation,</hi> which
we owe to his Indefatigable Industry and
Great Sagacity. In brief, it must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
that they are very Ingenious
and Learned <hi>Conjectures,</hi> but some of their
respective <hi>Hypothesis</hi> and <hi>Solutions</hi> are load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with such <hi>Difficulties</hi> (for on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it is that I mention these things)
they are loaded (I say) and oppress'd with
such <hi>Difficulties</hi> as are able to stifle and
choak not only the restif and hide-bound
Faith of a <hi>Socinian,</hi> but the ordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

            <p>Then if we come to <hi>Particulars</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this <hi>Terrestrial Globe,</hi> with what
Perplexities are we beset? Are not only the
Old but the New Opinions concerning
them every day quarrell'd with, and their
Celebrated Authors and Founders turn'd
out of the Schools? And what is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
Because of the Uncertainty, Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

any Material Cause solve the <hi>Cohesion</hi> of

In many other Instances it might
be proved, that most of our late Learning
in Natural Philosophy hath been to shew,
that what hath been formerly said, is
false.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Our selves</hi> (who are Perfecter

part of us, then we are environ'd
with much greater Darkness and Wonders.

is so Near to him, and Intimate with
him; and yet the many disputes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
of Learned Writers about its Nature,
and Functions, and the manner and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of its Operations acquaint us how
obscure and uncertain mens notions are
concerning it. Especially we are yet to
seek how a being that is wholly Bodiless
is able to lay hold on Matter, to actuate
and inform it. No man can tell how the
Soul causes Motion by Thought, or how
by the same way it is able to put a stop to
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:107741:226"/>
bodily motion. We experience this to be
true, but it will puzzle us to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Manner of it. It is no more
to be explain'd and apprehended how the
Humane Mind can <hi>think</hi> or <hi>will</hi> the Animal
Spirits into Action, than that a man should
by his Thoughts or Will command the
Winds to blow, or the Flames to burn;
for the Spirits of the body, being Material,
are no more capable in themselves of being
thus actuated by the Soul than the others
are. And lastly, though we know we
have a <hi>Soul,</hi> and are as certain of it as any
thing in nature, yet it hath been long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
where it is, in what part of the
body it is placed. Though it be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
demonstrated, that there is such a
being as the Rational Soul, and that it is
really distinct from Matter, and that this
latter is uncapable of Cogitation (as was
never more nervously proved than of late
by a Great and Eminent Person of our
Church, against one that shews himself
inclined to believe that Matter can Think)
though, I say, it is evident, that there is
such a Distinct Being as is the Sovereign
Empress of all our Functions and actions,
yet it is not certainly known <hi>where</hi> her
Throne is. For some give her the whole
body for her seat, others believe she circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
in the Blood, and others assign her
the Heart as her particular Chair of State.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:107741:227"/>
And though, it is true, the most Piercing
Philosophers of late have confined her to
the Brain, yet they are not agreed <hi>in what
part</hi> of it her Residence is. Many other
Instances (indeed almost as many as there
are <hi>Phaenom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>na</hi> in the world) of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of Natural Speculations might be
produced. A great part of that which
passes for Knowledge is ingenious Guessing
and Surmise. And yet, notwithstanding
the Scruples and Difficulties which attend
all these things which I have mention'd,
the Things themselves are readily own'd
and assented to.</p>
            <p>So that these several Particulars, which I
have named, are clear demonstrations of
these two things; First, That Propositions
may be True, and consequently, that we may
give our Assent to them, though the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them surpasses our <hi>Reason,</hi> yea, tho'
it is not only hard but impossible to explain
it, and to give an account of the Manner
of it. Secondly, The foresaid Examples
plainly shew, that some things even in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may be <hi>above Reason,</hi> and yet not <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it,</hi> for if they were the latter, no
man would yield assent to them, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reject them as inconsistent and impossible.
But even the very persons with whom our
business is at present, profess their ready
assent to the truth and reality of all these
things, though they know not how to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:107741:227"/>
explain them, and solve the right manner
of them. Hence it follows, that we ought
not to disbelieve a thing meerly because it
surmounts our Reason, and that we are
not to infer from a thing's being <hi>above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
that it is <hi>contrary to it,</hi> for after this
rate we must discard all Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and believe nothing of the most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Occurrences in Nature. And what
hinders now, that we should not make the
like Deductions with reference to those
<hi>Higher matters,</hi> which I before mention'd?
May we not on much better grounds make
these two <hi>Inferences,</hi> viz. that we ought
not to disbelieve those things because they
exceed our Reason; and that though they
do so, yet it follows not thence, that they
are repugnant to Reason? Such Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as these are very good and valid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the difficult and recondite nature
of these Spiritual and Divine matters,
which far outdoeth that of Bodily and
Sensible things. And we shall find that
this is the way of Reasoning, which one of
the Ancientest and Learnedest of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Writers of the Christian Church
made use of against the <hi>Hereticks</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
of his and the immediately fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
times.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> adv. Haeres. l. 2. cap. 47.</note> He argues from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
in matters of Sense to those that
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:107741:228"/>
are Spiritual and of a Sublime Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Thus then, in imitation of that Great
Man, we may solidly argue, with relation
to the foregoing disquisitions in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
If in things of an inferior nature
there be such Obscurities and Difficulties
(which yet are no impediments to our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
how much more then in Higher
things may we expect there should be Great
Difficulties, and amazing Obscurities? If
Natural Knowledge be so Cloudy, is there
not reason to believe the Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
to be much more so? If we are not
able to find out the True System of the
Material World, how can we apprehend
the unspeakable nature of the Spiritual
one? If there be Mysteries in Philosophy,
surely there are Greater ones in the Gospel.
If the nature of a Groveling Plant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
us, how shall we be able to solve
all the difficult Problems in Christianity?
If a man can't attain all his life time to the
knowledge of a single Mineral, is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that he can in a much less time know
fully the Secrets of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
If he can't give an account of a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Insect, how shall he be able to unravel
the Mysteries of our Faith? If we can't
tell with all our reason and argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
how the Soul is united to, and acts
upon the Body, how is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> possible to tell
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:107741:228"/>
the manner of the <hi>Son</hi> of God's being joyn'd
to the Humane nature? or how could it
be expected we should give an account of
the Unity of the Three Persons in the
Godhead, or of other the like surprizing
doctrines in our Religion? If we have so
mean a discovery of what is within us, and
so near to us, and is the Best part of us,
yea, is Our selves, it is no wonder that we
can't arrive to a full knowledge of the
things that are without us, and are remote
from us, and which are not of the same
Limited nature with Our selves, but are
Boundless and Infinite. If it was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a Great Philosophick Wit, that
the Material World is <hi>indefinitely extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that the Compass of the Universe is
beyond all that we can imagine, that it is
impossible to frame a conception of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
and bounds of it, then may we not
with more reason hold the Intellectual
World to be a boundless Expanse, such as
we cannot possibly reach to the Extremity
of, an endless, unlimited, and as it were
infinite System? Especially if we speak of
the Divine and Supernatural things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, we must be forced to own this
Truth, and to confess, that what we know
of them is the least part of what is kept
from our knowledge, and that we cannot
possibly with the greatest art and wit attain
to a greater insight. For if there be <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha</hi>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:107741:229"/>
in Nature (as hath been shew'd) it is
not strange that there are <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which it is impossible (whatever some
pretend) to solve, by reason of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and Immense nature. These will
not admit of an accurate Inquisition, and
therefore all our knowledge concerning
them is defective, and must needs be so.
We are presently beyond our depth, we
are soon plung'd when we venture into
this Fathomless Ocean. The Reason is,
because the Mind of man can have no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of what is of so Transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a nature: especially it can't attain to
a compleat notion and perception of what
is Infinite.</p>
            <p>This alone were sufficient to decide the
Dispute between the <hi>Anti-Trinitarians</hi> and
us. If they would put the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
upon this issue, it would soon
have a period. I wish they would well
consider of it, and shew themselves (what
they so vaunt themselves to be) Masters of
True Reason. For then they would see
how unreasonable it is, that their thoughts
and expressions concerning the <hi>Infinite God</hi>
should be according to the nature of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
beings. They would see how absurd
it is to undertake to measure the Creator by
the Creature, and to apply the Properties
of Natural things to what is Supernatural,
as they deal in the doctrine about the Holy
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:107741:229"/>
               <hi>Trinity.</hi> They would find that what is
true of the former, is not necessarily so
of the latter, and consequently, that they
ought not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rgue from the nature of a
finite and created being to that of God.
They would be convinced, That <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
(to use the words of a<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thoughts, and of a very Philosophical
and Rational Genius, who professes that
the Scripture) <hi>declares nothing concerning
the Divinity of Christ and the Holy Trinity,
that is impossible, contradictious, or more
unintelligible than things that men ordinarily
assent to, who are free Philosophers, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing upon force or superstition, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Reason.</hi> They would not pretend to
such a penetration of mind as to dive into
the exact nature of the Deity, they would
be sensible of the unmeasurable dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between their weak capacities, and
what is Infinite and Immense. In sum,
they would confess, that they have not
right conceptions concerning the nature of
those Sublime Verities, which I have been
speaking of, whilst they contend, that
there is nothing Mysterious and Hidden
in them: nay, they would acknowledge,
that they have very wrong and perverse
notions of these things, and such as are
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:107741:230"/>
no ways agreeable to their nature. And
now to shut up this Head of my Discourse,
we are to remember, that the Truth and
Reality of Things are firm and unshaken,
and we can't think to dissettle them, but
our business is to adjust our notions to
the Things.. He that finds fault with them
for their Obscurity and Difficulty cavils at
the nature of the Things themselves, which
is the most irrational act imaginable, for
the Nature of Beings is stable and settled,
and we cannot alter it, and therefore to
require that it should be altered, is absurd
and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I argue not only from the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of the things themselves, but from the
<hi>present state</hi> we are in, which is capable of
no other than an Imperfect knowledge of
these Divine Secrets. This Accounr of the
matter is suggested to us by the Apostle,
for he makes a plain distinction between
<hi>knowing now in part,</hi> and <hi>seeing then</hi> (i. e.
hereafter) <hi>face to face, and knowing even as
we are known,</hi> 1 Cor, 13. 12. One he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
to the state of a <hi>Child,</hi> who is of
weak understanding and capacity, and the
other to that of a <hi>Man,</hi> who is of ripe
judgment and apprehension. The former
is our allotment in this world: Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and Divine Truths (for of these the
Apostle speaks in that place) are known by
us here only <hi>in part:</hi> and no otherwise
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:107741:230"/>
shall they, or can they be known as long
as we inhabit in these dark Vehicles of
Earth. I speak not this to disparage the
<hi>Christian Knowledge,</hi> for it must be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that there are many Plain aud Clear
Propositions, both as to the matter and
manner of the things contain'd in them,
which the Writings of the <hi>New Testament</hi>
furnish us with: and all the Practical
Truths of Christianity are easie to be
known, and are represented to us by Christ
and his Apostles in a very intelligible
manner. And as to the knowledge of those
very Doctrines, which I have been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, all True Christians have such a
measure of it, as makes them sufficiently
capable of understanding their Religion,
and of discharging their Duty, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so much as concerns them to know, so
much as is requisite to Salvation. But that
which I assert, and am proving, is this, that
these last sort of Truths are mix'd in us,
whilst we take up our residence on this
earthly stage, with much Ignorance and
Darkness. We comprehend not the full
meaning of them, because this is not suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to our present condition, which we
are now placed in. Thence it is, that there
are some Secrets mention'd in the Holy
Scriptures, which our understandings trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at, and are afraid to approach unto. Be
the mind of man never so Ambitious, and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:107741:231"/>
greedy of knowledge, it cannot grasp
them, for they are too Big: it cannot
reach them, they are too High: it cannot
fathom them, they are too deep: it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern them, they are too Remote:
in a word, they surpass humane abilities
at their highest pitch in this state of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
            <p>But it shall be otherwise afterwards, as
the Apostle informs us, <hi>When that which is
perfect is come</hi> (when we shall be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Heaven, a state of Perfection) <hi>then
that which is in part shall be done away,</hi> v. 10.
Then we shall no longer be in the dark,
then the imperfection of our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall cease, because our natures shall
be exalted. Then those Amazing Truths,
which pose us now, shall be fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<hi>i. e.</hi> so far as is fit for us, for even in
Heaven our Nature will still be but Finite,
and therefore our knowledge will be so
too. But by the change of our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
for heavenly ones (though still they
are the same, but otherwise qualified)
which will no ways impede, but promote
the operations of our Souls, and by being
taken into the more Immediate Presence of
the Holy Trinity, and stated in the Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion
of perfect Glory, we shall have our
minds exalted, and our understandings
widened to such a degree, that we shall
exactly and fully know every thing that is
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:107741:231"/>
to be known by us. Though the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
nature of the things, that we shall
know, shall be the same that it is now (for
there can be no alteration as to that) yet
our faculties shall not be the same as to the
degree of their capacity, and the manner
of their perception. When this gross Veil
of flesh shall be drawn aside, when the
Soul is rid of this Terrestrial Clog, and is
stript of these Deficient Organs, we shall
have a more clear and refined apprehension
of all Truths; and approaching nearer to
the Great Objects themselves, we shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to a more distinct view of them, and
a fuller insight into them, than now at this
distance from them we are capable of.
In that Separate state we shall, by reason of
an intimate Communion with the Supreme
Being, and a close Conjunction of the Soul
with him, be able to comprehend all the
Hard Points of Religion, to unravel all
Difficulties, to untie all Knots, to assoil all
Controversies. Then, and not before, we
shall be furnish'd with this ability. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those men make not a due distinction
between this life and that to come, who
talk against <hi>Mysteries</hi> in our Religion:
they are forgetful of the Present Scene of
things, and the Dispensation they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
they discourse as if they thought
themselves advanced to the Coelestial Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
already. But this very thing shews
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:107741:232"/>
their mistake, and that they are on this
side of that place, for they betray the
weakness and uncertainty of their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
These persons indiscreetly antedate
the Last day, anticipate the Future World,
and confront the revealed Purpose of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
for it was not design'd by the Supreme
Being, that we should here below have a
full insight into those Divine Recesses:
this is reserved for another State.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the <hi>Reasons,</hi> so far as we
can apprehend, why Christianity is a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi>
that is, why some of the most
weighty and momentous doctrines of it are
in some part hid from all mens understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>What I have said administers to us this
double Reflection, 1. From the premises
we may discover the vanity and falsity of
the <hi>Socinian</hi> Notion, that there are no <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>
in the Christian Religion. 2. We
may gather what is our Proper Duty and
Concern in the Case before us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I say, this discovers and detects,
and at the same baffles the false apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of those men, who cry down all My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
in Christianity, and tell us, that all
is levell'd to the meanest capacities. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
those Remarkable Attestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Contrary Truth from the plain
words of our Saviour and his Apostles, yet

them in Religion but Logick and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Demonstration. I have observ'd it
in the Modern Writings of this sort of
men (and of one also that is a late Friend
of theirs) that they seldom or never finish
a Discourse, though it be about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without bringing in of Geometrical
terms, especially Angles and Triangles.
These Gentlemen under a pretext of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks</hi>
would subvert Christianity, and
<hi>demonstrate</hi> us out of the Articles of our
Faith, and make a Triangle baffle the
<hi>Trinity.</hi> This is the grand Source of their
present Delusion, and of that disturbance
which they make in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> their
labouring to exclude all <hi>Mysteries</hi> from
Christianity. It arises wholly from this,
that they will not give credit to any thing
in Religion, but what is entirely Clear and

This is perfectly according to that

This is the brief, but full Character of a
<hi>Disciple of Socinus,</hi> (so far as we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in him upon the present occasion)
but certainly it ill becomes a <hi>Christian</hi> man;
for I have proved already, that such a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and genius are against the plain deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Christ and his Apostles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the very nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and unsuitable to the present state
we are in. Such a one forgets to distinguish
between <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Christianity.</hi> The
Professors of the former, act not amiss in
squaring all their opinions and sentiments
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:107741:233"/>
by Strict Reason: but the Adherers to the
latter, who are eminently stiled <hi>Believers,</hi>
must yield their assent to things, which
they cannot by Reason comprehend. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they confound the natures of
things, and take away the Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> which is much
more absurd and unaccountable than what
<hi>Scenkius</hi> in his <hi>Medical Observations</hi> fancies,
that it is possible for a man to receive the
<hi>Visible Species</hi> through his <hi>Nostrils,</hi> or in
plainer terms, that a man may <hi>See</hi> with his
<hi>Nose;</hi> for here is only a substituting of
one <hi>Bodily Sense</hi> for another, but in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
case there is a mistaking of one <hi>Mental
Operation</hi> for another, <hi>viz. Reason</hi> for <hi>Faith.</hi>
This is the Absurdity of those of the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi>
way, and we ought carefully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
it. We are to believe Christianity to
be a <hi>Reasonable Service</hi> (as the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
stiles it:) but it may be truly said
of those men, that they make Christianity
<hi>more reasonable than it is:</hi> that is, they
make it submit wholly to Humane and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason, and this is the ground of
their exploding all <hi>Mysteries.</hi>

previous Faith, which helps the eye-sight of the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:107741:235"/>
mind, clearly imbrace what we understand,
and firmly believe what we understand not.</hi>
The Reason of which Advice and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is this, that some things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reach of our Understandings may
be, and ought to be the matter of our
Belief. Which is founded on this, that
the object of Faith is of a much larger Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
than that of Reason, and therefore we
may give assent to some Propositions, which
we cannot explain and clear up by the
light of Reason.</p>
            <p>And besides, every Thinking Man ought
to revolve this in his mind, that <hi>Faith</hi> is of
an higher nature than <hi>Reason,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
was designed to bear Sway over it,
and to controul it. To this purpose it is
to be consider'd, that there are these Three
Faculties or Operations in Men, <hi>Sense,</hi> and
<hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and they gradually rise
one higher than the other. <hi>Sense</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to us with Brutes, and takes notice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Corporeal and External Objects, but
<hi>Reason</hi> is proper to us as we are Men, and
is bestow'd upon us to correct the mistakes
of <hi>Sense;</hi> thus by Sense we can't perceive
the Motion of the Sun and Stars, they so
couzen our sight that we can't apprehend
when they move, yea, they seem to stand
immoveable: wherefore we must consult
with something else than <hi>Sense,</hi> and that is
<hi>Reason,</hi> which tells us, that either those
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:107741:236"/>
Heavenly Bodies, or the Ground we stand
upon move very swiftly: our <hi>Reason,</hi> not
our <hi>Eyes,</hi> must give us an account of this.
Thus it is plain, that <hi>Reason</hi> controuls
<hi>Sense,</hi> and consequently is a higher and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
faculty. But then comes <hi>Faith,</hi> and
claims a Superiority over them both; for
as <hi>Reason</hi> was given by God to correct <hi>Sense,</hi>
so this Function was added to give a check
to <hi>Reason,</hi> as being Higher and Nobler
than that. This is the Order of these O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
in Man, and it is by Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
and therefore no man of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thoughts can find fault with it. If we
are free to acknowledge, that <hi>Reason</hi> is a
Curb to <hi>Sense</hi> (and we cannot deny it) then
we should be as forward to own, that <hi>Faith</hi>
is the same to <hi>Reason,</hi> and that we ought
to make use of the one to check and bridle
the other, when Sacred and Supernatural
things are under our consideration. Here
then, as is fitting, let us strenuously exert
our <hi>Faith,</hi> and not judge of the Divine
Being and the Truths revealed by him
according to humane measures, according
to what we find and perceive in one another,
still remembring that they are <hi>Mysteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Contrary Sentiment, there are
these three Great things that disparage it, 1. It
argues <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogant Stiffness.</hi> 2. It is an
undeniable proof of gross <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</hi>
3. It unavoidably introduces <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:107741:236"/>
in Religion.</hi> I will distinctly insist upon
this Triple Charge, and then leave the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
to judge of my performance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is a great argument of a <hi>Proud</hi>
and <hi>Haughty Spirit.</hi> For it must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from this Principle, that the men of
that perswasion will by no means acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their Short-sightedness, and the Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowness
of their Intellectuals. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
brook such Condescention as this, and
therefore they scorn to own any <hi>Mysteries.</hi>
If any Difficult Truths are propounded to
them, they have learnt of a Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
to cut the knot, instead of untying
it: they violently null the proposition,
and so make it no Mystery, as we see they
do in the Articles of the Trinity, and the
Incarnation of the Son of God, and the
like. For they pretend to manage all by
meer force of Reason, and reject all
propositions and doctrines which they
think come not up to this heighth. They
take it very ill, if you allow them not a
Catholick and Unbounded Knowledge of
every thing, whether finite or infinite, and
of the particular Manner and minutest Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
that appertain to them. They
disdain that there should be any thing
in nature which they are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
they deem it an unsufferable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to their understandings, that any thing
should be above the reach of them, that
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:107741:237"/>
there should be any Point of Speculation
so deep and abstruse, that they cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
to the very bottom of it: they scorn
to have it said, that there are any Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Darknesses in Religion, when their
minds are so bright, and their intellects are
so shining. What is this but <hi>Pride?</hi> What
is this but being over-conceited of their
natural Faculties, and having too great an
opinion of their own Rational Capacities?
what is this but an immodest and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
magnifying of these Powers? Yea,
what is it but a kind of aspiring to Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and attributing to themselves an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and Immense nature, an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and more than humane Wisdom?
<hi>Zophar</hi> gives us the true Character and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree

<hi>Vain man would be wise</hi> (this Empty Hollow

he is of such Arrogancy and Elati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mind, that he thinks it below him

have Instances on Record of those Humble

of the Divine Wisdom, and
the Exalted Truths that belong to it. The

not the price of it,</hi> (i. e. as
I apprehend, he cannot come up fully to
the Purchase, or, which is the same, the
Attainment of it, for we <hi>purchase</hi> things by
<hi>price) neither is it found in the land of the
living: the depth saith, it is not in me; and
the sea saith, it is not in me. Whence then
cometh Wisdom, and where is the place of
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:107741:238"/>
Vnderstanding? Seeing it is hid from the
eyes of all living, and kept close from the
fowls of the air,</hi> i. e. those that are most
quick-sighted, for Naturalists observe, that
the eyes of <hi>Birds</hi> generally excel those of
other Animals. But he concludes, <hi>God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the ways thereof, and he knoweth the
place thereof,</hi> that is, he hath reserved the
perfect knowledge of these Divine and
Supernatural things to Himself. This was
the humble sense of another Great and
Wise Man, the Royal <hi>Psalmist,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whom it is worth our observing, that
after he had asserted and maintain'd the
doctrine of God's <hi>Omniscience</hi> and <hi>All-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Providence,</hi> he adds,<note n="*" place="bottom">Psal. 139. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Such knowledge
is too wonderful for me: it is high, I cannot
attain unto it:</hi> which is as much as if he
had said, though it is impossible for me to
apprehend the infinite and boundless know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Eternal God, the Sovereign
Disposer of all things, though I can't tell
<hi>how</hi> he sees and foresees all things whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
yet I heartily own this Universal
Sight and Prescience of his, and I verily
believe it to be a certain and unshaken
Truth. It is <hi>Humility</hi> which furnishes a
man with such perswasion and language as
this, and it is this which causes him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and assert, that there are <hi>Mysteries</hi> in
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:107741:238"/>
his Holy Faith, which far transcend his
thoughts and conceptions. This is that
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> which according to another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Inspired Sage,<note n="*" place="bottom">Eccl. 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>is far off and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
deep,</hi> and therefore (as it follows)
<hi>who can find it out?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which irrefragable Testimonies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to adjoyn that of an <hi>Apocryphal</hi>
Writer (and the rather because I will take
occasion thence to offer a Conjecture on
that dark place)<note n="†" place="bottom">Eccl. 6. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Wisdom is according to
her Name, and she is not manifest unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
What is the meaning of that, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her Name?</hi> What Title hath <hi>Wisdom</hi>
that imports any such matter, <hi>viz.</hi> that she
is <hi>not manifest?</hi> Some Criticks think it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for <hi>Wisdom, Choc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi>
others to the Arabick <hi>Algnalam,</hi> but
what they propound seems to be very much
strain'd, and doth not reach the purpose.
And how can it seeing they forget that this
Book was writ in <hi>Greek,</hi> and that the Title
of it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? We must therefore repair to
the <hi>Greek</hi> for a solution, but we must first
confer with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> where we meet
with the Verb <hi>Saphah</hi> or <hi>Tsaphah,</hi> which
signifies <hi>to hide</hi> or <hi>cover,</hi> and thence it is
probable <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is derived: and this it is
likely is the <hi>Name</hi> that is here meant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though the language in which this
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:107741:239"/>
book was originally drawn up was <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
(as appears from the <hi>Prologue</hi> of it) yet it
was soon translated into <hi>Greek,</hi> because
the <hi>Iews</hi> at that time spoke <hi>Greek</hi> general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and had their <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> in
<hi>Greek:</hi> and accordingly this place hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the name of <hi>Wisdom</hi> in that
tongue, wherein there are many words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> and hence it is,
that the denomination of <hi>Wisdom</hi> imports
something <hi>hid</hi> and <hi>mysterious,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>she is according to her Name.</hi> The
<hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors had a sense of this, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from their Proverbial Saying, <hi>When
Elias comes, he will untie all knots,</hi> i. e.
solve all Difficult and Abstruse Points;
of which there are not a few in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There are sundry things hid from
our understandings here, which shall not
be clear'd till the last day. Now, if the
Wisest persons spoke thus concerning the
things of <hi>Religion</hi> (which is the <hi>Wisdom
of God</hi>) under those Dispensations of old,
is there not much more reason to say the
like of the <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi> under the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> when doctrines of
an higher nature are published to the world,
such as far surpass all humane comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?</p>
            <p>But there is a generation of men among
us that will not stoop to this, they will not
own themselves to be in a state of <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:107741:239"/>
Childhood,</hi> and <hi>Minority</hi> in this life,
though the Great Apostle (as we have
heard) expresly did, when he so far own'd
the deficiency of his Understanding, as to
say, <hi>he knew in part,</hi> and <hi>spake, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and thought as a Child.</hi> And all the
Great and all the Wise men in the world
have been ready to say the same, yea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with reference to matters of a <hi>lower</hi>
nature. The Learned in the Law confess
they have their Perplexed and Knotty
<hi>Cases,</hi> Statesmen their <hi>Arcana,</hi> Physicians
their Opprobious Maladies, Anatomists their
Unknown <hi>Ductus</hi>'s, Astronomers their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrical
Motions which they can't reduce
into regular and exact Order, Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
their Insoluble Problems. And, in
brief, most Professions and Sciences labour
under some insuperable Difficulties and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacies:
and this is freely acknowledg'd
by the most Skilful in those Arts. But here
is a sort of men that will not own any such
thing in <hi>Divinity,</hi> although it be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
about Objects that are infinitely High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Greater. Notwithstanding this,
they think it is below a <hi>man of Parts</hi> to
own any thing to be Inexplicable: they
profess that it becomes not a <hi>man of Sense
and Reason</hi> to admit of this, yea, that it is
an unsufferable affront to Humane Nature
to believe such a thing. They think it a
sufficient ground to cashier a doctrine in
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:107741:240"/>
Religion because it is attended with Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
In short, they think it unreasonable
to yield assent to a Proposition on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of its being reveal'd in Scripture,
meerly because they are not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Manner of it. Thus their <hi>Pride</hi>
makes them Infidels, and they bid adieu
to <hi>Modesty</hi> and the <hi>Faith</hi> together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Great Disparagement
and Inexcusable Blemish of these mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
is, that it argues wilful <hi>Prejudice</hi>
and <hi>Partiality.</hi> I will make this evident
from these two Considerations; First, Tho'
they deny not that there are <hi>Mysteries</hi> in
the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> yet they altogether
renounce them in the <hi>Articles</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd:
Secondly, Though they grant
there may and ought to be a Government
and Restraint on the <hi>Imaginations, Will</hi>
and <hi>Affections</hi> of men, yet at the same
time they perversly disapprove of the like
restraint on the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faculty.</hi> Both these are Instances of
their egregrious Prepossession and Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>1. They profess themselves to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
about the Divine Conduct in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
of the Vniverse,</hi> though many <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,</hi>
and those very Great and Insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
accompany it. They acquiesce in
the unerring <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Supreme Ruler
of all things, and they pretend not to
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:107741:240"/>
judge of his actions, but most willingly
grant them to be just and wise and good,
notwithstanding they cannot give an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
of them, notwithstanding they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
them to be Unsearchable and
Incomprehensible. None of them have
ever ventured to question God's Wisdom,
because there are some Events and Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in the world, which no man can
possibly give a <hi>Reason</hi> of. We do not hear
them say, that these are <hi>contrary to Reason,</hi>
and that they are <hi>Contradictory,</hi> although
at the same time they yield that they have
<hi>no knowledge</hi> of them, they are out of
their sight, and they can render no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
account of them. Nor do we hear
them cry out to have these Intricate Events
made out by <hi>Reason,</hi> they don't peremto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
demand to have the <hi>Causes</hi> of them
laid open, or else they will throw up the
doctrine of <hi>Providence:</hi> No, they very
patiently and contentedly resolve all into
the Infinite and Unsearchable Wisdom of
the Absolute Governour of the World, and
into the Ignorance and Weakness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
understandings. God hath not thought
fit to reveal those Secrets, and therefore
they are content to be ignorant of them:
yea, they submissively admire, revere and
adore that Infinite Wisdom, which they
vote to be Mysterious and Unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:107741:241"/>
And why then do they not act thus with
with reference to the <hi>Mysterious Articles of
the Christian Faith,</hi> and the Great, but Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
<hi>Verities of the Gospel?</hi> Seeing they
deny not the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, because
of some harsh and difficult passages in it,
why should they reject <hi>those Doctrines</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are some things in them hard
to be understood? Seeing they quarrel not
with the <hi>Divine Government,</hi> though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in it are mysterious and dark,
and far above their understandings, why
do they find fault with those <hi>Points of the
Christian Belief,</hi> (which were deliver'd to
us by the same All-wise Governour of the
world) because there are certain <hi>Mysteries</hi>
in them? If the Infinite Wisdom and the
Absolute Power and Sovereignty of the
Supreme Being render his <hi>Actions</hi> unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable,
why should not these make his
<hi>Words,</hi> his <hi>Sayings,</hi> his <hi>Dictates</hi> about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things to be of the same nature? If
the methods of God's <hi>ruling</hi> the world be
Inscrutable, why should we undertake to
fathom the depths and secrets of those
<hi>Truths</hi> which he hath declared to the
world? If God<note n="*" place="bottom">Iob 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>doth great things past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out,</hi> why may not he be allow'd to
<hi>speak such? If the</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Iudgments of God are
unsearchable, and his ways past finding out,</hi>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:107741:241"/>
is there not cause to believe, that <hi>God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Essence</hi> are so too? If the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
are not concern'd to answer the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
about the former, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that they startle at the latter? If they
acknowledge that God <hi>acts</hi> many things
which are above their understandings, why
should they not own him to <hi>be</hi> what they
cannot comprehend? If they can't know
what he <hi>doth,</hi> why should they expect to
know what he <hi>is?</hi> Are the <hi>Works</hi> of God's
Providence unsearchable, and is not <hi>He
himself</hi> so? Are there several things done
above their apprehensions, and shall they
deny the <hi>Author</hi> of them to be above them?
Is God to be <hi>trusted</hi> and <hi>relied</hi> upon beyond
their knowledge and understanding, and
is he not <hi>barely to be believ'd,</hi> though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
some things which are above their
capacities? Is the <hi>doctrine of Providence,</hi>
though in sundry things Unaccountable,
imbrac'd and profess'd by them, and is not
the <hi>doctrine of the Holy Trinity</hi> to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
though it contains in it such things
of which we are not able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
Is it an unquestionable Truth that
there is a Divine Management of all mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
affairs, though the particular admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of it are inexplicable? and is it
not as reasonable to assert, that there are
Three Persons in the Deity, though we
cannot explain and unfold the Manner of
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:107741:242"/>
it? I challenge those that make the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pretences to Reason and Good Sense,
to shew the <hi>Difference</hi> between these. All
unprejudiced and impartial minds must
grant the Case to be the same, for surely
God's <hi>Essence</hi> is as infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
as his <hi>Providence,</hi> and therefore if
it be a rational and sufficient Answer to all
the Objections and Scruples against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to say, that they believe God is
Wise and Good and Just, though they are
not able to comprehend the secret methods
of his Wisdom, Justice and Goodness,
then it ought to be as good and satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
an Answer to all Difficulties of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
to say they firmly assent to that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
though they cannot understand the
Manner of it.</p>
            <p>But the persons I am speaking of will
not submit to this, and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
how <hi>Partial</hi> they are, when they
quarrel with the foresaid Article, and <hi>other
doctrines</hi> of the Gospel, for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
but this, that they are <hi>Mysterious</hi> and
<hi>Vnaccountable,</hi> they are rais'd above the
reach of their understandings. I appeal
now to the severest Judges of <hi>Reason,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these men can justly lay claim to any
such thing whilst they thus behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
whilst they declare that even in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and Divine Matters (for such cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is that of <hi>Providence</hi>) it is reasonable
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:107741:242"/>
to believe and embrace more than we can
understand and comprehend, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and
some other substantial Points of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for their being in some measure Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible.
What can this be but <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness</hi>
and <hi>Crosness?</hi> What is it but
acting contrary to themselves? And then
who will give heed to men of this cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain'd
temper? Who will regard such
vain people that are inconsistent with
themselves, and clash with their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions?
They frankly subscribe to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence,</hi> though it hath many My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
Obscurities, Difficulties, Intrigues
in it which no mortal man can unfold:
and yet they discard some of the chief <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Truths,</hi> because they can't ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
them by Reason. Thus they run
counter to their own Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and are Self-condemned persons, and
proclaim to all mankind that they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with Prejudice and Partiality.</p>
            <p>2. They give open and undeniable
proofs of this, by granting that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
yea, necessary to regulate and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the tendencies of the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and yet with the same breath they
pronounce it unfitting and unreasonable to
use any restraint, or set any bounds, or
prescribe any rules to the <hi>Intellectual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
They own it to be the indispensable
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:107741:243"/>
Character of a Good and Religious Man
to exercise a discipline on his <hi>Imagination</hi>
and his <hi>Passions,</hi> they hold it to be a main
part of Christian Philosophy to be severe
and rigorous here. For some things which
seem reasonable and plausible are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
us by the Evangelical Laws, and many
harsh and difficult things are enjoyn'd us;
but we are to satisfie our selves with this,
that God's Will ought to be the Standard
of ours, and therefore we ought to resign
our selves to the Divine Conduct. And
these men allow of this as just and ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and advise that our <hi>Natural desires</hi> and
<hi>propensions</hi> should give way to our Saviour's
Commands, he being our Great Law-giver
and Master. And why then do they shew
themselves Partial in denying it reasonable
to submit the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part of the Mind
to the doctrines and dictates of the Gospel?
Is there not as much reason to take care of
<hi>this Faculty,</hi> to look to the management of
it, to keep it within its due bounds, as
there is to deal thus with the <hi>Elective Power</hi>
of the Soul? If they are content to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<hi>this</hi> to the Divine Will, why are
they against subjecting the <hi>other</hi> to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

Seeing they deem it proper and

why do they not think it as requisite
to submit the second to the infallible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates

do they not abandon their own weak sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
about the highest Concerns of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity?
why do they not renounce their
private surmises, their shallow arguings,
their sophistical ratiocinations, and give
them up to be corrected by the light of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation? why are they not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the deficiency and indigence of their
Minds, of the narrowness and contracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their understandings, and why do
they not at the same time adore the Divine
Perfection? why do they not inure their
understandings to the dictates of Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and believe what is Unintelligible?
Particularly in the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity;</hi>
why do they <hi>lean to their own understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi>
why do they prescribe to Heaven,
and set up their own weak Conceptions as
the Standard of Divine Truth? In a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:107741:244"/>
word, why do they not make their meer
Natural Notions and Principles truckle
to Reveal'd Truth, and bring their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
into subjection to the Eternal <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>If they come here with their old cry
and cavils, that the Article of the <hi>Trinity,</hi>
and some others that appertain to it are
<hi>contrary to Reason,</hi> and are a perfect <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,</hi>
and are <hi>Impossibilities,</hi> (as their
language is) we may for ever silence them
with this, that they can't with any shew
of Reason talk after this rate, because they
can't pronounce that to be <hi>Contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
the Nature of which they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of: what they can't <hi>reach with their
Reason,</hi> they can't say is <hi>Repugnant to it.</hi>
Nor can they doom this or that to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory,</hi>
when they know nothing of
the <hi>Manner</hi> of it. And so for the <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of a thing, it is rash folly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it <hi>cannot be</hi> when they are unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Transcendent Nature of it,
when the Mode of its existence is hid from
them. This I think is very plain, and it
is as pertinent to the matter in hand, I
having proved that the doctrine of the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> and such like Articles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
are hidden <hi>Mysteries.</hi> Therefore
let not these men think to amuse and

            <p>But this I request of them, that they
would be Serious, and vouchsafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on what I have suggested under this
Head, for the Article of the <hi>Trinity</hi> would
be a very clear and bright Truth to them,
if they would but entertain this one thing
in their thoughts, that they are oblig'd as
much to keep a discipline over their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
as over their Wills, that the
Intellectual Powers, as well as the other
Faculties of the mind, are to be in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

This is the Conduct of our Minds which

The latter expresses himself thus,
(and though some may think it is spoken
in Politick Compliance, yet it is more than
they can prove, and it is certain, that they
are in themselves words of truth and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berness,

               <q>We must, saith he, always and chiefly
remember this, that God the Author of
things is Infinite, and we altogether fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite:
so that when God reveals any
thing concerning himself or other things
which surpasses the natural strength of our
wit, such as the Mysteries of the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
or <hi>Trinity,</hi> we are not to refuse to

not clearly understand them.</q> And again,
in the Close of this <hi>First Part</hi> of his <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical

<hi>Memorandum,</hi> 
               <q>This is to be fix'd
on our memories as a Principal Rule, that
whatever things are reveal'd unto us by
God are to be believ'd by us as the most
certain of all. And though perhaps the
most clear and evident light of Reason
should seem to suggest to us some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, notwithstanding this we
are to give credit to the sole Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:107741:246"/>
of God rather than to our own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus these Mighty <hi>Genius</hi>'s of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
give their Suffrage to our Greater A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
and declare to the world how ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
it is to keep the <hi>Reasoning</hi> as well
as the <hi>Elective part</hi> in subjection. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
seeing it is the same Soul that <hi>affects,
wills,</hi> and <hi>understands,</hi> and these Faculties
are not really different from the Soul it
self, it follows, that if the Soul in one ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
may be check'd and regulated, then
it may be so in another: and if we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
to chastise the extravagancy of the
<hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Appetites,</hi> we may and ought to
correct the disorder of the <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi>
The <hi>Socinians</hi> grant the former, but deny
the latter, though without any ground,
for there is the same reason for the one,
that there is for the other. Which shows
that they despise the Parity of Reason, that
they attend not to the Consequence of their
Propositions, that they argue not alike in

               </gap> that are alike, that they vary in

               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:107741:246"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is yet another Great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement and
Blemish lies upon this
Sentiment, and this Behaviour; for as they
are the off-spring of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Insolence,</hi> of
<hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Perverseness,</hi> so they are the
nurse of <hi>Indifferency</hi> and <hi>Scepticism in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
Whilst persons acquiesce in <hi>Divine
Revelation,</hi> they are upon safe and firm
ground, but when they quit this, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to measure Christianity by the
Principles of Natural and Common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
they have no sure footing, but they
waver and fluctuate, they start queries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
all things, and utterly overthrow all
Certainty in Religious and Divine matters.
For when Over-curious and Wrangling
heads come to argue about those High
Points of Christianity, which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mention'd, and make them the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a Formal Dispute, and encounter
them with meer dint of Reason, they soon
perswade themselves that they are <hi>Victors</hi>
in such an Engagement, and then they
carry their <hi>Conquests</hi> further, and range and
flie about, and make it their work to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settle
Religion, and bring all the Concerns
of it into question. They teach men to
doubt of all the Propositions which they
before received, and especially to dispute
about every part of <hi>Christianity.</hi> For they
infuse this notion into mens heads, that
they must not admit of the doctrine of the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:107741:247"/>
               <hi>Trinity,</hi> and such receiv'd Articles of Faith,
because they are <hi>against Reason.</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
with them is their own Prejudice and
Dislike, which prompt them to use a sort
of Argumentations against these Truths.
But they are able to use the like Reasonings
against all <hi>other Articles of Christianity,</hi> and
when there is occasion they will not fail
to do it; for they seem to begin with those
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ore Difficult and Abstruse Points, and to
bring people off from them (because they
think they can't easily maintain them) that
they may make way for shaking the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ones afterwards. I must needs profess,
I have more Charity than to think that
this is a formed design of the generality
of those that profess the <hi>Socinian</hi> way, for
I believe there are some well disposed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
among them. But I am enclin'd to
believe, that there is such a Project carried
on by some ill-minded and perverse men,
who take this opportunity to render Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
Doubtful and Disputable, and by
degrees to represent it as an Indifferent and

the <hi>Torments of Hell,</hi> &amp;c. And sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
substantial Verities, as the Existence
of Good and Evil Angels, the Universal
Providence of God in the world, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of our Saviour, the Truth of the
Christian Religion, and many more such
doctrines are either doubted of, or denied
by <hi>Deists</hi> or <hi>Atheists,</hi> and that on the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Principles, (that is the thing obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
at present) I say, upon the <hi>Socinian</hi>
Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> because there are some <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi>
that attend the notions and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of these things, and because they
are not on all accounts adjusted to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of mens ordinary <hi>Reasonings:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are unwilling to admit of them
on that very account.</p>
            <p>But for the same reason all the Main
Doctrines of the Gospel will be doubted
of, the weightest Articles of our Religion
will be voted to be but Arbitrary Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and <hi>Christianity</hi> it self will be thought
to be no other; as we find in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
both of our Foreign and Domestick
Adversaries <hi>Christianity</hi> is laid in the same
Scales with <hi>Iudaism</hi> and <hi>Turcism,</hi> and some
parts of it (nay the Weightiest) are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to be lighter than any in the other
two. This naturally follows from their
arrogantly presuming upon the Strength of
their Understandings and Reasons in the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:107741:249"/>
things of God, from their peremptory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
to entertain nothing in Religion,
but what is commensurate to Natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
from their opposing and denying
a Doctrine which is plainly and expresly
asserted in Scripture, meerly because they
cannot define the exact Manner of the thing
that is asserted. This, I say, is the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of founding all Religion upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason and Argument. We must
throw up a great part of that which is
<hi>Reveal'd,</hi> meerly to gratifie the <hi>Deists</hi> and
<hi>Racovians.</hi> Nay, this will not suffice, for
it is to be suspected, that those who strike
at <hi>Reveal'd Religion</hi> bear no kindness (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they pretend) to the <hi>Natural.</hi> It is
likely that those who bid defiance to the
former will do the same in time to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
for we can't imagine but that those
bold men who disregard the <hi>Immediate</hi>
Discoveries of Heaven to mankind, and
represent them as altogether Incredible by
intelligent and inquisitive minds, will also
vilifie the more <hi>Mediate</hi> and Common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Nature: those that slight the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
Voice of God cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to attend to the <hi>Ordinary</hi> one: those
that refuse to hear him speaking in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Writ will not be obsequious to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
in their own breasts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:107741:249"/>
Thus you see how dangerous and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
an Opinion our Adversaries maintain
and promote: we see how they feed the
humour of this Sceptical Age, and work
upon unstable and wavering minds, and
wheadle them out of their Religion by
plausible insinuations and pretences of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reason: by this means they directly
lead them to defame, libel and blaspheme
Christianity and all the Mysteries of it, and
they make use of their Reason to make
void their Faith.</p>
            <p>But now all this may be prevented and
hindred by a humble and Christian sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the Sacred Oracles, by a free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
our selves to the Faith of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and by giving credit to it; Articles,
because they are deliver'd and attested by
God himself in the Infallible Writings;
which even <hi>Reason</hi> it self dictates to be the
best Method we can take to establish and
confirm us in our Religion, and to assure
us of the Truth of all its doctrines, be they
never so perplexed and mysterious.</p>
            <p>Nor doth this introduce a Blind Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and such an Implicit Faith as some of
the <hi>Romanists</hi> defend, for when we resign
up our judgments to Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we are not debarr'd from examining
and searching into, and satisfying our
selves about the <hi>Truth</hi> of the things we
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:107741:250"/>
speak of, but only of the <hi>Mode</hi> of them.
Which makes it a quite different thing from
the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Proselytes, who
are bid to swallow down whatever is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated
to them, and that upon the bare Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Warrant of the Church. But
here is no such crude Method prescribed, we
are to<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 17. 11.</note> 
               <hi>search the Scriptures, whether these
things be so,</hi> and we are to make use of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
to shew and convince us how fitting it
is, that we should believe what is reveal'd by
the Spirit of God. For seeing since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
and Original Depravation of Man, we
stand in need of <hi>Revelation</hi> to direct us,
<hi>right Reason</hi> tells us, that it is unsafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the bare suggestions of our own
minds in the great matters of Religion. <hi>This</hi>
acquaints us, that though we are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of answering all difficulties in those
Points, yet we are oblig'd to give credit to
the doctrines themselves, because they are
founded on <hi>Scripture,</hi> which was divinely
inspired. This Principle in us assures us,
that though we can't fully explain these
things by Reason, yet we have reason to
believe the Holy Writ, which is the Rule
and Measure of our Faith, yea, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
those Points seem to thwart the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:107741:250"/>
natural principles of Reason. Thus far we
have <hi>Reason</hi> on our side.</p>
            <p>And then for <hi>Scripture,</hi> that is wholly
and entirely ours. Those Grand Articles,
which our Antagonists renounce are found
there. Particularly to instance in that Great
and Celebrated Doctrine which I have so
often mention'd, one would think it might
suffice, that this is so directly, so plainly, so
frequently asserted in the <hi>New Testament:</hi>
where we find <hi>Three</hi> expresly named, <hi>Father,
Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to whom the <hi>Divinity</hi>
is ascribed, and therefore we believe these
Three to be One God. But <hi>how</hi> these three
distinct Hypostases are one Entire, Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Essence, is an ineffable and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
Mystery. Yet, though we can't
conceive the <hi>Manner</hi> of this, yet the Thing
it self is clearly and plainly reveal'd in
Scripture, and consequently the <hi>Socinians</hi>
have no cause to brag, that theirs is an<note n="*" place="bottom">History or the <hi>Vnitarians,</hi> p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable</hi>
and <hi>Reasonable Faith,</hi> when it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
opposes and contradicts the Holy
Oracles of the Bible.</p>
            <p>This is the true state of the matter, and
so it was thought to be by that Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whom I before quoted, who hath the
repute, even among these men of a Person
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:107741:251"/>
of Great Reason and Sense; speaking of
them, he<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>More,</hi> History of Godliness, <hi>Book 10. Chap.</hi> 6.</note> thus expresses himself, <q>Their
Opinion I look upon as fundamentally
repugnant to Christianity it self, if the
<hi>New Testament</hi> be the foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
for I know nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
than That (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Trinity</hi>) in those
Writings. And therefore the denying of
the <hi>Trinity</hi> is the denying of the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> Or, if they
will pretend they can interpret things
there so as to evade this doctrine, by the
same reason I think they may evade any,
and so still the Sacred Writ shall stand for
a Cypher, and signifie nothing, which
tends mainly to the enervating of our
Faith.</q> These are very Weighty words, and
the more to be consider'd by our Adversaries,
because they come from One of a Large
Compass of Mind, and a great Asserter of
<hi>Reason</hi> in Religion, which is a thing that
these Gentlemen pretend much to. The sum
of what he saith is this, that if the <hi>Scripture</hi>
be true, the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is so too:
if Divine Revelation in the books of the
<hi>New Testament</hi> is to be believ'd, then this
also must be embraced. And on this very
account it hath been embraced by all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and pious minds that have had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:107741:251"/>
for the Holy Scriptures. As it was
the <hi>Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> so it
hath ever since been the steady belief of all
the Martyrs and Confessors of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and all
the True Professors of Christianity, and it
hath with invincible force in all ages of
the Church born down all opposition that
hath been made against it. And I question
not but those violent Efforts and Insults
which have been, and are made against it in
this present Age will prove vain and success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
Though we have seen the <hi>rain descend,
and the flouds come, and the winds blow, and
beat upon it,</hi> yet it shall <hi>never fall, because it
is founded upon a rock,</hi> the same <hi>Rock</hi> on
which the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> is built, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Confession and Testimony of the Inspired
Apostles, the Truth and Authority of the
Scriptures, the Veracity of God, and the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Divine Revelation. And all the
<hi>other Sacred Mysteries</hi> of our Religion have
the very same stable foundation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are Impregnable.</p>
            <p>Let this then satisfie us, that these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are sufficiently reveal'd, though they
are not fully known. I say they are <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
revealed,</hi> because the Book of God as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us that these things are so: but they
are <hi>not fully known,</hi> because we are not able
to discover the Arguments on which they
are founded; we discern not the foot on
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:107741:252"/>
which they stand: God hath been pleas'd
to hide this from us. But then this is to be
said, It is not reasonable to renounce our
belief of that which is plain and evident,
because it is mix'd with something which is
dark and intricate. It was an Excellent
Caution and Rule of the Great St. <hi>Augustine,</hi>

The <hi>Truth</hi> of a Doctrine may be evident and
perspicuous (and that is sufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
our Assent) tho' the <hi>Nature</hi> of it is not.
The Modes and Circumstances apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to Divine things are not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for: at least, if we cannot clear
them up, we have no reason to quit the
Grand Truths themselves. These are not
to be abandon'd because they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our ordinary level, because we
are not able to render a punctual account
of them, because we cannot perfectly
Gauge them, and sound them to the very
bottom; in a word, because they are not
subject to the Tribunal of Reason. But
if we have any regard to the Sacred and
Infallible Volume, we cannot but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
these Divine Doctrines, and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, and heartily approve of them;
for when we find any thing (though 'tis
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:107741:252"/>
impossible to explain and unfold it)
vouch'd by <hi>Scripture,</hi> we need desire no
more. Whence we may judge of <hi>Socinus</hi>

believe these doctrines, though the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
should expresly assert them. These
are strange passages in Writers that bear
the Name of <hi>Christians,</hi> and seem to own
the <hi>New Testament</hi> (as well as the Old)
where every thing is Authentick, and
worthy of all acceptation, and depends
not on the arbitrement of our shallow
Reasons. Here to doubt is In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>idelity, to
be scrupulous is an affront to Heaven,
to dispute is an injury to the Deity.</p>
            <p>To conclude, It appears from the whole
that the Disciples of <hi>Socinus</hi> are the most
foolish and sensless pretenders to <hi>Reason</hi>
in the whole world, because they make it
their business to argue against the God of
Reason and the Spirit of Truth. But if
they will call their Anti-Scriptural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by the <hi>name of Reason,</hi> who can
help it? Only this we are sure of (and it
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:107741:253"/>
is all I will add at present) no truly Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and Sober man will be pleas'd with
that <hi>Reason</hi> which rejects what God hath
reveal'd, which vilifies the Discoveries that
come from Heaven, which contradicts the
Bible, and gives the Lye to Him who is
the Original Truth, the Eternal Reason,
the Source of all Understanding, and
Light and Knowledge it self.</p>
