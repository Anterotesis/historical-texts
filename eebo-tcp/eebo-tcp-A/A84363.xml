            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THis Speech ought to be ſet in <hi>Letters of Gold,</hi> that aſwell the Majeſty, prudence and virtue of this Royal Queen might in general moſt exquiſitely appear; as alſo that her Religious Love, and tender reſpect which ſhe particularly, and conſtantly did bear to her Parliament in unfeigned ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, might (to the ſhame, and perpetual diſgrace and infamy of ſome of her Succeſſors) be nobly and truly vindicated, and proclaimed, with all grateful recognition to God for ſo great a Bleſſing to his poor people of <hi>England,</hi> in vouchſafing them heretofore ſuch a gracious Princeſs, and magnanimous Defendor of the Reformed Religion, and heroick Patroneſs of the liberty of her Subjects in the freedom and honour of their Parliaments; which have been under God, the continual Conſervators of the Splendour, and wealth of this Common-wealth againſt Tyranny, and Oppreſſion.</p>

               <opener>The 30. of <hi>November,</hi> 1601. her Majeſty being ſet under State in the Council-Chamber at <hi>White-hall,</hi> the Speaker, accompanied with Privy Councellors, beſides Knights and Burgeſſes of the lower Houſe to the number of eight-ſcore, preſenting themſelves at her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties feet, for that ſo graciouſly and ſpeedily ſhe had heard and yielded to her Subjects deſires, and proclaimed the ſame in their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as followeth:
<salute>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE perceive your coming is to preſent Thanks unto Us; Know, I accept them with no leſſe Joy, than your Loves can have deſire to offer ſuch a Preſent, and do more eſteem it, than any Treaſure of Riches; for thoſe We know how to prize, but Loyalty, Love, and Thanks, I account them invaluable: and though God hath raiſed Me high, yet this I account the glory of my Crown, that I have Reigned with your Loves. This makes that I do not ſo much Rejoyce, that God hath made Me to be a Queen, as to be a Queen over ſo Thankful a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to be the mean, under God, to conſerve you in Safety, and to preſerve you from Danger; yea, to be the Inſtrument to deliver you from diſhonour, ſhame, and infamy; to keep you from ſervitude, and from ſlavery under our Enemies, and cruel tyranny, and vile Oppreſſion intended againſt Us: for the better withſtanding whereof, We take very acceptably your intended helps, and chiefly in that it manifeſteth your loves, and largeneſs of heart to your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign. Of my ſelf I muſt ſay this, I never was any greedy ſcraping graſper, nor a ſtrict faſt-holding Prince, nor yet a waſter; My heart was never ſet upon any worldly goods, but only for my Subjects good. What you do beſtow on Me, I will not hoard up, but receive it to beſtow on you again; yea, Mine own Properties I account yours, to be expended for your good, and your eyes ſhall ſee the beſtowing of it for your welfare.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I would wiſh you, and the reſt to ſtand up, for I fear I ſhall yet trouble you with longer Speech. Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> you give Me thanks, but I am more to thank you, and I charge you, thank them of the Lower-Houſe from Me, for had I not received know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from you, I might a fallen into the lapſe of an Error, only for want of true information. Since I was Queen, yet did I never put My Pen to any Grant but upon pretext, and ſemblance made Me, that it was for the good, and avail of my Subjects generally, though a private profit to ſome of my ancient Servants who have deſerved well: But that my Grants ſhall be made Grievances to my People, and Oppreſſions, to be priviledged under colour of our Pattents, Our Princely Dignity ſhall not ſuffer it. When I heard it, I could give no reſt unto my thoughts until I had reformed it, and thoſe Varlets, lewd perſons, abuſers of my bounty, ſhall know I will not ſuffer it. And Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> tell the Houſe from me, I take it exceeding grateful that the knowledge of theſe things are come unto Me from them. And though amongſt them the principal Members are ſuch as are not touched in private, and therefore need not ſpeak from any feeling of the grief, yet We have heard that other Gentlemen alſo of the Houſe, who ſtand as free, have ſpoken as freely in it, which gives Us to know that no reſpects or intereſts have moved them other then the minds they bear to ſuffer no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of our Honour, and our Subjects love unto Us. The zeal of which affection tending to eaſe my People, and knit their hearts unto Us, I embrace with a Princely care farre above all earthly Treaſures. I eſteem my peoples love, more than which I deſire not to merit; And God that gave me here to ſit, and placed me over you, knows that I never reſpected my ſelf, but as your good was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Me: yet what dangers, what practices, and what perils I have paſſed, ſome, if not all of you know, but none of theſe things do move Me, or ever made me fear, but it is God that hath delivered Me. And in my governing this Land, I have ever ſet the laſt Judgement day before mine eyes, and ſo to rule, as I ſhall be Judged and anſwer before a higher Judge, to whoſe Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat I do appeal in that, never thought was cheriſhed in my heart that tended not to my peoples good. And if my princely bounty have been abuſed, and my Grants turned to the hurt of my people contrary to my will and meaning, or if any in Authority under Me have neglected, or converted what I have committed unto them, I hope God will not lay their culps to my charge. To be a King, and were a Crown, is a thing more glorious to them that ſee it, than it is pleaſant to them that bear it: for my ſelfe, I never was ſo much inticed with the glorious name of a King, or the royal authority of a Queen, as delighted that God hath made Me his Inſtrument to maintain his Truth and Glory, and to defend this Kingdom from diſhonor, damage, tyranny, and oppreſſion. But ſhould I aſcribe any of theſe things unto my ſelf, or my ſexly weakneſſe, I were not worthy to live, and of all moſt unworthy of the mercies I have received at Gods hands: but to God only and and wholly all is given and aſcribed. The cares and trouble of a Crown I cannot more fitly reſemble, than to the Drugges of a learned Phyſitian, perfumed with ſome Aromatical ſavour, or to bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pils gilded over, by which they are made more acceptable or leſſe offenſive, which indeed are bitter and unpleaſant to take; and for mine own part, were it not for conſcience ſake to diſcharge the duty that God hath laid upon Me, &amp; to maintain his Glory, and keep you in Safety, in mine own diſpoſition I ſhould be willing to reſigne the place I hold to any other, and glad to be freed of the Glory with the Labors: For it is not my deſire to live or reign longer, than my life &amp; reign ſhall be for your good. And though you have had and may have many mightier and wiſer Princes ſitting in this Seat, yet you never had, nor ſhall have any that will love you better.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I commend Me to your loyal Loves, and yours to my beſt care, and your further Councels; and I pray you Mr. <hi>Controullor,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Secretary,</hi> and you of my Councel, that before theſe Gentlemen depart into their Countreys you bring them all to kiſſe my Hand.</p>
