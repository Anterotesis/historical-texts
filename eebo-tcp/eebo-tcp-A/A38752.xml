            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E the Lords, Juſtices, who have the Honour to repreſent his Majeſties moſt Royal Perſon this day in Parliament, are glad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo great diſorders, Tumults, and Confuſions which have been for many years paſts in all parts of this Kingdom to ſee this goodly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Aſſembly met together in this orderly and beautiful manner. To ſee the moſt <hi>Reverend Fathers of our Church</hi> ſettled in their former Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and remitted to their ancient and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right: <hi>To behold our Judges as at the firſt, and our Councellors as at the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſure if the wiſeſt <hi>Daniel</hi> amongſt us had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61832:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two years ſince foretold us of this day, and of thoſe great things which our eyes have ſeen, and which we have heard with our ears, which are now come to paſſe, and that our Captivity ſhould be ſo ſoon at an end, we ſhould have given little credit unto him: nay, I doubt me if an Angel had been ſent to proclaim theſe glad tydings unto us, whether we ſhould have believed him; For the things we ſee fulfilled this day before our eyes are above humane reaſon, They are <hi>Mirabilia Dei,</hi> The wonders of God Almighty, and ought to be marvellous in our Eyes.</p>
            <p>Adde unto this which is the height and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the ſolemnity of the day, That we do not repreſent this day the Perſon of a Tyrant or Uſurper as ſome of late have done, but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our natural Lord and King, <hi>Charles</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by the Grace of God of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> King, and that you are by a legal Power, derived from him, called together to adviſe with him, <hi>De arduis &amp; urgentibus Regni Negotiis</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are alſo glad to ſee the general Convention of <hi>Ireland</hi> turn'd to a Parliament, and the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity of the one ſwallowed up in the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the other, and why ſo? becauſe though the general Convention of <hi>Ireland</hi> for the time it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, acted very worthily, yet it could not do the work which is intended, For neither the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, nor his Majeſties gracious Declaration, nor any thing but a Parliament could compleat the great work which is to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61832:3"/>
It is true that the Convention had excellent conceptions tending to the good of the Kingdom, and brought many of them to the birth, but it wanted ſtrength to bring forth, and therefore it was one of their humble Deſires by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners unto his Majeſty, That a Parliament might be called with convenient ſpeed for the putting of ſeveral things (which they preſented to his Majeſty) into Laws for the good of this Kingdom, and thus this <hi>Phoenix</hi> was contented to be conſumed with the ardent affection which it bore to its Countrey, That out of the aſhes thereof another more excellent then it ſelf might ſpring, as it is at this day.</p>
            <p>This might ſerve in general for a reaſon why this Parliament was called, but I ſhall in a more particular manner give you the reaſons of it, and that very briefly, <hi>ſumma ſequar veſtigia Rerum,</hi> and leave the fuller Declaration thereof to my Lord <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> appointed Speaker of the Houſe of Peers <hi>pro tempore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The main and fundamental occaſion of calling you together at this time, is to ſettle every mans <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> which are are the great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world, in ſuch a way as every man may know which is his <hi>Meum &amp; tuum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You well know that theſe are the things which accaſion moſt differences in this world, This is made moſt commonly the ground of War betwixt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and of all differences in civil ſocieties, and how hard a thing it is to do this you cannot but apprehend, when as at preſent there is that incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61832:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of mens Eſtates in this Kingdom, as hardly can any man ſay This or that Land is mine own; and uncertainty we all know is the mother of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and mens mindes are ſeldome quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their Eſtate be ſettled: The Law ſaith, that the Freehold cannot be in abeyance, except in one only caſe; But as the condition of affaires now is in this Nation, the Freehold is in abey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in moſt mens caſes: What is that namely, as the great Maſter of our Law ſaith, <hi>in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Legis,</hi> in conſideration of the Law, and muſt be ſettled by a Law (there being firſt, <hi>Matura con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideratione habita)</hi> before there can be any ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort of men who ought to be ſecured and ſettled in their juſt poſſeſſions are the <hi>Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi> I ſay <hi>juſt poſseſſions,</hi> for if the foundation which is now to be laid be not right, the ſuperſtructure cannot be firm or laſting, <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain that build it;</hi> and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is all the reaſon in the world that theſe men ſhould be ſecured in their juſt poſſeſſions, For theſe were Adventurers indeed, for when there was no viſible means for the relief or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of almoſt loſt <hi>Ireland,</hi> when the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Rebels were rampant in the field, and like a Land-flood carried all before them, when the Town of <hi>Tredah,</hi> which was the only Bulwark left betwixt us and them, was beſieged with twenty thouſand of them, when <hi>Dublin</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan City of this Kingdom was threatned with a ſiege, and the whole Land as it were in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61832:4"/>
a flame round about us; when we could heare nothing but the ratling of Drums, the found of Trumpets, the neighing and trampling of Horſes, and the noiſe of Cannons; when a common deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction threatned every Engliſh man in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; when we could hear in every place the word of Command given, Kill, kill, &amp;c. And no difference made of age or ſex, Then did theſe noble Adventurers open their purſes, and ſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief unto us, when all was in a manner loſt, and ought not theſe men to be performed with in a fitting way, according to the ſolemn undertaking in the Statute of xvii. <hi>Caroli.</hi> No man will or can in Reaſon ſpeak againſt it.</p>
            <p>The next ſort of men that are to be provided for, are the Souldiers, and theſe were Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers indeed, for they carried their lives in their hands, and adventured themſelves and all they had in our Quarrel, and for our preſervation, and amongſt theſe thoſe Worthies commonly called the fourty nine men, who ſtood in the breach, and made good their ground until they were ſeconded out of <hi>England</hi> by thoſe Forces which came from thence; Theſe muſt not be poſtpon'd as they were in the Uſurpers time, but ſpecial regard muſt be had of them, as of thoſe who did undergo the brunt and fury of the Rebels.</p>
            <p>The Adventurers without theſe could do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the Souldiers without the Adventurers purſe would not do much, <hi>For who goeth to War at his own charge,</hi> But the Adventurer and Souldier joyning together, did carry on this great work,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61832:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ought to be ſatisfied in a reaſonable and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting manner.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of people who are not to be forgotten, Namely, the old Proteſtant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Papiſt, whoſe right is to be inquired into, For it is a Maxime in our Law, That <hi>androit ne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it morier,</hi> an ancient right cannot die.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard ſhould fall unto any mans lot, it had been better for him to be without it, We muſt not rob <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying is.</p>
            <p>You are now made Judges of this matter, and in a word your work is <hi>ſuum cuique tribuere,</hi> which is the higheſt work of Juſtice, and it is for this end you were called together, and if that you will follow thoſe heavenly Rules given by the moſt Reverend Father in God, the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Downe,</hi> in his warning Sermon, which I wiſh were imprinted in all your hearts, you cannot do amiſs. His Majeſty hath in his great wiſdome ſhewn you by his Declaration the way to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row this great work, which if he had not done you would find it a moſt difficult work, and Bills are in preparation for you to that purpoſe: God grant you wiſdom and underſtanding to do that which beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth wiſe and ſober men. His Majeſties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Declaration muſt be the corner ſtone of this great ſtructure, but this ſtone muſt be poliſhed, ſquared and fitted for the building, for <hi>nihil eſt ex omne parte perfectum.</hi> And now that I have in brief declared unto you the reaſons of calling this Parliament, I ſhould leave it to my Lord <hi>Primat</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61832:5"/>
of <hi>Ardmagh</hi> to be further amplyfied and ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; But in breif let me put you in mind of ſome of thoſe great things which his Majeſty hath done for us, ſince his moſt happy Reſtauration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whereas the General Convention of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did by their Commiſſioners preſent unto his Majeſty three and twenty humble requeſts for the welbeing of Church and Common-wealth in this Kingdom, his Majeſty denied them none of their requeſts, but either granted them <hi>in terminis,</hi> or what he did not, his Majeſty referr'd to his Lords, Juſtices and Council to grant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when the Convention had all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired thus granted to them, His Majeſty hath held out unto us by his moſt gracious Declaration much more then the general Convention of <hi>Ireland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His Majeſty hath left the diſpoſing and diſtributing of all his Royal Eſcheats and forfeited Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which I am confident are more then all his Predeceſſors, Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> have had ſince the Conqueſt, to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by honourable Commiſſioners, <hi>Secundum equum &amp; bonum,</hi> which I pray God they may do to the ſatisfaction of all Intereſts; His Majeſty hath reſerved none of thoſe Lands to himſelf, no not ſo as for Forreſts, Chaſes, Parks, or like uſes, which he might juſtly and lawfully do.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, his Majeſty hath been graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to grant us a Parliament to begin as on this day, which if that he had denied us, all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions to the Convention, all his Grants compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his Declaration, and that vaſt and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralled
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61832:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Conceſſion of all his forfeited Lands in this Kingdom had fallen to the ground and come to nothing, for none of thoſe could be ſetled but by Parliament, wherein we are to obſerve the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time, when our Parliament was to begin, namely on the very day when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England</hi> was to begin, as if his Majeſty had an equal care of both Kingdoms, like Royal Queen <hi>Dido,</hi> who ſaid to <hi>Enaeas, Tros teriuſque mihi nullo diſcrimine agitur,</hi> or did conceive that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> could not ſettle the buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as indeed it cannot.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, His Majeſty hath given us all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue in this Kingdom, certaine and caſual, and whatſoever may be called his towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and keeping of the Army in <hi>Ireland;</hi> this his Majeſty could do without a Parliament, and therefore <hi>ex gratia ſpeciali</hi> has done it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, His Majeſty, notwithſtanding ſo great debts contracted by in him forraign parts abroad during his baniſhment, hath ſent us very lately out of his own private Purſe twenty thouſand pounds at one time, and thirty thouſand pounds at another time to pay part of the Army for our eaſe, whereby his people here might be eaſed of part of the Charge of the Army, and if his Majeſty could have done more, he would have done it.</p>
            <p>Will you know what hath been done by the Lords Juſtices in order to this, truly it is very fit that you ſhould be made acquainted with it, and therefore I ſhall in brief give you an account thereof.</p>
            <p>The Army is now modelled according to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61832:6"/>
eſtabliſhment ſent by his Majeſty out of <hi>England;</hi> and in order thereunto they have in the firſt place diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded an entire or whole Regiment of Dragoons and Officers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they have reduced fourty Troops of Horſe to thirty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Officers of one hundred and ſix Foot Companies are reduced to ſixty ſix.</p>
