            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I receiv'd both your Letters, with the Copies of the Latin Tractate, you publiſhed; wherin you endeavour to bring men to a right underſtanding of the Soveraign Good of
<pb facs="tcp:50573:5"/>
Humane Minds; a glorious employment in it ſelfe, and never more uſeful than in this our Age. For your deſire that I would ſay ſomething by way of Praeface to your Tranſlation of <hi>Boetius,</hi> though I am ſenſible you may much better, and with greater Advantages recommend it to the World, than I, yet to aſſure you of that Great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſervice I have for your Perſon, I have ſent you my preſent thoughts.</p>
                  <p>When Mankind was at firſt Created, they lived, and acted under the Divine life, and Nature, freely injoying, and participating of the Communications of the Firſt, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Good; but being lapſed into a State of Sin, Indigency, and Penury, they quickly loſt ſight of thoſe Glorious formes, and the Influences of Heaven were ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. But yet though their Caſe was ſufficiently deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the <hi>Deluge</hi> of Iniquity, and <hi>Vice,</hi> had not ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd the Beauteous Structure of <hi>Virtue,</hi> but that the remaining Ruines ſhew'd the Glory of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, and men ſtill knew God, and ſearched after the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their Beings, and the Reaſon of their Natures led them to a Purſuit of Happineſs. Hence it came to paſs that the wiſe men of the World were divided in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions concerning the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Good, and Happineſs of Humane Nature; ſome placing it in the bare, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Pleaſure reſulting from the exerciſe of Virtue; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a perfect Apathy, Inſenſibility, and deadneſs to all Paſſions whatever; and others again in a full Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of all the Corporeal Faculties. But we, who through the Gracious Bounty of God, live under a more Radiant, and Refulgent light, than that of Nature, have a perfect ſight of that which they through the clammy
<pb facs="tcp:50573:5"/>
miſts of Ignorance, and Darkneſs did but feele after; and we know that the Happineſs of Humane Nature conſiſts in it's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and Conjunction with the Eternal Good. Which being the Highest, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tmoſt Perfection of our Soules ought certainly to awaken our drowſy, and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring minds to a vigorous Proſecution of ſo tranſcendent a state of life: a life, ſo full of ſolid, and ſubſtantiall Joy, and Pleaſure, that if we did not take falſe meaſures, and eſtimations of things, we could not but think it infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beyond the faireſt and beſt of all Sublunary Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. And indeed the Mind of man is then in a wrong ſtate of Poſition, when it's Appetites, and Deſires are fixed, and terminated upon Terreſtrial Good, ſuch as is ſo far from any Harmony, or Agreeableneſs with our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Frame, that it vilifies, and Degrades it, and ſets it at a vast Diſproportion to it's true, and Proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And this is that falſe, and Adulterate Beauty, that ſo often cheats us into a liking, and Approbation of it: A meer Shadow of Happineſs, which we poſſeſs only in our Fancies, and Imaginations. For if there were really any Subſtantial Felicity, or Good in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Honors, Worldly Glory, and Corporeal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the mind of man would then be full, and at Reſt: it would then have no more Paſſionate Thirſts, and Aſpirations, when once it were poſſeſt of it's True Object. But we finding ſtill a Perfect Diſſatisfaction, and Inquietude amidſt the largeſt Meaſures, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Comprehenſions of Sublunary Injoyments, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſy to conceive that there is ſomething elſe yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to Perfect, compleat, and fill the Capacities of the Soule of man. And this can be no other than
<pb facs="tcp:50573:6"/>
that Eternal, and Immortal Good, which has left ſome ſignatures, and Impreſſions of it ſelfe upon every thing in the Whole Creation: From whence it is that men beholding ſome Shadowes, and Adumbrations of the Abſolute Good, are ready to catch at, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it in the things below; not conſidering that all the fine ſhows and ſplendid Appearances of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and Viſible World, are but ſo many Powers full Charmes, and Ineſcations to allure, and draw our Minds from a ſteady Contemplation of that <hi>Holy One,</hi> in whoſe Preſence is Life, and Felicity, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo call'd. And that we may not fright our ſelves from ſo deſirable a Condition, as our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and Conjunction with God, nor our Endeavours after this Immutable Good coole, and flag by drawing a Scene of Humane Life full of miſeries, and Calamitous Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and repreſenting unto our ſelves the black ſide of Providence, wherin Innocent Virtue is afflicted and oppreſſed, and Iniquity, and Vice Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and Triumphant, we may conſider that that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Being, who Perpetually Intereſſeth himſelfe in the Affairs of mankind, will at laſt ſettle Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Truth in it's Juſt Throne, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World; and thereby redreſs, and heal all the Evils Humane Nature is obnoxious unto; which are for the moſt part made ſo to us by our unjuſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and Eſtimations of them: For what are Fetters, and Impriſonment, but clogs of the Corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Life, while the Mind may Converſe with God, and the Whole Creation, and be as Free, as the Air we breath in? what is Death it ſelfe, but only the
<pb facs="tcp:50573:6"/>
Awakening of our nobler Faculties to the Participation of a freer, and more enlarged life? All which put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether do not only depreciate the moſt Glorious ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Animal life, but convert our Minds to their own Genuine Happineſs; that is, to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and Conjunction with the Bleſſed Author of All things which is the Grand Deſign of this Treatiſe.

the mouth of the ſame <hi>Plato</hi> haſt taught me that this is a Neceſſary Cauſe why Wiſe men ſhould undertake the Adminiſtration of Publick Affairs, That the Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left to men of crooked, and pervers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, they would be a perpetual Plague to all Perſons of true Honor, and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

GOD, who hath fixed thee in the minds of the Wiſe, is my Witneſs, that no other Inclination brought me into any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Office, but to be Serviceable to all Good Men.

How often did I oppoſe <note n="(e)" place="bottom">One of king Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus his chiefeſt favorites.</note> 
                     <hi>Coniga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> when he would have ſeiz'd the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of all Perſons uncapable of Defending

themſelves! how often did I diſappoint <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilla,</hi> the Controuler of the Kings Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in his Injurious Deſigns! how often did I Protect by my Authority thoſe diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed People, whom the Avarice of the <note n="(f)" place="bottom">The Gothes.</note> 
                     <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> that went allwayes unpuniſht, did vex with infinite Calumnies, and Falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations! I was never drawn aſide from Right to Injuſtice by Any man whatſoever. When I ſaw the Fortunes of thoſe that liv'd in the <hi>Provinces</hi> ſo rackt and torn, both by Private Rapines, and Publick Taxes, I Griev'd no leſs than thoſe very men, who ſuffer'd ſuch great Oppreſſions. When in a time of extream Scarcity of Corn there was a moſt grievous <hi>Coemption</hi> eſtabliſht, which in all likelyhood would have impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht the Province of <hi>Campania,</hi> I ſtrove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him, who was Next in Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King, for the Common Good, and Diſputed the buſineſs with him touching the <hi>Coemption,</hi> the King himſelfe hearing the Debate and I prevail'd, ſo that it was not exacted. <hi>Paulinus,</hi> a Worthy Perſon, that had been <hi>Conſul,</hi> whoſe Eſtate thoſe <hi>Palatine

Do I not ſeem to have heaped up matter enough of Strife, and Contention againſt my ſelf? but I ought to have found the greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards amongſt other men, having ſo Acted upon the Principles of Juſtice, and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I deſerv'd nothing for my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Courtiers,</hi> whereupon I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the leaſt Confidence in any of them. <note n="(g)" place="bottom">The fourth cauſe of his griefe, the baſeneſs of his accuſers and the open injuſtice of his accuſation.</note> But by whoſe Accuſations are we Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd? One of them, <hi>Baſilius,</hi> being turn'd out of the Kings Service was compell'd by the Debts he had contracted to forge an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt Me. But when the King had Decreed that <hi>Opilio</hi> and <hi>Gaudentius</hi> ſhould ſuffer Baniſhment for their innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and manifold Deceitful-dealings, and when they refuſing to obey the Decree

tooke <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and the King had notice of it, he gave Commandement that if they did not go from <hi>Ravenna</hi> within a certain Day, they ſhould be Mark't in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads with an Hot Iron, and driven out of the City: How could there be a greater Act of Severity? Yet that ſame Day the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe ſame Perſons were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Me. What then? Did our Studies deſerve this? or could my Condemnation Fore determin'd Qualify Thoſe men to be my accuſers? Was not Fortune in the leaſt aſham'd of Innocence Accus'd, or of the Baſeneſs of the Accuſers? But wouldeſt thou know the <note n="(h)" place="bottom">Fiftly, His chiefe offence was vertue.</note> matter that is lay'd to my charge? It is Affirm'd that I would have ſav'd the <hi>Senate</hi> from great Danger. Wilt thou hear the Manner of it? My Crime is to have hind'red an <hi>Informer</hi> from <hi>Impeaching</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> of High Treaſon. O Miſtreſs, what thinkeſt thou? ſhall I Deny what I am Accus'd of, that I be not a ſhame to thee? But indeed I did wiſh well to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and ſhall never ceaſe to Deſire their Safety. Shall I Confeſs it? but ſo that Endeavour to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the <hi>Informer</hi> will become ineffectual. Shall I call that an Offence to have Deſir'd the Safety of that <hi>Order</hi>? They have indeed made it an Offence by their Decrees againſt Me. But Ignorance that is allwayes Falſe to it ſelfe, cannot change the Merit of things; neither do I think it Lawful, being of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates's</hi> Judgement, to conceale the Truth, or give way to a Lye. But be it how it will, I leave it to the Judgement of Wiſe Men. The Truth of this Affair that Poſterity may not be Ignorant thereof, I have endeavour'd by Writing to keep in Remembrance.

                  <p>WILT thou permit me to try the ſtate of thy Mind by propoſing a few Queſtions, that I may underſtand what courſe to take for the Cure of thy Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I ſhall Anſwer, quoth I, to whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou ſhalt be pleas'd to Aske of me. Then ſhe ſpake thus: Doſt thou think that this World is hurried on in it's courſe by the Agitations of Chance, or meer Caſualty, Or that it is Govern'd by REASON? But, quoth I, never could I entertain ſuch a thought, as this, that ſuch Certain and Orderly Motions can proceed from Chance and Uncertainty. I know that GOD, the Maker of the Univerſe Sits on High, and Overlooks his own Worke; neither ſhall that Day ever come that may enforce me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake this Truth. Thou ſayſt well, quoth ſhe; for what thou didſt Sing a little while ſince ſuits well with thy preſent ſpeech: and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50573:23"/>
thou didſt deplore Mankind, as Neglected by GOD, whilſt All things elſe are under his Providence. Thou didſt not ſeem in the leaſt to doubt of thoſe things; but that they are Govern'd by REASON. But truly I cannot but wonder very much that thou ſhouldſt ſtill labour under ſuch a Diſtemper having attain'd to ſo great a meaſure of the moſt Wholſome Doctrine. But let us ſearch deeper; I conceive that ſomething, I know not what, thou lackeſt yet. Tell me, ſince thou doſt not doubt but that the World is Govern'd by GOD, doſt thou conſider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by what <hi>Rule</hi> He Governs it? I hardly underſtand, quoth I, the meaning of this Queſtion, much leſs am I able to give an Anſwear thereunto. Was I miſtaken, ſaith ſhe, in that I thought there was ſomething Wanting, through which <hi>Defect,</hi> as through an <hi>Hole</hi> theſe Perturbations have Crept into thy Mind? But tell me, doſt thou Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what is the END of things? or what it is that the Whole Courſe of Nature Tends unto? I have heard what it is, quoth I, but Sadneſs has much weakned my Memory. But how knoweſt thou from what All things
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50573:24"/>
derive their Being? I know from what, ſaid I: from GOD. And how can it be that ſith thou knoweſt what is the BEGINING of things, thou ſhouldſt be Ignorant of their END? But this is the cuſtome of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, and Diſtractions of mind, ſuch is their ſtrength, that they unſettle, and diſcompoſe a mans Thoughts, but cannot alienate him from the proper <hi>Sentiments</hi> of a Rational Nature. I would have thee give an Anſwear to this Queſtion; doſt thou Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou art a Man? how is it po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible, quoth I, that I ſhould ever Forget this? Art thou able then to tell me what Man is? Is this the Senſe of thy Queſtion, whether I know my ſelfe to be a Living-<hi>Creature</hi> Rational, and Mortal? I know, and confeſs that I am. And doſt thou not know, quoth ſhe, that thou art ſomewhat beſides that? No. Now, quoth ſhe, I come to underſtand another, and that the greateſt cauſe of thy Diſtemper, thou fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of the Knowledge of Thy Selfe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have plainly found out the grounds of thy Diſeaſe, or rather the way to recover thy Health. For becauſe thou art in ſuch
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50573:24"/>
Confuſion of mind, by reaſon that thou For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteſt Who thou art, thou falleſt into this extream Anguiſh, as if thou waſt <hi>Exil'd,</hi> and Depriv'd of thy Proper Goods. Forasmuch as thou art Ignorant what is the END of things thou judgeſt that Lawleſs, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men are in great Power, and Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And forasmuch as thou haſt Forgotten by what <hi>Rule</hi> the World is Govern'd, thou art ſo apt to conceit that the manifold Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Humane Affairs are not within the compaſs of any Government. Great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes indeed not only of Sickneſs, but of Death itſelfe. But Thanks be to the Author of Health that Reaſon has not as yet wholly forſaken thee. We have very good grounds to undertake thy Recovery, in that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt this Truth touching the Governance of the World, that it is not ſubject to the temerity of Chance, but to the Divine Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Therefore ſet thy heart at reſt. We perceive ther's Vital Heat in thee by this little Spark.

                  <p>AFTER this, She held her peace for ſome time; and when ſhe had gather'd in my Attention by a ſober, and grave Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, thus ſhe began: If I throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the cauſes of thy Diſtemper, and the Condition thou art in, thou doſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and pine away for want of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Fortune: 'tis Her Change, as thou makeſt thy ſelfe to believe, that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the high State of thy Mind. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the manifold Deceits of that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy,</hi> and that ſhe is wont to ſhew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Dearneſs, and Familiarity to thoſe,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50573:26"/>
whom ſhe hath a mind to Delude, 'till ſhe confounds them with intolerable Anguiſh, whom beſide all expectation ſhe hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, and left deſtitute. If thou wilt call to mind her nature, manners, and diſerts, thou ſhalt underſtand that thou didſt neither Enjoy, nor Loſe any Excellent thing in Her Preſence, or Departure. But, as I judge, I ſhall have no hard taske to bring theſe things to thy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Remembrance. For whilſt ſhe remained with thee, and flatter'd thee continually, thou waſt wont to ſpeak Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully unto her, and to perſecute Her with ſentences brought from the <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Profound wiſdome and knowledge.</note> 
                     <hi>Secret Place of my Temple.</hi> But a ſudden Change of Things happens not without ſome Wavering of Minds. So it comes to paſs that thou art gone a little from thy wonted Peace, and Tranquillity. But 'tis now time that thou ſhouldſt drink ſome Pleaſant, and Delicious thing, which being receiv'd will Prepare thee for Stronger <hi>Potions.</hi> Therefore let us have the Perſwaſives of Sweet <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> which then only proceeds in the Right way, when ſhe forſakes not our Inſtructions: and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50573:27"/>
with Her let <hi>Muſick,</hi> who is one of our Houſe-hold Servants Sing Notes ſometimes Light, and ſometimes Grave. What is it then, ô Man, that hath caſt thee into ſo deep Sadneſs, and Diſcontent? I believe thou haſt ſeen ſomething new, and unuſual. Doſt thou think that Fortune is Changed in her Diſpoſition towards Thee? thou art miſtaken. Theſe are Her Manners: this is Her Nature. She hath rather kept her own Conſtancy in the Mutability ſhe hath ſhown towards Thee. She was no other than now thou ſeeſt Her to be, when ſhe flatter'd, and Deceiv'd thee with the Enticements of Falſe Felicity. Thou haſt found out the Deceitful Pretences of this Blind Goddeſs. She that covers Her ſelfe with a Vaile from the <hi>ſight</hi> of other men has ſuffer'd thee to take a full View of Her: and to be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her Diſpoſition. If thou Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt Her, uſe her Manners, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. If thou dreadeſt her Perfidiouſneſs, Scorn, and reject Her, that ſports her ſelfe thus in doing miſchiefe. For ſhe that hath brought thee into ſo great Sorrowes ſhould have been the cauſe of thy Tranquillity. For
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50573:27"/>
ſhe hath left Thee, of whom no man can be Secure, but that ſhe will leave him alſo. But doſt thou think in good earneſt that that Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which thus paſſeth away, is any thing worth? and can any Preſent Fortune be Dear unto thee, which gives thee no Aſſurance of her Stay, and when ſhe ſhall Depart, will certainly involve thee in great Anguiſh, and Vexation? If we cannot keep Her with us as long as we pleaſe; and if when ſhe flyes from us ſhe makes us miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what is ſhe elſe, being ſo ready to take her flight, but a Sign of future Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? For it is not ſufficient to Conſider that which is lay'd before our Eyes. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence meaſureth the End of things; whoſe Mutability in either State, ſhould make us neither to Fear the Threat'nings of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor Regard her Pretences of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Finally thou oughteſt to bear with a patient mind, whatſoever is done within the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of Fortune, now thou haſt ſubmitted thy Neck to her Yoke. If thou wouldeſt impoſe a Law on her, whom thou haſt freely choſen to be thy Miſtreſs, to ſtay, or be gone at thy pleaſure, wouldeſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50573:28"/>
thou not be Injurious, and by thine Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience encreaſe the Bitterneſs of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which thou art not able to Change? If thou ſhouldſt commit thy Sailes to the Winds, thou ſhouldſt not be carried whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou Wouldeſt Arrive, but whither they will Drive thee. If thou wilt ſow thy ground, thou muſt make account that ſome years are barren, and ſome fruitful. Thou haſt ſubmitted thy ſelfe to the Government of Fortune, 'tis but requiſite thou ſhouldſt comply with the Humours of thy Miſtreſs. But doſt thou endeavour to put a ſtop to the Turning of her Wheele? but, O Fooliſh man, if ſhe begins to be <hi>Constant,</hi> ſhe ceaſeth to be <hi>Fortune.</hi>

                  <p>BUT I would diſcourſe with thee a little in the words of Fortune. Obſerve if ſhe ſpeaks not right. O man, why doſt thou thus complain of my carriage towards thee? In what have I Injur'd thee? what Goods, that thou mighteſt juſtly call <hi>Thine own,</hi> have we taken from thee? Let any man be Judge betwixt us, whilſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt with me touching the Poſſeſſion of

When Nature brought thee out of thy Mothers wombe, I tooke thee being Naked, and deſtitute of all things, I che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht thee with my Riches, and, which makes thee now ſo Impatient againſt me, I gave thee the moſt tender, and delicate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and encompaſt thee with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and ſplendour of all things, which are in my power.

Thou haſt no juſt cauſe to complain, as if thou hadſt loſt that which was <hi>Thine own.</hi> Why then doſt thou ſigh, and groan? Riches, Honors, and all ſuch like things are in my power: they acknowledge that I am their Miſtreſs: they come, and go with me. I boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that if thoſe things had been Thine, which thou complaineſt that thou haſt loſt, thou hadſt not loſt them. Shall I only be

But this doth moſt vehemently torment my ſoule, when I reflect on it, For in all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity whatſoever 'tis the moſt Unhappy kind of Misfortune, <hi>To have been Happy.</hi> But, quoth ſhe, what thou ſuffereſt by thy Falſe Opinion, thou mayſt not impute to the Nature of things. And if thou art mov'd with the empty name of that Felicity, which is in the Power of Fortune, thou mayſt account with me how much thou doſt ſtill retein of it. Therefore if that, which thou didſt ever eſteem as moſt pretious in the whole Treaſury of thy Fortune, be ſtill by the Divine Providence kept ſafe, and free from all harme, can'ſt thou have any cauſe to ſay that Fortune deals hardly with thee, whilſt thou reteineſt the more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enjoyments? But that moſt pretious Ornament of Mankind, thy Father-in-law <hi>Symmachus</hi> is ſtill Alive, and in good health; and (which thou wouldeſt readily purchaſe with the price of thine own Life) He, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man wholly made up of Wiſedome, and Vertue, regardleſs of the wrongs that are done unto himſelfe, beſtowes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints on thoſe, he ſees thee to ſuffer. Thy

Wife is ſtill Living, a Woman Modeſtly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, Excelling in all the Perfections of Chaſtity, and, that I may briefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all her Endowments, ſhe's Like her Father. She Lives, I ſay, and keeps her Breath only for thee, being weary of this Life; and, which, I confeſs, is a leſſening of thy Felicity, ſhe pines away with Tears, and ſorrow for want of thy Company. What ſhould I ſay of thy Sons, that have been <hi>Conſuls,</hi> in whom, as in Youths of their Age, there ſhines the Reſemblance of the Wit of their Father, and of their Grand-Father? Sith therefore it is our chiefeſt care to preſerve our Lives, O Happy man that thou art, if thou didſt but know how to value thy Condition, who to this very day haſt ſo great abundance of thoſe things, which no man doubts but that they are more Pretious than Life it ſelfe! wherefore wipe off theſe Tears from thine Eyes. Fortune has not as yet ſhown her utmoſt ſpight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; neither has an over-violent <hi>Tempest</hi> falled on thee, whilſt thine <hi>Anchors</hi> hold faſt, which do not permit thee to want Conſolation for the preſent, nor Hopes to

ſee Better Times. And I pray, quoth I, they may hold faſt; for whilſt they are Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however the matter goes, I ſhall have hopes to overcome the Storme. But thou ſeeſt how my Honors, and Dignities are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſht. And ſaith ſhe, we have Advanc'd ſomewhat in our deſign if there be any thing in thy Condition, with which thou art not diſpleas'd. But I cannot away with this that thou art ſo nice, and tender, who makeſt ſuch grievous complaints that there is ſome thing wanting, which thou wouldeſt have to compleat thy Happineſs. For where is the man that hath attein'd to ſuch a ſtate of Eaſe, and ſatisfaction, that he is not in any regard Diſcontented with the quality of his preſent Fortune? For the condition of the Goods of this World is full of Anxiety, and vexation, and ſuch that it never comes whole, and entire, and never can be made ſtable, and permanent. One man abounds in Wealth, but is Aſham'd of his Ignoble Birth. Another being Nobly Born is well Known throughout all the Country, but wanting an Eſtate Anſwearable to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Name, he would rather be hid in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50573:35"/>
                     <hi>Obſcurity</hi> with perſons of the meaneſt Rank. This man is both Rich, and Noble, and bemoans himſelfe for want of a Wife. That man hath a Good Wife, but hath no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and afflicts himſelfe with the thoughts that he muſt leave his Wealth to a Stranger. Another rejoycing in his Iſſue turns his joy into mourning for the ill carriage of his Son, or of his Daughter. So that no man can eaſily ſuit his Mind with his own Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And let us moreover conſider this, that the ſenſe of every man that has been moſt uſ'd to Proſperity is exceeding ſoft, and delicate, and unleſs he can have all things at his beck, being unaccuſtom'd to any Adverſity, is caſt down with every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing, that goes acroſs to him: of ſuch ſmall moment are ſuch matters, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the perfection of the Happineſs of thoſe men, on whom Fortune has beſtowd her choiceſt Favours. How many are there thinkeſt thou who would conceit themſelves to be Advanc'd almoſt as high, as Heaven, if they could have but a part of the remains of thy Proſperity? This very Place that thou calleſt <hi>Exile</hi> is the Country of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50573:35"/>
Thus nothing is a Misfortune, but when thou deemeſt it ſo to be: And on the contrary Every Condition turns into Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity to thoſe, who know how to Diſpoſe themſelves in it. What man is there ſo Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but he would be deſirous to change his Eſtate, if he ſhould once give way to Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience? what bitterneſs is the ſweetneſs of Humane Felicity ſprinkled with! which if it ſeem joyful to him that poſſeſteth it, yet it cannot be ſecur'd to him for a moment. 'Tis evident therefore how Wretched that Happineſs is which conſiſts in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of periſhing things, which neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with thoſe that are contented, nor is wholly delightſome to perſons of anxious, and diſturbed minds. Therefore, O ye ſons of Men, why do yee ſeek for True Happineſs Without, which is plac'd Within Your ſelves? You are confounded with Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and Wrong Opinions. I ſhall in a few words ſhew thee what is the Soveraign, and onely True Happineſs. Is there any thing more Dear, and Pretious to Thee, than Thy Selfe? Nothing, thou wilt ſay. Therefore if thou canſt have the full <hi>Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:50573:36"/>
of Thy Selfe, thou ſhalt Poſſeſs that which thou wouldeſt never part with, and which Fortune ſhall never be able to take from thee. And that thou mayſt clearly perceive that True Happineſs conſiſts not in thoſe things that are in the Power of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, conſider this Argument: If Bliſs, or True Happineſs be the Soveraign Good of <hi>Intellectual Nature,</hi> neither is that Soveraign Good which can by any means be taken from us; becauſe that Excells it, which we cannot be deprived of: 'tis manifeſt that the Inſtability of Fortune can never bring us into the waies of True Happineſs. Moreover he that is puft up with this uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Felicity either knowes, or doth not know, how Changeable it is. If he knowes it not, what Happineſs can there be in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, the Blindneſs of the Soule? If he knowes it, he muſt needs be in Fear of loſing, what he doubts not but may eaſily be loſt. Wherefore the Dread he is in continually ſuffers him not to be Happy. Or elſe he cares not if it be loſt: Thus alſo it appears to be a matter of ſmall moment, whoſe loſs can be ſo eaſily born. And becauſe thou
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50573:36"/>
art one of thoſe who know, and are aſſur'd by many Demonſtrations that the Soules of Men are Immortal; and ſith it is ſo clear, and unqueſtionable, that ſuch Happineſs, or Proſperity, which is in the Power of Fortune has it's Period by the Death of the Body; it cannot be doubted, but if Death be able to deprive us of our <hi>Bliſs,</hi> All Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt at length become Miſerable. And ſith we know that many a man hath earneſtly purſu'd, and endeavour'd after <hi>Bliſs,</hi> or True Happineſs, not only by Death, but alſo by great Pains, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; how can it be that this preſent Life ſhould be able to make men Happy, the End whereof makes them not Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>

                  <head>The FIFTH PROSE.</head>
                  <head type="sub">How riches are neither pretious, nor our own.</head>
                  <p>BUT becauſe theſe ſoft, and gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, or <hi>Fomentations</hi> of the Mind begin to ſink into thee, I think it would now be ſeaſonable to uſe ſome ſtronger Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. Well then: Though the Gifts of Fortune were not ſo fraile, and tranſitory, what is there in them that can ever be truly, and properly <hi>Your own,</hi> and which being throughly diſcover'd what it is in it ſelfe, would not appear to be moſt vile, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable? Are Riches to be Priz'd in regard of Your Nature, or of Their own? what is the beſt kind of Riches? is it not Gold, or great Heaps of Mony? But theſe things make men to be ſincerely Eſteem'd when they are given away, rather than when they are kept in ſtore: for Covetouſneſs makes men Odious, Bounty Glorious. If that cannot remain with any man, which paſſeth from him to another: then is Mony Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, when, being confer'd on another,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50573:38"/>
by the exerciſe of Bounty, it ceaſeth to be in our own Poſſeſſion. But if one man had All the Wealth in the World, it would leave others in the greateſt Poverty. And indeed a <hi>Voice</hi> comes <hi>Whole,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndivided</hi> to the Ears of a Multitude of People at the ſame time; but Your Riches, unleſs divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into many ſmall Parts, cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to divers Perſons. And hence it is, that of neceſſity they expoſe ſuch men to Poverty, from whom they come into the Poſſeſſion of others. O then, how Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Contracted, how Beggerly are thoſe Riches, which 'tis impoſſible that Many men ſhould have Whole, and Entire; and which cannot come into the Hands of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, without the Impoveriſhing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers! Art thou taken with the Splendor of <hi>Gemms,</hi> or <hi>Pretious ſtones?</hi> But if there be any Worth, or Excellency in their Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is the <hi>Light</hi> of thoſe Stones them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not of Men: which <hi>Gemms</hi> I cannot but wonder exceedingly that Men ſhould have in ſuch Admiration. For what is there that wants a <hi>Soule,</hi> and a fit compoſure of <hi>Members,</hi> and <hi>Features,</hi> which ſhould ſeem
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50573:38"/>
                     <hi>Beauteous</hi> and <hi>Amiable</hi> to a <hi>Rational Nature?</hi> Which, although, as they are the Worke of our Creator, and in their own Rank they carry with them ſome of the loweſt kind of <hi>Beauty,</hi> yet ſith their Quality is ſo beneath Your Excellency, do in no wiſe deſerve Your Admiration. Are you Delighted with the Beauty of Fair, and Fruitful Fields? why not? For it is a <hi>Fair</hi> Part of the <hi>Fair Worke</hi> of the Creation. Thus we delight alſo to ſee how pleaſantly the Sea Lookes in a Calme, and Clear Day: thus we Admire the Heavens, the Stars, the Sun, and the Moon. What, doth any of theſe Peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertain to the? dareſt thou to Boaſt thy ſelfe in the Brightneſs of the Heavens? Art thou Adorn'd with the Various Colours, of the Flowers, that come forth in the Spring, and the Begining of Summer? Or are thoſe Fruits Thine that come forth ſo plenteouſly in their Seaſons? why art thou raviſht with vain Joyes? why doſt thou em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>External things,</hi> as if they were <hi>Thine own?</hi> Fortune can never make that to be <hi>Thine,</hi> which the Nature of Things has <hi>Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> from thee. The Fruits of the Earth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50573:39"/>
indeed are without all doubt for the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of <hi>Living Creatures</hi> But if thou wilt Satisfy thy <hi>Need,</hi> which is all that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires, ther's no reaſon why thou ſhouldſt deſire that Fortune ſhould make thee to <hi>Abound.</hi> For Nature is contented with a Few, and with very ſmall things: whoſe Fullneſs if thou wilt oppreſs with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity, that which thou doſt Force upon her, will become either Unpleaſant, or Hurtful. And doſt thou think it a Brave thing to Shine in Rich Apparel? which if it be pleaſant to Looke on, I ſhall commend the Matter of which it is Made, or the Wit of him, that Made it. Art thou Happy in that thou haſt a long Train of Servants to wait on thee? who, if they be Vitious, are a Burthen to the Houſe, and a Plague to their Maſter: But ſuppoſe them to be Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, how can it be that the Goodneſs, and Vertue of other men ſhould be reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Thy Goods? By all that we have ſpoken it is clearly prov'd that not one of thoſe things which thou accounteſt to be <hi>Thy Goods</hi> is <hi>Thy Good</hi> indeed. In which things if there be not any <hi>Beauty</hi> to make
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50573:39"/>
them ſo Deſireable, what reaſon is there that thou ſhouldeſt either be Griev'd for the Loſs, or Delighted with the Poſſeſſion of them? If they are Fair, and Beauteous in their own Nature, what is that to Thee? For upon this account they might be as Pleaſing, though thou couldeſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have any particular Intereſt in them. For they do not therefore become Pretious, or Valuable, becauſe they are a part of thy Riches; but becauſe they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be Pretious thou didſt deſire to get them into thy Poſſeſſion. But, what would ye have, that yee make ſo much adoe about the things that are in the power of Fortune? I ſuppoſe ye would have ſuch Plenty, that yee might not ſtand in Need of any thing. But the caſe is quite contrary with you: For you have Need of more helps to keep the Riches, you have gotten: And True it is, that they ſtand in Need of Many things, who have Many things in their Poſſeſſion; and on the contrary they Want very little, who meaſure their Abundance by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Nature, not by the Superfluity of Ambition. But are you ſo void of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50573:40"/>
and Internal <hi>Good,</hi> that you ſhould ſeeke Your <hi>Goods</hi> Without, in things remote from Your own Nature? Is the courſe of things ſo monſtrouſly chang'd, that a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-Creature</hi> deſerving to be eſteemed as <hi>Divine</hi> upon the account of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſhould not ſeem unto himſelfe to be ſhining, and Illuſtrious, but by the Poſſeſſion of <hi>things without Life?</hi> And indeed other things are ſatisfyed with what they have in themſelves: but you, Creatures <hi>Made after the Image of</hi> GOD, would fain Adorn Your ſelves being of ſo Excellent a Nature, with the Baſeſt, and Loweſt things; not conſidering how great an Injury ye do to Your Creator. For He would have Mankind to Excel All Earthly things, but ye Advance the very Loweſt of them Above Your own Dignity. For if it be a truth unqueſtionable that what ever is the <hi>Good</hi> of another thing, is more Pretious than that thing, whoſe <hi>Good</hi> it is; ſith ye conceit that ſuch contemptible, and unworthy things are <hi>Your Goods,</hi> ye make your ſelves by your own Judgement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Inferiour</hi> to them: and indeed ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that ſo it ſhould be. For ſuch is the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50573:40"/>
Nature of Man, that then only he Excells all other Creatures, when he Knowes Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: but He becomes more Vile than the Beaſts that Periſh, when he ceaſeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein this Knowledge. For 'tis but the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other Creatures here upon Earth, Not to Know Themſelves: but in Men 'tis Vice, or the Corruption of their Nature. But how great is your Error, who conceit that any thing can be Adorn'd with Ornaments that are not It's own. That cannot be. For if any thing looke Bright, and Glorious with that which is put on it, that which is put on, is Prayſed: but that which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd therewith nevertheleſs remains in it's own Filth, and vileneſs. I deny that any thing is <hi>Good,</hi> which may become Hurtful to him that Poſſeſſeth it. Am I out in this? No ſurely, thou wilt ſay. But Riches have often been Hurtful to thoſe that have had them, ſith every one that is extreamly Wicked, and ſo the more <hi>Deſirous</hi> of <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things,</hi> as Gold, or Pretious Stones, thinks him only, who hath ſuch things, to be a moſt Worthy Perſon. Thou then who art now ſo ſollicitous, and fearful of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50573:41"/>
Spear, and of the Sword, if thou hadſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into the Path of this Life with an Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Purſe thou mighteſt Sing in the preſence of a Robber. O Bleſſedneſs of periſhing Riches, which when thou haſt obtein'd thou ceaſeſt to live in Safety!</p>

                  <p>BUT what ſhall I ſay of Dignities, and Power, which you, being Ignorant of the True Dignity, and Power, do ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Extol?

well of the Common-Wealth: which <hi>Fame,</hi> or <hi>Glory,</hi> how ſmall a thing it is, and of no Importance at all, thou mayſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thus: Thou haſt learnt by <hi>Astronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Demonſtrations that All the Compaſs of the Earth is but as it were a <hi>Point,</hi> or the <hi>Least thing Imaginable</hi> in compariſon of the large Space of the Heavens: that is to ſay, if it be compar'd to the greatneſs of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Globe, it would be judg'd to have no Space at all. And of this ſo ſmall a Region of the World 'tis about the Fourth Part as thou haſt learnt from <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by ſuch Creatures, which are known to us. If thou ſhalt ſubſtract from this Fourth Part what the Seas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> take up, and the utmoſt Extent of the Dry Sands, and Deſarts, there will be left but a very Narrow Space for the Habitations of Men. Being then Encompaſt, and Shut up within the leaſt Part of this Extream Little Part of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> do you Think of Enlarging your <hi>Fame,</hi> and making your <hi>Name</hi> Great? But what hath that <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Amplitude,</hi> and <hi>Magnificence</hi> that is ſtraitned with ſuch Narrow Limits? Moreover I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50573:45"/>
would have thee to conſider that in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable Part of the World moſt Nations Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer very much one from another in their <hi>Language,</hi> and in their <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> and their whole Kind of Life: ſo that by reaſon of the Difficulty of ſuch Journeyes, or Voia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the Diverſity of Languages, and the want of all Traffick, or Commerce, not only the Fame of Particular Men, but even of Great Cities may never come to ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In the Daies of <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> as he himſelfe <note n="(a)" place="bottom">In ſomnio Scipi<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     <note n="(b)" place="bottom">A mountaine betwixt Scythia and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</note> 
                     <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and at that time <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo Great, as to be a Terror even to the <note n="(c)" place="bottom">People of Aſia maior.</note> 
                     <hi>Parthians,</hi> and the other Nations therabout. And doſt thou not ſee then how Narrow, and Strait that Glory is, which you labour to ſpread, and dilate? Shall the Glory of a <hi>Roman</hi> go thither where the Name of ROME could never arrive? The Manners, and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Divers Countries do not Agree; ſo that what with ſome men deſerveth Prayſe,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50573:46"/>
with others is accounted worthy of the greateſt Puniſhment. Hence it comes to paſs that if any one delight to be Well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, it is in no wiſe convenient for him that his Name ſhould be carryed to Many People. Therefore Every man muſt be contented with the Glory that is propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt thoſe, who are Govern'd by the ſame Lawes with himſelfe: and that Fame, and Laſting Renown, which they call <hi>Immortality,</hi> ſhall be confin'd within the Limits of one Country. But how many Perſons of great Eminency in their Time had their Names Omitted by the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of that Age! And what doth it profit a man to be mention'd in <hi>Histories,</hi> which at length together with their Authors fall into Oblivion! But you ſeem to your ſelves to have gotten a kind of <hi>Immortality,</hi> when you think that your Fame ſhall endure in the Generations to come. If thou doſt but compare that Duration to Eternity, thou wilt find that thou haſt no cauſe to rejoyce in the Long Continuance of thy Name. For if we make compariſon of One Moment with Ten Thouſand Years, becauſe both Spaces
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50573:46"/>
have their Bounds, it carries though but a little yet ſome Proportion therunto. But this Number of Years be it Multiplyed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much, can in no wiſe be compar'd to that Duration, which ſhall never End. For between things <hi>Finite</hi> there is ſome Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but <hi>Infinite,</hi> and <hi>Finite</hi> can never have any. Thus it comes to paſs that the Fame which endures for never ſo long a Time, in compariſon of Eternity, will not only appear to be very little, but as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. But you care not to Do well, unleſs for the Prayſe of People, and the empty noice of Vulgar Applauſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarding the Excellency of your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Vertue, you expect your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the <hi>Talk</hi> of others. Obſerve how Ingeniouſly a certain man reproves this kind of Folly. For when he ſaw a <hi>conceited</hi> Perſon, that had through vain Glory aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to himſelfe the Falſe Name of a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> to be aſſaulted with many ſharpe Contumelies, and Revilings, and he had told him that now he ſhould know him to be a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> indeed, if he would bear thoſe Injuries with Meekneſs, and Patience; For
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50573:47"/>
a little while he tooke on him a kind of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Boaſting as it were in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies he had receiv'd; Doſt thou not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand at length, ſayth he, that I am a <hi>Philoſopher?</hi> Then replyes the other very Bitingly, I had underſtood it indeed, if thou hadſt held thy peace. But what is Fame to Excellent Men (for of ſuch is our diſcourſe) who ſeeke for Glory in the way of Virtue; what, I ſay, is Fame, or the Glory of this preſent World to them, when their Bodies return to the Duſt? For if Death ſeize on the <hi>Whole Man,</hi> which my Doctrine will not ſuffer you to believe, ther's no ſuch thing, as Glory: ſith he who is ſaid to be the Owner of it, is depriv'd of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But if the Soule that is cleanſed from all Impurity, being deliver'd from this Earthly Priſon, Aſcendeth into Heaven; will ſhe not deſpiſe all that is done here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, whilſt ſhe, being an Inhabitant of Heaven, rejoyceth that ſhe is Exempted from all Earthly Concerns?</p>

And ſome there are that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the Ends, and Cauſes of theſe <hi>Goods (viz.</hi> why they Deſire them) one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as they, who deſire Riches that they may attein to Power, and Dignities, and have all the Means of enjoying ſuch Carnal Pleaſures, to which they are moſt inclin'd: or they, who would fain be in Power that they may get Money, or a Great Name. To theſe, and ſuch like things is the <hi>Bent,</hi> or <hi>Intention</hi> of Humane Actions and Deſires: Nobility, and the Favour of the People ſeem to procure an <hi>Illuſtrious</hi> Name: A Wife and Children are deſir'd for the Pleaſure, and Delight men hope to receive from them. But as for <hi>Friends,</hi> which are the moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred kind of <hi>Goods</hi> we do not judge of them as apperteining to <hi>Fortune,</hi> but to <hi>Virtue.</hi> But now 'tis eaſy to apprehend how the <hi>Goods</hi> of the Body are refer'd to the things above mention'd.

moſt Manlike Exerciſe; Beauty, and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> bring large Prayſes; Health fits a man for the Pleaſures of the Body. By All theſe things 'tis manifeſt that True Happineſs is that which men Chiefly, and Principally Aim at. For that which every man deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth before all other things he judgeth to be the <hi>Soveraign Good.</hi> But we have concluded the <hi>Soveraign Good</hi> to be <hi>Bliſs,</hi> or True Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Wherefore that State, or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which every man deſireth before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, he judgeth to be his <hi>Bliſs.</hi> Therefore thou haſt now lay'd before thine Eyes allmoſt the whole <hi>Form,</hi> or <hi>Model</hi> of Humane Felicity, <hi>Riches, Honors, Power, Glory, Pleaſure.</hi> Which things <hi>Epicurus</hi> conſidering ſeverally, and apart one from another, he judged the <hi>Soveraign Good</hi> to be Pleaſure, becauſe all thoſe other things ſeem to bring Pleaſure, and Delight to the Mind. But I return to the Studies, and Endeavours of men: whoſe Mind notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, though their Memory be ſo weake, and dull, ſtrives to regain the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> but it is like a <hi>Drunken man,</hi> who Miſtakes the Path that leadeth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50573:53"/>
to his Houſe. For what, do they ſeem to be in an Error, who would fain Arrive to ſuch a State, that they may no longer ſtand in need of any thing? But there is nothing that ſo much perfects True Happineſs, as the Abundance of All Good things, which wants not any thing foraign, and Extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal to it's own Nature, and is in itſelfe All-Sufficient. Are they miſtaken who judge that the <hi>Chiefe Good</hi> is that, which is moſt Worthy of <hi>Veneration?</hi> In no wiſe. For that is not vile, or contemptible, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein which, is the <hi>Aim,</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> of All Mankind. Is not Power to be reckon'd in the number of Good things? what? is that feeble and without ſtrength, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably to be prefer'd before All things whatſoever? Is Glory, or Renown no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing-worth? But it cannot be but that whatſoever is moſt Excellent ſhould be alſo moſt Glorious. To what purpoſe ſhould I ſay that True Happineſs cannot be Anxious, or Sad, or Subject to any kind of Sorrowes, and Perplexities; ſith in the leaſt things That is Deſir'd, the Having and Enjoying whereof is Delightſome. For this reaſon
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50573:54"/>
do men Deſire Riches, Dignities, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Glory, and Pleaſures, becauſe they believe that by them they ſhall Attein a State Sufficient, Venerable, Powerful, Illuſtrious, and full of Pleaſure, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. 'Tis GOOD therefore which men Aim at in their various Studies, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: the Force of Nature we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in this, that although the Opinions of men are ſo various, and Diſagreeing, yet they all Conſent in Chooſing GOOD, as the <hi>End</hi> of their Actions.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That true happineſs conſiſteth not in riches.</head>
                  <p>O Earthly Creatures, ye have ſome kind of Perceivance of THAT from which you deriv'd your Being, and of the END for which you were Made, though it be very dull, and confus'd as it were in a <hi>Dream</hi>; and therefore the <hi>Aim,</hi> or <hi>Intention</hi> of your Nature leadeth you to the <hi>True Good,</hi> and many Errors carry you out of the way to It. For conſider whether thoſe things, by which men think they ſhall Attein to True Happineſs, will ever bring them to the End they deſign, and propoſe to themſelves. For if Mony, or Honors, and thoſe other things afore mentioned could put us into a Condition, to which no Good thing could ſeem to be Wanting, we would grant that a man might be Happy by the obteining of thoſe things. If they cannot Performe that which they promiſe, Wanting many Good things, is it not manifeſt that they have but the Falſe Shew of Felicity? In the firſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50573:55"/>
place therefore I aske. Thee, who not long ſince didſt abound with Riches: In the midſt of that Abundance didſt thou never feele any Anguiſh, or Diſturbance of mind ariſing from a ſenſe of the Injuries thou didſt ſuffer? I cannot remember, quoth I, that I was ever in ſo comfortable a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that I had allwayes ſome Trouble, or other. And was it not either becauſe ſomewhat was Wanting, which thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not ſhould be Wanting; or that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what was Preſent, which thou wouldeſt not ſhould be Preſent? This is the caſe, quoth I. Therefore thou didſt Deſire to Have the one, and to be Free'd from the other. 'Tis confeſt, quoth I. But every man Lacketh that which he Deſireth. He doth ſo, quoth I. But whoſo Lacketh any thing, has he Attein'd to a State of <hi>Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency?</hi> In no wiſe, quoth I. Therefore whilſt thou didſt moſt Abound with Riches, didſt thou ſuſtein this <hi>Inſufficiency?</hi> what elſe, quoth I? Riches therefore cannot bring a man to ſuch a State that he ſhall not ſtand in Need of any thing; and it was this, which they ſeem'd to Promiſe. <hi>But</hi> I think
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50573:56"/>
that this is moſt worthy of Conſideration; That Mony hath nothing in it's Nature of ſuch Power, and Efficacy, that it may not be taken away from thoſe that Poſſeſs it. I confeſs it, quoth I. How ſhouldſt thou not confeſs it, ſith we ſee it ſo frequently that the Poſſeſſors are depriv'd of their Wealth? For what is the ground of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaints that are made before the <hi>Judges,</hi> but that men endeavour to regain the Mony that hath been taken from them by Force, or by Fraud? 'Tis ſo, quoth I. Every man therefore, ſaid ſhe, will ſtand in Need of ſome Aid from without, by which he may Poſſeſs his Mony in Safety. That cannot be deny'd, quoth I. But he would have no Need of any ſuch Aid, or Aſſiſtance, if he had no Mony that might be taken from him. That is unqueſtionable, quoth I. The matter then falls out quite contrary to what vain men expect: for thoſe Riches, which were thought to make a man <hi>Sufficient,</hi> render him the more <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous,</hi> making him to ſtand in Need of ſuch External Aid, or Aſſiſtance, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he might well be without. But
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50573:56"/>
how can Riches drive away <hi>Indigence?</hi> Do not Rich men ſuffer <hi>Hunger,</hi> and <hi>Thirſt?</hi> Do not the Limbs of Mony'd men feel <hi>Cold</hi> in the Winter? But Rich men thou wilt ſay have wherewith they may Satisfy their <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> wherewith they may Eaſe themſelves of <hi>Thirſt,</hi> and <hi>Cold.</hi> But thus they may have ſome Conſolation in their <hi>Indigence,</hi> but they cannot be wholly free'd from it. Wherefore if Wealth cannot remove <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> and doth in many reſpects encreaſe it, can there be any reaſon that you ſhould believe that all the Riches in the World can produce <hi>Sufficiency?</hi>

'Tis not poſſible. For <hi>Virtue</hi> has <hi>Dignity</hi> of it's own, which it cannot but transfuſe into thoſe, which Join themſelves unto it. Which becauſe Popular Honors cannot perform 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt they have not in them the Beauty of True <hi>Dignity.</hi> This ought to be very much thought on: for if every man be More Abject, and Deſpicable for being Contemn'd by a Greater Number of Perſons, ſith <hi>Dignity</hi> makes not Wicked men Reverend, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that Shewing them to More People; it makes them to be More Deſpis'd. But Wicked men are reveng'd on Dignities, by Defiling them with their own Impurities,

by which they are ſo expos'd to Diſgrace. And that thou mayſt acknowledge that True Reverence cannot be obtein'd by theſe Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of Dignity; If any man that has been never ſo often <hi>Conſul</hi> ſhould come amongſt Forraign Nations, would his Honor render him Venerable to thoſe Strange People?

As Fire through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World never deſiſts from it's Heat.

If it ſeem a Brave thing to Spread, and Enlarge a mans Name; it followes that it muſt be judg'd a Baſe thing not to Enlarge it.

                  <head type="sub">Why true felicity cannot conſist in temporal things.</head>
                  <p>HItherto I have been giving thee a Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of Falſe Happineſs: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that I ſhould now declare unto thee wherin the Nature of True Happineſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conſiſts. I ſee plainly, quoth I, that Sufficiency may not be gotten by Riches,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50573:65"/>
nor Power by Kingdomes, nor Reverence by Dignities, nor True Renown by Glory, or Popular Applauſe, nor True Joy by Tranſitory Pleaſures. And haſt thou found out the Cauſe, quoth ſhe, why it is ſo? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, quoth I, I have a Glimpſe of it, but I would fain that thou ſhouldeſt give me a clear ſight of it. The Reaſon is very eaſy to be known. For that which in it's own Nature is <hi>Simple,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndivided,</hi> the <hi>Error</hi> of Men has Divided into ſundry Parts, and withdrawes their Mind from that which is True, and Perfect to that which is Falſe, and Imperfect. Can that, thinkeſt thou, which hath Need of nothing, Want Power? No ſurely, quoth I. Right, quoth ſhe: for if there be any thing, which in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect failes in it's Ability, in that reſpect it hath Need of the Aſſiſtance of ſome other thing. 'Tis ſo, ſaid I. Therefore the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Power, and of Sufficiency is One, and the Same. But doſt thou think that what includes Sufficiency, and Power in it's own Nature may be Deſpis'd? or that on the contrary it deſerves the greateſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? This, quoth I, cannot be doubted.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50573:66"/>
Let us Add therefore Reverence, or Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Sufficiency and Power, that we may judge theſe Three things to be One. We muſt do ſo, if we confeſs the very truth. What then? quoth ſhe: doſt thou ſuppoſe that It is Obſcure, and Ignoble, or that It ſhines with the Brightneſs of the greateſt Glory? Conſider whether to that which hath Need of nothing, which is moſt Powerful, which is moſt Worthy of Honor, as has been prov'd, Glory can be Wanting, which it not being able to give unto it ſelfe, it may ſeem in ſome reſpect to be poore, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable? I cannot but confeſs, quoth I, that it is moſt Glorious. It followes then that True Glory, or Renown does not Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the things above mention'd. It followes indeed, quoth I. This then, quoth ſhe, which hath Need of nothing, which Can do All things by it's own Strength, which is Venerable, and Renowned, ye muſt grant alſo to be full of Joy, and Durable Pleaſure. I cannot imagine, quoth I, how any Sadneſs, or Diſcomfort ſhould ever get entrance into It. Wherefore if the former Poſitions remain firm, we muſt of neceſſity
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50573:66"/>
confeſs that it cannot but Abound with all manner of Joy. And this alſo neceſſarily followes from what has been ſaid, that the Names of Sufficiency, Power, Veneration, Glory, Joy, are indeed Divers, but they do not Differ in their Subſtance, or Nature. Right, quoth I. This therefore which in it's own Nature is <hi>One, Simple,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,</hi> the <hi>Perverſeneſs</hi> of Men Divides into ſundry Parts, (as hath been ſaid) and whilſt they endeavour to get a Part of That, which hath no Parts, they neither obtein any Portion thereof, for there is no ſuch thing, nor That <hi>One, Simple,</hi> and <hi>Indiviſible it ſelfe,</hi> which they do not in any wiſe Affect, or Endeavour after. How is that, quoth I? Whoſo deſireth Riches through an Averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Want, or Penury, takes no care how to become Powerful: he chooſeth to be Vile, and Obſcure, and deprives himſelfe of many Natural Pleaſures, that he may not loſe the Mony he hath gotten. But thus he failes of the Sufficiency he Aims at, being void of all Power, encompaſt with many Troubles, Obſcure, and Inglorious. But he that deſireth Power above al things ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50573:67"/>
his Riches, deſpiſeth Pleaſures, and accounteth that Honor, and Glory, that is not accompanied with Power to be nothing-worth. Thou canſt not but ſee that many things are wanting to this man. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it comes to paſs that he wants Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that he ſuffers much Anxiety, and diſturbance of mind: and whilſt he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to put off his troubles, and vexations, 'tis manifeſt that he has not the Power, which he ſo much eſteems. We may Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in like manner concerning Honors, Glory, Pleaſures. For ſith Every one of Theſe is the Same with the other, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever endeavours to get one of Them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, miſſeth even that, which he deſireth. But what, quoth I, If any man ſhould deſire to have All of Them together? Such a man indeed would fain have That wherin the True Felicity doth conſiſt: but ſhall he ever find it in thoſe things, which we have demonſtrated to be unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what they promiſe? No ſurely, quoth I. Then, quoth ſhe, True Felicity is not to be ſought in thoſe things, which men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to contribute Severally to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50573:67"/>
of our various Deſires. I grant it, quoth I, and a greater truth could never have been ſpoken. Thou haſt then the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of Falſe Happineſs, and the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it. Looke now on the other ſide; for there thou ſhalt ſee the only True Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as I have promis'd thee. Verily quoth I, it may eaſily be ſeen, and thou didſt ſhew it a little before, whilſt thou didſt open the Cauſes of that, which men Falſely call Happineſs. For, if I am not miſtaken, that is the True, and Perfect Happineſs which makes a man Perfectly <hi>Sufficient, Powerful, Venerable, Renowned, Joyful.</hi> And that thou mayſt underſtand that I have a deep Apprehenſion of the Truth, thou haſt deliver'd, what One of Theſe, ſith they are All One, and the Same, has the Power verily, and indeed to give unto us, I certainly know to be this Full, and Perfect Happineſs. O my Dear Child, quoth ſhe, Happy art thou in thy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if thou add this there unto! what, quoth I? Doſt thou think that any of theſe fraile, and periſhing things can bring a man to this Eſtate? No ſurely, quoth I, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50573:68"/>
as for that matter what we are to think thou haſt ſo demonſtrated, that there needs no more to be ſaid. Theſe things therefore ſeem to be but Shadowes of the <hi>True Good,</hi> or to give certain Imperfect <hi>Goods</hi> to men in this Mortal Life: but they cannot beſtow the <hi>True, and Perfect Good.</hi> I heartily Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, quoth I, to what thou ſayſt. Sith then thou art come to the Knowledge of True Happineſs, and of ſuch things which Deceive the World with the empty ſhew of it, now it remains that thou ſhouldſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand How thou mayſt Attein to this True Happineſs. That is the thing, quoth I, which I moſt earneſly expect to hear from thee. But, ſaith ſhe, as our <hi>Plato</hi> hath declar'd in his Booke entitled <hi>Timoeus,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in things of the leaſt Importance the Divine Aſſiſtance ought to be Implor'd, what doſt thou think ſhould be done now, that we may become Fit to find the Seat of the <hi>Soveraign Good?</hi> We muſt Invoke the Father of All things, quoth I; unleſs we make our Addreſſes unto Him, no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking can Begin well.

                  <head>The TENTH PROSE.</head>
                  <head type="sub">That there is ſome true happineſs, and where it is to be found.</head>
                  <p>SITH therefore thou haſt had a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Imperfect and alſo of Perfect Good: it is fit that I ſhould now demonſtrate where the Perfection of Felicity is Seated. And here we muſt firſt make Inquiry, if there Be any ſuch Good, as that which thou didſt even now Define, leaſt we ſhould be Deceiv'd with a vain Imagination, there Being indeed no ſuch thing, as that which we make the Subject of our Diſcourſe. But that it doth Exiſt, or is <hi>Actually</hi> in Being, and that it is the Fountain, from whence All good things do flow, this is certain, and unqueſtionable. For whatſoever is ſaid to be Imperfect, by Diminution of that which is Perfect it is call'd Imperfect. So it comes to paſs that if there be any thing Imperfect in it's Kind, in the ſame Kind there muſt needs be ſomething Perfect. For if ye take away Perfection,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50573:69"/>
it cannot be conceiv'd from whence that which we call Imperfect ſhould have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd it's Being. For the Nature of things tooke not it's Begining from that which is in any reſpect Faulty, or Defective, but proceeding from that which is Sound, and Free from all Imperfection, it deſcends at length to theſe Low, and Weak things. If there be a certain Imperfect Happineſs, as we have already ſhown, it cannot be doubted but that there is an Happineſs Entire, and Perfect. This Concluſion, quoth I, is Firm, and Irrefragable. But where It's Abode is, Think with thy ſelfe thus. That GOD, who hath the Governance of All things is Good, this is Natural to the Minds of Men to conceive. For it is impoſſible that our Thoughts ſhould fix upon any thing Better than GOD: and who can doubt but ſuch a Being is Good, which nothing can ſurpaſs in Goodneſs? but ſo doth Reaſon demonſtrate GOD to be Good, that it doth alſo evince the Perfection of Goodneſs to be in Him. For unleſs He were Such a one He could never have the Governance of All things. For ſome thing, that hath the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50573:70"/>
Perfection of Goodneſs, would be more Excellent, than He, in as much as it would be found to have the Priority of Being. For it is manifeſt that All Perfect things have their Being Before thoſe things, which are Unſound, and Imperfect. Wherefore that we may not be endleſs in our Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it muſt be Granted that the Moſt High GOD is Full of the Higheſt, and Perfect Good. But we have Concluded that Perfect Good is <hi>Bliſs,</hi> or True Happineſs. Therefore it muſt needs follow that True Happineſs is no where to be found but in the Moſt High GOD. I heartily Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, quoth I, to what thou ſayſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it capable of any Contradiction. But, I pray thee, quoth ſhe, ſee how thou mayſt prove ſoundly, and Irrefragably that the Moſt High GOD is Full of the Higheſt, or <hi>Soveraign Good.</hi> How, quoth I? Thou mayſt not ſuppoſe that this Father of All things hath Receiv'd that <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> of which he is ſaid to be Full, from without, or that he has It by Nature in ſuch a manner, that thou mayſt think that the <hi>Subſtance, or Eſsence</hi> of GOD Having,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50573:70"/>
and of the <hi>Soveraign Good</hi> Had, is not the Same. For if thou doſt conceit that It is Receiv'd from without, thou mayſt judge That which hath given, to be more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than He which hath Receiv'd It. But we moſt worthily Confeſs Him to be the Moſt Excellent of All things. And if this <hi>Soveraign Good</hi> be in Him by Nature, but may be conceiv'd to be not altogether the Same with Him, ſith we ſpeak of Him, who is Acknowledg'd to have the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of All things, let any man Imagine, who it was that Join'd together theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things? Laſtly that which Differs from any thing Is not That thing, from which it Differs. Wherefore That which Differs in <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Eſſence</hi> from <hi>Soveraign Good</hi> Is not <hi>Soveraign Good:</hi> And 'tis the greateſt Impiety to have ſuch a Thought of GOD, than Whom there can be nothing more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. For it is impoſſible that the Nature of any thing ſhould be Better than That from which it Receiv'd its Being. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore That from which All things Receiv'd their Being I may firmly Conclude to be in its own <hi>Nature</hi> the <hi>Soveraign Good.</hi> 'Tis
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50573:71"/>
moſt certainly ſo, quoth I, as thou ſayſt. But it has been Granted that the <hi>Soveraign Good</hi> is True Happineſs. Very right, quoth I. Therefore, quoth ſhe, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that GOD is True Happineſs. There can be no Reaſon, quoth I, to Deny the <hi>Premiſes,</hi> and I clearly perceive that this is their true, and proper <hi>Conſequence.</hi> See, quoth ſhe, if the ſame thing may not be more firmly prov'd by this Argument, that there cannot be <hi>Two Soveraign Goods,</hi> Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one from the other. For 'tis manifeſt that One of thoſe <hi>Goods,</hi> which are Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from each other, cannot be That, which the Other is: for which cauſe Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them can be Perfect, ſith One is Wanting to the Other. But that which is not Perfect cannot be <hi>Higheſt</hi> or <hi>Soveraign.</hi> The things then that are <hi>Soveraignly Good</hi> cannot be Different from each other. But we have prov'd that both True Happineſs, and GOD are the <hi>Soveraign Good:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs follow that <hi>Soveraign Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> and <hi>Soveraign Divinity</hi> is One, and the ſame Thing. Nothing, ſaid I, could ever be concluded more True, as to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50573:71"/>
Matter; more Firm, as to the way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it; or more becomming the Divine Majeſty. Upon theſe things then, quoth ſhe, as <hi>Geometricians</hi> having Demonſtrated their Propoſitions, are wont to inferr cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Corollaries,</hi> as they call them, ſo ſhall I give thee a <hi>Corollarie.</hi> For ſith Men become Happy by the acquiring of True Happineſs, and True Happineſs is <hi>Divinity it ſelfe,</hi> 'tis manifeſt that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Happy by the acquiring of <hi>Divinity.</hi> But as Men become Juſt by the acquiring of Juſtice, Wiſe by the acquiring Wiſedome, ſo it muſt needs be that having gotten, or acquir'd <hi>Divinity,</hi> they become <hi>Gods.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one then that is <hi>Truly Happy is a God:</hi> but indeed by Nature there is but <hi>One God,</hi> yet nothing hinders but that there may be very Many by the <hi>Participation of Divinity.</hi> And this, quoth I, is a Fair, and Pretious <hi>Corollarie</hi> indeed. But there is nothing more Fair than That which Reaſon perſwades ſhould be Annext to the things that have been ſpoken. What is that, quoth I? Sith True Happineſs, ſaid ſhe, conteins Many things, whether All theſe things make up
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50573:72"/>
One Body with a certain variety of Parts, or whether there be any one of them, which compleats the Subſtance, or Nature of True Happineſs, the reſt being refer'd Therunto? I would thou ſtouldſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what thou ſayſt by rehearſing thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things. Do we not judge True Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, quoth ſhe, to be <hi>Good?</hi> yea, ſaid I, the <hi>Soverain Good.</hi> Add this, ſaid ſhe, to All the reſt of the things aforemention'd. For the ſame <hi>Bliſs</hi> or True Happineſs is judg'd to be <hi>Soveraign Sufficiency, Soveraign Power,</hi> and alſo <hi>Veneration, Renown,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> or <hi>Delight Soveraign.</hi> What then? Are All theſe things as ſo many Limbs, or Parts of True Happineſs, or are they refer'd to <hi>Good,</hi> as That, wherein the Nature of them All is contein'd? I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand now, quoth I, what thou doſt propoſe, as the ſubject of our Inquiry, but I would fain know how thou doſt Determine the Queſtion. Thus. If All theſe things were as ſo many Parts of True Happineſs, they would Differ one from the other. For this is the Nature of Parts, that being Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers they make up One, and the Same Body.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50573:72"/>
But it hath been already prov'd that they are All but One thing. Ther's no doubt of that, quoth I, But I expect what thou wilt ſay next. This is manifeſt quoth ſhe, that All thoſe other things are refer'd to <hi>Good.</hi> For therefore is <hi>Sufficiency</hi> Deſir'd, becauſe it is judg'd to be <hi>Good,</hi> for the ſame Cauſe is Power Deſir'd, and ſo Veneration, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, Delight. 'Tis <hi>Good</hi> then, which is the Cauſe, For which any thing is Deſir'd: ſith that which retains not any thing in it ſelfe either <hi>Really,</hi> or <hi>Apparently Good,</hi> can in no wiſe be Deſir'd. And on the contrary thoſe things, which are not <hi>Good</hi> in their own Nature, yet if they Seem to be ſo, are Deſir'd, as if they were <hi>Truly Good.</hi> Whence it comes to paſs that <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is rightly judg'd to be the Cauſe, why any thing ſhould be Deſir'd. But that For which any thing is Deſir'd is the Chief Object of the Deſire. As if a man have a Will to Ride For his Health, 'tis not ſo much the Riding, as Health that he Deſires. Sith therefore that All things are Deſir'd For the obteining of <hi>Good, Good</hi> is the Chief, or Principal Object of all Deſires whatſoever. But it
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50573:73"/>
has been granted that True Happineſs is That, For which any thing is Wiſht, or Deſir'd: wherefore it is evident that True Happineſs is the Only thing Requir'd, or Sought after. And thus it cannot be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, that the Subſtance, or Nature of <hi>Good,</hi> and of True Happineſs is One, and the Same. I ſee not how it is poſſible for any man to Diſſent from this. But we have prov'd that GOD, and True Happineſs is One, and the Same thing. Right, quoth I. Therefore we may Safely Conclude that the Nature of GOD conſiſts in GOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS, and in Nothing elſe.</p>

                  <p>I Aſſent, quoth I. For All theſe things hang one to another by a chain of the ſtrongeſt Reaſons, that were ever produc'd. Then ſaid She, At how great a rate wouldeſt thou value it, if thou couldeſt know what
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50573:74"/>

They ſhall ſo remain, ſaid I. Have we not prov'd, ſaid ſhe, that thoſe things, which are Deſir'd by the Generality of men, are not <hi>Truly, and Perfectly Good,</hi> becauſe they Differ one from the other, and ſith eace of them is Wanting to the other, that they cannot produce <hi>Full, and Abſolute Good?</hi> But that then they become <hi>True Good,</hi> when they are collected as it were into <hi>One Form, and Efficiency,</hi> ſo that what Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is, the Same is Power, Veneration, Renown, Delight; and unleſs they are One, and the Same thing, that they have nothing in them, for which they may be numbred amongſt things that are to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd? It has been plainly Demonſtrated, quoth I, neither can it be Doubted in the leaſt. Is it not by the acquiring of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> that thoſe things become <hi>Good</hi> which are in no wiſe <hi>Good,</hi> whilſt they Differ, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

But doſt thou grant that whatſoever is <hi>Good,</hi> is <hi>Good</hi> by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the <hi>Soveraign Good?</hi> I grant it. Thou oughteſt therefore to grant likewiſe that ONE, and GOOD is the Same. For the Nature of thoſe things is the Same, whoſe Natural Effect is not Divers. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Deny it, quoth I. And doſt thou know, ſaid ſhe, that whatſoever is, does remain, and Subſiſt, ſo long, as it is One; but that it Periſheth, and is diſſolv'd, as ſoon as it ceaſeth to be One? How is that? As in <hi>Animals,</hi> or <hi>Senſitive Creatures,</hi> whilſt the Soule, and the Body remain together, we call it a <hi>Senſitive Creature.</hi> But when this Unity is diſſolv'd by the ſeperation of one from the other, 'tis manifeſt that it loſeth the Being of a <hi>Senſitive Creature.</hi> And our very Body, whilſt it remains in One Shape by the Conjunction of it's Limbs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teins the Reſemblance of a Man. But if the Parts of the Body be Diſunited it ceaſeth to be what it was before. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Every other thing will be found to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, or remain in Being ſo long, as it is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50573:75"/>
One: but when it ceaſeth to be One, it Periſheth. I cannot think but that it muſt needs be ſo. And is there any thing, quoth ſhe, which ſo far as it Acts according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can ceaſe from all Inclination to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein it's Being, and become Deſirous of it's own Deſtruction? If, quoth I, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Animals,</hi> or <hi>Senſitive Creatures</hi> either <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>meerly Senſitive,</hi> which in ſome ſort may be ſaid to Will, or to be Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I find not any thing, which (unleſs it be conſtrain'd from without) leaves the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to continue it's Being, and of it's own Accord Haſtens to Deſtruction. For Every <hi>Senſitive Creature</hi> labours to keep it ſelfe in Safety, and does all that it can to avoid Deſtruction. But I know not what I ſhall think of <hi>Herbs,</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> and of things neither <hi>Senſitive,</hi> nor <hi>Vegetative.</hi> But, quoth ſhe, neither is there any reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt doubt of this, ſith thou mayſt behold <hi>Herbs,</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi> to grow firſt in Places moſt convenient for them, where they may not dye away, as long, as their Nature is capable of any further Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. For ſome ſpring up in Fields, ſome
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50573:75"/>
on Mountains, ſome the Mariſhes bring fourth, ſome grow on Rocks, ſome are produc'd by the Barren Sands, which if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man endeavour to tranſplant in other Places, they will wither, and dye away. But Nature gives to All things that which is convenient for them, and takes care that they may not Periſh, whilſt they have any Poſſibility to Subſiſt. Do not all <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi> thruſting their Mouthes as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth draw Nouriſhment by their Rootes, and diffuſe their Strength, and Rinde through their Pith, or Marrow? Does not every ſuch Part, which is moſt ſoft, and tender, as the Pith, lye hid in the inmoſt ſeat, but without it is cover'd with that which is firm, and ſolid; but the outmoſt Part of all is the Rinde, which is ſeated there to be a defenſe againſt the Violence both of the Sun, and of the Wind? And thou ſeeſt how careful, and diligent Nature is that All things may be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Multiplication of Seed. Which things have theſe Engines, as we may call them, not only to preſerve their Being for a time, but to make their Duration, as to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50573:76"/>
their ſeveral Kinds, Perpetual. And do not thoſe things likewiſe which are thought to be neither <hi>Senſitive,</hi> nor <hi>Vegetative,</hi> Deſire that, which Properly belongs to them? For why doth <hi>Lightneſs</hi> carry up the Flames, and the Earth is preſt down by it's Weight, but that theſe Places, and Motions Properly belong to each of them? That which is Agreeable to any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it's Being, as thoſe things, which are Contrary therunto, deſtroy, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it. Thoſe things, which are Hard, as Stones, cleave faſt to their Parts, ſo that it is very Difficult to Divide them. But <hi>Liquid</hi> things as <hi>Aire,</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> yield preſently to the Impreſſions of that which would Divide them, but (that which kept them aſunder being remov'd) they inſtantly return into thoſe things, from which they are Seperated. We treat not now of the <hi>Voluntary</hi> Motions of a <hi>Knowing</hi> Soule, but of the <hi>Natural Intention.</hi> Thus we <hi>Digeſt</hi> the Food, we receive, though we think not of it; thus we draw our Breath, whilſt we Sleep, though we Know it not. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>Living-Creatures</hi> the Love they have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50573:76"/>
to their own Being does not proceed from the <hi>Animal Inclinations</hi> of their Soules, but from the Principles of Nature. For it is often ſeen (great cauſes conſtraining ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) that a mans <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Rational Appetite</hi> Embraceth Death it ſelfe which Nature Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors: And on the contrary That by which alone the Kinds of Mortal things are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated, to wit, the Worke of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Nature allwayes Deſires, the Will very often moſt earneſtly Refrains from. Thus the Love which things have to Themſelves doth not proceed from their <hi>Animal Motion,</hi> but their <hi>Natural Intention.</hi> For Providence hath given this even the greateſt cauſe of preſerving their Being, that they Naturally Deſire to Subſiſt, as long, as 'tis Poſſible. Wherefore there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thou ſhouldſt doubt in the leaſt, that All things that are, do Naturally Deſire to retain their Being, to avoid Deſtruction, I confeſs, quoth I, that I do now moſt clearly perceive thoſe things, which awhile ſince ſeem'd very Uncertain. But that, ſaid ſhe, which Deſireth to Subſiſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Being, it Deſireth to be One. For
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50573:77"/>
if this (Being One) were taken away, no <hi>Eſſenſe</hi> could remain to any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. 'Tis true, quoth I. All things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Deſire ONE. I conſent. But we have Demonſtrated that ONE, and GOOD is the Same. You have ſo. All things therefore have a <hi>Natual Propenſity</hi> to GOOD: which indeed thou mayſt thus Deſcribe: <hi>Good is That, which All things Deſire.</hi> A greater Truth, quoth I, could never be conceiv'd.

                  <head type="sub">How the world is governed by God.</head>
                  <p>THEN ſaid I, I do moſt heartily Aſſent to <hi>Plato</hi> in this matter: for this is the Second time that thou haſt call'd me to the Remembrance of theſe things. Firſt when I loſt my <hi>Memory</hi> by the Conragion of the Body, and then by the Dullneſs, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity which my Mind had contracted being oppreſt with ſuch a weight of Immoderate Sorrow. Then ſhe ſpake thus: If thou lookeſt back to the things that have been already Granted, it will not be long before thou ſhalt come to the Remembrance of that, which awhile ſince thou ſaydſt that thou hadſt no Knowledge of. What quoth I? By what <hi>Rule,</hi> ſaid ſhe, is the World Govern'd? I remember, quoth I, that I did confeſs my Ignorance of this: but though I do in a manner foreſee what thou art about to ſay, yet I deſire to hear it for my further Inſtruction. Thou didſt diliver thine Opinion, ſaid ſhe, but a little before,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50573:78"/>
that it could not be doubted in the leaſt but that the World is Govern'd by GOD. Yea, quoth I, and I am of the ſame mind now, and ever ſhall be that this is moſt certain, and unqueſtionable: and by what Reaſons I am induc'd to this Judgement, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in a few words. This World conſiſting of ſo Divers, and Contrary Parts could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been brought into One Forme, if there were not ONE who did Join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Divers things. And the Diverſity of their Natures, which are ſo Repugnant to one another, would Seperate, and Diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite them being Join'd together, if there were not ONE, who did Hold together the things, which He has United. For the Courſe of Nature could not proceed in ſuch certain, and never fayling Order, neither could it make ſuch a ſhew of well-diſpoſed Motions, by Places, Times, Efficiency, or Operation, Spaces, Qualities, if there were not ONE, who Being Himſelfe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable did Order, and Diſpoſe this Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Changes. This (ONE) whatever it is, on which All things Depend both as to their <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> I Call GOD,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50573:79"/>
which is a Word us'd by All People. Then ſpake ſhe thus: Sith thou haſt ſo deep a Senſe of theſe things, I ſuppoſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Part of my Labour is not great, to bring thee Safe into Thine own Country, where thou ſhalt Enjoy the only True, and Perfect Happineſs. But let us Reflect on thoſe things, which we have already Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſt. Have we not Agreed upon this that Sufficiency is included in the Nature of True Happineſs: And that GOD is True Happineſs it ſelfe. And therefore, quoth ſhe, He will not Need any Helps, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments from Without to Govern the World; for if He had Need of any thing He could not have Full, and Perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. It muſt be ſo, quoth I, as thou ſayſt. Therefore By Himſelfe Alone He Governs, and Diſpoſes All things. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd, quoth I. But it has been prov'd that GOD is the <hi>Soveraign Good.</hi> I know it has, quoth I. By the <hi>Soveraign Good</hi> then He Diſpoſes, and Governs All things, ſith He Governs All things By Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whom we have Acknowledg'd to be the <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> and He is as it were a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50573:79"/>
certain <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of Government, whereby the Whole World is kept in Order. I moſt heartily Aſſent, quoth I: and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before I did foreſee what thou waſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſay, though ſomewhat darkly. I believe it, quoth ſhe; for now, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, Thine Eyes are more Open to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern the Truth. But what I ſhall now ſay is no leſs perſpicuous. What, quoth I? Sith GOD, ſaid ſhe, is rightly believ'd to Govern All things By the Rule of GOODNESS, and All things, as I have taught, have a Natural <hi>Bent,</hi> or <hi>Intention</hi> to GOOD, can it be doubted but that they are Govern'd, as they Would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and being <hi>Made</hi> to Comply with their Governour, All the Motions they have according to the <hi>Propenſity</hi> of their Nature are no other, than the Reſults of that Complyance. So it muſt needs be, quoth I: neither could it be thought an Happy Government, if it were the <hi>Yoke</hi> of things Refractory, not the <hi>Safety</hi> of things Tractable, and Obedient. There is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then, which, following the Courſe of Nature, can Endeavour to go Contrary
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50573:80"/>
to GOD. Nothing, ſaid I. If any thing ſhould Endeavour it, quoth ſhe, would it ever Prevaile againſt Him, whom we have granted by the Right of True Happineſs to be Almighty? Nothing, quoth I, could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the leaſt Prevaile againſt Him. Then, quoth ſhe, there is not <hi>any thing in Nature,</hi> which hath either the Will, or the Power to Reſiſt the <hi>Soveraign Good.</hi> No ſurely, as I conceive. Then, ſaid ſhe, That is the <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> which Powerfully Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and Sweetly Diſpoſeth All things. Then ſaid I: How am I Delighted not only with the main Scope, and Drift of thine Arguments, but even with the very words that thou uſeſt, that at length Prating Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be Abaſht, and put to Silence. Thou haſt heard, quoth ſhe, in <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Ovid Lib. 2. Metamor. &amp; Macrob. Lib. I. Saturnal.</note> Old Stories how the Gyants endeavour'd to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Heaven, but even they, as it was moſt meet, were thrown down by Benign Fortitude. But wilt thou that we ſtrike Arguments one againſt another, perhaps out of ſuch a Conflict ſome bright Sparke
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50573:80"/>
of Truth will ſpring forth. Do as thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fit, ſay'd I. No man, ſaid ſhe, can ever doubt but that GOD is Almighty. No man, ſaid I, that is in his right wits. But there is Nothing, which He that is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath not a Power to Do. Nothing, ſaid I. What hath GOD a Power then to Do EVIL? No ſurely, EVIL then, quoth ſhe, is Nothing, <hi>viz.</hi> Hath not any <hi>Proper Being</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> ſith He who Can Do All things, Cannot Do EVIL. Doſt thou ſport with me, ſaid I, making an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable Labyrinth with the ſubtle wayes of Thine Argumentation, Entring now, where thou didſt Go forth, and then Going forth, where thou didſt Enter; or doſt thou by theſe Intricate Reaſonings ſhew that there is a Wonderful Circle in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Simplicity? For a little before begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with True Happineſs, thou didſt affirm it to be the Higheſt, or <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> which thou ſaydſt was plac'd in the Moſt High GOD: And thou didſt Prove that GOD is this <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> and the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly True, and Perfect Happineſs: then thou gaveſt me this, as a Token of thy Bounty,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50573:81"/>
That no man is Truly Happy, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he muſt be a GOD. Again thou didſt aſſert that the very <hi>Form of Good</hi> is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD, and of True Happineſs: and thou didſt ſhew that ONE is the very GOOD, which All things Naturally De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: thou didſt alſo Demonſtrate that GOD Governeth the Univerſe By the <hi>Rule</hi> of GOODNESS, and that All things are Willingly Subject unto Him, and that EVIL hath not any <hi>Nature</hi> Properly ſo call'd: And theſe things thou didſt evince by ſuch Arguments, wherof there were none Extrinſecal to the Matter in hand, but one drawing Aſſent by the Connexion it hath with another, all of them being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Subject of our Diſcourſe. Then ſpake ſhe thus: We do not Sport, but we have perform'd a Taske of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, by the Gracious Aſſiſtance of GOD, whoſe Name we did Invoke. For ſuch is the <hi>Form</hi> of the Divine Subſtance, that It neither falls into the Condition of things Without, nor doth It admit any thing Without to come into the ſame State with It ſelfe; but, as <hi>Parmenides</hi> ſaith,

It wheeles-about the Movable Circle of things, whilſt It preſerves It ſelfe in a State Immovable. And if we have us'd ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which were not fetcht from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but lie within the compaſs of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which we did Treat, there is no cauſe that thou ſhouldſt Admire, ſith thou haſt receiv'd it from the Teſtimony of <hi>Plato,</hi> that Words ſhould be A-kin to the Things, of which we Diſcourſe.</p>

And ſith I have already ſhewn thee, wherin True Happineſs doth conſiſt, and thou haſt learnt in Whom it is to be found, all things being run over, which I think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to promiſe, I ſhall ſhew thee the way that leadeth to Thine Houſe. And I

                  <head>The SECOND PROSE.</head>
                  <head type="sub">That good men are powerful, and evil men weake.</head>
                  <p>THEN ſaid I, O, how Great things doſt thou Promiſe! which I doubt not but thou art Able to Performe. But ſee thou do not ſlacken and coole him, whom thou haſt excited, and enflam'd. In the firſt place then thou mayſt eaſily underſtand that <hi>Good men</hi> are allwayes Powerful, that the <hi>Wicked</hi> are void of all Power: of which Aſſertions one is prov'd by the other. For ſith <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Evill</hi> are Contraries, if it be manifeſt that <hi>Good</hi> is Powerful, 'tis no leſs evident that <hi>Evill</hi> is Feeble, and Impotent: but if the Frailty of <hi>Evill</hi> be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the Strength and Firmneſs of <hi>Good</hi> cannot but be known likewiſe. That the Truth of that I ſay may be moſt clearly and abundantly demonſtrated, I ſhall go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this way, and ſometimes that, in the purſuit of the Matter, I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to treat of. There are Two things,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50573:86"/>
wherin all the Effect of Humane Actions doth conſiſt, to wit, Will, and Power, of which if one be wanting nothing can be Done. For if the <hi>Will</hi> faile, no man At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth any thing: but if <hi>Power</hi> be wanting, 'tis in vain to will any thing. So that if thou ſeeſt any man Willing to Get that, which he does not Get, thou canſt not doubt, but that he wanteth the Ability to Obtein what he would have. 'Tis as clear, as the Sun, quoth I. But canſt thou doubt but that he had <hi>Power,</hi> whom thou ſeeſt to have <hi>Effected</hi> what he <hi>Will'd,</hi> and <hi>Deſign'd?</hi> No. But what any man is Able to do, in that he is Powerful: but what he is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do, in that he is judg'd to be Feeble, and Impotent. I confeſs it, quoth I. Doſt thou not Remember, quoth ſhe, that it has been already Prov'd, that All the <hi>Bent,</hi> or <hi>Intention</hi> of the Will of Man, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd in Divers Studies, and Endeavours, tends unto True Happineſs? I well Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, quoth I, that This has been De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. Doſt thou Remember that True Happineſs is the <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> ſo that ſith True Happineſs is ſought for by
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50573:87"/>
All men, <hi>Good</hi> muſt needs be Deſir'd by them? I cannot be ſaid to Remember it, quoth I, becauſe it is never out of my Mind. Have All men therefore <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> one Intention, <hi>viz.</hi> To Attein to the Poſſeſſion of GOOD? It muſt needs follow, quoth I. But it is moſt certain that by getting of GOOD, Men become <hi>Good.</hi> 'Tis certain. Do <hi>Good men</hi> therefore get that, which they Deſire? So it ſeems. But <hi>Evill</hi> men, if they could get the <hi>Good,</hi> that they Deſire would ceaſe to be <hi>Evill.</hi> 'Tis true. Sith therefore Both ſorts of Men Deſire <hi>Good,</hi> but ſome Attein therunto, others come ſhort of it, it cannot be doubted but that <hi>Good men</hi> are Powerful; but they that are <hi>Wicked</hi> are Feeble, and Impotent. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doubts of this, ſaid ſhe, is neither ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of conſidering the Nature of Things, nor the Conſequence of Reaſons. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſaid ſhe: If there be Two perſons, who have one Purpoſe, or Deſign to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which their Nature requires: and one of them Performs his Intention; but the other is not Able to execute that Natural Office, but takes ſome ſuch courſe,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50573:87"/>
which is not Agreeable to Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth not Accompliſh his Purpoſe, but Imitates one that doth Accompliſh it: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Two doſt thou judge to be the more Able man? Though I conjecture, ſaid I, what thou wouldeſt be at, yet I deſire thou wouldeſt ſpeak it out more plainly. Wilt thou deny, ſaid ſhe, that to Go is a Motion Natural to men? No, ſaid I. And doſt thou doubt that 'tis Natural to the Feet to perform that Office? Neither can I deny that. If any one then ſhould Go on his Feet, and another, who wants this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Office of Feet, ſhould endeavour to Go on his Hands, who of theſe might be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judg'd to be the more <hi>Able</hi> man? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, ſaid I, for it is unqueſtionable, that he who has a Power to perform thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which Nature requires, has more Strength than he, who is not Able ſo to do. But the <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> which All men Aim at, <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Bad, Good men</hi> Attein unto by the Natural Office of Virtues: but the <hi>Wicked</hi> earneſtly endeavour after this very <hi>Good</hi> by gratifying their various Luſts, and unruly Affections, which is not the Office
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50573:88"/>
that Nature requires us to perform, that we may Attein to the <hi>True Good.</hi> Doſt thou think otherwiſe? No ſurely, ſaid I: the Conſequence alſo is very clear. For from what I have granted, it muſt of neceſſity follow that <hi>Good men</hi> are Powerful, that <hi>Wicked men</hi> are altogether Feeble, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent. Thou doſt well, quoth ſhe, thus to run before me; and this, as <hi>Phyſitians</hi> are wont to hope, is a ſign that Nature ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Strength, and begins to reſiſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe. But becauſe I perceive thee to be ſo Quick of Apprehenſion, I ſhall be ſure to ply thee with Arguments. See how Weak are all Vitious Perſons, who cannot ſo much as Attein to That, to which their Natural Intention leads, and in a manner compels them. And what? if they were left deſtitute of this great, and almoſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable Aſſiſtance of Nature encouraging, and directing them? but conſider, I ſay, how great Impotency lend, wicked men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under. For the things they ſeek for, but are not able to obtein are of no ſmall moment: but indeed they faile in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is the Chiefeſt of All their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50573:88"/>
they miſs the fruits of all the Toyle, and hard labour they undergo night, and day: in which the Strength of <hi>Good men</hi> may eaſily be ſeen. For as thou wouldeſt judge Him to be a Moſt Able <hi>Foot-man,</hi> who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his Feet, ſhould be Able to come at length to that Place, Beyond which 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any one ſhould Go: ſo thou muſt of neceſſity judge Him, who hath At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein'd to that GOOD, Beyond which 'tis impoſſible that any one ſhould extend his Deſires, to be a Perſon Abſolutely Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht with the Greateſt Strength, or Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. From whence it is moſt evident that whoſoever are Wicked, the ſame are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all manner of Strength. For why do they leave Virtue, and follow Vice? is it becauſe they are Ignorant of the True Good? but what is more Feeble than Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or <hi>Spiritual Blindneſs?</hi> Do they Know what they ſhould follow, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after, but their Luſts draw them aſide ſome other way? thus they appear to be moſt Feeble Creatures, who are ſo Unable to Reſiſt their Vitious Inclinations. Do they Knowingly, and Willfully forſake that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50573:89"/>
which is Good, and turn to the way of Vice? But if ſo, they do not only ceaſe to <hi>be</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, but they wholly relinquiſh their True, and Proper <hi>Being.</hi> For they who thus forſake the common End of All things that are, ceaſe alſo to have <hi>their Being.</hi> Which perhaps will ſeem to ſome to be very ſtrange, that we ſhould ſay that <hi>Evill,</hi> or <hi>Wicked men,</hi> which are by far the greateſt Number, ſhould ceaſe to <hi>Be.</hi> But ſo it is for certain. For thoſe, who are <hi>Evill men,</hi> I do not deny to be <hi>Evill men:</hi> but I deny that they may Purely, and Simply be ſaid be be <hi>Men.</hi> For as thou mayſt ſay that a <hi>Carcaſs</hi> is a <hi>Dead Man,</hi> but thou mayſt not call it Simply, and Abſolutely a <hi>Man</hi>: ſo I ſhall grant that thoſe, who are Addicted to Vice, are <hi>Evill men,</hi> but I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Abſolutely that they are <hi>Men.</hi> For that <hi>Is,</hi> or hath it's True, and Proper Being, which reteins Order, and preſerves it's Nature: from which whatſoever doth revolt, it relinquiſheth it's Proper Being, which lyeth in it's Nature. But <hi>Evill men</hi> thou wilt ſay have ſome kind of Power: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I deny it; but this their Power
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50573:89"/>
does not proceed from Strength, but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity: For they have the Power to <hi>Do Evill,</hi> which they would not have, if they had the <hi>Effectual Power</hi> of <hi>Doing Good.</hi> Which Poſſibility doth plainly ſhew that they have not any Power, Truly, and Properly ſo call'd. For if <hi>Evill</hi> have not any <hi>Proper Being,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> as we prov'd a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſith Wicked men have only the Power to Do <hi>Evill,</hi> 'tis manifeſt that they have no True Power. It cannot be deny'd. And that thou mayſt better underſtand what kind of Power this is, we have determin'd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before that ther's nothing more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the <hi>Soveraign Good.</hi> I know thou haſt, ſaid I. But the Same (<hi>Soveraign Good</hi>) Cannot Do that which is <hi>Evill.</hi> No ſurely. Will any one conceit, ſaid ſhe, that Men Can Do All things? None, but ſuch a one, who is out of his wits. But they Can Do <hi>Evill.</hi> Would to God, ſaid I, they had no ſuch Power. Sith therefore He that Can Do nothing, but that which is <hi>Good,</hi> Can do All things; but they Cannot Do All things, who Can Do <hi>Evill,</hi> 'tis manifeſt that their Power is the leſs in as much as
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50573:90"/>
they are Able to Do <hi>Evill.</hi> Add hereunto that All True Power is in the number of things that are to be Deſir'd, and we have prov'd that All things to be Deſir'd are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to <hi>Good,</hi> as to that wherin their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection doth conſiſt. But the Poſſibility of Performing a Wicked Action Cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to <hi>Good:</hi> therefore it is not to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd. But all True Power is to be Deſir'd. 'Tis manifeſt therefore that the Poſſibility of Doing <hi>Evill</hi> is no True Power. Hence it appears that <hi>Good men</hi> are allwayes Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, that <hi>Wicked men</hi> are moſt Feeble, and Impotent. And the Truth of that Saying of <hi>Plato</hi> cannot be doubted.
<q>That Wiſe men onely Do what they Deſire, but that the Wicked Exerciſe their Luſts, but are never Able to Accompliſh their Deſires.</q>
For they Do whatſoever their Luſts prompt them unto, whilſt by thoſe Courſes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they gratifie their Senſual Inclinations, they hope to Attein to that <hi>Good</hi> which they Deſire; but they never Attein therunto, for 'tis impoſſible that Villany ſhould Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to True Happineſs.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That good men are not without reward, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil without puniſhments.</head>
                  <p>SEEST thou then what Filth all Villany walloweth in, and how great a Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor there is in True Virtue, and Integrity? In this it plainly appears that <hi>Good men</hi> are allwayes Rewarded, <hi>Evill men</hi> are allwayes Tormented. For that, for which any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is Perform'd, ſeemeth to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that ſame Performance: as a <hi>Crown,</hi> or <hi>Garland,</hi> for which a man Runs, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd as a Reward to him that Runs a Race. But we have prov'd Happineſs is that very GOOD for which All Actions are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: That GOOD therefore is the common Reward that is propos'd to All Humane Actions. But This cannot be kept from <hi>Good men.</hi> For he may not any longer be called a <hi>Good man,</hi> who is not Partaker of this <hi>Soveraign Good.</hi> Let the Wicked then Rage, a Wiſe, and Virtuous man keeps on his Crown, and it Fadeth not away. For
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50573:91"/>
the Iniquity of Other men can never deprive a Pious Soule of it's Proper Ornament. If he did Rejoyce in what he hath Receiv'd from Without, this any other man, even he, who confer'd it on him, might deprive him of. But ſith it is confer'd on him by that <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which is Within himſelfe, he will never want his Reward, as long, as he continues to be <hi>Good.</hi> Laſtly ſith every Reward is therefore Deſir'd becauſe it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to be <hi>Good,</hi> who will ever judge that he who Poſſeſſeth the <hi>True Good</hi> can miſs his Reward? But what is this Reward? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Faireſt, and Greateſt of All Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Remember the <hi>Corollary</hi> which I gave thee but a little before, and gather in the full Proofe of what I have ſaid thus: Sith the Soveraign Good is True Happines, 'tis manifeſt that All Good men even in this that they are <hi>Good</hi> do become Truly Happy. But it has been concluded that thoſe, who are Truly Happy are Gods. Such there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Reward of <hi>Good men,</hi> which ſhall not be worn out by the longeſt Time, nor diminiſht by any mans Power, nor defil'd by any mans Iniquity, <hi>viz. To become Gods.</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:50573:92"/>
And ſith theſe things are ſo, what Wiſe man can ever doubt of the Pains, and Anxieties that are implyed in the nature of All Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Actions. For ſith <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Evill, Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment,</hi> and <hi>Reward</hi> are Oppoſite, it muſt needs be that whatſoever we ſee in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Good,</hi> that which is directly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary therunto may be ſeen in the <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Evill.</hi> As Virtue therefore is the Reward of the Virtuous, ſo Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity is the Torment of the Wicked. But now whoſoever ſuffers <hi>Puniſhment</hi> doubts not but that he is oppreſt with <hi>Evill.</hi> If therefore they would rightly Judge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, could it ſeem to them that they are free from Trouble, and Vexation, whom Wickedneſs the greateſt of all <hi>Evils</hi> doth not only oppreſs, but Pierce through, ſeizing, and Perverting all their Faculties? But Obſerve what Pains, and Anxieties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Wicked, in oppoſition to what we have ſaid of the True Pleaſure, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of thoſe that are ſincerely, and firmly Poſſeſt of True Goodneſs, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For thou haſt been taught a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that whatſoever Is, or hath any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                  <p>BUT the Vulgar regards not theſe things. What then? ſhall we be like them, whom we have demonſtrated to be no other than a ſort of <hi>Irrational Creatures?</hi> What if any one having wholly loſt his Sight, ſhould forget that he had ever ſeen any thing, and conceit that there was nothing wanting to him of Humane Perfection, ſhould we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50573:94"/>
judge thoſe that retein their Sight to be Blind likewiſe? For the Vulgar refuſe their Aſſent to this alſo, which depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as firm, and ſolid grounds, as any thing we have formerly demonſtrated, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>That thoſe Perſons are more Miſerable that Do an Injury, than thoſe that Suffer it.</q>
I would fain hear, ſaid I, what grounds thou canſt ſhew for this. Doſt thou deny, quoth ſhe, that every Wicked man is worthy of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? No ſurely. But it appears by many Reaſons that they are Miſerable, who are Wicked. 'Tis true, ſaid I. Whoſoever then are worthy of <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> thou doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not but they are Miſerable. It cannot be deny'd, quoth I. If therefore thou didſt ſit, as a Judge, on whom wouldſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Puniſhment</hi> ſhould be inflicted, on him, who has Done, or on him who has Suffer'd an Injury? I doubt not, ſaid I, but that I ſhould ſatisfie the Perſon Injur'd by the Griefe of him, that hath done the Injury. The <hi>Injurious</hi> therefore would ſeem to be more Miſerable, than he, who hath receiv'd the Injury. It followes indeed, ſaid I. By this Reaſon therefore and others
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50573:95"/>
of the like Importance, <hi>viz.</hi> that Vice and Impurity does by it's own Nature make men Miſerable, it is moſt evident that he who offers an Injury, not he, who receives it, doth thereby become Miſerable. But now, quoth ſhe, our <hi>Advocates</hi> Act quite contrary to this. For they endeavour to move the Pity, or Commiſeration of the Judges towards thoſe, who have Suffer'd ſome Great Injury, wheras indeed they ſhould be rather Pityed, who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Guilt of being ſo Injurious: whom their Accuſers ſhould not be mov'd to bring before the Judge by Wrath, and Indignation, but by a Generous Pity, and Deſire of their Welfare, as <hi>Sick folk</hi> are brought to the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> that by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of External <hi>Puniſhment</hi> they may be Cur'd of their Inward Diſtempers. And thus the Employment of thoſe that Plead for Offenders would either totally ceaſe, or if it ſhould be continued for the Good of Mankind, it would be turn'd into the Form of an <hi>Accuſation.</hi> The Wicked themſelves if they could have but a Glimpſe of Virtue, which they have Forſaken, and could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50573:95"/>
that they ſhould be in ſome capacity of cleanſing themſelves from the Filth of their Vices by receiving their due <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> their Pains being recompenc'd with the obteining of True Goodneſs, and Piety, they would not eſteem them to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Horror, and Averſation, and they would refuſe the Aſſiſtance of thoſe men, that make <hi>Apologies</hi> for ſuch who De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> and yeild themſeles to be Diſpos'd of according to the Pleaſure of their Accuſers, and of the Judges. Whence it comes to paſs that among Wiſe men there is no Place left for <hi>Hatred.</hi> For who but an egregious Foole will Hate Good men?

Then Smiling a little ſhe ſpake thus: This <hi>Inquiry</hi> is the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult of all, which will hardly be ſatisfyed with any thing that can be ſaid in Anſwear therunto. For the Matter is ſuch that one doubt being Cutt of, many others Grow up like the <hi>Heads of the Snake Hydra:</hi> neither will there be any end of theſe Doubts, and Scruples, unleſs they are Burnt up with the moſt Lively Fire of an <hi>Ardent</hi> Mind. For here Queſtions are wont to be made of the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of Providence, of the <hi>Series</hi> of Fate, of ſudden, and unexpected Accidents, of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50573:98"/>
the Divine Knowledge, and Predeſtination, of the Liberty of the Will: And of how great Weight ſuch Queſtions are, Thou thy ſelfe art not unſenſible. But becauſe the Knowing of theſe things is a part of the <hi>Medicine</hi> which thy Diſtemper requires, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am much ſtreightned with the ſhortneſs of Time, yet I ſhall endeavour to ſay ſomewhat in Anſwear to the Deep Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion thou haſt propos'd. But though thou art much taken with the ſweet <hi>Harmony</hi> of our Verſes, thou muſt defer this Pleaſure a little while, 'till I ſhall have made a due, and orderly Contexture of ſuch Reaſons, as tend to the Solution of thy Doubts. Do as thou thinkſt fit, ſaid I. Then as if ſhe paſt to another Subject, thus ſhe Diſcourſt. The Generation of All things, and All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Changeable Natures, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has any kind of Motion, receiveth it's Cauſes, Order, Formes from the Stability of the <hi>Divine Mind.</hi> Which remaining Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and Immovable in the Hight of it's own <hi>Simplicity</hi> doth Aſſign a Manifold, and Variable Manner of Proceeding to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs here below. Which Manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50573:99"/>
whilſt it is Beheld in the Purity of the <hi>Divine Intelligence,</hi> is called PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDENCE: but when it is refer'd to the things that it Moveth, and Diſpoſeth, the <hi>Antients</hi> gave it the name of FATE. That theſe Two do differ thus from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, it will eaſily appear, if any man ſhall conſider the Importance of each of them. For <hi>Providence</hi> is that Divine Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeated in the SOVERAIGN LORD of the Whole Creation, which Diſpoſeth All things: but <hi>Fate</hi> is that Diſpoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent in things Movable, by which <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> Embraceth them All at once, though they are Divers, though they are Infinite: But Fate puts them into their ſeveral Ranks, according to Motion, Places, Formes, and Times: ſo that the Unfolding of the Order of things in <hi>Time,</hi> being <hi>Simple,</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided in the Proſpect of the Divine Mind, is called <hi>Providence:</hi> but the ſame <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or <hi>Simplicity,</hi> being as it were Sever'd, and Unfolded in the Succeſſions of Time, is called <hi>Fate.</hi> Though theſe Two are Divers, yet one depends on the other. For the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Fate</hi> proceeds from the Simplicity of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50573:99"/>
                     <hi>Providence.</hi> For the <hi>Artificer</hi> perceiving in his Mind the Form, or Faſhion of the thing, he is about to Make, begins to Effect what he has Contriv'd; and what he <hi>Saw</hi> all at once in his Mind, he Works out at Divers Times with his Hands: So GOD by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> Diſpoſeth All things at once firmly, and Unalterably: but by <hi>Fate</hi> theſe ſame things, which He hath Diſpos'd, He Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageth in a <hi>Manifold,</hi> and <hi>Variable</hi> Manner. Whether therefore <hi>Fate</hi> be exercis'd by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Divine Spirits, Attending upon <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> or by the whole Courſe of Nature, or by the Motions of the Stars &amp;c. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is manifeſt that <hi>Providence</hi> is the <hi>Immovable,</hi> and <hi>Simple Form</hi> of things to be Done: but that <hi>Fate</hi> is the <hi>Movable</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, and <hi>Temporal</hi> Order of thoſe things, which <hi>Divine Simplicity</hi> hath Ordain'd. Whence it comes to paſs, that All things, which are under <hi>Fate,</hi> are ſubject alſo to <hi>Providence</hi>; which <hi>Fate</hi> it ſelfe is ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

Whence it comes to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50573:101"/>
paſs, that although to you, who come ſhort of the right Apprehenſion of Order, All things may ſeem to be turned upſide down, never the leſs this <hi>Manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> Aſſigned to them by <hi>Providence</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to the <hi>True Good.</hi> For even <hi>Wicked men</hi> themſelves never propoſe <hi>Evill,</hi> as the End of any of their Actions: who, as hath been ſhown at large, are turn'd out of the way by their own <hi>Wicked Error,</hi> but ORDER Proceeding from the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Soveraign Good</hi> makes not any man to Decline from It's own ORIGINAL. But, thou wilt ſay, what worſe Confuſion can there be than this, that ſometimes Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and ſometimes Proſperity ſhould happen to the Righteous, and alſo that the Wicked ſhould ſometimes Attein to that, which they Deſire, and be ſometimes Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with that which they would Avoid? what then, do men ſhew ſuch perfect Strength of Judgement, and Integrity of Heart in their Lives and Converſation, that thoſe whom they Judge to be Righteous, or to be Wicked muſt needs be ſuch, as they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem them to be? But we ſee the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50573:101"/>
of men Differ in nothing more than in this: and thoſe who are eſteem'd by ſome to deſerve a Reward, are by others eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of the ſevereſt Puniſhment. But let us grant that any one could clearly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine who are Righteous, and who are Wicked: what then, would he be able to Diſcern the <hi>Inmost Temper,</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of Soules, as we uſe to expreſs it, when we ſpeak of Bodies? For to one that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it not, 'tis no leſs wonder; why to ſome Healthy Bodies Sweet things are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, to others Bitter things: Why ſome Diſeaſes are Cur'd with ſoft, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Medicines, others with thoſe, which are moſt ſharpe, and piercing: But it is no whit ſtrange to the Phyſitian who ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into the ſtate, and Condition of <hi>Bodies</hi> both in Health, and in Sickneſs. And what is the Health of Soules but Virtue, or <hi>True Goodneſs?</hi> what is their <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> but <hi>Vice?</hi> But who is there, that can either give that which is <hi>Good</hi> for us, or drive away that which is <hi>Evill,</hi> but GOD, the Governour, and <hi>Phyſitian of Soules?</hi> who looking from the High Tower of his <hi>Providence</hi> Sees what
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50573:102"/>
the Inward Condition of Every man doth require, and Applies that which He Sees to be Requiſite, and Suitable to his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence it is that the <hi>Order of Fate</hi> is ſuch Matter of wonder, and Aſtoniſhment to the World, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Ignorant Men</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be Amus'd at that which is Done by the <hi>Infinitely Wiſe</hi> GOD. For that I may lightly touch at a few things, which Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon is ſomewhat capable of being exercis'd about, concerning the <hi>Divine</hi> DEPTH: As for this man whom thou thinkeſt to be moſt Obſervant of Law, and Equity, the contrary is moſt Evident to <hi>Providence</hi> that Knoweth All things. And My <hi>Lucan</hi> ſaith that
<q>The Cauſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour was Pleaſing to the GODS, but of the Conquer'd to Cato.</q>
Whatſoever then thou mayſt ſee at any time to be Done here upon Earth, there is certainly a Right Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Things themſelves; but thine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning them is Perverſe, and Confus'd: But ſuppoſe there be any one ſo ſyncerely Virtuous that he is both Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to GOD, and Approv'd of Men: yet, it may be, he wants a Courageous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50573:102"/>
Spirit: to whom if any Adverſity ſhould happen, perhaps he will no longer take care to preſerve his Innocency, by which he could not retein his Fortune. Therefore the Wiſedome of the Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation deals Gently with him, whom Adverſity might incline to Wickedneſs, that he may not be Affiicted, who is not Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed to Endure Affiiction. Another hath Attein'd to the Perfection of All Virtue, an Holy Perſon, Fully <hi>Partaking of the Divine Nature,</hi> the All-wiſe GOD Judges that it would be contrary to the Rules of Juſtice, that this man ſhould be toucht with any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, ſo that He does not ſuffer ſuch a man to be Affiicted even with any <hi>Bodily</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. For as one, more Excellent than I, Sayes '<gap reason="foreign">

But many times it comes to paſs that the chiefe Management of things is by <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> put into the Hands of <hi>Good men,</hi> that Abounding Wickedneſs may be repreſt. To others the <hi>Supream Wiſedome,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> diſtributeth a Medley of Pleaſing, and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things According to the Temper and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their <hi>Soules:</hi> ſome He Curbs,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50573:103"/>
and Reſtrains leaſt they grow Wanton by long Proſperity: others He makes to ſuffer <hi>Hardſhip,</hi> that by the Uſe, and Exerciſe of <hi>Patience</hi> they may be confirm'd in All Virtue, and ſtrength of Mind. Others are too Fearful of that, which they are Able to Endure: others are too apt to make light of that, which they are not Able to Endure. Theſe men that they may Know themſelves He brings into Adverſity. Some have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chac'd a Venerable Name in this World at the Price of a Glorious Death. Some being Undanted in the greateſt Torments have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to others an Example of this Truth, that Virtue is Invincible in any Calamity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: which how rightly, and Orderly it comes, and how it tends to the Good of thoſe, whom we ſee to labour under it, may not be doubted. This alſo, that ſometimes Sad things befall the Wicked, ſometimes they have the things that they Wiſh for, doth proceed from the ſame Cauſes. No man wonders at this, that Sad things ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them, whom every one Judges to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo Ill. Whoſe Puniſhments are a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to others that they may not be guilty of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50573:103"/>
the like Offences, and they conduce to the Amendment of thoſe, upon whom they are Inflicted: But the Proſperity of the Wicked is a clear Demonſtration to thoſe that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Virtue, what they are to Judge of that kind of Happineſs which they ſee to Attend upon the Worſt of men. And here I conceive this alſo to be the Tendency of the Divine Diſpenſation, that ſome men are Naturally ſo Head-ſtrong, and Violent in their wayes, that the want of Mony would excite them to commit the greateſt Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>Providence</hi> by diſtributing Riches to ſuch kind of Perſons applies a Remedy to their Diſtemper. This man obſerving his Conſcience Defil'd with all manner of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, and comparing Himſelfe with His Fortune, is perhaps ſtruck with a Fear leaſt the Loſs of that ſhould be extream Grievous, the Enjoyment whereof is ſo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome unto him: therefore he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelfe to a New Courſe of Life, and whilſt he Fears that his Fortune ſhall be Taken from him, he makes ſpeed to Depart from his Iniquity. Others are ſuddenly brought to their Deſerved Ruine by the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50573:104"/>
Proſperity they have Abus'd. Some are permitted to have the Power of Inflicting Puniſhment for the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of Good men, and the <hi>Vexation</hi> of the Wicked. For as there is no League between the Lovers of Virtue, and the Slaves of Vice; ſo theſe Slaves of Vice can never Agree amongſt themſelves. How ſhould it be otherwiſe? their Conſciences being torn in peeces by the Fury of their vile Affections, they Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Their own Minds, and often Do thoſe things, which when they have Done, they Determine that they ought not in any Caſe to have Done ſuch things. Whence it is that the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> hath often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd this great Miracle, that even Wicked men make other Wicked men to become Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. For whilſt ſome Unrighteous Perſons ſeem to themſelves to ſuffer moſt Unjuſtly by thoſe that are as Bad as themſelves, or Worſe; Burning with Indignation againſt thoſe, who have dealt ſo Injuriouſlly with them, they return to the wayes of Virtue, whilſt they endeavour to render themſelves Unlike to thoſe, againſt whom they have conceiv'd ſuch Hatred. For 'tis only the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50573:104"/>
Power of the ALMIGHTY to which <hi>Evils</hi> become <hi>Good,</hi> whilſt by the uſe He makes of them He draweth forth ſome <hi>Good Effect.</hi> For a certain Order Embraceth All things, ſo that whatſoever hath ſwerv'd from that Courſe, which by Providence was <hi>Primarily</hi> or <hi>Antecedently</hi> Aſſign'd unto it, it falls ſtill within the Compaſs of Order, leaſt any Chance, or Temerity ſhould have any thing to do in the Kingdome of Providence. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>DOST thou not ſee now what is the Conſequence of all that I have ſaid. What, quoth I? That Every Fortune, or Outward Condition [as it comes from GOD] is Good. How is that, ſaid I? obſerve what I ſay, quoth ſhe, ſith Every Condition being either <hi>Pleaſing,</hi> or <hi>Grievous,</hi> comes for the <hi>Rewarding,</hi> or <hi>Exerciſing</hi> of Good men; or elſe for the <hi>Puniſhing,</hi> or <hi>Reforming</hi> of the Wicked; whatſoever it is, it muſt needs be Good, which, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, is the Inſtrument either of the <hi>Divine Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>Mercy.</hi> The Reaſon thou giveſt, ſaid I, is moſt true: And if I conſider <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> and <hi>Fate,</hi> which thou didſt ſhew me a little while ſince, this Concluſion is moſt Firm, and Irrefragable. But if thou wilt, let us put it into the number of thoſe Poſitions, which, as thou ſaydſt a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are contrary to the Common Opinion. How ſo, quoth ſhe? Becauſe quoth I, this
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50573:107"/>
ſpeech is often in the Mouthes of men, that ſome have Ill Fortune. Wilt thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaid ſhe, that we yeild a little to the ſpeeches of the Vulgar, leaſt we ſeem to go too far from the Uſe and Cuſtome of Mankind. As thou thinkeſt fit, ſaid I. Doſt thou not then judge that to be Good, which is <hi>Profitable?</hi> yea ſurely, ſaid I. But that Fortune, which either <hi>Exerciſeth,</hi> or <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth</hi> is <hi>Profitable.</hi> True, ſaid I. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is Good. Who can deny that? But this belongs to them who being either Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht in Virtue make War with Affliction; or being Convinc'd of the Miſery that comes on them by their Vices Break forth into the way of Virtue. I cannot but Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this, ſaid I. But what, a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Condition, which is given as a Reward to Good men, do the Vulgar eſteem it to be <hi>Evill?</hi> In no wiſe: but, as it is, they judge it to be <hi>Exceeding Good.</hi> What of the other Condition, which, ſith it is <hi>Sharpe,</hi> and <hi>Grievous,</hi> is for the Reſtraining of the Wicked by Juſt Puniſhment, do they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be <hi>Good?</hi> Nay, quoth ſhe, they judge it to be moſt Miſerable. See then, if
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50573:107"/>
following even the Opinion of the Vulgar we have not Prov'd ſomewhat very contrary to the Common Opinion? what, ſaid I? For from thoſe things, ſaid ſhe, which have been granted, it muſt of neceſſity be infer'd that to Thoſe who have Attein'd to the Full Poſſeſſion of Virtue, or have made ſome <hi>Progreſs</hi> towards it, or are Really <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd</hi> therunto, Every <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>Good</hi>; but to Thoſe, who remain in their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Every <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>Exceeding Evill.</hi> This is true, ſaid I, though ther's hardly any one, that dares Acknowledge it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaid ſhe, A Wiſe man ought not to be Troubled, when he is to Fight with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as it becomes not a Stout Souldier to be any way diſturb'd when the <hi>Trumpet</hi> ſounds an <hi>Alarm.</hi> For Hardſhip, and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is to the one an Occaſion of enlarging his Renown, to the other of improving his Wiſedome. And hence it is that <hi>True Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in the Hearts of Men is called VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUE, becauſe it's <hi>Virtue, Power,</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> is ſuch, that it can never be Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by any <hi>Adverſity.</hi> For being Plac'd on the Borders of Virtue, you are not come

hither to indulge to your vain Deſires, and to loſe your ſtrength in the Enjoyment of Senſual Pleaſures; but here you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your ſelves for a Fierce Encounter with Both Fortunes, that you may not be <hi>Caſt down</hi> by Adverſity, nor <hi>Corrupted</hi> by Proſperity. Stick to the <hi>Mean</hi> with all your Force. Whatſoever is beneath it, or goes beyond it, implies a Contempt of True Happineſs, gives you not any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for all your Labours. 'Tis put to your Choice, what kind of Fortune you would rather have. For whatſoever ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be <hi>Grievous,</hi> if it do not <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> or <hi>Reform,</hi> it <hi>Puniſheth.</hi>
