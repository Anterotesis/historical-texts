            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat you may have a full Sence and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Indictment, and what what enſued thereupon, it is neceſſary to acquaint you with all the Circumſtances of the laſt Pole, upon the Election of Members to ſerve in Parliament for the Town and Bourough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> from whence the pretence for this Indictment was taken.</p>
            <p>The Pole began on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the tenth of <hi>February 1680.</hi> and continued until <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, full five days.</p>
            <p>The Candidates were Sir <hi>Richard How,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peter Rich,</hi> on one part; <hi>Slingsby Bethel,</hi> and <hi>Edward Smith,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> on the other part.</p>
            <p>The place of Pole was the Old <hi>Artillery-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> which is Aſcended out of the <hi>Artillery</hi> Ground, by ſix or eight large Stone ſteps, with two half Spaces, the uppermoſt at the entrance into the Houſe, being Baniſtered about, is ſo Capacious, as will hold a hundred perſons or more.</p>
            <p>The method of Poling was by filling the Houſe, from the doors that open upon the half Space, then ſhutting them, until they within were all Poled, and let out at a back door, and ſo filling the Houſe again.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt half Space, was planted one <hi>Sam Sams,</hi> a known Hector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Carr-man, and two water men of the largeſt ſize, fetched from <hi>Lambeth,</hi> or there abouts.</p>
            <p>Theſe men obſtructed coming up to the Pole-Houſe, all ſuch as they knew, or ſuſpected were Friends to <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> to the hurting ſome; diſcouraging others, and cauſing many to go away.</p>
            <p>This rudeneſs was ſeveral times complained of to Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> who kept in the Pole-Houſe, but being preſſed to endeavour to reform this diſorder, at laſt, and on the fourth day of the Pole, he went along with thoſe that fetched him, but found then upon the forementioned ſteps, no more in that Hectoring poſture as was repreſented to him, than <hi>Sam Sams,</hi> and <hi>Robert Maſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> aapplying himſelf firſt to <hi>Maſon,</hi> asked him in a milde and Civil manner if he had a right to Pole? and upon his denyal that he had, deſired him to withdraw, and not diſturb the Peace, and ſo took him by the Arm (he having a wide Camlet Coat over his Red Coat) and led him gently down, who followed without reſiſtance (or any ſuch Dialogue, as is falſly ſuggeſted to have paſſed betwixt them,) and went quietly away.</p>
            <p>After this Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> asked <hi>Sam Sams</hi> the ſame Queſtion as he had done his Companion <hi>Maſon,</hi> who anſwering that he had a right to Pole, took him by the hand, and led him in at the back door to Pole, at which <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> ſeemed diſpleaſed, though <hi>Rich</hi> did cunningly ſpeak to him, to Pole for <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> intending (as may well be ſuppoſed) that he ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:46503:3"/>
thereby defend himſelf, againſt <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Smiths</hi> Complaint, of his rude and diſorderly Cariage; but the Dull Fellow, not apprehending the meaning of it, Poled for <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now this being all the ground there was for an Indictment, one that pulls another by the Sleeve to ſpeak with him, may as well be Indicted for ſo doing, as Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> was for what he did.</p>
            <p>Having this occaſion to take notice of the manner and way of Poling in <hi>Southwark,</hi> I cannot but upon the whole obſerve, That the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of lye (at the times of Poling) under great oppreſſion, in the expence of five or ſix days, when fewer hours might ſerve the turn, could the Bayliff be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, to follow the example of <hi>London,</hi> (where double the number of True Electors in <hi>Southwark,</hi> are Poled in four hours) by having ſeveral Writers and Pole-Books, eſpecially the <hi>Artillery</hi> Houſe being ſo convenient for the purpoſe, as nothing can be more, and the benefit in putting this in practice, is backed with theſe Cogent Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Induſtrious ſort of Inhabitants will hereby ſave the attendance of four or five days.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe the doors of the Pole-Houſe ſtanding open, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple underſtanding, that every one in three or four hours will be diſpatched, it will prevent Quarrelling and Rudeneſs in coming to the Pole, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Factious Perſons, from ſending for Hectoring Fellows, to eſpouſe a particular Party, in oppoſition to all others, as was done the laſt Pole.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Candidates will hereby be prevented, in Raking the Priſons, Hoſpitals, Almes-Houſes, and Streets, for Beggers, and the adjacent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood for neceſſitous perſons, to the ſwelling the number of Electors to above double of what they really are, as was done the two laſt Poles; the firſt having Poled near fourthouſand, and the latter above three thouſand; whereas there are not in all above eighteen or nineteen hundred in the Bourough, that have a right to Pole, whereof we found the laſt Pole, by Examination of the Church-Books, no more to appear than thirteen hundred, that payed to the Poor, the reſt being abated by Widdows, Aged, Sick and Abſent Perſons: of which number of thirteen hundred, <hi>How</hi> had five hundred eighty ſix, <hi>Rich</hi> five hundred eighty three, <hi>Bethel</hi> ſeven hundred and three, and <hi>Smith</hi> ſeven hundred and ſixteen; ſo that though by the Pole at large, <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> had near three hundred more than <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> theſe two latter, upon a true account, had near one hundred and thirty more than the two former, as may be obſerved by the above mentioned Numbers.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe ſo long as this method of Poling is continued, the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough of <hi>Southwark</hi> will never be truely repreſented in Parliament; the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates that live upon the place, being always able to make their Numbers by illegal Polers, as great as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Antiently, and in the memory of ſome living, none were admitted to the Election, but ſuch as by their Taxes appeared to be the moſt Subſtantial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, which was acquieſced in without Poling; but of late that way is not only by the Bayliff, increaſed to all that pay to the Poor, (againſt which none can object) but even to all that will but ſay they are Houſe-Keepers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which notion it is, that the true Electors are abuſed.</p>
            <p>This Fraud hath been complained of to two Parliaments, but both Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before buſineſs came to Hearing, otherwiſe it is more than probable it would have been Reformed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46503:3"/>The laſt Election, <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> being ſenſible that there was no Poling for them againſt all the Beggars in the Town, they with many Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, propounded to the Bayliff, to Pole by the Poors Books, and to convince him of the reaſonableneſs thereof, delivered him the Opinions of two Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants at Law, and one Bencher, under their own hands, that none had right to Pole, ſave ſuch as at leaſt paid to the Poor, and alſo inforced this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the Votes of the Commons in Parliament, in the Caſe of other Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, fully to the ſame effect: But though the Bayliff confeſſed it was but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it ſhould be ſo, yet he would not be prevailed with, to do that which he owned to be reaſonable; from whence it is, that the Burrough hath not had in the two laſt Parliaments Repreſentatives, which have been duly Choſen by true Electors. And thus much may ſuffice at preſent, to ſhew the irregular, and unjuſt way of Election of Members to ſerve in Parliament, for the Town and Burrough of <hi>Southwark.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am Councel for the King againſt <hi>Slignsby Bethel,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> You underſtand the Iſſue you are to Try, it hath been opened: the queſtion is, Whether Mr. <hi>Slingsby Bethel</hi> be Guilty of this Battery, and the matter contained in the Indictment, and the Agravating words therein, or no. The occaſion was, that in <hi>March</hi> laſt, there was an an Election for two Burgeſſes, to be choſen to ſerve in Parliament, for this Burrough; this <hi>Robert Maſon</hi> was deſired to come from <hi>Lambeth,</hi> to ſee whether any of that Pariſh came to Pole, which had no Right ſo to do. The Competitors were Sir <hi>Richard How,</hi> Captain <hi>Rich, Slingsby Bethel,</hi> and <hi>Edw. Smith,</hi> Eſquiers, Mr. <hi>Slingsby Bethel,</hi> ſhewed at his entrance into the Burrough what Inclination and Temper he came with, for his Followers, and ſuch as came with him, came with their God-Damme's, and ſeveral execrable Oaths againſt thoſe that Voted againſt him; after the Election began, and the Pole demanded, truly then Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> Acted his part, and took occaſion to go off from the place where he was, and ſtrike ſeveral Perſons that were Acting againſt him, particularly this <hi>Robert Maſon,</hi> finding him to be againſt him, took
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46503:5"/>
his Cane, and knocked him over the Pate, and afterward knowing him to be Kings Waterman, ſaid he deſerved to have his Coat pluck'd over his Ears; were the affront againſt him as a ſingle perſon, it were not of ſo bad Conſequence, but we are to take notice of the Solemnity of the occaſion of the Meeting, now conſider the occaſion, it was for the chuſing of Parliament men, and had it not been for the prudence of the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in forbearing to ſtrike again, God knows the effects, and what an uproar it might have occaſioned: but he prudently refrained, and took his Courſe in a Legal way, and according to Law hath preferred this Indictment againſt Mr. <hi>Slingsby Bethel.</hi> Now though the ſaid Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> be ſo great a man, and a perſon of value, lately Sheriff of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and he <hi>Robert Maſon,</hi> appearing to be but a poor Waterman, yet I don't queſtion, he will find an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jury to do him right.</p>

               <p>I am of Councel for Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> the Defendant, who has been, and ſtands Indicted for making an Aſſault and Battery upon <hi>Robert Maſon,</hi> and for ſpeaking many menacing and threatning Words, as <hi>that he would pull his Coat over his Ears,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And for giving ſeveral blows</hi>; unto which, we have Pleaded <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> They have produced ſeveral Witneſſes, and <hi>Robert Maſon</hi> himſelf, (who is ſo thorow-ſtitch in the Caſe) that he ſwears ſo, as no one can believe him, for his own Witneſſes do not; for they do not Swear, nor pretend to Swear like him, being not able to ſtretch at that rate; he is deſperately miſtaken, to ſpeak the beſt of him.</p>
               <p>For this <hi>Maſon</hi> Swears Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> gave him Twenty blows at leaſt, but how many more he cannot ſay; ſee how this will look, when we ſhall prove (by Subſtantial and Credible Men) that not one blow was given, or puſh either; but ſuppoſe he were puſht, yet his Evidence agree not one with another; for ſome ſwear to one puſh, ſome to more; but Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> ſwears to the full number of Twenty blows at leaſt, and that poſitively, but how many more he doth not remember. But ſuppoſe it were ſo, yet the matter is not ſo much, but what may be juſtified by the occaſion given, and what would be a good Plea in Law, in an Action, will be the ſame upon Pleading not Guilty, in this Caſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The occaſion of Mr. <hi>Bethels</hi> coming here, was this, being about the Chuſing of Parliament men for this Burrough, the Competitors were Sir <hi>Richard How,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>; there was a Houſe wherein they appointed to Pole, called the Artillery-Houſe: When they came to take the Pole at this place, where there is a pair of ſtairs which leads to the door, the manner of taking the Pole was thus, firſt to fill the Houſe, by that door to the ſtairs, and after they had Voted to put them out at the other door; this being the occaſion of the Battery (however agravated) will to all that know it, or ſhall take the matter into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſeem a very ſhameful thing, to ground an Indictment upon. But this <hi>Maſon,</hi> a very officious man, who had no Right to Pole, (as himſelf confeſſes) and who might have ſpared the trouble (for any Authority he had) of coming there, and it might have been better he had ſtaied at home, by what he has Sworn, this man and one <hi>Sam Sams,</hi> a Hectoring Carr-man, were ſet upon the ſtairs; and their buſineſs was not (as they now pretend) to take notice who were fit to Pole, but to underſtand who were for Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smyth,</hi> and thoſe they did abuſe, and puſh them down the ſteps, which Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> being informed of, came out of the Houſe, and ſpake Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy to them, and ſaid, <hi>Friends what have you to do here, if you have not a Right to Pole come down from the place,</hi> which <hi>Maſon</hi> refuſing, the Defendant took him gently by the hand and led him down the ſteps, giving neither blow nor puſh: we Shall call Witneſſes to prove this,—Now for A Gentleman that ſtood as one of the Competitors for a Parliament Man at that time in that place, he might do this to a Perſon that had nothing to do there, nay they themſelves ſay there ought not to be any Interruption at an Election, and that the Interruption was from themſelves and that occaſioned the mighty Battery they make ſo much of. We ſhall call our Witneſſes, and ſhall make this matter appear to be our Caſe, and then though <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> hath ſpoken of Twenty Blows, if believ'd, as there is but little Reaſon for it, it will be ſufficiently Juſtified by the Witneſs we ſhall Produce, and the Evidence we ſhall give in this matter.</p>

               <p>There were two Men which I ſaw in Red Coats, which puſht down the People that came to Poll for Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> before Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> came; and had not Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> come to appeaſe the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, I do believe there had been much miſchief done by them and <hi>Sams,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Upon the Oath you have taken, were there any blows given?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hatfield.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, there were none.</p>

               <p>Were there any blows given by Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi>?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hatfield.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, not one: for Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> being informed of the incivility of <hi>Maſon</hi> and <hi>Sams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> came Civilly to them, and intreated them to come down, and bid them be gone, and not make a Diſturbance.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lawrence.</speaker>
               <p>I ſaw <hi>Robert Maſon,</hi> and the Party with him, behave themſelves very Civil; and the Diſturbance that was, proceeded from the other Party.</p>

               <p>This is the ſame Man we had but now, he is called to Witneſs again; a pretty way of multiplying Witneſſes: I appeal to Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> himſelf, whether this be not the ſame Man you called once before?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Thompſon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I think the Caſe is plain, and needs no Arguments: I ſhall onely take notice how careful theſe men are (as they pretend) to keep the King's Peace. The matter you ſee, in ſhort, is, Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> (who ſtood for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Man of this place, and at the ſame time bore an Eminent Character, (as Sheriff of the City of <hi>London</hi>) upon Information given of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance made by this <hi>Maſon,</hi> and of the unfairneſs of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, only came Civilly, and took him by the Arm, perſwading him to come away, and make no Diſturbance. And this is the truth of the Caſe, and the mighty Battery they pretend to. Now ſuppoſe, that when People are in ſuch a Crowd, and upon ſuch an occaſion, there were ſome puſhes, (as is the utmoſt here pretended) could this be a ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ground an Indictment upon? No, Gentlemen, no: This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, and the Deſign of it is to raiſe a duſt, and (if poſſible) to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46503:8"/>
caſt Reflections on Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> but 'tis more than they can do in point of Law, by any matter here proved, if <hi>Maſons</hi> Witneſſes do ſwear true; yet you ſee how <hi>Maſon</hi> behaves himſelf, crying <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> ſtriking down all that came between <hi>Sam. Sams</hi> and him; ſo they broke the Peace, and raiſed the Diſturbance themſelves. And in that caſe any Man (and why not Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi>?) might have taken him, and carried him before a Magiſtrate, and have juſtified it. But now, for the Credit of the thing; you ſee none ſwears it but <hi>Maſon</hi> himſelf; but even he ſwears to that Impoſſibility, ſo over-reaches the matter through the exceſs of his Paſſion in ſwearing, that no one can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; if he had ſworn modeſtly, as the reſt did, to two or three puſhes, it might have been Credited; but to twenty blows, no one can believe it; neither doth any one of his own Witneſſes ſwear like him, or of ſo much as one blow given: So there is not one word <hi>Maſon</hi> ſaith can be Credited.</p>
               <p>Then, my Lord, admit it be ſo; yet you ſaw M. <hi>Bethel</hi> was not the Perſon that firſt began this Diſturbance; now if the other Party had been Indicted and Tryed, (as indeed it had been much more fit they ſhould) we could have proved much againſt them.—</p>
               <p>And as to the Fact and manner of what Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> did, it was no more than coming in a civil manner, asking whether he had a right to Poll? when he ſaid no, he took him civilly by the Arm and led him down; and this is a Juſtifiable aſſault, being the Nature of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a neceſſity of ſomewhat of Action in it. I appeal to you of the Jury, whether here be any Cauſe for this Indictment, or colour of Reaſon for you to find it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Holt.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the Evidence on both ſides, and the queſtion is, Whether, in your Conſciences, you can diſ-believe Eight Witneſſes, that ſwear poſitively to the Battery, and believe thoſe Witneſſes that did not ſee it? if you acquit Mr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> you muſt neceſſarily Convict Eight Perſons of Perjury: But if you do not find for Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> the other Witneſſes cannot be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of Perjury; for how can Men ſwear, (though they were there all the time) that they did not ſee? poſſibly they may be very honeſt Men, and preſent at the time, and yet not ſee <hi>Bethel</hi> ſtrike, and ſo not ſwear to it: But our Witneſſes ſwear very true; I hope you will be guided by Senſe and Conſcience, and not by Spectators humours, and apprehenſions, that come here and hiſs in a Court of Juſtice: Now Eight Witneſſes ſwearing it, I do appeal to the Court, whether in matters of this Nature, one Witneſs for the Affirmative, be not more valid than many of the Negative?</p>
               <p>They take notice of the impoſſibility, and why, becauſe they ſwear (as they ſay) at an extravagant rate, that Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> gave him Twenty blows.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, If Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> will beat a Man extravagantly, it is not extravagancie to ſwear it: Now <hi>Maſon</hi>'s Evidence is confirmed by all the reſt produced, and no Contradiction: If one ſwear to ten, and another to two, and another to three, is this inconſiſtent? No, Gentlemen, it is Evident thoſe Men ſwear Cautiouſly and Fearfully, for if otherwiſe, they could Swear to as many as Twenty, as <hi>Maſon</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46503:9"/>
hath done: Who is the beſt Judge, he that felt the blows, or they that Swear there was not one given? He that felt them, I am ſure.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, It was in a Crowd, 'tis poſſible they may not ſee all; yet their Evidence is a concurring Circumſtance.</p>
               <p>Next I come to the point of Law, how a Man that is a Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date at an Election, can beat any Man that ſtands in his way; I do not underſtand that to be Law: if any Man had beaten Mr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> he might have beaten him again in his own Defence; but there was no ſuch thing. Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> ſaw no Diſturbance himſelf, but was informed of it, and ſo became too Officious; though he was Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> yet he was not an Officer there; for he was not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable there; and it was a Conſtables Office, and he only could have ſeized him, and not a Conſtable neither, unleſs he had ſeen the Kings Peace broken.</p>
               <p>And as to what Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> ſaith, that it is impoſſible that ſuch an Election ſhould be carried on without ſome buſtle; It's true, in a Crowd Men Juſtling one another, and by accident ſtrike another down, it's no Battery; But is it neceſſary for Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> to thump a a Man on the Breaſt? Is it neceſſary for Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> to beat a Man with his Cane? Is it neceſſary for Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> to give a Man Twenty blows? Is it neceſſary for Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> to pluck a Mans Coat off his Back? Is it neceſſary to an Election? It is not neceſſary, and ſo being not neceſſary, is not by Law Juſtifiable. Gentlemen, as Mr. <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſaith, it is a Caſe of Example; I ſay ſo too; and it is fit Perſons that will do ſuch things, ſhould be made an Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtice Pyrs</hi> afterwards ſummed up the Evidence, and told the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (as Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> the Counſellor for the King had before well obſerved) that they were to have regard to the Poſitive Affirmative Evidence, <hi>Maſon</hi> having ſworn poſitively to ſeveral blows that were ſtruck by Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> and that Eight Witneſſes had ſworn in the Affirmative; and that though there were Seven Witneſſes produced by Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> which were on the Negative part; yet they were to obſerve, that the Law did not allow of thoſe Negative Evidences: But for that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many had Sworn in the Affirmative, that they ſaw a thing done, and as many Swear that they ſaw it not; he could not tell what to ſay, but to leave it to the Jury; ſaying, that one Affirmative was better than Forty Negative Oaths.</p>
               <p>So the Jury went out, and in a very ſhort time were pleaſed to find the Indictment, and brought Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> in Guilty.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi>'s Counſel moved in Arreſt of Judgment, for that no Indictment lay for the Words, and the Court for that Reaſon ſtayed the Judgment, as to that part of the Indictment, and gave Judgment only as to the Aſſault and Battery, and Fined Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> Five Marks. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Counſel for the King moved to have him taken into Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, until he paid the Fine, which he preſently paid, and ſo was Diſcharged.</p>
               <p>THE Crowd was ſo exceeding great, that I could not take this Trial ſo exactly as otherwiſe I ſhould have done, but the Defects are only to the prejudice of Mr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel.</hi>

            <p>HAving as a Preface to this Trial, ſhewn the occaſion of the Indictment, I ſhall here make ſome Obſervations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Proſecution of it.</p>
            <p>And firſt, As to <hi>Maſon,</hi> thoſe that know him beſt, think it as improbable (his Eſtate conſidered) that he ſhould be at the Charge of three Counſel in this buſineſs, as it is that a man of his bulk and temper ſhould tamely receive Twenty blows with a ſtick, without returning one; or be purſued with blows in the preſence of five hundred men, at leaſt, without having it taken notice of by any one beſides himſelf, or eſpecially, that his Partner and Companion, <hi>Sam. Sams,</hi> who ſtood cloſe by him, ſhould not ſee one blow given, as he hath affirmed to one Mr. <hi>Farthing,</hi> his <hi>Southwark</hi> Neighbour, he did not; adding, that he would not forſwear himſelf for all the world. But the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif was not thus alone more than ordinarily concerned; for his Counſel were the ſame, otherwiſe at the opening of the Cauſe, they would not impertinently, and from the matter, have infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi>'s quarrelſome and rude intentions, from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that came firſt into the <hi>Burrough</hi> with him, whom they rendred to be none but debauched <hi>God Dammee's,</hi> though when it was put upon them to declare who they were that ſwore at that rate, they could not inſtance in any, ſave one, whom they deſcribed by his riding firſt, as not daring to name him: And were it true, that ſuch a perſon was in the Company, it was as uncharitable a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> to condemn a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of grave and ſober Citizens, who never were known to be guilty of Swearing or Curſing, for the fault of one man, as it was indecent in them to deſcribe reproachfully a Perſon of great Quality, becauſe they durſt not name him: But to make amends for this, in the Caſe of a fellow Commoner, after a Fine of five Marks was laid upon Mr. <hi>Bethel,</hi> the ſame Counſel moved to have him taken into Cuſtody, until he paid the Money, inſinuating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that otherwiſe he might run away, and defraud the Baliff of his Fine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:46503:10"/>Mr. Recorder not being at the Court, he who in his abſence gave Directions to the Jury, told them, That they had <hi>Maſon</hi>'s poſitive Oath, that One Affirmative was better than Forty Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Oaths, and therefore they muſt either find <hi>Bethel</hi> Guilty, or they would make <hi>Maſon</hi> perjured. Which paſſing for Law with the Jury, they brought him in Guilty of the Aſſault and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</p>
            <p>The Bench being now to ſet the Fine, my Lord Mayor and Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> (conſidering the nature of the Action) thought <hi>3 s. 4 d.</hi> enough, but the reſt were for ſeveral higher Sums, yet at laſt all centred in Five Marks. And thus the whole matter is left to the Reader, to make what Judgment and Concluſions he pleaſeth upon it.</p>
