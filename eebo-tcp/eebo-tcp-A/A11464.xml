            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving now almost fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed my intended course of travell, and comming to cast vp (as it were) the short account of my labours, I shall heere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour briefely to relate what I have observed in the matter of Religion, my time being chiefely imployed (as was from the first my principall designe) in viewing the state thereof in these Westerne parts of the world, their divided factions and professions, their differences in matters of faith, and their exercises of religion, in government Ecclesiasticall, and in life &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what vertues in each kind eminent, what eminent

defects. Moreover, in what termes of opposition, or corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencie each standeth with other, what probabilities, what pollices, what hopes, what iealousies are found in each part for the advauncing thereof: and finally, what pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sibilities and good meanes of vniting, at leastwise the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall braunches of the reformed professours (if vnitie vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall bee more to be desired then hoped in such bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde, &amp; equalitie of forces as leaveth on neither side, either dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to yeeld, or doubt to be va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quished.)</p>
            <p>In the midst of these thoughts not intending to deliver a full report of all these points, which would too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede a reasonable proportion, but restraining my selfe chiefly to such parts and places as may seeme most nessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for one of my Countrey to know.<note place="margin">The Romane Religion</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 FIrst, the Roman Religion, framed in those middle times when there was no man to controll them, did light into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling of such men as made their greatnesse welth and honor, the verie rule to square out the Cannons of faith, and then did set Clearkes on worke to devise Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to maintaine them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Religion seemeth notwithstanding at this day, not so corrupt in the very doctrine (and in their Schooles, where yet manifolde oppositions doe hold them in awe, that hath caused them to refine it) as it is in the practise here of, and in the vsage among themselves, wherein they are so gross: as that sundry men whom the reading of their Bookes hath allured, the view of their Churches hath averted from their partie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 I must omit an endlesse multitude of their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions and ceremonies, for they are enough to take vp a great parte of a mans life to peruse, beeing without vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, and different in diverse Countryes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all so childish and vnsavourie, that as they argue seeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and rawnesse in their inuenters, so can they bring no other then disgrace and contempt to those exercises
<pb facs="tcp:26238:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Religion wherein they are stirring.</p>
            <p n="4">4 How they communicate divine honour to Saints &amp; Angels, by building Churches, erecting Altars, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding prayers, &amp; addressing vowes vnto them, in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their Images, going in pilgrimage to their Reliques, attributing all kind of miracles both to the one &amp; to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will in this place restraine my selfe especially to <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The stateliest &amp; fairest Altars are hers, for the most part, where one prayeth before the Crucifixe, two pray before her Images, where one vowe vnto Christ, tenne vow vnto her, &amp; not so much to her selfe, as to some particular Image of hers, which for some notable power and grace of operation of miracles they chiefly serve, as the glorious Ladie of <hi>Loretto:</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Ladie of <hi>Rome:</hi> the myraculous Lady of <hi>Proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And such as their vowes are, such are their Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages; and to nourish this honour, for one miracle repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be wrought by the Crucifixe, not so fewe, perhaps, as one hundred are voiced vpon those other Images, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I omit this no lesse certaine, though lesse appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that where one fasteth on Friday, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our Lords day, many fast on Saturday which they account our Ladies day, in honour to her. In all which the
<pb facs="tcp:26238:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people do but folow their guides; who, as in the measuring of their devotion by tale on beades, doe string vp ten salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to our Lady, for one of our Lords prayers. So them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also in their Sermons, make their entrance with an <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> yea a solemne divine honour which they have, most commendable, if it were well vsed: that at Sun rising, none, and Sunne setting, vpon the ringing of a bell, all men, in what place soever, house, fielde, streete, or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, doe presently kneele downe, and send vp their vnited devotions to heaven. This honour is by them chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to our Ladie, the devotion is the <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and the bell that ringeth to it, hath also that name. They teach in pulpit, that nothing passeth in heaven without her expresse consent. That the stile of that court, is, <hi>Placet Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae,</hi> that matters of Iustice come properly from Christ, and matters of Grace from her, that it was the vision of a holy man, that certaine that would have beene condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Christ, in regard they were her servants, have bin absolved by her intercession. So the principall streames o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> affiance and love, are diverted from him, and turned vpon those vnto whom so great honour is not due, nor so vndue honour can be acceptable.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Their Liturgies being not vnderstoode by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are not able to holde them occupyed with any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall contemplation: for supply whereof they hold them to their charming with their beades in the meane season, which being so vnsavory a foode as it is, they vse it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: when they are wearie of it, they entertaine the rest of their time with talke and mirth, which their Priestes themselves also at their leisures forbear not, not forgetting yet at certaine pauses to shew devotion, wherein their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward iestures are decent, reverent, and significant. And this honour is to be yeelded to the Italian nation, that hee is naturally not vndevoute, were his devotion duely gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and cherished, and not starved and quenched in the darke mist of a language, which hee neither vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands

what is saide to him, not yet what himselfe say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The best part of their exercises of Religion, are their Sermons, wherein much matter, both of faith and piety is eloquently delivered, by men surely of wonderfull zeale &amp; spirite, if their interior fervor were correspondent to their outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ervencie; how beit they are sometimes mingled with so palpable vanitie (as besides their other poverties, as forced allegories, and vnnaturall interpretations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are fervent,) they have legends of Saints, and tales (at which children with vs would smile) solemnely historized in their Cathedrall Pulpits; yet what religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse soever is the peoples mindes may wholy bee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to their Sermons, whither the better disposed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe resort.</p>
            <p>This one thing I cannot but highly commend in that sort and order: they spare nothing, which either co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And although for the most part, much basenesse and childishnesse is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the maisters and contrivers of their ceremonies, yet this outward state and glorie being well disposed, doth ingender, quicken, increase, and nourish, the inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, respect, and devotion which is due vnto sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne maiesty and power. And therefore, howsoever some will not be perswaded in it, yet in the zeale of the common Lord of all, I chuse rather to commend the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an enemy, then to flatter the vice and imbecility of a friend.</p>
            <p n="7">7 But to returne to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to come to the consideration of their penance and confession, out of which, so great good is promised to the world, and the want thereof so much vpbraided to their opposites. I must confesse I brought with mee this perswasion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that surely in this must needes bee a very great

restraint to wickednesse, a great meanes to bring men to integrity and perfection, when a man shal daily, as it were, survey his actions, censure with griefe, confesse with shame, cure by councel, expiate with punishment, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish with firme intent, never to returne to the like again; whatsoever had defiled or stained the soule, (neither doubt I but it had this fruit in the first institution, &amp; hath also with many at this day, yea and might perhaps have bin restored better in reformed Churches, to ther prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sincerity, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtterly abolished, as in most places it is:) Notwithstanding, having diligently searched into the meaning thereof in those parts, I finde, that as all thinges whereof humane imbecillitie hath the custodie and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, fall away, decaying by insensible degrees, from their first perfection and purity, and gather much soile &amp; drosse in vsing: so this as much as any thing. For this point of their religion, which in outward shewe carrieth a face of severitie and discipline, is become of all others, the most remisse and pleasant, and of the greatest content to the desolutest mindes, the matter being growne with the common sort to this open reckoning; What neede wee refraine so fearefully from sinne, God having provided so ready a meanes to be rid of it when we list? yea, and the worser sort will say; When wee have sinned we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and when wee have confessed, we must sinne againe, that we may also confesse againe, and with all, make work for new indulgences and iubiles; making acount of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, as drunkards do of vomitting: yea, I have knowne of those that carried shew of very devoute persons, who by their owne report, to excuse their acquaintance in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters criminal, have wittingly periured themselves in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only presuming of this present and easie remedy of confession, and others of more ordinarie note amongst them, who when their time of confessing was at hand, would then venture on those actions which before they trembled at, as presuming to surfet, by reason of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood
<pb facs="tcp:26238:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Phisition, which Phisition also himselfe is perhaps more apparantly infected with the noysome disease his patient discloseth, then the patient, who is not anie way bettered by the connsell which the Phisition gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>

            <p>But to touch so much of their lives as shall bee necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for this purpose, and rather the causes then the effects themselves, it is not to bee marvailed, if the glorie of their Religion, (consisting most in outvvard shewe, and the exquisitenesse in the number of intricate dumbe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, if their devotions being not seasoned vvith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding requisite, but prised more by tale then by weight of zeale, if as by the vertue of their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of their actes of pietie, being placed more in the verie massie materialitie of the outvvarde vvorke, then in the puritie of the heart from vvhich they proceede) it is not, I say, to bee marvailed though the fruites also of their conversation bee like vnto those rootes, rather such as may yeelde some reasonable outvvarde obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Lawes, then approove that inwarde integritie and sinceritie of that fountaine from whence they issue.

            <p>And there bee also amongst them, as in all other places, some men of excellent and rare perfection, yet can it not bee dissembled, but that generally the whole Countrey is strongly overflovvne &amp; overcome vvith vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, vvith filthinesse of speech, vvith beastlinesse of actions, both governors &amp; subiects, both priests &amp; Friers, each striving (as it vvere) vvith other in impudencie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, even so farre forth, that vvhat in other places vvoulde not be tollerated, is there in high honor, vvhat elsevvhere even a lose person would be ashamed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes, their priests

and Friers refraine not openly to practise, yea, if any man forbeare the like, they finde it very strange, &amp; hold inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity for little better then seeliness or abiectnesse. I cannot heere forget the saying of an Italian Gentleman of verie good qualitie, but in faction Spanish, at my first entry into <hi>Italy:</hi> namelie that the Italians were excellent men but for three faults they had: in their lust they were vnnaturall; in their malice vnappeasable, and that they would deceive all men. Vnto which he might truly have added; They spend more vpon other men, then vpon themselves, they blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme oftner then sweare, and murther more then revile or slaunder: notwithstanding, this testimony I yeelde, not onely willingly, but gladly to them: (for what ioy could it be to the heart of any man, to see men fall irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verablely from the love and lawes of the Creator:) That at one time of the yeare, (namely at Lent,) they are much reformed, no such blaspheming or durty speaking, their vanities of all sorts reasonablely laid aside, their pleasure abandoned, their apparrell, their diet &amp; all things else co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to austerity &amp; state of penance. They have daily their preaching with collection of almes whereof all men resort: and to iudge of them by the outward shew, they seeme to have generally a great remorce of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: in so much, that I must confesse, I seemed to my selfe in <hi>Italy,</hi> to have learned the right vse of Lent, there first to have discerned the right fruit of it, and the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for which those sages at the first did institute it; neither can I easily accord to the fancies of such (as because wee ought at all times to leade a life worthy of our profession) thinke it therefore superstitious, to have one time wherein to exact or respect it more then another: But rather doe this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that seeing the corruption of the times and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mans nature is now so exorbitant, that a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is, to hold the ordinary sort of men at all times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the lists of piety, iustice, and sobriety, it is fit therefore that their should be one time at least in the yeare, &amp; that

of a reasonable continuance, wherein the season it selfe, the vse of the world, and practife of all men (for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Iewes and Turkes have their Lent, though different) the commaundement of superious, and in some the verie outwarde face and expectation as it were of all thinges, should constraine men (how wicked and retchlesse soever) for that time to recall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to some more severe cogitations and courses, lest sinne having no such Bridle to checke it at anie time, should at length waxe headstrong and vnconquerable in them; that on the other side being thus necessarily invred for a while, at least wise to make a bare shewe of walking in the pathes of vertue, they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes perhaps more sincerelie, and willinglie persist, or at least wise returne more readily vnto them some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. And verily I have sundry times had this cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Italie,</hi> that in great loosenesse of life, and decay of discipline in those partes, it was the speciall great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and grace of God, that the severitie of Lent should be still preserved, least otherwise the flouds of sinne grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so headstrong, and outragious, and having no where, either bound or banke to restraine them; might plunge that whole Nation into such a gulfe of wickednesse, and bring them to that last extremitie, which should leave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither hope for better, nor place for worse: yea &amp; I was so farre from thinking the institution of Lent superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or the restraint in it vnprofitable, that I rather incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to like the custome of the Greeke Church, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their great Lent, have three other Lents also in the yeare, though the other neither so long, nor yet so strict a generall observation.

An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing verie memorable, and to be imitated in <hi>Italie,</hi> is the exceeding good provisions of Hospitals and houses of pietie, for olde Persons enfebled, for poore folkes mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or diseased, for Gentillitie impoverished, for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers distressed, for lewd women converted, for children abandoned, which the devotion of former times have founded and enriched, and this present age dooth verie faithfully &amp; discretly governe, and if it were not for those houses, in the number, goodlynesse, and great revenewes whereof, <hi>Italie</hi> exceedeth anie one Countrey in the world, it might be said to be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But now to come to the view of their Ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, how it is referred to the conduct of soules to their true happinesse (which should be the naturall and

proper end of that regiment, whereof I can say little,) and how it is addressed to the vpholding of their worldly power, and glory of their Order, to the advancing of their part, and overthrow of their opposites, which I suppose to be the chiefe point they now respect; as I thinke it may be truly said, that there was never yet state fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by mans wit in the world, more powerfull and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to worke those effects, never any more wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and plotted, more constantly and diligently put in practise and execution, that if the foundation bee free from vntruth and dishonestie (for rottennesse of heart is an infirmitie which will ruine all strength builded thereon) their outward meanes were sufficient to subdue a whole world. Now as in every Art and Science there are some certaine propositions, vpon the vertue whereof all the rest depend, so in their Art also they have certaine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions which as indemonstrable principles they vrge all to receive &amp; hold in this maner. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In these poynts no doubtes or questions are tolerable And whoso with them ioyne in these, shall find great connivence, in what other defect or difference soever: this being the very touchstone by which all men are to be tried, whether they be in the Church, or out of the Church; whether with them, or against them: and by this plott have their wits erected in this worlde, a Monarchie more potent then ever any that have bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: A Monarchye, which intitling them (<hi>de iure</hi>) to all the world, layeth a strong foundation thereof in all mens conciences, (the onelie firme ground of obedience in the worlde) and such a foundation, as not onely holdeth fast vnto them whatsoever it feazeth on, but worketh out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly also by engines, to weaken, and vndermine the states of all other Princes howe great so ever, and that in such sort, as by possessing themselves of the principall places, the hearts of their subiects (as being those from whome they have their principall good, even the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their soules) to incite vppon everie conscience a gaynest their naturall Soveraigne at pleasure, and by a writte of Excommunication to svbdue, or at leastwise greatly to shake whom they list, without fighting a blow, without leavying a Souldier; &amp; lastly, a Monarchie which as it was founded by meere witte, needeth not anie thing but meere witte to mainetaine it, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth

And all these maintained at other mens charges, for to that rare poynt have they also proceeded, as not onely to have huge rents themselves out of other mens states, but to maintaine also their instruments out of other mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and to advance their favorites, vnder the faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of providing for Religion, to the verie principall preferments in forraine Princes Dominions. That no man need find it strange, if finding the revenew of skill and cunning to be great, and their force mightie, especially what they worke vpon simplicitie, and ignorance. They inclosed in times past all learning within the wals of their Cleargie, setting forth Ladie <hi>Ignorance</hi> for a great Saint to the Laitie, and shewing her vnto them for the true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Devotion.

And seeing that by reason of this bookish age, they have not that helpe of ignorance which in times past they had, they cast about greatly to soake and settle them in mens perswasions and consciences by another way: They tell men, that the very gound whereon we build our perswasion of the truth of Christianity it self, are no other then credible: That the proofes of the Scripture to be the word of God can be no other at this day than probable, onely being impossible for any wit in the world to produce, exact, necessary, and infallible demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Eyther that the holy Apostle Saint <hi>Paule</hi> had his calling from above, or that those Epistles were of his writing, so likewise in the rest, and that the chiefe proofe that we have therof, is the testimony of the church, a thing which their very adversaries are forced to confesse. Now that this probable perswasion of the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity doth afterward grow to an assurednesse therof, this issueth from an inward operation of Gods divine spirit, the gift whereof is faith; and that faith being a knowledge, not of bare science, but of beleefe, which searcheth not the particular necessitie of the veritie of things delivered, but relieth in generall vpon the approoved wisedome, truth and vertue of him that doth deliver it. Then surely, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will have necessarie proofe of the severall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, doth but wittily deceive himselfe, and by over-curious indevour to chaunge his faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to science, doth loose that which he seeketh to perfect:

If then without faith there is no possibly of Salvation, this surely must needes be the hie way to perdition.

Their Church long since by her rules, and some of great reckoning amongst them, more lately by their writings have published &amp; preached to al the world, that faith given to heretikes is not to be kept; that leagues with them are more honourable in their breaking, then in their making, denying that right vnto Princes of Christian profession, which Christians vnto Heathens, Heathens one to another, of how different religion soever; yea al hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable princes vnto very traitors &amp; rebels, have alwaies kept vnviolable.

            <p>Hope is a sweet and firme conpanion of man, it is the last thing that leaveth him, and the highest things it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth him, it maketh all toiles supportable, all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties conquerable. Now the multitude of these Orders, and good provision for them being so great an ease to all sorts of men in their private estates, as they generally account it: It must needs be a great bond of their affection vnto the Papacie, vnder which they enioy it, as by whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone those Orders are protected, and whom his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do seeke vtterly to exterminate &amp; ruine. I shall speake little of the particular persons that enter into those Orders who draw thereby their whole race the more to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that way (which in so infinite a number of them must needs be of great moment.) Against this might be obiected with great reason, the inestimable damage which the publike do therby receive, as in <hi>Italy</hi> for example, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps halfe of the land in many places therof, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a full third, besides their other vailes, being appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this sort of people, and other persons ecelesiasticall, yea and of the people themselves, perhaps a quarter of a million at least in that one Countrey, having withdrawne themselves thereby from all service of Prince, or people, or Countrey, and confined themselves to their Cloysters life, living onely vpon the honie, which the toyling Bee doth gather, with perhappes an other quarter of a million of an other sect (I may erre in both numbers,

            <p n="22">22 But the benefite which the Papacie doth draw from these Friars consisteth in this point, accommodating and yeelding content. It stands in the multitude of harts, of tungues, and pennes (dispersed in all countries, but vnited in his service) of men of most furie, and furious zeale, who with incessant industry and resolutenes incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, give over no travell, leave no exploit so difficult or desperate vnattempted for the vphoulding of the Papacie, and advancing of that religion.

And although all Friars (being of so divers mettall) are not able to play their parts so naturally, and with such perfection as some that I have seene, yet beeing trained vp in the same schoole, they all hold one course: and certainely by their dealing with men at single hand in private by particular applyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, (which though they vse not continually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet doe they not neglect it whensoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

together with another <hi>Iacobine</hi> for the same crime. And vvhat may it be thought these men vvould not do, being commanded by their Generals, vvhom they have vovved to obey? And in the Popes necessarie service, and vvith his expressed desire, vvho are carried vvith so desperate rage and furie against vvhatsoever impediments their bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, vvithout vvarrant of higher authority present vnto them, and is in violent attempts to be executed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: they are men resolved, and hardly, as having no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity to be oppressed by their ruine, (which of all other things doth most containe men in duetie,) So in exciting the multitude of sedition or tumult in favor of their cause, and of their Catholike religion, they are as sedulous and secret, vsing opportunitie of confession to practise the vulgar, with annexing such conditions to the absolutions they give them, as the turne they intend to serve, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. A point very memorable, in weighing the manifold fruites which at this day that Sacrament beareth for the Papacie, as hath beene discovered at <hi>Paris</hi> that certaine Confessours, having taken a solemne promise of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, that they would live and die in the Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yea and die for it also, if neede shall require, have enioyed them therevpon, to oppose by all meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the verefying of the Kings Edictes for the Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.

            </p>
            <p n="24">24 But amongst many other points to bee regarded in these Friars, the very multitude it selfe seemeth to mee to be one, not of the least confederation, if the Papacy being reduced to any termes of extreamity, should resolve to put them in armes for their finall refuge and succour. The <hi>Franciscans</hi> alone in the time of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> their fellowe and Father, are said to have beene found by survey to bee thirtie thousand. the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> a late branch of them, doe vaunt to be eight thousand at this present. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> strive in competency with the <hi>Franciscans</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:26238:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in all things. The <hi>Iesuites</hi> being great statists, are withall, exceeding rich, and many: but for the greedinesse of wealth, and rare practises to get it, infamous in all places. The <hi>Garmelitanes</hi> and <hi>Augustines,</hi> have their hives in every garden, and everywhere swarme. The other orders of Friars and Monkes, being exceeding many, complaine not of paucity in their severall professions. In some other Countries they are sowen, but <hi>Italy</hi> is thicke strowed with this kind of people, whose number perhaps in the whole, may passe a million of men, of the which, one halfe at the least, eyther are, or would grow to be of lusty able bodies not vnfit to be soone imployed in any warlike service: if the Pope having played away the rest of his pollicies, were brought to his last hand, to set vp his rest vpon those men, what should hinder him from raising huge armies of them in all places? their course of life, perhaps their vowes and profession, whereof himselfe hath the key to locke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at pleasure may breed vnwillingnesse of minde, or backwardnesse of such actions, which canot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them that know their eagernesse of spirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider withall, their standing with his estate, and falling with his ruine. Then for their vnaptnesse and vndisposition of bodie, their fasting, watching, lving on the ground, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cold, exact keeping of orders and obedience to their commanders, ought to make them fit to all military dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. Then for the difficultie of assembling them in such case together. Heere needs must I speake of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnesse of their order and government, being such as needeth not yeelde to any. I know to that purpose, each order hath his <hi>Generall</hi> residing at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the most part, to advise with the Pope, and to receive his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from him, which being men of great reputation &amp; power, are chosen though in shew indifferently by all the Maisters, that is, Doctors of their order whatsoever: yet in election it is so finely and cunningly contrived, that the voices of <hi>Italy</hi> are farre predominant, even as in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
<pb facs="tcp:26238:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Pope, the <hi>Italian</hi> Cardinals; so in their moderne generall counsels, the <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops doe farre exceed all the rest of Christendome; that so the safetie of the papall sea, &amp; the greatnesse of <hi>Rome,</hi> may rest assured.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Generals</hi> have vnder them their Provincials as Lieutenants in every province or state in Christendome. The Provincials have vnder them the severall Priors of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. And those their companies. A commandement dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht away from the <hi>Generall,</hi> passeth roundly by the Provincials to the Priors with all speed, being received by the inferiours, they addresse themselves to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; yea though it commaund them a voyage to <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> or <hi>Peru,</hi> without dispute or delay they readily set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. To argue or debate on their superiors Mandates, were presumption, proud curiosity to search their reasons; to detract or disobey them, breach of vow, equall to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; So that as in a well disciplined army, the <hi>Generall</hi> guiding, the Souldiers follow; he commaunding, they obey, without further delay or question: So those have no other care than to performe with dexterity, what Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date soever their <hi>General</hi> in the plenitude of his authoritie shall addresse to them. This order, this diligence, this secrecie, this obedience, in a people that may wander without suspicion in all places, and find good reliefe &amp; aid in their passage, wil answere the former obiection. To add the good grace wherin they are generally with the vulgar, the meanes which they have to provide all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with their repositories of Reliques and silver Images, what with Church-place and treasure, wherein some of them are exceedingly rich, and daily increase, vnlesse the world should with generall consent bend against them, it may be (if the times should inforce such imployment) they should be able (being associated with such friendes as they should find) to make a very strong part in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the Pope, especially considering that these forces should be then raised out of their enemies countries, and
<pb facs="tcp:26238:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so weaken them, as bloud drawne out of their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And that no man may deceive himselfe with that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: That in these professors of peace, there is no humor of warre, that minds wholy possessed with sweet contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, can imbrace no thought of bloody resolutions: let him but a little dive into the late French troubles, he shall finde that the militarie companions of the leaguers, were oftentimes even stuffed with Priests and Friars, tall men and resolute, he shall find that of these people, there have served (what in field, what in garrison) at one time, sufficient to have made a great army of themselves onely. He shall find, that at <hi>Orleance,</hi> a <hi>Capuchin</hi> being expresly sent to that purpose by his Prior, went vp and downe the streets with a woodden crosse, crying, come forth good Christian, destroy the enemies of the Crosse of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: and therewithall put to the sword at sundrie times, sixe score of the reformed religion, vntill he left none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. Lastly, he may vnderstand, that more lately in <hi>Paris,</hi> some of them in their sermons have incited (not obscurely) to a new massacre, complaining that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Realme is sorely diseased, being surcharged with corrupt humors, as not having beene let bloud this five and twentie yeares, as it ought. To conclude, I conceive this force of Friars, to be so great, (what in regard of their very multitude, what by reason of their deadly rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their opposites) that it would be hard for any state to bring in the reformed religion, without discharging it first of this difficultie and burthen. In <hi>Germany</hi> the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of religion in this age, were friars themselves, who being men of great marke and reckoning amongst their owne, drew their Covents and other troops of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with them, and thereby set the rest in such amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Pope grew into a generall great iealousie of them all, doubting their vniversall revolt from his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. In <hi>England</hi> they were with great policy and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise dissolved, bofore any innovation in religion was me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb facs="tcp:26238:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wheras to have done both together, had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps impossible. But first cleare preventing them of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of religion, &amp; after finding their religion cleare strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of that Patronage, they were more quietly minded, and this more quietly reformed. In <hi>France</hi> this king vpon that outrage against his person, smoked the <hi>Iesuits</hi> out of his nest, in most parts of his kingdom. If he had done the like to the <hi>Dominica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> (a most potent &amp; florishing order in <hi>Spaine</hi> above all other) in revenge of the murder of <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. his predecessor, or if he would or could do it now to them, and to the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> (who at this day next to the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> are of greatest renowne) in punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their late practise, so fortnately discovered, &amp; so chastice the schools alwaies, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he took their schollers in so enormeous falts, there were great hope for the reformed religion in time to prevail, which is now preiudiced &amp; persecuted by these Friars, that hardly can it keepe foot on the ground it hath.

to defend, or at leastwise the commiseration of humane infirmitie to excuse them, yet were they not so washed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the mindes of the people, who could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this house to have beene guided by the Spirit of God, wherein they saw so many foule spirits of pride, and hypocrisie, of lying and deceiving, to have borne so great office so long, and without controlement. These things being perceived by the favorites of the Papacy, to have made so deepe impression in the minds of all men, and to have greatly preiudiced them in their more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible allegations, mens hearts being alreadie taken vp and fraught with detesting them, they cast about for revenge and redresse in the same kinde, not as the plaine blunt Protestant; who finding all the matters made readie to his hands, bestowed no other cost, but the collecting and setting it in some order together; but like a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Artisan, who in the sublimitie of his refined witt, disdaines to bring onely meere Art to his worke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee make also in some sort the verie mater it selfe. So these men in blacking the lives and actions of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, have partly devised matter of so notorious vntruth, that in the better sort of their owne Authors it happeneth to bee checked: partly suborned other Post men to write their Legends, that afterwards they might cite them as approoved Authours, and Histories, as is evident in the lives of <hi>Calvine,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> written by their sworne enemie <hi>Botsacke,</hi> the twise banished and thrice runnagate Friar, and Phisition, for those names his often chaunges, and hard chaunces have given him. This man being requested by their side to write thus, is in all their writings alleaged as Canonicall. But in this kind, surely me-thinks the conditions of those parties are too vnequall, for the Protestant whatsoever he hath eyther in impeaching his adversarie, or clearing his owne actions, vnlesse hee can directly proove out of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries owne writings, it is with them as nothing, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>better

Then for the measure and doctrine of the Protestants, the bookes of some of our owne Countrimen, besides many other, are famous, who have taken a toile (how meritorious God knoweth) surely very laborious, out of infinite huge Volumes which that part hath written, to picke out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever (especially severed from the rest) may seeme to be eyther absurdlly, or falsely, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But verily these courses are base and beggarly even when singlenesse of minde and truth doth concurre with them: and farre vnworthy of an ingenious &amp; noble spirit, which soareth vp to the highest and purest paths of verity, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to stand raking in these puddles of obscuritie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that charitable and vertuous minde which stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by doing good to all, to attaine to the high honour of being an immitator of God, who is sorie of those very faults, which are in his enimies, &amp; discloses them no further than is necessary, eyther for defence of impugned truth, or for warning to the world to avoid the contagion of the disease, or seducements by the deceased.

with the foule enimy and calumniator therof, whose name is the slaunderous accuser of his brethren. I suppose there was never man so patient in the world (that patterne of all perfection, our Savior Christ excepted) but if a man shuld heap together all the cholericke speeches, all the wayward actions that ever scaped from him in his life, and present them in one veiw all continuate together (as is the fashion of some men) it would represent him for a furious and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bedlem, whom displaying al his life in the same tenor it was led, the whole world might wel count of his stayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; admire him for his moderation &amp; magnanimitie.

But surely the Priests and Friars which have written in that kinde, have strangely behaved themselves, and disclosed how small reckoning they make of truth in any thing, their devising, their forging, their facing, their peecing, their adding, their paring, having brought, not onely their modesty, but their wits also in question, whether they forget not what it was they vndertooke to write, a worke of storie, or of poetry rather, which Artes though like yet (ought they to know) are different.

            <p>Now these being weapons wherewith they fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their adversary, they whet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by framing an vtter breach or separation in all religious duties betweene their
<pb facs="tcp:26238:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
partie and their opposites, not only in such points as wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they discent, (which is the part of all men which list not to wound their owne consciences,) neither yet in all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall duties alone, (which sundry other Churches, antient and moderne, have done, and still doe,) as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that the good things which heretiques retaine, are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated by those bad, wherewith either their faithes or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are stained, though perhaps there be a dram more of zeale then charity, in the ingredience of that Canon, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the heresie be capitall and directly opposite to the glorie of God, or honour of our Saviour. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day hath strained that string, as to stretch it out to all divine duties whatsoever, though not Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, but performed by private persons, and in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as occasion serves; neither to such onely as faith hath revealed to vs Christians, but even those which the light of Nature hath taught all men in the world; yea, <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> as yeelding glorie to God, imploring his aide and favoure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tendring him thankes for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, in none of which actions may they ioyne with the Protestants, being so commaunded by the soveraigne Lord of their Church. If a Protestant begin to settle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to pray, with that prayer which the lippes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath sanctified and taught, it is now so polluted by passing through his lippes, that a Romane Catholick may not stay in the roome, if hee vse that voice which all the creatures of God in their severall languages doe daily sound foorth and say; God bee praised; or, Glorie bee to the Highest. The Romanist alone is silent, and may not ioyne his assent, if at meate hee yeelde thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for his blessings, bee it but with <hi>Deo gratias,</hi> (which was ever in <hi>Augustines</hi> mouth though this chaseth not a Catholike from his dinner, (which were to his losse,) yet must hee forbeare his <hi>Amen</hi> vnto it.</p>
            <p>On the contrarie side, some Romane Catholicks will
<pb facs="tcp:26238:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not saie grace, though be at his owne Table, when a Protestant is present, thinking it better to leave GOD vnserved, then that a Protestant ioyne in serving him, though the Custome of giving GOD thanks at meales, is generally amongst these Catholiques growne cleane out of vse both in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> for ought I could see: as not knowing that the Popes pardon is gained by the vse of grace in cuppes. In summe, they are more averse to ioyne with a Protestant in dooing honour to GOD, then the very bruite beasts, if beasts by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per speech could sound forth Gods praise, as the legends of their Saints in their favour doe fancie, wherein how religiously they have proceeded for the amplifying and advauncing of Gods service, that GOD doth know: how politiquely for the strengthening of their owne part amongst their enemies, that the world may know by these few considerations; First by this course that they keepe their lay followers in a perpetuall darke ignorance of the Protestants faith and religion, having made it an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of deadly sinne, either to read their bookes, or to heare their Sermons, or to be present at their Service, or any way to communicate with them in religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatsoever. Whereby, whatsoever their lay mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiveth of the reformed religion; or of the points of doctrine which therein are taught, is that only which the enemies thereof doe tell them, who reports according to the disease of their owne stomackes, and as I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it, in most odious and hideous forme to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>So that now no more mervaile (which experience doth teach,) that seldome or never a lay Catholique can bee found, that conceiveth rightly of any (almost) of the Protestants propositions, sith seldome or never was Romane Priest yet to be shewen, that hath not falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and depraued them vtterly in reporting them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if those lay Catholiques should once open their
<pb facs="tcp:26238:40"/>
cares to know the Protestants opinions from themselves, that hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which was the vse of the old world in their ingeniovs simplicitie and singlenesse of proceeding) they would not bee found, either so absurd perhaps, but that a reasonable, or so wicked, but that a religious minde might imbrace them.</p>
            <p>Then secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by this meanes they doe knit their own fact on more fast together, and vnite them more soundly to the head thereof the Pope, sith no service of God, but in his communion, and with him no coniunction without vtter separation and estranging from his enemies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if his party should but ioyne with the Protestants in such service of GOD, as are allowed by both, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cvrring with them in some actions, might abate that vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dislike which they have of their whole way, yea and happily taking a liking of them in some things, they might bee drawne still by degrees to other; and finally, steppe away or grow colde in their first affections. For factions, as by disparitie of minde they are raised: so by strangenesse they are continued and growne mortall; whereas on the other side, they are slaked by intercourse, by parley they are reconciled, by familiarity extingush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A memorable example of the vertue of this pollicie our owne Country in these latter times hath yeelded, wherein the first reformation vnder King <hi>Edwarde,</hi> the Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ates and Clergie having before discarded the Pope, did easily ioyne with the Protestants, though not in their opinions, yet in the publike service of God in the Churches, being indifferently composed, and offensive to neither part. And but that the Pope soone after vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie cause, was restored to his former authority by Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> that faction had in likelihoode bin long since ended. But after that the Pope was once againe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and had liberty to temper with his partie at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, in the second reformation by her Maiesty, not a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of his could be perswaded to come to our Churches
<pb facs="tcp:26238:40"/>
but choosing rather losse of living; and the greatest part also of Recusants, which have since beene continued by their followers to this day. Notwithstanding our service be lesse offensive to them, then in King <hi>Edwards,</hi> and in no part opposite to any point of their beleefe. But so it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med good to their pollitique Governours, by this vtter breach and alienation, to preserve and perpetuate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines of their partie, and that in the middest of their more potent adversaries, though armed with Lawes, quickened with suspitions, yea exasperated by their often dangerous practises against them.</p>
            <p>Now in that they proceede also a steppe further, and inhibite their partie, not onely the reading of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants bookes, and repaire to their Churches, but also ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them in any service of God, in whomsoever, or in how lawfull sort soever performed, thereby doe they ingender in them an extreame hatred, and bitter detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their opposites. For if the Protestants, by reason of their enmitie with the Pope, and swarving from his way, do stand in te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmes of so deepe disfavour with God, that the prayer it selfe doe turne into sinne; that their humble thankes givings are abhominable presumptions; that to ioyne with them in praysing the Creator of the world, is no better then treason to his Maiestie: then surely, woe woorth the houre wherein they were borne, and blessed bee that hand that shall worke their bane and ruine. Then no stay or doubt, but what the Pope directes, that boldly to bee executed against these enemies of God: And this have they set vpp as a Crowne, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment, to the rest of their practises against their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries: for now is their faction, not onely kept on foote, and continually mainteined without decay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but enflamed also with such hatred of their enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they are readie to any violence, that opportunity shall devise. For as diversities of iudgements doe growe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, and dislikes by oppositions doe issue into facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb facs="tcp:26238:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so hatred in factions doth breake out into seditions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and attend onely advantage to vse force against these they hate: whereas on the contrarie side the Protestants (being not armed, nor quickened vp with such stings of hatred as his adversaries) is more cold and carelesse in his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site desires, and exceeding inferiour in all strong attempts and practises. But certainly howsoever in this crafty kinde of pollicie, which hath too much bewitched the wittes of this age, and doth too much tyrannise over that aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient true wisdome, wherewith the world in fore-times was more happily governed, these courses may seeme very fine and effectuall for the atchieving of that end whereto they are framed; yet hard (I suppose) now it would bee to bee showne, how they can stand with the principles and rules of that Religion, whose rote is Truth, whose braunches are Charitie, whose fruites are good deedes, extending and ever offering themselves with cheerefulnesse vnto all men, to the encouraging of friendes, and reclaiming of enemies, to the amending of the worse, and the accomplishing of the better and noble mindes, in the high vertuousnesse thereof, doth carrie it selfe in all actions, with such moderation, and measure, as that it neither hate his enemie so much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his wickednesse, but loves that whatsoever in him hath resemblance of vertue; neither yet feare him, so much for his mischievous desires, as to rage and growe fierce vpon him in his weaknesse, but contenteth it selfe so farre-forth onely to represse him, as maie dis-inable him thence forwardes from doing hurte vnto others, how much more may it seeme reasonable, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly affections of a Christian reioyce for whatsoever goodnesse appeareth in any man, as finding there some liniaments of his Creators Image, detest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but impietie and wickednesse the worldes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</p>

and eccho of them, beeing not lawfull there to alleadge them, no not to glaunce at them, nor to argue &amp; dispute of them, no not to refute them: In ordinary matter of com munication to talke of matters of religion is odious and suspitious, but to enter into any reasoning, though for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument sake, without other scandall, is prohibited and dangerous Yea it was once my fortune to be halfe thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for no other fault than for debating with a Iew, and vpholding the trueth of Christianitie against him, so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull are all disputes of Religion whatsoever: And the Friars even in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> in their indevours to convert o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will say it is lawfull to perswade them, but not to dispute with them. But in <hi>Italie</hi> this is much more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed, wherein their Divinitie disputations in their Vniversities or Colledges (as some such disputations they have, but very sleight and vnfrequent) I coulde not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that ever they debated any question at this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversed otherwise than as ever among themselves, and betweene the Schoolemen. And which was more straunge to me till I sounded the reason, in no place of <hi>Italie</hi> where ever I came, could I have anie of their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers treate of any point in question betweene them and the Protestants save onely at <hi>Padua,</hi> where, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect there are alwaies diverse hundreth of strangers of the adverse part, it is otherwise practised. But in all other places, for ought I could perceive, either they mention now no adversaries, or if they do (which is very seldome) yet doe they not vnfolde their opinions and arguments, but either from other Chimeraes of their owne in steed of them, &amp; so flourish about or two in canvasing their owne shadowes, as is vsuall in <hi>France</hi> also, or else dispatch them away with certaine generall reproches, and then (as I have heard) some of them will formally conclude. But what do I name Heretikes in an assemblie of Catholiques? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they are not so forgetfull and carelesse of their crosse neighbours, as this course might seeme at the first blush to
<pb facs="tcp:26238:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
import; but those offices they doe, they doe them to the best purpose, teaching the people somtime in pulpit, much more in private conference, and in their confession, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> are blasphemers of God, and of all his Saints; and above all other, that they despise and vilifie our Lady, saying plainly, she was no better than one of their owne wives. That they abolish the Church Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the onely meanes of salvation, that where ever they come, they either raze or robbe Churches, &amp; make stables of them, that in <hi>England</hi> they have neither Churches, nor any form of religion, nor serve God any way, that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nation (since their falling away from their Church) is growne so barbarous, that their students are very Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, and eate young children, and that there is no kind of villanie, which is not currant amongest them. And that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other places, <hi>Geneva</hi> is a very professed Sanctuary of Rogerie, giving harbour to all the runnagates, traitors, rebels, and wicked persons of all other Countries: By which speach, verie generally in <hi>Italie,</hi> spred and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, some memorable accidents have at some times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, Sundry of their prigging and loose Friars, hearing <hi>Geneva</hi> to be a place of good fellowship (and thinking the worse prankes they plaied with their owne, ere they came ther, to finde the better welcome at their comming) have robbed their Convents of their Church-plate, &amp; reposito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and brought away the bootie in tryumph to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Custome of Geneva.</note> vnder the colour of being reformed in their Religion, where their advancement hath beene straight to the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet for their labour; a reward vnexpected, and such as caused them to complaine pitifully of their wrong infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. For such is the extraordinary severity of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as to punish crimes committed without their estate, with no lesse rigor, then as if they had beene done amongst them. And not many yeers since, it was the lot of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Gallant, who stoode vpon his State, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Mint about him, to repaire thither to have stamps
<pb facs="tcp:26238:45"/>
made him for the coyning of Pistolets. His defence was, that hee vnderstoode that their Citie was free, &amp; gave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt to all offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders: but withal (said they) when they were come they punished their offences; a distinction which the poore Gentleman never before studied, &amp; the learning of it then cost him no lesse then his head-peece. And as by those kinds of slanders, so also to harden mens mindes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, they will tell of strange miracles have befallen them; a point wherewith the Pulpits of <hi>France</hi> doe also ring dayly, where in the siege of <hi>Paris,</hi> they were growne to that audaciousnes, as to perswade the people there (who generally beleeved it) that the thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of the Popes excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications had so blasted the Heretikes, that their faces were growne al black &amp; vgly as Divels, their eyes &amp; looks gastly, their breaths noysome and pestilent, much like to the <hi>Servide Madon &amp; Bollonia,</hi> whom I heard in Pulpit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a multude of moderne miracles, which had fallen out to their punishments who were excommunicated (the continuing wherein a yeare without seeking absolution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth suspition of heresie) tell this also of an hereticall gentleman of <hi>Polonia,</hi> who talking at a solemne dinner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pope, the bread of his trencher grewe black as inke, &amp; vpon his repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance it returned to his former white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. A thing happened but lately, &amp; reported by the Popish Ambassadors to a Cardinall, by the Cardinall to a Bishop, by this Bishop to this Frier, an imitation perhaps of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed miracle of eating tables for hunger, threatned by that winged Prophetesse, with like deduction of credit, <hi>Quae Phaebo pater omnipotens mihi Phoebus Apollo Praedixit vobis furiarum ego maxima pando:</hi> And these things are in steed of refuting the Protestants religion, which are not in vaine: for the vulgar sort of people, who beleeved (as they say) God and Pope, thinke all Gospell that their Fryars tell them. And I have heard some coniecture at others to bee <hi>Lutherans,</hi> only by reason that they were so mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers as they were; but all are not of that stampe, those
<pb facs="tcp:26238:45"/>
Gentlemen and others that have travelled abroad, &amp; those also at home, that are not paisionately blind, but discreet and inquisitive of the truth of all things, howsoever dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from them, yet have no such conceit of the Protestants opinions or actions. But the most strange thing (as to me it seemeth) of all other; is, that those principall writers, who have imployed themselues wholy in refuting from point to point the Protestants doctrine, &amp; arguments, are so rare in <hi>Italy,</hi> as by ordinary inquiry (I beleeve) are not to be found. The controversie of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I sought for in <hi>Venice</hi> in all places, neither that, nor <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Valenza,</hi> nor any of such quality, could I ever in any shop in <hi>Italy</hi> set eye on, but in stead of them, an infinite of meere invectiues and declamations, which made me intertain this suspicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, that it might be their care, that no part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants positions and allegations should be knowen, they were so exact, as to make discurre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in some, even those very bookes, which were constrained to recite them, that they might refute them in such wise, as not to suffer them to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly saleable, but only to such, &amp; in such places, as the superiors shal think meet: but the truth of this coniecture I leave to further enquiry. The conclusion is this, no sound of the reformed religion, either stirring in <hi>Italy,</hi> or by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wit now possible to be raised, for to bring in from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine places any heriticall writing, though it were without malice, it were two years straight imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (as they say) if he scaped so. So far are they from their adversaries, eyther simplicity, if their cause be bad, or honesty, if good, who not onely in the most of their Replies, print both together, to give means of indifferency in iudging to the Reader, but even permit their adversaries (yet vnanswered) disputers to runne current among them, so they be in the Latin, and not purposely writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as som are) misdrawing the multitude. It remained now to restraine the <hi>Italians</hi> from going abroad to forreine Countries where those contagious sounds and sights might infect them. Heerein the nature of the <hi>Italian</hi>

doth supply, who wonders at vs Englishmen that come tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling so farre thither, himselfe having no humor to stirre one foot abroad. And indeed little neede, considering how all nations in Christendome do flock to him, but not so for marchants, these fly abroad in exceeding abundance to all places, and in wealth (where ever they come) overtop all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, such is their skil, their witt, their industry, their parsimo nie. Behold then this late Popes exploit in that point, he hath, by his painted Bul, vnder paine of excomunication, forbidden them all repaire for traffique to hereticall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, wherevpon some (as I heare) are retired from Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and other in other places are said to have importunated &amp; obtained some out chappell to have their Masse in. Thus hath euery gap his bush, each suspition his prevention.</p>
            <p n="36">36 One thing only remaineth as a garland to all the rest: It were a hard state and tyrannicall, where the Superiours should assume to themselves all licence of doing, and not permit the inferiors, at least wise, libertie of speaking, which is but a slender revenge for so great a wrong as ill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet such as by giving vent to the boyling fumes of ha tred, doth evaporate and aslake that heat which otherwise would flame out into fire and mischiefe. For which cause the wisest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have bin alwaies pleased, that loosers should have their words. And they that endevored to bridle mens tongues by sharp laws (whom they rather should have charmed and held in tune by their owne integritie) haue learned that things violent are seldome permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the enioying of too much patience, makes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breake into mad nes. Yea, I haue heard men of great experience and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment say, that the best way to reconcile countrey enmities is, to let the good men chide a while heartily together, &amp; their stomakes once being disgorged, a peaceable motion will find good audience, so necessarie are these evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the mind of the multitude, which may serve for a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of the wisdome of the Papacie in those former free times when they; and others said, what ech humor

advised. But little was it then feared which since hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, little was it then imagined, that the time shoulde come, when the world awakened by the cries of a Friar, should looke so broadely about, and search so narrowly al the sleights and hid corners of the Papacie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had beene, what their lives, what their scopes, what their practises. Not so many of the consecrated Divines, patrones of the Roman state, with thousands of prayers &amp; vowes daily adored: nor so many of their inshrined and myracle-woorking-Images, to whome such store of la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pes and pure candels were daily burning, so much incense perfumed, so long iournies to pilgrimage perfourmed, such aboundance of giftes and glad offerings presented, One whom lastly, so many, so devout, so humble hung downe heades, and bowed knees, and beaten breastes, and lifted vppe eyes attended, did ever fore tell so notable a calamitie. It was not then thought that their would arise a generation, who would alleadge in good earnest, that, diverse hundred of yeares since, as also more freshly, sundrie of their owne Authors and followers, had (in bitter detestation of their monstrous abhomination) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed out the Pope for the antichrist foreprophesied; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Rome,</hi> the very <hi>Babylon</hi> and temple of heresies, the corrupter of the world, the hate of heaven, and in effect, the verie gate or hieway to hell: that the lives of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Priests, Friars and Nunnes, (not for some particular offences which will alwaies befall, but for the ordinariy tenor and course of conversation) had beene so reported by men of their owne religion, that an honest adversary cannot reade them without sorrowe, nor a modest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shame and blushing: that the iniquitie of their chiefe See hath bin so exorbitant, as to have raised among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves this saying, amongst other concerning it, ingrossed in their owne booke; That the worst christians in <hi>Italy</hi> are the Romans, that of the Romans, the Priests are the most wicked, the lewdest Priests are preferred to be Cardinalls,
<pb facs="tcp:26238:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the badest among the Cardinals is chosen to be Pope. Neither was it then foreseene that the world entering into these considerations, would thinke that they had reason, which called for a reformation, that it was not a fatall cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of this age, but a supernatural blessing of God from aboue, after the kindling of many precursory lights of knowledge, and furnishing other instruments to serve thereto, to direct a meere accident of scandall of their part, namely, the vndiscreet proclaming and seale on their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons (as the wisest and worthiest of their owne Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers reports it) to the provoking of certaine men of more zeale, &amp; courage, than pollicy, or skill in conducting their actions; who without any such premeditated intent, yea and drawne into the listes, &amp; held in them against their will, by the violent pressing and insulting of their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, having beene forced to sift throughly the Romish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practise, have discovered therein those errors and abuses, which it was hie time to be swept and purged out of the Church, and that the establishing of this reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how vnperfit soever, to be done by so weake and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple meanes, yea by casuall and crosse meanes, against the force of so puissant and politique an adversary, is that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle which wee are in these times to looke for; wherein it pleaseth God (whose goodnes doth alwaies speake out) to renowne his higher wisedome, in guiding this vntoward world by ordinarie courses, as in fore-times his power by annexing therein his often extraordinarie wonders. But the Papacy at this day, by wofull experience, what damage this licence of writing among themselves hath done them, and that their speeches are not only weapons in the hands of their aduersaries, but eyesores and stumbling blocks also to their friends, vnder shew of purging the world from the infection of all the wicked &amp; corrupt bookes and passages, which are eyther against honesty or good manners; for which two purposes, they have their severall officers, who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to bee both condemned and imitated (wherunto the <hi>Venetians</hi> adde also a third to let nothing passe that may iustly be offensive to Princes) have in truth, pared, and lopt off al whatsoever, in a manner, their watchfull eyes could observe, either free in disclosing their abuses &amp; coruptious, or sawcie in construing their drifts &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; or dishonorable to the Cleargy, or vndutiful to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy: these editions only authorised, all other are disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, called in, consumed, with threats to whomsoever shall presume to keepe them; That no speech, no writing, no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of things past, no discourse of things present: in sum, nothing whatsoever may sound ought, but holinesse, honour, purity, integrity to the vnspotted spouse of Christ, &amp; to his vnerring vicar, to the mistris of Churches, to the father of Princes. But, as it fals out now &amp; then, that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; good fortune are the ruine of them, that too much follow them, by drawing men somtimes, vpon a presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wit &amp; cunning in contrivements and of their good succes withall in one attempt, to adventure vpon an other still of yet more subtill invention, and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which breaks in the end with the very fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it selfe, &amp; overwhelmes them with difficulties: So it is to be thought, that their prosperous succes in pruning &amp; pluming those latter writers affected with good ease, and no very great clamor, as having some reason, and doing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally some good, was it that did breed in them a conceipt, that it was possible to worke the like conclusion in writers of elder times, yea in the fathers themselves. In al other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of reverend antiquitie, &amp; the opinion of possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty redoubling their desire, brought forth, in fine, that <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> whereof, I suppose, they are now not a little ashamed, they having by misfortune lighted in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries hands (from whome they desired by all means to conceale them) where they remaine as a Monument to the iudgement of the world, of their everlasting reproach and ignomy. These purging <hi>Indices</hi> are of divers sorts, some
<pb facs="tcp:26238:48"/>
worke not above 800. years vpward, other venture much higher, even to the prime of the Church, the effect is, that forasmuch as there were so many passages in the Fathers, and other antient Ecclesiasticall writers, which their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries producing in averment of their opinions, they were not able, but by trickes &amp; shiftes of wit, to reply &amp; to ease themselves, of that wit, labour, and qualitie, perhappes indede, more commendable in some other trade than in Diuinitie, where Veritie shoulde sway, where the love of the truth should assubiect or extinguish wholy all other passions, and the the eie of the minde fixed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively vpon that obiect, should divert from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding of other motions whatsoever. Some assemblies of their Divines, with consent, no doubt, of their redoubted superiors and soveragnes, have delivered expresse order, that in the impressions of these Autors, which hereafter should be made the sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalous places there named, should be cleane left out, which perhaps (though in this present age would have finally prevailed to the reclaiming of their adversaries) it would have bin great assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the retayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their owne, to whome no other bookes should have bin granted; yea perhaps, Time &amp; Industrie, which eate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thorrow marbles, extinguishing or getting into their hands all former Editions: and for any other new to be set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Lastly, by adding wordes where oportunitie and pretence might serve, and by drawing in the marginall notes &amp; glosses of their friars into the text of the fathers, (as in some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they have already very hansomely begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the mouth of antiquity should be allso opened for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) Their remained then only the rectifying of S <hi>Paule,</hi> whose

turne in all likeliehoode, (if ever) should be the next, and other places of Scripture, whose authority beeing set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Churches alreadie, it were no greate matter to submit also to her censures, especially for so good an inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as the weeding out of heresies, and the preserving of the Catholike saith in his purity &amp; glory. But above all other, the second Commandement (as the Protestants, Grecians, and Iewes reckon it) were like to abide it, which already in their vulgar catechisme is discarded as words superfluous, or at leastwise vnfit or vnnecessarie for these times: and then, without an Angel sent downe from heaven, no means to controle or gain-say them in any thing. But these are the dreames, perhaps, of some over-passionate desires, at leastwise not likely to take place in our times. But what is it which the opinions of the not possibility of erring, of the necessary assistance of Gods spirite in their Consistories, of authoritie vnlimited, of power both to dispence of Gods lawes in this world, &amp; to alter his arrests and iudgements in the other (for therevnto doe their pardons to them in Purgatory extend). What is it which these so high and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile opinions are not able to engender, and powerfully to inforce, and to execute, carrying men away headlong with this raging conceipt; that whatsoever they doe by the Popes, they doe by Gods owne commandement, whose Lievtenant on the earth he is, by a commission of his own penning: that is to say, with absolute and vnrestrained iurisdiction, that whatsoever they do for the advancement of his See and Scepter, they do it for the vpholding of the Church of Christ, and for the salvation of mens soules, which out of his obedience doe vndoubtedly perish. And verily it seemes, no causelesse doubt of feare, that these humours, so forward, so ventrous to alter and chastice with palpable partiality, the workes of former times in any age, which hath so many iealous eyes on their fingers, so many mouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s open to publish their owne shame, such store of coppies to restore and repaire whatsoever
<pb facs="tcp:26238:49"/>
they should presume to maime or deprave that in former ages, when there were few copies, small difficulties, no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as it is found by certaine &amp; irresragable arguments; that bastard writings were forged in their favour, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered on honest men, who never begat them. So also they might besides, by their choppings and changings, puttings in, and pvttings out, suppresse many good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which they perceived were not greatly to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose should be extant. But of all others, in reforming and purifying of Authors, the care and diligence of this Pope doth farre exceede, who not content with that which hath beene done in that kinde before him, nor thinking things yet so bright as they should be, causeth much to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used and skowred over anew; yea, and it is thought, will cassiere some worthy Authors, who as yet (though with cuts and gashes) hold ranke amongst them. And for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terrour, not to retaine bookes prohibited, I have seen in their printed instructions for confession, the hearing or reading of bookes forbidden, set in ranke amongst the sinnes against the first Commandements. And for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provision, the <hi>Iewes</hi> (who have no other trades to speake of, then loane of money and old stuffe) are inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in many places the medling any more with bookes, for feare that through error or desire of lucre, they might doe them preiudice. Neither is it lawfull in <hi>Italy</hi> to carry bookes about from one place to another, without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them from the Inquisitor, or search by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, wherein as I confesse, they have neglected nothing which the wit of man in this kinde could possibly devise. So yet it may be doubted, that as too much wiping doth in the end draw blood with it, &amp; soile more then before; so these too rigorous cuting off of all Authors tongues, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing which may favour any freedome of spirit, or give any satisfaction for vnderstading times past, may raise such a longing for the right Authors in the mindes of all men, as may encourage the Protestants to reprint them
<pb facs="tcp:26238:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in their first intirenesse, having hope given to vent them, although in secret. These have I observed for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots and practises of the Roman Church and Papacy, not doubting but that they may have many more, and much finer then I can dreame of: &amp; yet in the surveying of these altogether, me thinks they are such, that it causeth mee in generality of good desire to wish, that eyther the cause which they strive to maintain, were better, or their pollicies whereby they maintaine it, were not so good.</p>
            <p n="37">37 Now to take a view of the present state of the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or rather of some points therein more requisite to be knowne: First, to consider it in his owne proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Dominions, namely, in the Seigniories and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which the Pope holds in <hi>Italy,</hi> (for as for <hi>Avignon</hi> with his Countie <hi>Uenassive</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by reason of the ill neighborhood of the Protestants of <hi>Grange,</hi> it hath yeelded him (I weene) in these latter times no great matter) yea, rather it hath beene an overcharge vnto him: for which cause, they like well to be vnder the Pope, as bringing more vnto them, then he taketh from them. I take it at this day, of the foure great States of <hi>Italy,</hi> (by reason of the accesse of the Dukedome of Ferrara, escheated to him of late) to be clearely the third at least, and to surmount the great Dukes, which it hath well-nie surrounded also, yea, question might be made concerning the second place. For although the <hi>Venetians</hi> in amplitude of Territories farre, and in greatnesse of revenewes not alittle exceed it: yet (besides other difficulties and charges of necessity, to which they are more subiect) in militarie force they greatly come short, the popes men retaining still the brave hearts of their ancestors, and breeding among them plentie of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble leaders, whereof at this present, both the great Duke and <hi>Venetians,</hi> doe serve themselves, whereas the <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> wherein is the scumme of the states of <hi>Uenice,</hi> are as heavy and vnwarlike, as their soile is deepe and fat: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so much, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are driven to seeke abroad, and
<pb facs="tcp:26238:50"/>
especially to the Grecians, from whom they are to have at all times, ten thousand at call. But on the contrarie side, being to be alleaged, that the <hi>Uenetians</hi> are by sea puissant, where the Pope can doe nothing, I suppose they may still hold the second place of greatnesse. The first even in <hi>Italy</hi> without other respectes, being incomparable due to the Spanish mightinesse; and this in possession: Besides which, all <hi>Italy</hi> holding, partly of the Pope partly of the Empyre, (save the Citie of <hi>Uenice,</hi> who acknowledge no Lord) of the Pope the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Cicile,</hi> with their dependants, the Dukedomes of <hi>Parma, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vrbin,</hi> besides other lesse quillets of these. The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Urbin</hi> no great thing, but full of goodly men, and of some 100000. crownes revenewes, is in great probability to devolve to the church ere long, the Duke being in years, and without heire, though as now vnmarried, by his olde wiues decease of late. But the Iesuites labour hard that he so remaine, perswading him that <hi>Bigamy</hi> is not so accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table an estate to God. Heere is also possibilities of the cheating of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia,</hi> there being but the young Duke, who remaineth still vnmarried, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as it is thought, in his long love to <hi>Florence,</hi> both by <hi>Spaine</hi> of old, and now by the Pope, (also besides, the great Duke is not hastie to forgoe his Neeces portion) and the Cardinall <hi>Furnesy</hi> his brother, who in that case I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, should finde as difficult a suit at <hi>Rome</hi> for dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to marrie, as the Duke of <hi>Farara</hi> did before him, for a transport of his tenure. Of <hi>Naples</hi> I can say nothing, eyther for probabilitie or possibility, as things now stand, onely it is apparant that the Popes have a verie great desire vnto it, and opinion of good title also even in present; but the vnfortunate successe and fearefull example of Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> doth feare them, who of a simple Friar, being aduanced to the Papacy, by the favour of <hi>Spayne,</hi> whom of long he had served, fore-seeing very plainly the inevitable bondage, which together with all <hi>Italy,</hi> the very
<pb facs="tcp:26238:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Apostolique Sea, and Ladie Church did grow into, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their irreligion in encroachmentes vppon their Church-rights, their tirannous importuning him to serve their turne and humours, their bravadoes, threats, insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and lording over him. When his eies did see this daily, and could not remedie it otherwise, being constrained by these iminent dangers and present indignities, hee durst harbour in his minde the afflicted forsaken thoughts of <hi>Paulus Quartus</hi> his predecessor, and imbrace a designe of chasing the Spaniards out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and especially of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Realme of <hi>Naples</hi> to the Church, which hath now but a quit-rent, of foure thousand crownes out of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the richest places that is in the world. For the effecting of which purpose, by enhaunsing his impostes vpon all commodities, after the example of the other Princes and states, his neighbours, and by other devises to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with good managing in short time, he raised five millions of treasure, a good ground of warre. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, after the example of the same <hi>Paulus Quartus,</hi> who brought into <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, two thousand Almanes <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> to oppose against the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> King <hi>Philips</hi> Generall in <hi>Italy,</hi> yea, and was content to indure quietly those abuses and despites which they daily offered to his Images and Sacraments, and sundry other devotions, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in a report of credit not to be excepted against. So this <hi>Sixtus</hi> began covertly to seeke strength from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, propounding to favour this French Kingslabours, yea and desiring to entertaine good correspondency with <hi>England,</hi> conunending her Maiestics government above all Princes in the world, by which neglect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee drew vpon him so great offence of the Spanish partie, and especially of the Iesuites, from whom also as being too rich; for vowes of povertie he tooke at one clappe above 20000. crownes rent, and bestowed vpon Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as I have heard reported, as they have stiled him an <hi>Avarist,</hi> that the divell, with whom hee had intelligence, came and fetched

The vnpropsperous events of these high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours, and his precipitated ruine, who dared to advance them, having beene poisoned by Spanish practise, as the wisest there say (and whilst my selfe was in <hi>Italy,</hi> a Priest, one of the Popes subiects, reported in secret, that there was lately a supplication pute vp to his Holinesse, by a person vnknowne, craving absolution at his handes, for making away of a Pope, which was thought could bee no other then this <hi>Sixtus,</hi>) dooth terrifie them that come after from venturing themselves in the like, and for imitating his actions, whose end they have cause to tremble at.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Naples</hi> remaineth not in his view that hath most right to it, but in his hands and armes that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> strongest to hold it. And this for the Popes temporall state, which may perhappes yeeld him now neere two millions of yearely revenewes, by reason of the great increase <hi>Ferrara</hi> hath brought, and be able to make at home for their owne defence, some hundred thousand fighting men, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, if neede were.</p>
            <p>Besides which rent arising at home at his owne state, that which he sucketh out of forraigne partes is not small even at this day, though nothing perhappes in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of those former rich times, when mony came in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so flush from all quarters, that there temporality, (which now they make their principall) was then but an accessary addition to their greatnesse. For among other blowes which <hi>Luther</hi> hath given that See, it hath compelled them, besides the intire losse in Countries revolted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of those which sticke to them, to draw more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately then before, for feare of offending: yea, they have beene also in these latter times, forced to share or yeelde vppe into the hands of great Princes (of <hi>Fraunce</hi> namely, and <hi>Spaine,</hi> for the better assuring them) a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great part of those fleeces, which themselves were wont
<pb facs="tcp:26238:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to share from the Clergy heretofore, without any part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: howbeit in <hi>Italy</hi> and some other places, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities and tenths, doe still runne currant, (besides the Spogly, as they terme them, or strippings which they have of Clergy men at their deaths, vnlesse in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, by some yerely pension they list to redeeme) and amount (no doubt) to a good round summe. His gaine out of <hi>Spaine</hi> is thought matchable very neere to that of <hi>Italy,</hi> which the Kings thereof doe and will more contentedly endure, for the better assuring of the Papacy vnto them, which otherwise were likely to run mainly with <hi>France;</hi> I would not report it, but that I have it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good of place, that <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> vnder pretences (after the Councell of <hi>Trente</hi>) of reforming their Clergy and such like affaires, was complained on to the Counsell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to have drawne fourteene millions from them out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. what gaines their pardons bring, I cannot esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, they being not solde now to particular persons after their former vsage, saving in <hi>Spaine</hi> and the appurtenances to them, whereof also the late King himselfe was said to have the greater share and in regard thereof, to have pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it mightily vpon his people. It is to be presumed, that such a multitude of generall, perpetuall, and plenary indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, for all persons, times and offences, as are granted to the religious houses, and to some other Churches of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to sundry in <hi>France</hi> also, yeld somwhat to the holy father, in way of thankful acknowledgment, considering that their gaine by them is nothing.</p>
            <p>The Cordeliers at <hi>Orleance,</hi> at the publishing of one indulgence, picked vppe (as they say there) foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand at a blow. But howsoever the mistrie of that secret standes, this is plaine and apparant; that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes are contented to vse their religious houses, as verie spunges, to drinke what iuyce they can from the people, that afterwardes, hee may wring them out, one by one into his own cesterne. The Covents have from
<pb facs="tcp:26238:52"/>
him these indulgences of grace to remitte sinnes, and free soules from Purgatory: at the yerely publishing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in their Churches, there stands in some convenient place, the boxe of devotion, with some poore begging crucifixe likely before it, and two tapers of each side to see the chinke to put mony in. What man can be so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull, so stony, and dry-harted, as to give nothing to them, who have forgiven him so much, especially, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being wanting some holy pretence to incourage, nor many an eye open to see their good doing;</p>
            <p>Besides this, the Pilgramages to their miraculous ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which drew great commodities to their Cities also &amp; states, wherein the people not ignorant thereof, helpe to set them a working: a consideration that brings contentment therewith no lesse to the Princes. So sweete is the taste of gaine from whatsoever, the visiting of their holy reliques, (both which have their offerings) the purchasiing of mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, both auxiliatory &amp; expiatory, their rewards for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their collections for preachings, besides sund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

any of their brotherhoods, goeth (to the convent for ever: such is the law of <hi>Italy</hi>) being granted or permitted by the Pope to the Friars, and all to enrich them. The lawe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, reason and equitie allowes, and their vowes of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie adviseth, that when they grow too rich his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse should let them blood in their over-full veines, for his necessarie sustenance, as did <hi>Sixtus,</hi> who pared away the superfluities of sundry rich Covents, as fitter for his high estate and honourable designes, then for them, who had poverty in their vowed recommendations: This Pope dealeth more gently by way of loanes, which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the end come all to one reckoning. Besides the which, when warre against the Turkes, or Heretiques, or other enemies of the Church, or any other great affaires requires imployment of the Church treasure, then are taxes and subsidies imposed, or requested to a certaine proportion, vppon the revenewes of all Abbeyes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religious Covents in <hi>Italy,</hi> besides the rest of the Cleargie, which can be no small matter, as was done these last yeares for the service of <hi>Hungarie.</hi> I might adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the toll of his forreine commodities, the fees of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations, chiefly in prohibited degrees for mariage, and infinite other expeditions, wherin his Papal authority doth accommodate, &amp; is accommodated reciprocall of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but this is sufficient to verifie that assertion, that eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this day those out-incoms are good helps for an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary odd share when need is. And yet all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the treasure of the Church is smal. <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> left five millions by his great reckonings &amp; husbandry: his successor <hi>Gregory</hi> the 14 wasted foure of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:26238:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
never suffer it to swell over-great in treasure. The first is the high place of honour, which hee taketh farre above all other Princes and Monarchs in the worlde, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to inestimable charge in all places, to carrie it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality and Expence, that both breedes and maintaines honour; neither can a iudiciall man perhappes wish worse to his enemie, than to have an honorable calling, and a poore living.</p>
            <p>Another thing which keepeth the Papacie alwaies so bare, yea, and makes their temporall state the worse, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in <hi>Italie</hi> (for so it is counted) is their often chaunge of Popes, by reason of their yeares, the infinite desire each hath to advance his kindred, his children first if hee have any, as <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, who left his base issue no lesse than Dukes of <hi>Placentia,</hi> and <hi>Parma: Gegorius</hi> the thirteenth more lately, who made his base sonne Duke of <hi>Sora,</hi> and <hi>Castellane,</hi> of Saint <hi>Angelo.</hi> And if they have no children, or list not bee knowne of them, then their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes and other kinsmen, which is common to them all: yea, it oft falleth out, that those Popes, who have not any knowne children of their owne, by extending of their love larger to a great multitude of their Nephewes, yet desiring for their owne renowne, and perpetuating of their owne name, to raise them to a great estate and wealth as they can possibly) do consume more the goods and treasure of the Church, than those other, who have their loves though stronger, yet to fewer, as was apparant in the two <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:26238:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the thirteenth, with his few sonnes, and the fourteenth with the multitude of his Nephewes and Kinsmen: and these men being raised often from the bottom of basenesse to the height of pride and power, having no hold in their hand, nor scantling of their fortunes, as having never been in middle state, which is the measure of both extremities, do fall into riot, able to ruine a Prince, and rage and ravine in their Offices and Government, as they that knowing their time short, meane to vse it to the full proofe. The examples of both are many, and fresh, which for their foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and basenesse, I list not to repeat, for which cause it was a good helpe to <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> to be Pope, that he had small kinred, though the ground is moove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, seeing pedegrees change (for the most part) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with mens fortune, which as a conscionable Arbira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, neither annoyes the poore ever with multitude of kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor discomforts th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the matter of greatest marke herein at this day, is the power of the K. of <hi>Spaine</hi> in swaying those Elections, who by pensions, by perferments, by hopes of the highest, hath assured a great third part of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls to him: And to be alwaies at his devotions in all Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whereby having the exclusiue (as they terme it) no Pope can be made but with his liking.

            <p>A memorable example heereof in the election of the saide <hi>Gregorie,</hi> where the greatest parte of the Cardinalles enflamed against the King, and banding against him, yet in conclusion, after twoo moneths imprisonment in the Conclave, were forced to relent, and to choose one of his nomination, or otherwise a cleere case, no Election at all, which whether there were or no, made no mater to <hi>Spaine</hi> who stands vpon a sure ground in his exclusive obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The nessesitie of the Church, the state of the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, their owne present condition, the disorders of the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all their territories which in want of a Pope, and this locking vppe of the Cardinalles in a cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, doe swarve exceedingly, did maynly cry out to have some Pope or other, which at the last they yeelded to, by consenting vpon a favorite, yea a subiect of <hi>Spaine</hi> also, for such was that <hi>Gregorie,</hi> howbeit the maine matter runneth not with him so cleerely, they being not the same men that are chosen, and that are Popes: But changing with their estates both name and nature also, yea sometimes not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier to finde two divers men of humours more different, than is the same man in his Cardinalship, and in his Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, whereof no better witnesse than <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> the most crooching humble Cardinall that ever was lodged in an oven, and the most stowt resolute Pope that ever ware Crowne: in his Cardinalshipe, a meere vassall and slave of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in his Papasie, the most dangerous enimie that <hi>Spaine</hi> ever had in the world: in summe, who in his Cardinalship was scorned as a base Friar, in his Papacie
<pb facs="tcp:26238:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was reverenced as a Prince of great worth and spirite; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any marvell to be made of this difference, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meanes of obtaining and maintaining the Papall honour are so cleane contrarie, seeing in the one state they fashion themselves to all other mens humors, in the other, they looke all men should accommodate themselves to their honors. And lastly, seeing these Princes, whose favors are the only hopes to compasse this place, and their power quelling downe the estate. For this cause as in general the Cardinals doe, in their hearts favor <hi>France</hi> above <hi>Spaine,</hi> both as being the weaker part, and the further neighbours, &amp; the only hope to maintaine counterpose against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers greatnes. So let the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> make what choice among them of a Pope he can, he shall finde that as long as these reasons continue, whosoever sits in the seate, will more respect his owne safetie, than the service of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrors, even as doth this very Pope, who for that cause is conceived to have made some alteration of inward friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippes, though holding good termes of love and loyaltie with both. But this vncertainty &amp; mutability of the newe Popes affections doth cause both the K. of <hi>Spaine</hi> &amp; other princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> above all other things, to aime at a man of calme nature, &amp; not of stirring mettall, that if they cannot make any great account of his friendship, yet his naturall disposition and temper may assure them, that he shall not be a raiser of new stirs in <hi>Italy,</hi> and diverse of them to scamble somewhat for ther own, have bin as on the other side, a speciall good inducement to the Cardinalles, in his age and sicknesse, that the place may bee soone void again; for the gaining whereof there is alwaies practising and plotting immediately vpon the Election.</p>

But all of these, whether Atheistes in opinion or conversation (betweene whome is small choice) being reckoned or let passe to make vp the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; yet holde I that from <hi>Italie</hi> there are more wishes tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other helps, to maintaine the Papacie abroad, by reason of the partition of it in such a multitude of States, where the greater do nothing but Lymbick their braines in the arte of Alchumie, &amp; ballancing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to inrich themselves: by the one, drawing golde out of all things, and by the other, to poyse their neighbors, &amp; to keep them of equal weight, their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding some helpe with their hand where the scales are ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; the lesser States fly most to the protection of the chiefe, as the citties of <hi>Genovay</hi> and <hi>Luca,</hi> the duke of <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,</hi> the seignior of <hi>Prombino,</hi> with certaine other, who all recognizing the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> for their Patron, as casting by him to bee sufficiently secure from the encroachments of those other three. And counting that from him the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted consent of all the rest, will still preserve them to whome his greatnesse is fearefull, and his growing would bee pernicious. There have beene of them also, as the last Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who hath entertained both amitie and straight intelligence, with sundry of the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> vpon purpose to holde their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and especially the Pope in, and off calling the Protestants to their succour, if they should either as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile, or otherwise provoke them.

For as for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, which was instituted of purpose against those mungrell Christians, some hundred yeares sithence, at what time King <hi>Ferdinande,</hi> by chasing the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> out of the Realmes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> merited the name of King Catholike: great numbers of
<pb facs="tcp:26238:61"/>
them chose rather to make change of their religion in shew, then of their Country in deede, and consented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive baptisme, which in secret they polluted, or denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by circumcision, or other superstitions, wherein the Arabians and Moores concurred with the Iewes, and so continued with a false face and double hart, and have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted both the one, and the other to their of-spring to this very day. This Inquisition being first brought in to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise these miscreants, and received in <hi>Aragon,</hi> (a freer State then the rest) for terme of eighty yeares: (besides that, it is theirs in right, long since expired &amp; holdeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by title of the Kings pleasure and possession: And the Portugalles have now againe renewed their old suite, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their old offer of eighty thousand crownes, to buy it out in their Countries for their persons, which it is thought this yong King hath meaning to accept) the eye and edge of it hath been so wholy of late times convetted to the rooting out of their formed religion in all places that the other sort by neglecting them, have growne in strength, and by their strength now beginne to dispise their chastisers, whom feare (they say) inforceth often to winke at many things, which no eye open but needs must see. Thus fareth it with gardens wherein greater care is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pull vp the suspected hearbes, then to kepe downe the apparant weedes: what further hopes this sect may have I know not. This is cleere, that a great part of the Spanish Nobility is mixed at this day with Iewish blood; they which say least and speake fauourably for the honor of <hi>Spaine,</hi> will say, their are of them a hundred thousand families, in which at the least are a hundred thousand men able to beare armes, All which though conforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in some sort and outward shewe to the Christian re ligion, yet are thought in heart to be vtterly adverse from it, and to retaine an inward desire to returne to that super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition from which their auncestors by rigor and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror were departed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26238:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>And the Iewes will say in <hi>Italy,</hi> that there come divers <hi>Spaniards</hi> to them to be circumcised there, and so away to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> to plant in the East. The State of <hi>Spayne</hi> is in often feare of those mens rebelling, and specially that they would ioyne with any enemies that would invade them. For although they are forbidden to have any armes, and yearely search made for it over all <hi>Spayne,</hi> in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne and least suspected instant, yet is there no doubt but armed they are, and have their secret caves and devises to conceale them. This sort continually growing by living quietly at home, and the other part decaying daily by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne imployment, what the issue may be, though reason may probably coniecture, yet time onely and proofe can give assurance, by marrying of their younger brethren with the Iewes, for wealthes sake, vpon whom in time, the elder failing, the honour and hovse hath descended. But to leave these <hi>Maurani,</hi> another pestilent sect there was not long since, of <hi>Illuminati</hi> in <hi>Aragon,</hi> whose foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were a hypocriticall crew of their Priests, who affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting in themselves and their followers, a certain angelicall purity fell sodainely to the very counterpoint of iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bestialitie. But these men and their light are quenched some while since. The last and obscurest sort, are the poore persecuted Protestants, against whom, all lawes, and wits, all fortunes are strongly bent: all which notwithstanding, there are thought to be no fewer then twentie thousand in <hi>Ciuill</hi> it selfe, who in heart are that way: amongst whom, certaine bookes of their religion being secretly dispearsed, the Inquisitors for their number sake, who were to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, were required to forbeare, and to provide some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. In summe, I have heard some of their owne Countrey and religion acknowledge, that among other things, the scandals of their Cleargie, and Friars, especially in forging miracles in their spirits and images, doth draw the people to loathing and suspition of their way. And were it not for the Inquisition, it is thought generally
<pb facs="tcp:26238:62"/>
they would fall away, and turne Protestants in short time. They have in <hi>Spaine</hi> (as is told me) a Crucifixe, whose haire and nailes fall agrowing now in this old age, as in a dead man executed, the rest not stirring: at which, the devout men of the Clergie girke vp their eyes, and the wiser of the laitie wagge easily their heads. The holy Nunne of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> of whome the Spaniards taken prisoners in 1588. made so much talking of, who had the five wounds blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on her, and the print of the crucifixe in the skinne of her breast, to whom that invincible Army repaired for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction to set forward their victorie, is lately discovered and condemned for a Sorceresse, by a generall complaint of that whole sisterhood, who hating her for her arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and watching her fingers, in fine, discovered, that the one was but a forced rawnesse of the flesh, caused by fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lady <hi>Guadalupa,</hi> who transporteth through the ayre such prisoners in <hi>Affrica</hi> as vow themselves to her, is said by some to have her credite impaired, by occasion of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive servant, who being runne from his Maister, was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned by the Friars to play that flying part, complaining that our Lady for the wickednesse of this age, did restraine those graces, but yet that it was a godly act to maintaine men in their devotions. In fine, he was disclosed and seised on by his Maister. But this is more certaine and of more generall report, that for the weeping and sweeting of their images, they have had a tricke in all places to boare holes behinde them, and put to them the new cut sprigges of a vine, which being of a bleeding nature, and dropping ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily thorow the thinne plaister, remaining vnpiersed, make shew of teares or sweate, as they list; yea, some of their Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Friars have confessed withall, that their fashion is when their Gimmalls are all in tune, for a miracle to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne some seely old woman in her confessions, to say her

devotions before the Altar, where the Image prepared to play a miracle doth stand, abusing the weakenesse of her sexe and age, to report that confidently which her pronnes to thinke our Ladie might extraordinarily love her, made her easily beleeve. Wise Gentlemen that have been at the exorcising of spirits, have observed plaine arguments of intelligence betweene the parties as in actors of Enterlude, though this should away: and so were heard to avouch the multitude of the <hi>Indemoniati</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> (whereof most are women) being so huge, even as of witches in <hi>Savoy,</hi> of which some are daily cured in shew by their <hi>Exorcismes:</hi> but for one that is helped, twentie is eyther past their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or otherwise, as in counterfaits vnwilling to be cured. In summe, the falshoods in all these kindes are growne so so ordinarie and palpable to themselues, that some of their better Prelates have caused an Image of our Ladie to bee taken away off his place, vpon the broaching of a report, that it discovered it selfe for a wonder-worker. So vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory is the foode of fooles, to the taste of wise men; and such is Gods curse vpon all forgery and falshood, as in the end, to overthrow that which chooseth it for his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as hath happened alreadie in some places. and may with time in other.</p>

The Dukes of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the advantage of the <hi>Interim</hi> on their part, have forced those Protestantes which vvere in their States to quitt, eyther Religion or goods and Countrey.
<pb facs="tcp:26238:63"/>
The same hath beene attempted by the Arch Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> and in some places, as in their Country of <hi>Firoll</hi> effected. But in <hi>Austria</hi> it selfe not so, wherein the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Protestants exceedes and is fearefull to their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, though the publike exercies of their religion is restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in some of the chiefe Cities, as in <hi>vienna;</hi> but the most part of the country are of it, so are halfe the nobility. The Duke of <hi>Cleves</hi> a third Prince, affected the same way, hath shewed himselfe a little more moderate then some other, so advised by neighbourhood. The free Cities which are of very great number and strength, have all (save some very few) freede themselves from the Pope either in whole, or in greater part: the State of the Empire for that point, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it a very huge circuite of territoryes, full of mighty Princes, and well fortified cities: that if it were more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnited vnder one Monarchie, and not rent into facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with diversity of religions, breeding endlesse iealosies, hart burnings, and hatreds, it needes not other helpe to affront the great Turke, and to repulse his forces to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Christendome.</p>
            <p>But in this so vnequall proportion of adherents to the Papacie, two things there are which gives them hope of better, if prosperous successe doe second their well contrived proiects. The one is the creating the Emperour alwaies of their owne party, whereof they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure themselves by these considerations; First the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is no house in <hi>Germany</hi> at this day, of that infinite greatnesse as is requisite to withstand the Turke in his incroachments, the house of <hi>Austria</hi> set aside, who by their alliaunce, or rather neere intirenesse with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and sundry elective Kingdomes which runne necessarily vppon them, shall be alwaies able to make head against any power in the world. And by their owne state, confining so immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with the Turkes, shalbe necessarily inforced to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the vttermost droppe of their blood to keepe them off: next, whensoever the matter growes to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:26238:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one of another new Emperour, they shall alwaies have the casting voice with them or rather in them, having entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in such bondes, and promises. Besids, there is no other whom they may make choyce of, that they may make no other accompt of it, then as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing halfe hereditarie. And lastly, their late pollicie now strengthened, by vsage of declaring a King of Romans in the Emperours life time, whilest his presence and power may governe the action, doe assure them, it shal alwaies passe with them roundly and quietly.</p>
            <p>The other ground of their hope, is the division of the Protestants into their factions of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hed, they with the winde of others have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise so enflamed, that it threatneth a great ruine and calamitie on both sides. And though the Princes and heades of the weaker sides in those parts, both <hi>Palgrave,</hi> and <hi>Lansgrave,</hi> have with great wisedome and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (to asslake those flames) imposed silence in that point to the Ministers of the one partie, hoping the charitie and discretion of the other sort would have done the like: yet it falleth out otherwise, the <hi>Lutherane</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers rage hitherto in their Pulpets against the other as much as ever, and their Princes and people have them in as great detestation, not forbearing to professe openly, they will returne to the Papacy, rather then ever admitte that Sacramentarie and Predestinarie pestilence. For these two pointes are the ground of the quarrell, and the latter more scandalous at this day then the former. And some one of their Princes, namely, the Administratour of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> is strongly misdoubted to practise with the Emperour, for the ioyning of the <hi>Catholike</hi> and <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane</hi> sect in one, and by war to roote out &amp; extinguish the
<pb facs="tcp:26238:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Calvinists,</hi> the most plausible motion of the Emperor that ever could happen. Neither is there any great doubt, but if any stay and agreement could bee taken with the Turk, all <hi>Germany</hi> were in danger to bee in vproare within it selfe, by intestine discention: howbeit, all the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> are not caried with this sterne humor: but they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which are called <hi>Lutherani rigidi,</hi> the greater part, which are perhaps the <hi>Molles Lutherani,</hi> are quiet enough. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account they otherwise of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> then as of erring bretheren, whom the <hi>Rigidi</hi> haue (as is saide) threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to excommunicate as Schismatiques and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</p>
            <p>To this lamentable extremitie hath the headinesse of their Ministers on both sides brought it, whilst in the peremptorinesse of their poore learning, they cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any supposed errour in their bretheren, whereof themselves, even the best of them perhaps (if they were well sifted) would be found to be full enough: (such take I to bee the condition of all men of this world, that in their ignorance of all actions, save of their Schooles and books) make more account of some ill shaped Sillogisme, then of the peace of the Church, and happinesse of the worlde, the end whereof will bee, that their enemies shall laugh when themselves shall have cause to weepe, vnlesse the gratiousnesse of God stirre vp some worthy Princes of renowne and reputation, with both sides to enterpose their wisedome, industry, and authoritie, for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of these factions, or at leastwise, for reconciling and composing those differences in some tollerable sort. A worke of immortall fame and desert, and worthy of none but them, of whome this wicked base worlde is not worthy. But heereof I shall have occasion to speake in his due place; for this place it suffiseth, that these intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall quarrels, are the hopes which make their enemies hold vp their heads, and quickneth their expectations to see the blades of these reformers drawne one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:26238:64"/>
that themselves being called to the beating downe of the one partie, may afterwards in good time assaile the other. In the meane season, planting in all places their Colledges of Iesuites, as the onely corrasive medicine to fret out their adversaries: Now on the other part, the hopes are also not fewe: besides, their over-topping of them so much in multitude and power.</p>
            <p>First the <hi>Germaines</hi> bearing a naturall stiffe hate to the<note place="margin">Hopes of the Protestants.</note> 
               <hi>Italians</hi> for his winding and subtill wit, (which dispiseth and would ransacke him, but that hee opposeth a proude stoutnesse, and intractable obstinacie, which serveth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies as a wall of defence to simplicitie) will hardly (what tempering soever the Princes make) bee brought ever to reaffect the Papacie, whose sleights and devises they are throughly acquainted with, and have in more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, than any Nation whatsoever. And for their owne inwarde dissentions, it is to bee hoped, that though no courses were taken to compound them, yet never will they bee so madde, as to decide them by a generall open warre, having on both sides, the Turke, Pope, and Emperour to ioyne them in friendshippe. For although the contention of brethren bee bitterest, yet a common strong enemie alwaies maketh them friends againe. And as for the <hi>Administrator</hi> so much suspected, who prowles, as some say, in the practises for his owne greatnesse) his authority is but short, and expireth within three yeares.</p>
            <p>Then for having an Emperor of some more indifferent familie, though their desire bee in that point of all other greatest, yet their hope is (as I suppose) least<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; that which is, seemeth to be grounded vpon Electors of <hi>Collen,</hi> either if the old Elector <hi>Gerardu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or if some other of that See, might be induced to follow the steps of two of their auncestors, who have turned Protestants, of which
<pb facs="tcp:26238:65"/>
cause that place wilbe alwaies in danger, by reason of such vicinitie and intermixing of their state with Protestant Princes. Besides, in <hi>Collen</hi> it selfe the religion hath already sooting, or at the leastwise might be drawen to that civill indifferencie, as in preserving their freedome of election, to change once in an age that familie of <hi>Austria</hi> wherein the Empyre having continued these seven discents, may in time be established by prescription. And lastly, for the Iesuites their great Patron and planter, the olde Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> having now retyred himselfe into their College, and resigned his state to his Sonne <hi>Maximiliàn,</hi> who it is thought doth disfavour them, as much as his father do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on them. These and other such chaunges may give stay to their proceedings. But to leaue these hopefull specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations on both sides; and to take matters in termes they stand now, and may so continue. The benefit which the Papacie may expect from the Empire, is rather to keepe matters in that stay they are, then anie way to restore it where it hath beene disposed. For although the Turkish warres should cease, which is not vnlikely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the calme nature of both Emperours, who take more delight in Chambers then fields, yet shall our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperour be inforced still in fortifiing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning Garrison all along his Frontires and confines, so to exhaust his owne treasure, and employ his people; so that he will not be able to doe else-where any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie matter, without helpe extraordinarie, which is never over-readie. And time which may prodvce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie accidents in his favour, may also produce in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour as many. And by so many the more, as the ground out of which in those partes they may grow, is manifold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly larger against him then for him.</p>
            <p>Now for the low Contreys, the Papacie hath two thirdes with it, and of the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Grisons,</hi> two thirds, against it also. The Protestants are lightly the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier,<note place="margin">the low Cuntries switzers and Grysons</note> and the Papists more warre-like which may suff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

for those parts of <hi>France;</hi> how much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it knowne vnto vs at home, so much the lesse shall I need to speake much in this place. Neyther is it verie easie to proportion the parties, by reason they of the Religion are so scattered in all places; yet in <hi>Poicton</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all, in <hi>Gasconie</hi> an halfe; in <hi>Languedocke, Normandie,</hi> and other West <hi>Maritine</hi> Provinces, a reasonable strong part, as likewise in sundrie mediterrane parts. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is the proportion of the number to their opposites (which is manifoldly inferior, not one to twentie,) their strength is such, as the warres have witnessed. And speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at this day, notwithstanding such massacring them, so generall arising of the whole realme against them, by the vttermost extremitie of fire and sword, to extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them, they are esteemed to be stronger than at any time heretofore. In summ, so strong, that neither have their adversaries any great hope to winne, and themselves not in feare to be borne downe by warres; that their practise of peace (which hath sorely alreadie bitten and afflicte their states) by depriving them of place, of office, &amp; honor in the realm, confining the exercise of their religion into cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and remote corners, did not impoverish, debase, &amp; dis harten the partie, and so withdraw those from them that otherwise would sticke to them. That is it which they misdoubted, and by the Edict now past and verified, have sought to remedie. But looking more attentively into this partie, I find, that as conscience, in what religion soever dooth even in the mists of error, breed an honestnesse of minde, and integritie of life and actions in whome it sett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: So divine and pure vertue, as the love of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. which is the ground of all that merite the name of Religious; so also, that in them that affect the greatnesse singlenesse and in a manner, a verie carelesse simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie in their Religion, as contenting themselves with the possession of the rich treasure of truth, and for the preserving of it, or themselves, recommending those cares
<pb facs="tcp:26238:66"/>
to God onely, yet tract of afflictions, much miseries, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten over-reaching by subtiltie of adversaries, doth finally purge out those grosse witted humors, and doth ingender a verie curious and advantagious warines in all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, having learned by experience, the wisedome of the Aphorisine: That a small error in the foundation and beginning of all things, doth prove in the proceeding and end of them, a great mischiefe, as hath fallen out in their men, who doe as farre heerein out go their opposites, in all civill policies, as in other places they of the Religion are lightly outgone by them, which next vnto divine blessing which accompanieth good causes, where wickednesse or wilfull witlesnesse doth not barre against it, I account their chiefe reason of their present strength and assurance, by their providence in their capitulations, by their resolutions in their executions, by their industrie, and dexteritie in all occasions presented, they have possessed themselves of an exceeding great number of strong townes or places, there is scant any office or estate can fall void, but that they lay in by all meanes to get into it. They have Synods for their Church affaires, their conventions and counsels for their civill, their people is warlike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for leaders (a matter of maine importance,) they are aboue their adversaries, having besides those three of principal and knowne name, other in <hi>Gasconie</hi> of lesse place and degree, but in skill and valour not inferiour to the best. In fine, they have learned the wisedome of <hi>Spes sibi quisque, &amp;c.</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie whereof before, brought them so neere to their ruine. But now touching the weakenesse of them of the Romane Religion, in comparison of that strength which their multitude should promise, much more may bee said. First one great part of them are in heart with the reformed Religion, though for worldly respectes they hold in with the other: also will begin to disclose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves daily, those things being not setled in reasonable sort, which have hitherto beene but in motion: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:26238:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they are not all Papists that hold with the Masse; but the Catholickes are heere divided into as different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in as principall matters as the Protestants in any place that ever I heard of, although their discretion and moderation is such, as not to interrupt the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with private opinions.</p>
            <p>The ground of which disagreements in opinion (as I do take it) is the antient diversity between the <hi>Roman</hi> Church &amp; the <hi>Gallicane,</hi> which in many ceremonies differs much from the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, as (to omit sundrie other) in the priests Lotions at the Masse, and in their walking hymmes at <hi>Vespers,</hi> and in some of them rather runs with the vsage of the Greeke Church (as in their holy bread on Sundayes for them that do not communicate) so also in the verie head point of their ecclesiasticall government, it holdeth the general Councel to be above the Pope, which opinion is at this day very currant &amp; strong, even among such Catholiques as favour the Papacie, which I reckon for the first differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce touching the estate of the Church, which calleth into question, in whom the very Soveraigntie and Supremacie therof is placed. An other sort are there which hold their Church to be the true Church, although they acknowledge sundry errors of abuses of lesse importance, both in doctrine and practise. But for the the Pope they hold resolutely, that he is that Antichrist, which sitting in the Temple (that is in the true Church of God, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his verie being Antichrist, some prove they are the true Church (doth advance himselfe above God, as they thinke apparant by his dispensing with the law of God, by the marchandizing of soules, in his purgatorie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, releasing them in an other world; whom divine sentence hath bound, as also by his Indulgences for great summes of money in this world. And not least of all by his arrogating the impossibility of erring, being a property pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar vnto God, and not communicated, but only at times to the extraordinary Prophets, as all Churches in the world
<pb facs="tcp:26238:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
besides the Romane acknowledge. This sort spreadeth farre, and as themselues will say of the learned sort, three parts of foure consent in this opinion. And they which are most devoted to the Pope, that in that respect doe hate this realme above all other, confesse that Lawyers are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected; in which regard also some, terme these the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Catholickes. The opinions thus prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Catholickes of <hi>France,</hi> it is not to be marvelled,<note place="margin">France.</note> that the realme was so readie vpon the Popes refusall to re-blesse the king vpon conversion to them, to withdraw vtterly from the obedience of his Sea, and to erect a new Patriarch over all the French Church. The now Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Burges,</hi> who was ready to accept it; and but that the Pope in feare thereof did hasten his benedictionit had beene effected, to his vtter disgrace and decay: As the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and probabilitie thereof will hold him in awe, and in good temper of cariage to his kingdome, and content to beare indifferent sway with them in any things; as on the contrarie side, his great doubt of the French vnsoundnesse to him at the heart, will cause him the lesse to favour any of their footings in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these men, though they dislike also of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion, as having brought in an extreame innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things, in stead of a moderate reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of what was iustly blameable, yet will carry themselues alwaies in likelihood in an indifferent neutralitie, rather than by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing the one extreame to overstrengthen the other. A third part of this side we may make the Royalists, who as much as they dislike the attempts of the Protestants in alteration of religion, so much &amp; more do they hate those mischevous courses taken by their adversaries against them, which have threatened so neere ruine to the whole state of the kingdome, that it may shew halfe a miracle that it hath ever recovered, being so long a time at the very point, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of shivering in peeces, (as hath happened heretofore in other countries in like case,) or of rendring it selfe into the
<pb facs="tcp:26238:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
servitude of that hatefull name of their neighbours. This part having by experience learned the wisdom to knowe, that the quarrel of religion is but a cloake of ambition for the great ones. At this day many Traytours intents passe vnder catholike pretences; that the Protestants will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a sure enemine to the Spanyard; and to all his favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, partizans, &amp; pensionaries: that whilest he may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to enioy liberty of conscience, without any disabling or disgrace in the state, he will be in all occasions ready to serve the King to his vtmost, and forward by deserts to maintaine his favour; that it is not so easie a matter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate them, as some thinke, having so deepe roote in the realme as they have, besides the favour of so many great princes their neighbours abroad, who are ingaged &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in the same very cause. And that although it were to be wished for the happinesse of the kingdome (which during this diversitie and dissention in religion shall breed greater securitie to their neighbours than to themselves;) that if it were possible, some course were taken for a finall revniting of all into one profession, yet this being not to he hoped for in this exasperation of mindes on both sides, must be commended to time, which workes out manie thinges, which effecteth even wonders, on a sodaine. And finally, to some generall good way to bee taken by the ioint consent of wise and worthy princes for effecting like vnity over all Christendome, if it may bee: In these considerations, this part, which with his appurtenances is now the greatest, will never advise the King to become head of a partie againe, so long as hee may bee absolute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of the whole having found the sidening course in such stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of both partts to be a false ground ruinous to them that take it. To these may be annexed those moral me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as they cal them) who thinke not these diversities of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of any such mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as that they ought to disioyn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who in the love of God, in the beliefe of the fundamental Articles of Christian faith, in integrity &amp; honesty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
<pb facs="tcp:26238:68"/>
(which are the greatest bondes) remaine vnited, much lesse that they ought to enrage mens mindes so far, as to cause them to take armes to decide the quarrel, which are not those Instruments wherewith eyther errour should be razed, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ueth or religion planted. And finally, to this part may be added all those who affect a quiet worlde and peace above all things, which is the desire of those lightly, who in a middle degree of condition possesse also a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate temper of affections, which is ordinarily the greatest part in all well ordered commonwealths. And withall, farre surest and firmest to the state. None of these will be easily drawne to enter into any viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t course against those of the reformed religion, so long as they have discretion, by no iealousie to provoke them. The last parte is indeede of the vowed and sworne enemies the Leaguers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels (as some name them) once the greatest and most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured part of the realme, at this day not so; their plausible pretences being now dismasked, and their disastrous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in their disorderly actions, which hath brought things to the verie counterpoint of that they aymed at, and left nothing but a memorie of much trouble and miserie, with the wasting of the people, the sacking of Cities, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing and desolating of the Countrey, with imminent danger of vtter overthrowe for ever of the realme, making them hatefull &amp; despised in those very same minds, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were erstwhiles inshrined with all dovotion, which reasons have so abated also the hawtinesse of their hopeles heades, who lately breathed nothing but Crownes and Scepters, but glorie to their followers, and have turned their song of Soveraignety to a more peaceable &amp; calme tune of, <hi>Nec veterum memini L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue estimate of the whole strengh of the Papacie, in respect of the Priestes, being the part now onely on foote against them. For as for the greek Church, the case is evident, that though it bee granted, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede any other, yet are they so oppressed vnder Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish tyrannie, or remooued so farre off, (as the Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covite, and some others) that they come not into any account in the surveigh of the strength which now wee speake of. But for Westerne and Latine Churches in the generall division into the part reformed, and part Papall admiting them in number and circuite of territories to bee neare equall As considering the huge com-passe of <hi>Germanie,</hi> an Empire possessed so wholie in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the Protestantes, I can make no other expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. In other pointes wee shall finde great oddes and advantage, for strength indifferent, kinde on both sides; First, the kingdomes and States of the Romish parte, lying nearer the Sunne, are not onelie in riches, both naturall of their soyle, and accessorie, by great opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of traffique to all partes of the VVorlde, by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde degrees superiour to their Northren adversaries
<pb facs="tcp:26238:69"/>
but also in a finenesse and subtiltie of wit, which having that other instrument of wealth to worke by, doth farre passe in all ordinarie and orderly actions. That robusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of bodie, and puissance of person, wich is the onely fruit of strength, that those colder climates do yeeld, though sometimes extraordinarily, it is knowne and to bee graunted, that those Septentrionall inundations by their verie violence and multitude, as in people more generative, have so wholy diluviated over all the South, that as a raging tempest, they have ruined those power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and flourishing Empyres, in the suddennesse of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, which had beene many ages in rearing and sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it selfe over the world.</p>

the contrarie part the onely puissant Prince, in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with those other, is her Maiestie of <hi>England,</hi> whose State is so divided from all the rest of the world, that it is the lesse fit in that respect for the rest to make head at. The other have the Pope as a common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, adviser, and conducter to them all, to reconcile their iarres, to appease their displeasures, to decide their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and finally, to vnite their endeuours in one course, to instance, to presse them, to remoove stops, to add en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement by ayde from himselfe above all things, to draw their religions by consent of Counsels, to an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or likenesse and conformitie. In all places a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall piller or stay to the vnlearned multitude, of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to themselues, of vpbraidings to their enemies: whereas on the contrarie side, the Protestants as seuered bandes, or rather scattered troopes, each drawing adverse away, without any meanes to pacifie their quarrels, to take vp their controuersies without any bond to knit their forces or courses in one: No Prince, with any preheminence of iurisdiction above the rest; no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke, one, or more, to have a common superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, or care of their Churches for correspondencie and vnitie, no ordinary way to assemble a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of their part, the onely hope remayning ever to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage their contentions, and the onely desire of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest and best mindes amongst them. Every Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of theirs, hath his severall forme and frame of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, his severall Lyturgy and fashion of service. And lastly, some severall opinion from the rest, which though in themselves they be matters of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being no differences essentiall, or in any part capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, yet have they beene, are, and will be as long as they continue, causes of dislikes, of iealosies, of quarrels, and of danger.</p>
            <p>In summe, what vnitie soever is amongst them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds only from the meere force &amp; vertue of verity which

all persons seeke for, which, though it bee incomparably the best and blessedest, and which alone doth vnite the soule with God; yet for order in the worlde, for quiet in the church, for avoyding of scandall, for propagating and increase, of what great power that other vnitie is which proceedes from authoritie, the Papacie which standeth by it alone may teach vs. These then are the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages on the parte of the Papacie. But nowe one disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage (such is the nature of all things) impeacheth and diverteth all other their forces, &amp; that is their vicinity with their grand enimie the Turke, who by land and Sea pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth harde both vppon the Emperour, Pope, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and driveth then oftentimes to such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies of devises, that <hi>Spaine</hi> hath no other shifts to cleere himselfe, than by diverting him vpon his owne deere bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Austria,</hi> and causing him to sall foule vppon his friend the Emperour, wherein he is driven yet to a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde charge, both in bribing the <hi>Bas shawes,</hi> to draw their Lord into <hi>Germanie,</hi> and in supporting their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with money to withstand him. The Emperor on the other side calleth the Protestants for his aide, without whome the whole Empire were in danger to wreking: The Pope, who of all other is in deepest feare, though not yet in the neerest, knowing that the finall marke that the Turke shooteth at, is <hi>Italie,</hi> as thinking that to be the banner nowe onely remaining to be sett vp for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment and the perfection of his Empire. And that the warres with the Emperour, are but to open that land pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, forasmuch as by Sea hee hath alwaies prooved the weaker, bestirres himselfe on all sides in the best sorte he is able, both in sending such ayde as his proportion wil bear and especially in soliciting of the Princes of his parte to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a common league, and warre against him, giving overture of like desire for the Protestants also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Protestants would know what securitie and quiet they shall have from himselfe first, their neere and sterne, and

Then for his Catholiques and Polakers they cleerely slip collar, both for the naturall hatred they beare the Germaines; &amp; for that they are in peace and amitie with the Turke, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certaine tribute. And although his neere neighbors, yet not in his way, which is not the North; but to the sunne, and to the South parts, and mainely and plainely to the conquest of <hi>Italie.</hi> The Venetians are contente al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to live rather as free tributaries to the Turke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they now are, than as slaves vnto <hi>Spaine,</hi> who in ioyning with them heeretofore in league against the Turke, &amp; Pope <hi>Pius Sixtus,</hi> did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to his oath &amp; bond forsake them, &amp; suffer them to be beaten, being left alone to the Turks furie. And all this to the end, that having their state vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maymed and broken by the Turke; they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained wholy to cast themselves, their soveraignetie, &amp; cittie, into the armes &amp; embracements of <hi>Spaine</hi> for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde.

And as the present time doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover sundry errors in the former, so no doubt will the future in that which is now present: so that ignorance and errour, which seldome goe severed, beeing no other then vnseperable companions of man, so long as hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in his terrestriall pilgrimage, it can bee no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish to them to revise their doctrine, and to abate the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of certaine speculative opinions, especially touching
<pb facs="tcp:26238:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the eternall decrees of God, the qualitie of mans nature, the vse of workes, wherein some of their chiefe Authors have come to such an vtter opposition to the Romist do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as to have exceedingly scandalized all othe Churches withall, yea and many of their owne to rest very ill satisfied. The state of truth is aloft, that of vertve in the middest alwaies; both places of honour, but neither truth nor vertue draw to an vtter extreamitie. And as in some points of doctrine, so much more in their practise, in order of government and ecclesiasticall degrees, in solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and statelinesse in the service of God, in some exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of pietie, devotion and humility, especially in set fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings, accompanied with due contrition of heart &amp; praier. Besides, in many other ceremonies, they might easily with out offence of conscience at all, frame to draw somewhat neerer to their opposites then now they are, which yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on both sides a general and indifferent confession and summe of faith, an vniforme Lyturgy, a correspondent forme of Church-government to be made of the points both should agree in, and to be established vniversally throughout all Christendome, that this all Christians should necessarily hold, and this their Divines in Pulpits should teach, and this their people in Churches should exercise: which done, the vnitie of communion should remaine vnviolated for all other questions to be confined to the Schooles, the Counsels, and to the learned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages which are the proper places to trie them; and it should bee lawfull for each man to beleeve as hee found cause, not condemning others with such peremptorinesse as is the guise of some men of over-weening conceits: and all this to bee done by some generall counsell assembled and composed indifferently out of both sides, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But now, if eyther the obstinacie of the Popes ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the wilfulnes or scrupulositie of any opinionative
<pb facs="tcp:26238:74"/>
Ministers should oppose against, and impeach the vnitie of Charitie; then the vnitie of authoritie to be interposed to assist it. That is, the Princes of Christendome to presse this agreement, to constrain the Pope to content himselfe with that temporall state which the skill of his ancestors have got, and left him. And for his spirituall, to be such as the ancient Councels had limited. And for all other gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers to censure or punish them. Now for the Princes with ioint assent to do this, how many haue mightie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to enduce them. The service of Christ, the honour of Christian Religion; the peace of Christendome, the streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of Christians, the repulsing and overthrow of all Turkes and Infidels: and these in generall. In particular, the assuring of their owne lives and persons, which so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, vnder pretence of Religion daily conspire against, the quiet and secure enioying of their rich states, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, the transmitting of them to their posteritie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question or opposition. And lastly, the deliverie of their miserable subiects (which should be deare vnto them as children) from those extreame vexations of spirit and bodie, and those inestimable calamities in their states and conditions, wherewith these dissentions in Religions and effects thereof do now afflict them. And this is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the summe of the discourse of that kinde of people which doe shew them (and they are for the most part) Protestantes though perhaps not running iump with their side in everie thing: also many of the other part, are caried with the same good zeale and affection, to the like desire and intention. But these are of the moderate sort of the Catholiques, and not of their Cleargie. And such lightly as have but an indifferent conceit of the Popes claime and proceedings, of which sort, amongst the wise sort of the layity, are very many. But now in exacter consideration of this motion, there appears for the effecting of it, sundry difficulties, so great, that they draw to be next neighbors, to so many impossibilities, whereof I will mention onely
<pb facs="tcp:26238:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two of the chiefe. For as for the thing it selfe, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse for my owne part, the greatest desire I have in this world, is to see Christendome reconciled in the badge of their profession, and that without the ruine or subversion of eyther part, which cannot be done, but to the vnexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable mischiefe and misery on both sides, and with the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inhazarding both of Christendome and Christianitie, and that any peace were better then those strifes, which did not preiudice that higher peace betwene God and mens consciences: then for the way they purpose, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth for the generality of it, ther is no other now lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the opposition of extreames is no way peaceable) but by extinguishing the one, or drawing both to some more temperate and milde estate. But in this cause, two things doe cleane shorten this hope: The first is, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractablenesse of Papacy to it, who in so many conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as they have made in this age, have alwaies ere they parted, plainely discovered, they came not with any such intent as to yeeld any thing for peace, much lesse for truths sake, but onely to assay, eyther by manifold perswasion and intreatie to reduce, or otherwise to intrap and disgrace their adversaries. And if some one of them have shewed himselfe more flexible at any time, it hath beene his vtter discredit with his owne partie for ever after; a very sterne proceeding of theirs, admitting the fundamentall positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereon the Papacy is built as good as necessary. For if divine authoritie doe concurre with them in all their ordinances, if Gods spirit assist them in all their decisions, and all possibilitie of erring be exempted from their Pope and Church, what temaines there but only that they teach we beleeve, they commaund, and the world obey. Indeed in humane governments, where reason is shut out, there tyrannie is thrust in; but where God commandeth, to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e reason is presumption, to oppose reason, flat te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ellion. To this miserable necessitie have their assertions tied them, which they have laid for their foundation, miserable to
<pb facs="tcp:26238:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
themselves, &amp; miserable to the whole world. What can be more miserable to an ingenious good minde, then to have intangled himselfe in such a Laborinth of perplexitie and mischiefe, as to have left no place for the acknowledging of his errors, without ruining his estate, (when as error is onely purged by acknowledging, and doubled by denyi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it?) And to what a miserable push have they driven the world, eyther in their pleadings against them with such force of evidence, or in their ioyning with them, as to stop the mouth of the one, and to hang the faith of the other, on this vnnaturall paradox; <hi>I and my Church cannot possibly erre?</hi> And this you must take on our words to bee true. For as for their coniecturall evidence out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there seeme to be as much, or more for the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> not erring, as there is for the Popes, it being said, <hi>That the heart of the King is in the hand of God, a divine sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is in his lips, and his mouth shall not transgresse in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But now, as by these meanes they have debarred themselues from acknowledging, and consequently from being controlled of error in matters of doctrine, so on the other side, to reforme any great matter in their practise, were to open the eies &amp; mouthes of all men against them, who now in the obedience of their blindnesse, sticke fast vnto them. Let them suspend from hence forwards, the worshipping of Images, the flecing to Angels and Saints by vowes and praiers for pattonage, besides the great losse it would bring vnto their traine in their offerings; What a iealosie would it breed in the heads of their owne, that they had led the world all this while on the blinde side, and that other things perhaps were introduced for gaine, and corruptly continued as well as these. Then for their adversaries, their owne maner of saying is, yeeld one thing vnto them, and yeeld all, sith all hang vpon the same Prince, and by the same string that any one doth. So that it seemeth not to have beene vnwisely conceived by him, who said; that to perswade the Pope to any such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb facs="tcp:26238:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was to perswade him to yeelde vp his keyes and Crowne, and to returne to the order of his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours and other Patriarches, which to do, as yet he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no intention. Than to hope, that though himsefe and his Sea should withstand it, yet the learned of his side might be enduced in other places to some treaty of accord, they know them not, which would have that conceipt of them.</p>
            <p>For though it were perhaps not vntruely saide of a great man of their owne, that the Popes not erring was but an opinion of Pollicie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not of Theologie, to give stay to the La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tie, not stoppe to the Divines, of whome (in such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite controversies and iarrings about interpretations of Texts and conclusions of Science, wherein manie have spent a large part of their lives) Never any yet went to bee resolved by the Popes, as knowing it to bee true which their owne Law delivereth, that in holinesse many an old woman, &amp; in knowledge, many a Friar might out-goe the Pope, but in power and authoritie the whole world was vnder him: yet at this day they doe so generally all cling vnto him, and drawe by his line, as having no hope, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of standing against their opposites, but onely by him, or of vnity amongst themselves, but onely in him, that touch him, and touch them; yea, they thinke some of them, the name of Paptist to bee as good and a more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie name at this day then of Catholiques, the one shewing only their vnity with their body, the other with the head of the Church, which is now more needefull. It remaineth that Princes take the matter in hand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the Pope and other to yeeld to such accord as they should thinke reasonable. Indeed this were an only way to effect it: for Reason is a good Orator, when it hath force to back it. But where are those Princes? they dreame of an old world, and of the heroicall times, who imagine that Princes will breake their sleepes for such purposes. If there were at this day, a DAVID in <hi>Spaine,</hi> a IOSIAS
<pb facs="tcp:26238:76"/>
in <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Ezechias</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> a <hi>Coustantine</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> the matter were ended in a very short time. But take men as they are, and as they are like to bee (beeing brought vppe in the middest of their factions and flatterers, where they seldome heare truth, and if a good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by chance bee set on foote by one part, it is sure to bee straight crossed, through the watchfull industrious envie of the other), the world may hold it selfe reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable happie and content, if the civill State bee vphelde in any tollerable manner, and not thinke that they should care greatly for reforming the Church, and much lesse for the vniting of the State Ecclesiasticall, the dissentions whereof, have, and daily serve so many mens turnes. And though it is to bee acknowledged and thankefully commemorated, that this age hath not beene so vtterly ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In summe, there is small hope remaining in this part, the world having extinguished the care of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good, by an over-care of their private, and each proiecting to passe their owne time smoothly over, in pleasure, and recommending posteritie to the Starres and Destinies), these reasons, together with the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this division, whereby both parts are formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and setled in their opinions: insomuch, that at this day there are but very fewe, (in comparison of former times) that are gained either way: doe make mee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire greatly of any successe by that course, and so esteeme of that plot, as an honest heartie desire, but no probable designe, and as a cabinet discourse of speculative conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which practise in the world, and experience doth neede to certifie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26238:76"/>The next point is, whether necessitie (which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules all frowardnesse and sturdinesse of humors and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) may not presse them to some vnitie, if the Turke grow still great vpon them, as hitherto he hath done, hee shall leave no hope for Christendome to resist, But in their inward concorde. True it is that a forreine enemie is a reconciler of bretheren; and that common daunger holdes them together, as long as it lasteth, which else should flie asunder vppon everie light occasion. But herein me thinketh, it commeth first to be considered, whether the Turke be so fearfull a Monarch as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conceived, especially since his late so huge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement towards the East, that which most men esteeme in him the grand cause ofterrour, seemeth to mee a chiefe argument of the contrarie at this present, and that is the hugenesse of his Empire. For Empires are then at the strongest, when they are at their biggest, there being a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain due proportion in all things, which they breaking, the that exceed, as wel as they that comeshort, may be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>un ted huge add vaste, but not great, since that is great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly which is great in the actions, which one as often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacheth by vnwildinesse in the bigge, as by weaknesse in the little. But if to this be adioyned, (as it sometimes fall out) that there be but a little soule to moove this vaste bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, (which maketh some of the biggest men, to be neither wisest nor valiantest,) and that the government (which is the soule of the state) is scant &amp; feeble, not able to embrace nor order so huge affaires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then is their no greater presage of ruine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the verie massinesse it selfe, which every stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g push or iustle maketh reele and totter for want of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward strength which were requisite to hold it steddie. And this take I to be the state of the Turkish Empire at this day which being a meere tyrannie as ayming only at the migh tinesse and securitie of their great Lord, the sole absolute commander, without any respect to the benesite of the people vnder him, save only so far-forth as may serve vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:26238:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his greatnesse: and for that cause in his iealousie &amp; distrust of his owne, keeping territories halfe desolate, waste, and vn-inhabited, his subiectes without heades of Nobilitie to lead them; without harts to encorage them to seek their liberty or deliverie, abusing them by all kinde of bestiall education, and oppressing them by all sortes of extortion and outrage, giving the land where he conquereth to his Souldiers, &amp; <hi>Timarri,</hi> which scattered over all parts of his ample Empire, are the onely contented people, &amp; strength (in effect) he hath, as being bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by their tenures to serve whither soever hee cals them, &amp; without his charge.

government of the state, in regard that they concurring entirely with neither side, yet reverenced of both, are the fitter and abler to worke vnity betweene them; and to bee an vmpire also &amp; directer, a swayer of al, whensoever there should be an occasion of assembling of their councels, or conioyning their forces, for their common defence, and especially, for that it is the only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nation of the Protestant party, able to encounter and affront their king Catholikes proceedings for the rooting out of heresie, as their actions both by sea and land have manifested. Of all places in the world they desire most to recover it, making full account that the rest would then soone followe and apply to them of their owne accorde one after another. But to as high a tide as they are risen in their desires thereof, to as lowe an ebbe, are they fallen in their hopes, being lesse now (for ought I perceive) than ever, having seene her Maiestie kept, and almost myraculously preserved, their treasons discovered, their excommunications vanished, their armies defeated, their cartels and bookes answered, their chiefe champions discouraged, wasted, deceased; those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, though many, yet few of ability, insomuch (were it not for some hope of reformation which time may bring) their fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders were likely to withdraw from them ere long their stipends, which get them but a name of fruitlesse li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality.

power, which at <hi>Venice</hi> they doe not, but a meere prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of order, which the auncient Councils thought good to give him.

               </gap>t may resort vnto them: yea, in means of enriching themselves, they are so much fauoured, that in all places they are permitted to straine vp their vsurie to eighteene in the hundred vpon the Christian, (for among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves they no where vse it) whereas also that summe in a Christian is not tollerated, which causeth many of the Christians to vse these Iewes vnder-hand, in improoving their vnlawful rents to their vtmost proportion. They have also in some places &amp; it may be in all, a peculiar Magistrate, to decide any controversie betweene Christians and them, with particular direction to favor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their trades. And lastly, where <hi>France</hi> hath banished that race, in <hi>Avingnon</hi> only the Popes citie are they harbored &amp; retained. Some answere to this demand in defence of the Pope, that the Church hath no authoritie to chastice the Iewes, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:26238:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were within the Church, but are as enemies in euen termes, whereas the Protestants are either vnnaturall or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious children, who haue flung out of the Church; or the issue of such, against whom her authoritie is endlesse, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrained, to take all courses possible to reclaime them for ever. This answere seemes faultie, both as short of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, seeing it extendeth not to the Grecians, who are in the very same role of Hereticks, &amp; Schismaticks, flingers out of the Church; &amp; for that there is difference betweene exercising iurisdiction in punishing an enemie, &amp; not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring &amp; cherishing him, and his vnlawfull and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous religion in our verie bosoms, as is done in <hi>Italie,</hi> who have called the Iewes in thither, yea, &amp; stil do entice them whom <hi>Fraunce, England,</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaine,</hi> have banished from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> long since. Others leaving these quirkes of iustice, hold by the text of Charitie, That it is a Christian act to harbor a harmelesse enemie, &amp; especially that it is of al other most befitting the Church, who hath hereby also better meanes to reduce them to the Faith: And so in fine to save their soules, which is the summe of their endevors. And in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying this answere, there is to bee alledged for the first point, that the Iewes have their Service in Hebrewe, and the Grecians in Greeke, which <hi>Italie</hi> vnderstands not, yea, and that they haue purged the Hebrewe Liturgy from all points wherein they did impugne or scandalize Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie. And for the second point; that the Iewes are bound to repaire at some times to the Christian Sermons by which meanes some few of them have beene conuerted and more may be when God shall please so. But neither seems this answer so perfect as were requisite, for the Iews doe make their Sermons or expositions of the Lawe in the Italian language, though the text of Scripture they cite in the originall. And although they have purged their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, as they say, yet leaving them Circumcision, they tollerate that which is now intollerable. And as for their gayning of any soules among them, if they gained not
<pb facs="tcp:26238:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more Crownes, that reason would not stand: for if any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit may be given to the Hebrewes themselues, as many Friars become Iewes, as Iewes become Friars, of both sorts some, but few of eyther. But of the good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they have taken to convert them, and of the fruites thereof I shall speake hereafter: In the meane time, this I aske: would they suffer the <hi>English</hi> Protestants to have an <hi>English</hi> Church there, none vnderstanding their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, neyther in service, nor Sermons, yea and purging their Lyturgy of whatsoever may seeme to impugne or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face their religion (if there be any thing in it of that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive qualitie) as for my part I know nothing, but thinke rather, with great iudgement it was purposely so framed out of the grounds of Religion, wherein both sides agree, that their verie Catholickes might resort to it, without scruple, or scandal, if factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more then reason did not sway. Then for repayring to their Sermons they know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience they will not be backward, especially having the opinion of great men (as some say) that it is not vnlawfull. And lastly, what reason why they should not be as hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to gaine <hi>English</hi> mens soules as Iewes? yes, their hope is greater, else would they not bee at such cost vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the one abroad, and bestow so little labour vpon the other at home. To this question they would aunswere; first, that there were more daunger of flocking away their people, if they should have but once a bare view of our Churches, as being more infectious, therefore no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie. And secondly, to what purpose the making of any such motion, what need vnto vs, and vnto them what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit? This answer deduced from policy and profit I take to be the right answer. Also to the first principall question, and neyther of the former drawne from Iustice or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; For there is no cause of any feare at all, eyther of the oppressed Grecian, or of the obstinate Iewe, bearing a marke of ignominie and reproach in all places, yea, they remaine the rather as examples, and spectacles among
<pb facs="tcp:26238:82"/>
them, of contempt and miserie; the one for the vngratefull refusall of Christ himselfe; the other for his sedition against the Vicar of Christ, as they inferre against him: whereas to give the Protestant any foot amongst them, were the next way to leave themselves no foote to stand on: On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, by extending pitie towards the afflicted, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid Graecian, whom the verie hand of God hath laid as low as the verie dust, they saw some hope of regaining him againe vnder their subiection, which were to them a reputation and strength inestimable, and such as they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly by false bruits, cause the wicked daily to feede on. Then for the Iew, the profit by him is exceeding great, and greater in proportion of number then by the verie Curtesans, and that as well to the Pope, as to other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy,</hi> to whom they pay a yearely rent for the very heads they weare, besides other meanes, to racke, and wracke them in their purses at pleasure: which gaine, as it is a peece of a cause why the beastly trade of the one; so it is the entire reason why the cruell trade of the other is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: they being vsed as the Friars, to sucke from the meanest, and to be sucked by the greatest; insomuch, that the Pope besides their certaine tribute, doth sometimes (as is said) impose on them a subsidy for ten thousand crownes extraordinarie for some seruice of state.</p>
            <p n="52">52 Now to consider a little, what probabilitie of their conuersion there is in these parts. And by the way to touch somewhat of their religion, and vsage. Thus standeth their case; they haue a religion, though something strange to our conceits, as being framed, not only out of the law of the old Bible, but also out of sundry capricious fancies &amp; fables of their <hi>Rabbins,</hi> yet so hansomly peeced and glued togither, that one part seemes to hang to the other not absurdly. And that which they hold, they are so perfit in, that they wil give both a probable account of it out of certaine Morall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie, &amp; reason, (wherin they are wel seen) as also make some shew for it out of the Bible it self, wherin they are the
<pb facs="tcp:26238:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
skilfullest men (I beleeve) in the world. And needes must they be so, setting their children to the Hebrew language at three yeeres olde, and following no other studie save of the Bible, and writings vpon it all their life long, except some few that betake themselves to Physicke. Touching God and his nature: Their opinions are for the most part very honorable and holy, save that they deny the trinitie. Touching Angels, but weake, and soyled with much Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, Touching the nature and condition of man, very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, and for the most part, drawing neere vnto truth. But for the three states of the soule of man, they run some more strange courses, holding the creation of them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with sundry of the antient, and others, the <gap reason="foreign">

That the generall law of all men is the law of nature onely, which who so keepes, it shall lead him to blisse, in what Religion soever, though the Hebrewes, vnto whom the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was peculiarly given, by observing it shall haue a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of glory.</p>
            <p>They preferre the ciuill life before the solitarie, and Marriage before Virginitie, as being to Nature more agreeable, to mankinde more profitable, and consequently to God more acceptable. Their beleefe of the end of the world, of the finall iudgement, of the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of mens bodies, and of their happinesse everlasting in the height of the heauens, is good in the generall: But as they thinke it a bad opinion which some men seeme to hold, That God in his everlasting and absolute pleasure should affect the extreame miserie of any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="tcp:26238:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the shewing of his iustice and severity in tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them; Or that the calamitie, casting away, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of some should absolutely and necessarily redound more to his glorie than the felicitie of them all, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that his nature is meere goodnesse and happinesse, and hath no affinitie with rigour or miserie: so contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they thinke with <hi>Origen,</hi> That hell, in the end, shall be vtterly abolished: And that the Divels themselues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long course of bitter repentance and punishment shall finde mercie at his handes that did create them, That the World may bee entirely restored vnto that puritie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Almightie God at the first did make it. And to that perfection and happinesse whereto each part of it in his severall degrees was destined by him, from whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but goodnesse and blessednesse could proceed: Their Lyturgie in the kinde of it, is not much different from ours, consisting in Psalmes, and Prayers with sundrie short Hymnes and Responds of Lessons: One out of the Lawe, and read by some chiefe person, an other out of the Prophets, correspondent vnto the former in Argument, but is read by some boy or meane compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For they will in no sort doe honour, neyther attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute they that authoritie to any other part of the Bible that they doe to their Law, which they doe vsually carrie about their Synagogue at the end of their Service in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, with many ornaments of Crownes and Scepters, the children kissing it, as it doth passe by them. And sometimes doe they make proclamation, who will give most to their treasure, to have the honour of that time of taking out of the Law. But for the manner of performing their service and their behauiour therat, it is different from all other that ever I saw; They chaunt it in a strange wilde halowing tune, with imitating sometimes trumpets, and ecchoing one to another, and winding vp by degrees from a soft or silent whispering to the highest and lowdest notes that their voyces will beare, with continual great wagging

of their bodies, and exultation, as it were, in some sauage and raging solemnitie, sometimes all springing vp light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ground, and with as much varietie as wilde worke will receive, They weare certaine Ornaments of imbrodered linnen, cast mantle-wise about their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are their Philacteries edged with knotted, fringe, according to the number of the Commandements, and serving as locall memories of the Lawe. The reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they shewe, is in standing vp at times, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of adoration in bowing forwards of their bodies; for kneeling they vse none, no more than doe the Graecians; neither stirre they their bonets in their Synagogue to any man, but remaine still covered: They come to it with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed hands, and in it, they burne Lamps to the honour of God: but for any shewe of devotion, or elevation of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that, yet in Iewes could I never discerne; but they are as reverend in their Synagogues, as Grammer boyes are at Schoole, when their master is absent: in summe, their holinesse is the very outward worke it selfe, beeing a brainelesse head and soulelesse bodie. For circumcision they vse it to the dead aswell as to the living, yet no way thinke it necessarie for the infants salvation: They are a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and advantagious people, and wonderfull eagre or gaine, insomuch, that whoso deales with them, needes let his wit goe with his beliefe, or else his findings shall come short to his expecting; as earnest to make <hi>Proselits</hi> as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were their ancestors, and as obstinate against Christ as the Priests that condemned him. In other points they are, perhaps, rather to be commended than otherwise. Their care of avoiding fornication is such, that they doe marie their sons at eighteene yeares: but adulterie they would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punish with death, if they had liberty; when they break the Lawe, they come to their <hi>Rabbi</hi> for punishment, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any particular disclosing of their fault: they kepe their fasts and feasts verie duely: But as the Christians fast the night, so they the noone alwaies: They are charitable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

<pb facs="tcp:26238:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in contriving, the other in discovering them. And surely this is an exceeding great scandall to them; seeing truth is of so pure and victorious a nature, that it refuseth to be in league with any falshood in the world, much more disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be assisted by it: neither can there bee a greater wrong done to a true conclusion, then to indevour to prove it by an vntrue allegation: a scandall is the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they are forced by the inquisitors to make in their Authors and monuments of antiquitie, thinking that these devises are our best evidences. But of all these altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they keepe a note for a time: A scandall is the vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying to Angels and Saints, which they hold to be the duties peculiar to God onely, and so hath it beene esteemed among them in all ages: yea, and they note that the Christians pray more often and more willingly vnto Christs mother, then vnto Christ himselfe, or to God. But the greatest scandall of all others, is their worshipping of Images, for which both Iewes &amp; lurkes call them Idolatrous Christians. Now this is so much the greater, &amp; of more indignitie, for that they generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it to be a thing which Christ himselfe expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and that in the Gospel of Christ, written by the Evangelists the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves; that the <hi>Decalogue</hi> should be recited with omission of the second Precept, as one of their greatest <hi>Rabbines</hi> contested with me, beeing induced into that error by some Catechisme of the Christians, which he had seene with that fault. Now when they come to confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Priests &amp; Friars, (as somtimes they do), they vpbraid this as a pere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptorie exception against Christ: those good men deny it not for feare of scandalizing their own, but letting it passe for currant; that Christ, whom the Iewes call a Carpenters son, was an Image-maker: or howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, an Author of the worshipping of them, seeking to sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:26238:85"/>
prayer to that little wooden crucifixe that stands on the pulpit by him, to call it his Lord and Saviour, to kneele to it, to imbrace it, to kisse it, to weepe vpon it, (as is the fashion of <hi>Italy</hi>) this is preaching sufficient for them &amp; per swades them more with the very sight of it, to hate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion, then any reason that the world can alleadge to love it: and those be the scandalls which I heard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves alleadge they take on that side, besides their <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> which they can at no hand digest: The particular scandalls fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Protestants, is their mutual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions which they hold to proceed from the want of the vnity of truth in their foundations, otherwise save for their generall exceptions against Christianity, they hold their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion very conformable to the law of Nature, which they account the principall. But were all the vnneedefull scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls in those parts removed, yet is their no good meanes there of the Iewes conversion vsed. They complaine first, that the new Testament, being the ground of our religion, they cannot see it. That Italian translation which they had, is called in, and taken from them, it is printed in Hebrew letters, but not in Hebrew language, at leastwise, not in such as they can vnderstand. With Greeke and Latine their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions never medled: besides which, the Inquisitors have inhibited and taken from them, all bookes that were ever published in that theame on either side, as well those that have bin written in defence of christian religion, as also the contrary against it, alleadging they will have no disputing in matter of religion either way, much like to an Edict set vp at <hi>Dola,</hi> in the french County, where the Iesuites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, forbidding any talke of God, either in good sort, or in bad. Then lastly, for those few sermons they are bound to repaire to, seldome are they directed to the pointes they sticke on, but holde on their vsuall tenour, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting meerely the Christians. The last discouragement to men, especially of their mettall, is, that at their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Christianity, they must quitte their goods to the
<pb facs="tcp:26238:86"/>
Christians. And the reason is, for that in baptisme they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renounce the divell and all his workes, part whereof, are the Iewes goods being gotten, eyther of themselves, or of their ancestors by vsury. Now this is such a cold comfort to a man set on the world, (as that Nation is wonderfully) that for my part I have not hard of any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verted in those parts, save some Phisitians, with some of their children, who by friendship to the Pope, have obtained dispensatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to retaine their goods stil, in as much as they were gotten by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable profession. But if on the contrarie fide, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians would againe in their charity, give somewhat for the competent entertainment of such as for Gods sake did give vp their owne, I could not but well commend that rigor of iustice, which the bountifulnesse of this mercy did mitigate and asweeten. But being no such matter, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for a Iew converted, but to be friared, a trade which of all other they lest can fancy, as being contrary (as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Nature it selfe) which hath made man sociable, and each helpfull to other in all civill duties, a trade never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or commended by God, never practised nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled by their renowmed ancestors, who received conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall instruction and inspiration from above, which none of their Patria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And these are the termes that the Iewes stand on in those parts: and so must I leave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull care of God, an vnblessed and forsaken people, obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate within, and scandalized without, indefatigable in their expectations, vntractable in perswasion, worldly, yet wretched, received of their enemies, but despised and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, scattered ouer all countries, but no where planted, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multiplying in number, but to the increase of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, and not to their power.

and marked example of Gods iust severitie to abate their pride, that glory even as they in their ancestors and founders, Gods Temple, and Oracles, promises, and many prerogatives, long continuance in honourable estate and glorie, (which things, if they were sufficient to preserve any seat in the world, euen their seat had beene preserved by them) and to proclaime to the whole world, that there is no assurance of the fauour, protection, and assistance of God, (without which all falls to ruine) but in beleeving in his Sonne, and in keeping his commandements. And this also may serve touching the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> sufficient.<note place="margin">The Greeke Church.</note>

            <p>Next followeth the Greeke Church inthralled (all in a manner save the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Candians,</hi> with some few other of no great name or number) vnder the Turkish tyrannie: of which Church, as their farre distance from vs requireth not to speake much, so their vniformitie in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, yeeldeth not much to be spoken for their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except onely their ancient error, touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Holy Spirit from the Father alone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have long dissented from all Latine or VVest Churches. In other points they seeme to stand in some middle termes of opinion, betweene the Romish and the Protestants, in the more weightie, or at the leastwise in the dominative. With <hi>Rome</hi> they concurre in the opinion of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and generally in the service, and whole bodie of the Masse, in praying to Saints, in auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, in offering of sacrifice, and prayer for the dead, and in these, without any, or with no materiall difference. They hold Purgatory also and the worshipping of pictures: but for images, they will not so much as indure them in their Churches. As well for the proclivitie they have to trayne away the ignorant into the crime of Pagan errors, as also to avoid that similitude betweene their Churches and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Temples of Idols, which imagery doth cause. And for their pictures, they kneele to two onely, to Christ, and our Ladie: the rest they passe over with an ordinarie reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<pb facs="tcp:26238:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For Purgatory they hold none, in hell, or in the skirts thereof, or by any outward torment, but that the soules of the faithfull are not received into glory, till by an extreame compunction and anguish of mind, they have worne out those staines with which the same, and the pleasures therof in this life, defile them. In summe, those opinions which grew into the Church before that separation betweene the Greeks &amp; the Latins, and all those ceremonies which were common vnto both, they still retaine, as their crossings, and tapers, with certaine other. But for these superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which have crept in fresh memory, or which were as antient, yet not so currant; and in generall, all those Canons of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish faith, which have beene thrust on the Church in those times, by the vnaccountable power &amp; pride of the Papacy, tending to the advancement of their owne Sea, and to the exempting of their Church &amp; doctrine from triall, by those Anabaptifticall fancies of the spirit, that mans them, and protecteth them from error in their consultations or resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching matter of faith, extenuating the sufficiency and authority of the Scriptures in comparison of their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or Church guided by it; all these things they abhorre no lesse then the Protestant: they hold vnderstanding requisite to concurre with affection, for the accomplishment of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in praying to God. And although their Lyturgies be the same that in the old time, namely; Saint <hi>Basills,</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostomes,</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> translated, without any bending of them to that change of language which their tongve hath suffered, yet doe they say, that alteration is not so great, but that their people with small accustoming, vnderstand the language well enough. But by praying with Saint <hi>Dominickes</hi> round counters, they esteeme of it no better then those heathenish repetitions, and vnnaturall lip-labour which our Saviour censureth: neither can they beleeve that the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> the lesser, who is painted vnder the Papacy with his great beads at his girdle, even as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> lightly praying before a crucifixe, was

Saint <hi>Dominicks</hi> disciple, but a wiser mans farre, &amp; one that introduced a better fashion of praying, if the world would have bin contented to have followed his prescripts. In like sort, for the holy water so much vsed vnder the Papacy, they beleeve no such feare, that the divel should have of it, nor svch force in it as to purge sin as their neighbors doe teach: they repute it a very vain opinion, that the Church cannot erre, both in the whole, &amp; in every part therof: and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that their neighbours of <hi>Rome</hi> had bestowed their pains better, which they have spent, in proving &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre, in providing &amp; caring more not to have erred. They acknowledge that there is sufficient doctrine in Scripture for salvation, though to the antient v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the Church, &amp; writings of the fathers, they yeeld due reverence. Three things in the Pope they condemne, especially his pride, in arrogating of so exorbitant a iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over all Churches, contrarie to the decrees of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Counsels, &amp; vpon no shadow of right or good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but chiefly in vsurping that temporall tyranny over Princes &amp; the States, in deposing of the one, &amp; disposing of the other at his absolute pleasure; his cruelty in persecuting other Christians with such extremity (for their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinions) his presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption in mounting to the seate of God, by dispencing with the lawe of God &amp; granting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for sin, &amp; liberty out of Purgatory, which they accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be of those royal prerogatives incident to God only. For as for the doctrinal foundations of these indulgences, the overplus of merits &amp; satisfactions, in some being more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they needed, or then were to be required of any ioyes of heaven, in their particular persons, &amp; consequently remain as a perpetual treasure to the Church, to be conferred by the Pope, on his weaker &amp; lesser deserving, or rather lesse satisfying children (for so is their opinion) so farre are they from prising m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ts at such an estimable valew, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise they concurre in assertion with the Protestants, that it is impossible for any creature to merite, as by

way of right, the least dramme of reward at, his Creators hands; the service of ten thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d millions of worlds, being not able to adde any shadow of perfection to him, who is perfection it selfe, hauing whatsoever is good or desireable within himselfe, even fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all eternity, in infinitie of degrees &amp; with impossibility of any the least addition. But whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reward is bestowed vpon the Creature, floweth forth from the meere bounty &amp; gratiousnes of the Creator, who as in goodnesse alone &amp; meere grace did make him, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in meere grace doth advance him to that high happines. That service intermediall which he requireth, is a gratious disposition of sweetest harmony, from the inexplicable wisdome of a Lord &amp; Father, still abounding &amp; inlarging his hands in all bounty &amp; goodnesse towards his sons and servants, &amp; destined to no others then to the creatures meere benefit &amp; advancement only; that by his requisite indevors in those honorable waies of wisdom &amp; vertue, of love &amp; thankfulnesse, &amp; of imitating of his Maker in doing good in the world, he may growe to a higher degree of glorie, which is proposed &amp; reserved by that great rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the height of the heavens, as a full &amp; finall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of his whole deserts, as the Crovvne of his cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial blessednesse. Now, as in this opinion they agree in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vvith Protestants doctrine, so do they mightily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from that doctrine, touching the eternall counsels of God, vvhich <hi>Calvine</hi> (as some conceive) first reveiled or rather introduced into the vvorld. And since, some of his friends and fellovves have seconded, as thinking it very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to the goodnes of God, &amp; directly &amp; immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposite to his nature, in regard vvhereof, one of their Bishops hath vvritten a booke against it, vvhich hath bin sent to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and there receiued. Thus much of their doctrine, vvhich though it may better and fuller be taken out of their Bookes, yet have I thought not inconvenient to deliver this in briefe, hovv I have found them also in speech and conference affected.</p>

For the forme and ceremonies, they much resemble the Latines, though of the two the French Masse more than the Italian, not onely in their holy bread, but especially in their Altar, which with great misterie (as is said) they both inclose from the people, that the <hi>Arcana</hi> of those their ineffable cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and convertings, may not bee prostituted and Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vnsanctified view, whereas the Romanes lie open on all sides to all eyes. In their hoast they vse leaven, which the Latines avoyde. They elevate it forward, which the Latines doe backeward, and neare the bodie of the Church, which the other doe at the Altar. In their cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings they are verie plentifull, but herein swarving from the Latines. The Greeke, who is more nimble therein, beginneth his crosse on the right side, and the Latines on the left, each with his severall mysterie. They have also a shifting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in one, and the same Masse, from one Altar to another, which the Latins have not, who contrariwise haue in a Church a dozen Masses, sometimes all going at once at severall Altars, which the Grecians vse not for ought I could see; they have much adoe with their lights, in putting them out, and in againe, at severall times and parts of their service, &amp; their Liturgy is much intermedled with singing performed in a tune, neither artificial nor altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but grave alternated &amp; branched with diuers parts. At the Creede the Priests come forth to the doore of the chancels, &amp; hold vp a little imbrodered picturé of Christ, towards which they do reverence, and pronounce their be liefe. Their gesture, or reverence, are the very same with the Iewes, standing vp and bowing forwardes their bodies at times; for kneeling they vse none, save only (as they say) one day in the yeare. At there comming, they bow themselves thri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:26238:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Prelats hands, from whom they receive it, they final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly salute the pictures of Christ, &amp; our Lady, kissing their hands which are plated over with mettall for wearing. But the Grecians pictures of Christ, &amp; of our Lady, are nothing like the Latines, but as different as any two ordinarie faces that a man shall see. The most vniformity therin that I have seene, is with vs in <hi>England,</hi> For in <hi>Italy</hi> there is little, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of our Lady, whose very pictures, which they say S. <hi>Luke</hi> himselfe partly did drawe, &amp; partly begun, &amp; an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel did finish, may argue more devotion towards her in the drawer, then acquaintance, vnlesse her face were verie vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or their skill verie slender. Somewhere, as at <hi>Loretto,</hi> she is painted like a Blackmore: In summe, they have so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knowledge of her countenance and favour, that in some places they will assemble diverse of their fairest Curtesans, to draw the most modest beauty of a Virgin, out of the flagrancie of harlots. But to returne to the Grecians, and to come now to their government, which is auncient, by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, Archbishops, and Bishops, with other orders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, vnto whom the people carry exceeding respect, as it were, to the publike fathers, and heads of their nation; notwithstanding that calamitie wherein the tyranny of the Turke hath plunged them. They have also a religious order amongst them, of S. <hi>Basill,</hi> the great founder of the East Monks; and S. <hi>Benedict</hi> of the West. These only have their vowes of chastitie &amp; austerity, and may not marry, which to the rest of their Cleargy is not prohibited; they have also their proper habite, but shaven they are not, for ought I could discerne; no more are their Priests, being a ceremony so bald, that some Priests in <hi>France</hi> are ashamed of the marke, and few of them have it that can hansomly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it. But as in the multitude of their religious orders, they differ much from the West Church, the Grecians ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only this order of S. <hi>Basil,</hi> &amp; the Latines having multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed therin to greater store &amp; varietie, then are professions in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, or trades in a city, so also in their vse &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:26238:89"/>
course of life. For the Roman monks by withdrawing them selves from the societie of other men, and living and dying within their Cels, do bereave the world of that benefit, and of that dutie and service wherein each man is bound to the behoofe of other, alledging in place thereof the blessings which by their assiduitie and fervor in praier not interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nor cooled by secular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, nor drawne down vpon the world, doe grow vnto the Church, whereas the Grecians continue that more approved institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them by spirituall meditations, and exercises, and by severitie to make themselves fitter to serue in the Church of God, in ecclesiasticall calling with exemplarie holines. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly their Prelates and other principall priests are chose in many places out of one of their order, &amp; in greatest part these guides of their Church, have a wonderfull care, and are continually pricked with the motion of much feare and griefe of heart, lest their persecuted flock, gasping in helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and comfortlesse exreamitie of all miserie, having fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of soule, and great blindnes within, for lacke of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, &amp; meanes to maintaine them, without, seeing nothing but triumphes over Christ, and scorners of his religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies, and violencies against their persons, oppressions, and extortions vpon their goods, rapines, and murderings vpon the verie soules of their children; (a case to be bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with teares of bloud by all Christian hearts that knew it, hearing the onely anchor and stay of ther soules (which is the expectation of the comming of Christ, and of future salvation) daily derided and blasphemed by the pride of the mightie. And finally, seeing no shadow of any hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverie from this calamitie, (vnder the burden whereof they grone) should in the end fall away, and revolt to <hi>Turcisme,</hi> inviting them therevnto with so many baites of pleasures, of freedome, and of worldly glorie. In which fearefulnes of mind, the onely remedy remaining, is the vertuousnes of their owne example, in constancie and patience, and avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all scandall to their people, which is the cause that
<pb facs="tcp:26238:90"/>
they vvill not heare of any reformation of any thing: not, I suppose, for any presumption or obstinacie of minde, as disdaining reformation, but all trembling at alteration vvhich must needes accompany it, least their people per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving hovv they had bin amisse in something, might sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the possibility of like error in the vvhole, &amp; fall mainly vvhither the force of povver, &amp; vvorldly prosperity (a chief argument to the vulgar mind) should sway them: &amp; on the other side, their doubt of further exasperating the Turke in his crueltie against them (considering that in Greece and in all those parts of Europe, the Christians vnder the Turke, doe verie manifoldly exceede in number the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometitians</hi> themselves) may be a cause, why in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall they hold so small intelligence, and correspondence with the West Church of one side or other, and are like to continue so, whilest their thraldom and cause of that feare shall last, though in their particular, they will declare a brotherly affection of both, and desire of the vnity of all in one truth. But for the Turke himselfe, hee maketh full account, that whensoeuer the West Christians should shortly invade him, these Christians vnder him would runne to their aide, if they sawe any likelihoode that they should prevaile. And this hath beene seene alreadie more then once by example, and hee provideth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moscovites</hi> are a great Church, a free and puissant, not Schismaticks from the other Grecians (as some in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace<note place="margin">Moscovites.</note> of both deliver) though, perhaps, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curring fully in al points, neither is it true which other of a contrary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt have rumored, that the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> had removed his Seat to <hi>Mosco,</hi> whither he went, only to erect that See into an Archbishopricke, which before it was not, &amp; returned. But the Turk to keep the <hi>Moscovits</hi> from stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring against him, causeth the <hi>Tartarians</hi> to make ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incur sions &amp; roads into their country, that so being held alwaies in awe on one side, they may have lesse stomack on the
<pb facs="tcp:26238:90"/>
other to imbrace any thoughts or dessignes of interprising or combining with other Christians against him. It were needlesse now to enter into any view of their lives, neyther could it serve eyther way to their honor, or reproch of their Religion and gouernment, being maimed, interrupted, or stopt in his operations, of what quality soever, through his tyrany, who strives to plant barbarousnes among them, as knowing, that neither civilitie founded his Empyre, nor with civilitie could it long continue. But the case is general, and experience shews it in all places, that the afflicted in all religions, how contrary soeuer, are, for the most part, men of conscience and honestie, save only where hopes draw other humors to them. For it cannot come from lesse than a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous affection, to prefer the sinceritie of conscience before worldly glory, howsoeuer it may be stained with erronious opinions: as on the contrary side even the purest religion in prosperity draws it to an infinity of timeseruers, who being trained vp in the exactions of cup discipline, make their <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous</hi> where the best cheere is stirring, and follow Christ vpon a sharp devotion, but to his bread, not to his doctrine. In which regard, the fruits of life in divers religions and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are not to be compared, but where their pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and adversity are equall; So fals it out in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar we now speak of, where the Grecian who is counted by the corruption of his country, to be naturally a crafty mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, a seditious person in all kinds of gouernment, is now become humble, obedient, and peaceable; and at divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice gives shew of more devotion than the Romanist in any place, for ought I have yet seene. But the lamentable calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this afflicted &amp; distressed Church once florishing in all worldly glory (now such as it hath pleased the wild bore to leave it) is able to dissolve a marble heart into streams of tears, &amp; causeth me, in true sense of compassion of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, to wish with the humble petition of a mind pierced with grief, to the iust Iudge of the world, redeemer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and savior of his people, to cast downe his pitifull eies
<pb facs="tcp:26238:91"/>
vpon them; to behold on one side his triumphing fierce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies persecuting without measure; on the other, his poore servants troden downe &amp; persecuted without helpe, hope, or comfort; to dissolue the pride and power of the one, to comfort the astonished and wasting weaknes of the other, with some hope of succour and finall delivery; to inspire the hearts of Christian Princes, (their neighbours) compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or laying aside their endlesse and fruitlesse conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions, to revenge their quarrell against their vniust oppressor; to deliver now, at length, the Church of that bane, the world of that ignominy, mankind of that mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ster of <hi>Turkish</hi> tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that hath too long raigned and laied the earth desolate: A small thing were it, if this revenue and treasure were only supplied and maintained out of their goods and labours, or if their bodies and lives were onely wasted and worne out in his works &amp; slaueries, it might be suffered, for goods are transitorie, and death the end of all worldly miseries: But to be forced to pay a tribute also of soules to his <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to have their deerest children snatcht out of their bosomes, to be brought vp in his impious abhomination, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in murdering them that begat them, and in rooting out of the faith, wherein they were borne and baptized, and which onely were able to bring their soules into happines. This surely is a calamitie insupportable, and which crieth out vnto God in the heavens for reliefe. How long shall that hateful name of that cursed seducer vpbraid the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; lovely name of our Savior? How long shall his fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood insult ouer our faith? how long shall his barbarisme oppresse our civility, &amp; his tyranny affront the true honor of all lawful government? but how long soever, this stands firme for ever, that the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God are iust, &amp; directed in his sharpest chasticeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to the benefit of the world and instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, &amp; sound to vs: that if those people amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst which our Savior himself co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>versed, at what time his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful steps honored this world, with those Churches which his Apostles so industriously planted, so carefully visited, so

Aforewarning of that plague which is since befallen them, if besides these spiritual prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives and graces, the puissance and glory of the great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the world; the christian empire of <hi>Rome</hi> being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated vnto them, &amp; seated in their lap and with promise of perpetuitie to their present prosperity, such then was the strength thereof: Notwithstanding when they fell away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their first zeale &amp; charitie, when knowledge, the right mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of humilitie, made them swell, when they envied each others graces, which they ought to haue loved, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things bred wantonnes instead of thankfulnes. In fine, when they forgot the Author of all their blisse, and fell to snarling and biting one another, insteade of putting vp and forgiving of offences, if not for the name of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, yet for his sake, who was father and equall lorde of both: it pleased God to suffer a base thiefe and a wicked, with a traine of vagabondes (to the eternall reproach of all their wisedome and pollicie) to advaunce himselfe so by his industrie and their securitie, and to grow to such an height in his successors and folowers, as to be a terror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the world, and to themselues an vnexplicable &amp; vnsuccorable calamity to strip them of all those graces and blessings which vngratefulnes wold not acknowlege, pride and wantonnes did abuse: And to heap on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, as the cruelty of a barbarous and mercilesse tyrant can infflict vpon such as haue no meanes to appease him, save their calamitie alone, or to withstand him, besides their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, then surely wee who come short of them so farre in pledges of favor, and equall them in our faults, And they who have had in particular the like threatening caveats of cutting off: notwithstanding the virtues of their honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble auncestors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may thinke it high time to enter into a more
