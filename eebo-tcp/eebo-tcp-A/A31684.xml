            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
CHARACTER
OF A
Church - Trimmer.</head>
            <byline>By Heraclitus his Ghoſt.</byline>
            <q>Ad Populum Phaleras—</q>
            <p>A CHURCH-TRIMMER is the <hi>Beelzebub</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> of TRIMMERS, the <hi>Devil</hi> of a
Saint, and the <hi>Monſter</hi> of a Man, into the bargain; for he is <hi>Two-fold</hi> all over: He
hath not only (<hi>Janus-</hi>like) <hi>two</hi> contrary Faces to put on as the Weather ſerves, but
all things elſe proportionable: He hath <hi>two</hi> ſeveral Tongues ready tuned both ways,
a <hi>double</hi> mind, a <hi>pair</hi> of Conſciences, one with a Belly as big as the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, to ſwallow
Camels with; the other ſo very ſtrait-laced, that it muſt <hi>ſtrain</hi> hard to get down a <hi>Gnat</hi> or
little Punctilio of a Ceremony; and <hi>two pair</hi> of hands and feet to be All your <hi>humble Servants,</hi>
to addreſs and make legs to <hi>All</hi> Parties, <hi>All</hi> Points of the Compaſs, as well to flatter <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,</hi>
as to court the <hi>Mobile</hi> or Commons of <hi>England,</hi> as times will bear, and Trump turns
up. It were below his Character to ſay, He is a mear Volpone in a Sheep-skin Doublet,
a formal Hypocrite, Holy Cheat, or modern Phariſee; for he is not only more rotten and
debauched in his Principles than they All, but worſe than any <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Jeſuit</hi> for <hi>Morals</hi> alſo.
He is a Church-Politico, a Conforming Non-conformiſt, a Spiritual Jugler, a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank
Divine, and loves a <hi>Croud</hi> as well as any <hi>Cut-purſe,</hi> for Reaſons beſt known to his own
<hi>Pocket</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> (and who but He to give them meaſures for their <hi>Huzzahs,</hi> and their <hi>One-and-Alls,</hi>
as occaſion offers) for as he hates <hi>Popery</hi> with <hi>one</hi> of his <hi>Hearts,</hi> ſo He dotes upon
<hi>Peter-pence</hi> and <hi>Popularity</hi> with the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is a true Proteſtant <hi>Eraſtian</hi> in point of Government, accounting the longeſt Sword
the ſtrongeſt Argument, and ſureſt Title: He is as true as Steel to the higher <hi>Powers,</hi> (be
they what they will) ſo long as they continue ſuch, and are able to protect themſelves and
Him; which, when they ceaſe to be, they are no longer higher <hi>Powers</hi> for his Money;
you cannot blame him if he ſhift for himſelf; when the Wind turns he muſt ſteer a quite
contrary courſe, by force as well as choice.</p>
            <p>He pretends to be of the Religion of his <hi>Country</hi> for <hi>Peace-</hi>ſake, but is really a Sceptick in
Point of <hi>Faith;</hi> for though he is ready to <hi>do</hi> all things that he is commanded, yet all this
while he <hi>believes</hi> Nothing; or if he do, it is not as the Church, but as the State believes. He
is a profeſſed Doctor of the <hi>Law</hi> of Nature, who will ſcarce allow a dram of <hi>Grace</hi> to any
one under a <hi>Duke;</hi> his <hi>Councils</hi> are the common Sentiments of all Mankind in Parliament
aſſembled in his upper Room; his <hi>Fathers, Seneca, Antoninus, Epictetus, Tully,</hi> and other
ancient Heroes; his <hi>School-men, Curcellaeus, Epiſcopius, Socinus, Crellius,</hi> and the reſt of that
Gang of Heatheniſh Divines; his dearly beloved Fundamental darling is <hi>Self-preſervation;</hi>
for whoſe ſake he hath an univerſal tenderneſs for all <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> Chriſtian or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel;
among the <hi>Whigs</hi> he is a zealous <hi>Whig,</hi> with the <hi>Tories</hi> a moderate <hi>Tory;</hi> and hugs
himſelf in the fancy that he is the very Picture of the old <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe he
becomes <hi>all</hi> things to <hi>all</hi> men, that ſo he may be <hi>all</hi> means ſave ONE.</p>
            <p>Would ye know what he was or did in thoſe days when there was no <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Malice
it ſelf could not ſuſpect him to have a <hi>King</hi> in his Heart in all that time, as became a man of
Temper, Prudence, and good Nature. He was true and faithful to all the ſeveral new Faces and
freſh Broaches of <hi>Government</hi> (as that Female Hector ſwore ſhe had been to her ſeventeen
<pb facs="tcp:43352:2"/>
               <hi>Gallants</hi>) though without <hi>King,</hi> Houſe of <hi>Lords,</hi> or <hi>Commons</hi> either; (none but Fools and Sots
will ſuffer and ſtarve, be the Weather never ſo cold, or times bad.) The man of <hi>Salamanca</hi> can
hardly ſwear what <hi>Orders</hi> he was <hi>then</hi> in, but <hi>he</hi> was a mighty buſie Pulpiteer; he had the
Gift (or rather the Art, or <hi>Cant</hi>) of praying by the <hi>Spirit;</hi> he prayed aloud for all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Powers</hi> which Providence ſucceſſively ſet over us, though all perjured <hi>Rebels;</hi> (for he was
never againſt the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> unleſs it were in the <hi>Right Line.</hi>) He preached in a black Cloak
and white Gloves, and inveighed bitterly all along againſt the <hi>Roman Miſſal,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh
Maſs-Book,</hi> with all their Superſtitious Forms and Rites; againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy</hi> alike;
for next to <hi>Kings,</hi> he loved <hi>Biſhops</hi> worſt at that time of the day. His Fingers itched to have
a ſhare in the Government <hi>then,</hi> that he might ſhew his cowardly Proweſs in trampling upon
a poor <hi>Church</hi> when it was down; and perſecuting a <hi>Loyal</hi> Clergy-man that durſt preſume
to read <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> under his <hi>ſanctified</hi> Noſe; for theſe and ſuch-like glorious ends and
to ſhew how heartily he eſpouſed the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> no doubt he uſed all laudable means, though I
will not ſay poſitively that he liſted himſelf <hi>Chaplain</hi> to ſome <hi>Major General,</hi> or other man of
<hi>Might,</hi> or committed <hi>Matrimony</hi> with a caſt <hi>Abigail,</hi> or genuine off-ſpring of old <hi>Holofernes</hi>
his own <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the laſt Game of this Church-Sophiſter, is his Maſter-piece, and worth all the reſt;
for ſo ſoon as ever the <hi>Clock</hi> ſtruck 1660. and the word was <hi>Dieu &amp; mon Droit,</hi> and all the
Bells and Pulpits rang, <hi>I will overturn, overturn, overturn, till he ſhall come whoſe Right it is;</hi>
his Trimmerſhip (in a great Fright) turn'd <hi>Old Cavalier</hi> in a moment, like the man that grew
<hi>Gray</hi> in one night: He put on the Face of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> began to aſſert <hi>Monarchy</hi> ſtrenuouſly, took
all <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi> to bind him to his good behaviour for the future; ſubſcribed the Articles of
<hi>Religion</hi> (as Articles of <hi>Peace</hi> indeed, but not of <hi>Faith</hi>) and fell ſo deſperately in love with
the <hi>Church</hi> all of a ſudden, as if it had been really his new <hi>Miſtriſs;</hi> but this was only a Copy
of his Countenance; however, finding a <hi>new</hi> Talent put into his hand, and the <hi>old</hi> ferment
of Ambition working ſtill in his brain, he reſolves to be <hi>ſomebody</hi> (and not Vicar of <hi>Bray</hi> ſtill)
to make a greater <hi>Figure</hi> in the Church, that he may be the more able to ſerve <hi>Her</hi> a Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,
and betray <hi>Her</hi> into the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> hands, when time ſhall ſerve. It was not long
before he began to ſet up a <hi>new</hi> Church within the <hi>old,</hi> to cry up <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> or <hi>Toleration</hi>
for all Sects, leſt he at laſt ſhould be found <hi>intolerable:</hi> He inſinuated into the great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and preſumed to make liſts too, of <hi>Worthy men</hi> and <hi>men Worthy;</hi>
to blacken and defame all <hi>Loyal</hi> Clericks, and recommend thoſe of his own <hi>ſtamp</hi> as the only
men of <hi>Merit;</hi> to cry down the <hi>one</hi> as men of hot heads, and <hi>Popiſhly</hi> inclined, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the <hi>other</hi> as great <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Prudence, Conduct</hi> and <hi>Moderation;</hi> ſo that the moſt uſeful,
honeſt, and able Church-man that will not lick up his <hi>Spittle,</hi> muſt ſtay for his Reward till
the <hi>Great day.</hi> He eſteems all our Church-uſages indifferent little <hi>Trifles,</hi> not to be contended
for; prefers one <hi>Pipe</hi> in the <hi>Veſtry,</hi> before a whole Organ-full at the <hi>Bellfry:</hi> He ſeldom reads
the publick <hi>Prayers,</hi> but <hi>Preaches</hi> World without end: He hates a <hi>Croſs</hi> in his Heart, and
values not the <hi>ſign</hi> thereof in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> at a braſs Farthing; two <hi>Guineys</hi> will purchaſe him to
leave it out: He allows no more of a <hi>real Preſence</hi> in the Sacrament, than at his own Table,
when (by chance) he eats <hi>at home;</hi> his Sermons are wiſely compoſed, to treat men of all
<hi>Religions,</hi> only they ſeem to be more particularly calculated for <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<hi>Chriſtians.</hi> In one word, He is the <hi>King's</hi> humble Servant in the Intervals of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when <hi>He</hi> can rule his own <hi>Roaſt</hi> without the diſturbance of popular <hi>Votes;</hi> but if he
chance to want <hi>Money,</hi> or <hi>Hands</hi> or <hi>Heads</hi> to aſſiſt him in Extremities, when Factions grow
high and inſolent againſt <hi>Him;</hi> and threaten the ſecond part to the <hi>ſame Tune</hi> of 1641. this
true Proteſtant Trimming <hi>Antichriſt</hi> fairly denies his <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The King is but one
man, but the People of</hi> England <hi>are very numerous; and what wiſe man will diſoblige and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
a</hi> Multitude? <hi>No, I will rather venture and truſt His Majeſties wonted Clemency, than
their known Fury; I have read</hi> Matchiavel, <hi>and am well aware, that</hi> Honeſty <hi>is not the beſt</hi> Policy,
<hi>though it be the</hi> Fools <hi>Motto, I was never of the loſing ſide, and will ſave my ſtake ſtill if I can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's your <hi>Trimmer</hi> for you with a Vengeance! you that would know more of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Ways, muſt repair to the <hi>Reconciling-Office</hi> near <hi>Peg Trantams,</hi> being the half-way
Houſe between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> where he is to be ſpoken with once every Week; and you
are deſired to tell him that he muſt not give <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> if he love them not <hi>himſelf,</hi>
but that he muſt expect, ſome time or other, to meet with a <hi>Rowland</hi> for his <hi>Oliver.</hi>
