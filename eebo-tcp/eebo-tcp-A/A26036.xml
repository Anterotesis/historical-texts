            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEing imployed in the ſervice of the City and State, to attend the London-Brigade, now joyned with Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and at that time intruſted to acquaint you with our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the laſt week; I am bold, after my humble ſervice, to preſent to you a brief Relation of the moſt remarkable Paſſages between us and the Enemy, not onely in duty to you, but alſo in love to all thoſe that long to be truly informed in the particular.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Honour; Upon Thurſday the 21. of this inſtant March (our Brigade being quartered at Midhurſt) our Major Generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders from Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> to advance towards Wincheſter to a Town called Traford, which accordingly he did with incredible ſpeed, almoſt at an hours warning, and that night ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, which we found to be a ſmall Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, not above ſeven or eight houſes to quarter all our men, there we met with much hardſhip, ſtaying for Orders till the Lords day following; Upon Monday the 25, we marcht forwards to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49748:3"/>
ioyn with Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> main body, which accordingly wee did, and that night were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to quarter at Weſtmean, three miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the main body, where we found a partee of the Enemies horſe when our Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters entred the Town, which occaſioned ſome action, though not much conſiderable, we onely took a Quartermaſter priſoner; the next day, which was Tueſday, we lay ſtill, onely our Scouts brought in ſome priſoners, 6 Troops incountring with 16 of the Enemies, put them to flight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and brought away 3. of them priſoners; The day following we diſcovered the Enemy, who took ſome fevv of our men that vvere ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from their colours, and ſoon after appeared in a great body upon the hill on the left hand the Tovvn, intending (as ſome priſoners confeſsed) to take us at Church, it being the Faſt day; but it pleaſed God, vvho foreſavv the Plot, to prevent the danger, directing us to keep the Faſt the Wedneſday before, vvhen vve lay ſtill at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt, ſo that vvee vvere provided to entertain them, and drevv our men into a body neer the town, which done, Orders came to march away, which accordingly we did, in the Forlorn-Hope, expecting the Enemy every hour to fall upon us,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49748:3"/>
ſo that we were forced to make a ſtand a mile or more from the town in extream danger, till Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> forces came up from Eaſtmean to joyn with us, then we marcht along till we came neer to Cheriton, to a place called by ſome, Lamborough-field, where wee quartered all night, the Enemy lying upon Sutton Common, and ſome part of them neerer to us, ſo neer that the Sentinels could heare one another talke: Upon Thurſday morning a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded partee was ſent to view the Enemie, which they did, and incountered with a forlorne hope of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and behaved themſelves very bravely, ſo that day was ſpent in skirmiſhes, where much gallantry and true valour was ſhewed by our horſe, eſpecially two men whoſe names I do not well remember, to the perpetuall honour of the actors, and great admiration of the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; by whoſe meanes a conſiderable partee was once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and the enemy came on with a great body, which appearing, we diſcharged one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>gun, which did ſuch executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our ſight, that they all fled.</p>
            <p>This day a Counſell of War was called by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, both by us and the Enemie, as ſince we are informed, and the ingagement was ſuch, that of neceſſity they muſt give battell or retreat with much diſhonour, the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we prepared for the worke, and having ſought to God for aſſiſtance, we did addreſſe our ſelves to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; in the firſt place, a forlorn hope was drawn out of our brigade, four files out of a company, led on by <hi>Captain Tompſon,</hi> a ſtout man, who were ſent to take poſſeſſion of a wood which lay on the right hand betweene us and the enemie, which they obtained with eaſe in the enemies ſight; but ſuch was their policy, that they foreſeeing the neceſſity of our gaining the wood, if ever we gave battell to them in that place, planted their Drakes on the further ſide of the wood, which they diſcharged upon our men ſo thick, that the place was not tenible, though the greateſt part of our Musketteers, and ſome others, were drawn up
<pb facs="tcp:49748:4"/>
to them, ſo that they were forced to retreat in one houres ſpace, which gave great incouragement to the Enemie, who preſently came on with their main body of horſe, very powerfully, and were met as couragiouſly, yet being of the greater number (for our whole body was not then together) forced ours to a diſorderly retreat, at which time the day was doubtfull, if not deſperate, our foot all the while was ingaged on the left wing, to drive the Enemy from the hodges, where our men played their parts gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, and drove them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hedge to hedge by degrees, till they had forced them to the top of the hil, our horſe doing little for the ſpace of an hour after their retreat, only ſome parties incountring with each other, at which time our Noble Major Generall <hi>Brown</hi> (who was ever known to be a valiant man, and muſt be lookt upon as a ſpeciall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the work, Drew off 100. men from the hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and in his own perſon led them on to charge the horſe, which they did moſt gladly and couragiouſly, and forced the enemies horſe to wheele about, wherupon our body of horſe came on again, and that very manfully, at which time they charghed quice thorow the Enemies body and put them to a rout, ſo that they were forced to retreat to the top of the hill, where they firſt appeared, this was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two of the clock in the afternoon, at which time they began to retreat, and ſent their Carriages away, their body of foot followed after, the horſe and ſome few foot onely being left to face and to fight with us, at the the laſt it pleaſed God to raiſe up the ſpirits of ſome few, not above 300. and to put ſuch courage into them, as to adventure out of the cloſings, to charge the main body upon the plain, which they did ſo reſolutely that they put them all to flight, our horſe purſued them two miles at the leaſt, till the Enemies horſe overtook their own foot, who cryed out (as the country people ſay) Face them, face them, once more face them; which they did, but to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; our horſe came up, and at the firſt charge they were all routed and fled, our horſe purſued them till they overtook the foot, routed them likewiſe, and diſperſed them ſeverall waies, ſome fled to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb facs="tcp:49748:4"/>
ſome to Alton, and ſome to Wincheſter, and by the way they cryed out, the Kingdoms loſt, the Kingdoms loſt, &amp;c. and when they left Alsford where they had long quartered, they ſet the town on fire at both ends, which doubtleſſe had burnt to the ground, but that our men came in and put it out, there was onely four or five houſes burnt.</p>
            <p>Thus it pleaſed God (who alone is the giver of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory) to vouchſafe us not onely a deliverance (which we ſhould have owned as a mercy) but a glorious conqueſt. As for the inſtruments, I dare not challenge any of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in this dayes ſervice, to ſpeak the truth, both Horſe and foot quit themſelves bravely.</p>
