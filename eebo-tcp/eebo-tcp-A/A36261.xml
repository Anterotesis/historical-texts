            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For 1. it must be of great use for the <hi>Laity</hi> and the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> who either have not the Abilities, or cannot spare the time, which would be requisite for Enquiring into the particular Disputes, to have the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies reduced into a narrow compass. And especially if these few things, to which they are reduced, may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for securing the Duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on such Persons as well as if the Enquiry had been more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute; and when withal the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb facs="tcp:49109:5"/>
on which their Resolution depends, is suited to the capacity of that sort of persons. Now all these things are provided for by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>All the Disputes between us are reduced to this one of the Popes Supremacy over the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church diffusive.</hi> As for our Differences in Other Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, it is here proved, that, if we be not mistaken in This, themselves either cannot charge us with <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> or not with any Errour of that consequence as may excuse them, either for <hi>Separating</hi> from our Communion, or for that rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Imposing</hi> their own Opinions which are contrary to it.</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>And this does indeed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
<pb facs="tcp:49109:6"/>
secure the Duty of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Laicks in this whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</hi> For the Obligation incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent at least on such Persons who are not, by their particular Calling, obliged to Enquire, can only be to know so much as may secure their <hi>Christian Practice;</hi> and that is sufficiently secured by due adhering to that <hi>Communion</hi> where they may reasonably expect the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of those Divine Promises which are conveyed in the use of the Sacraments, and the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Means of Grace, so that the main concernment of such Persons is this, to know where such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is to be had. Now the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this Question appears from the Principles here laid down, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to decide the whole Dispute concerning the <hi>true Communion.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:6"/>
If it should prove <hi>true</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> has this Authority over the <hi>Catholick Church diffusive,</hi> it would follow that his <hi>particular Church</hi> must be the <hi>Catholick Church virtual,</hi> and so must have a Title to all those Promises made to the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in the Scriptures (thus much at least will follow, even according to their <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> who do not pretend that these <hi>Promises</hi> reach so high as <hi>Infallibility</hi>) and therefore that they were obliged to submit to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Obedience,</hi> to all <hi>Lawful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi> and <hi>Passive</hi> even in <hi>Unlawful</hi> ones, so that in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it would be <hi>Unlawful</hi> to joyn with any other Communion in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to it. And on the other side, if it prove false, it will plainly follow that it is unlawful,
<pb facs="tcp:49109:7"/>
either for those who are already in that Communion to <hi>continue</hi> in it, seeing they cannot continue in it without being accessary to the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of <hi>Christendom</hi> by abetting a <hi>Tyrannical Power</hi> over it; or for others to <hi>desert</hi> their own Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to come to the <hi>Roman,</hi> which cannot on those Principles, be done with any such pretence of <hi>Necessity</hi> as may excuse their Separation from being <hi>Schismatical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>The Evidence also into which this Dispute is ultimately resolved, must needs be such as must be suitable to the meanest capacity that is capable of acting prudently in this great affair</hi> (and certainly every one is in <hi>Interest,</hi> as well as <hi>Duty,</hi> obliged to make use of his utmost. <hi>Prudence</hi> in a matter wherein his greatest Interests are so
<pb facs="tcp:49109:7"/>
nearly concerned) For the meanest Prudence that is, will require that where they cannot choose their <hi>way,</hi> there at least they should choose their <hi>Guide.</hi> And it is only the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> as a <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of <hi>Unity,</hi> and of the <hi>Church</hi> adhering to him as a <hi>Guide</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,</hi> of which this <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> allows them a Liberty to <hi>judge,</hi> in order to their own private satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And as the <hi>matter</hi> is such, concerning which the meanest <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> that can deserve the name of <hi>Prudence,</hi> is <hi>obliged</hi> to judge, so the <hi>Evidence</hi> is such as every one must be <hi>capable</hi> of judging who is capable of being <hi>Prudently</hi> and <hi>Rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> a <hi>Christian.</hi> For the very <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> it self, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to us in this Age, must be proved by <hi>Historical Testimonies</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:8"/>
of the <hi>Miracles</hi> by which it was attested from the beginning; and the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> must be proved by the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of those by whom the Scriptures were delivered. And it is the same <hi>Historical Testimony,</hi> whether of <hi>express Scripture,</hi> or of <hi>express Tradition,</hi> to which they are here referred for the proof of this <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> of the <hi>Pope:</hi> and the <hi>Subject</hi> concerning which this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony was to be given, could not but have had so general an influence on their Practice (if they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged any dependence on this <hi>Supremacy</hi>) as that it must have been as notorious to them who gave it, as those <hi>Miracles,</hi> or that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;</hi> and therefore their <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> must have been as <hi>Credible</hi> in one Case as in the other.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:8"/>§. 6. Besides that the <hi>Negative Argument</hi> (which I here make use of) is much less Questionable than the <hi>Affirmative.</hi> That is, there is much more reason to <hi>doubt</hi> of a pretended <hi>Tradition,</hi> if it be not <hi>expresly</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Authors,</hi> (and <hi>doubting</hi> is sufficient for my purpose, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Credit of that which pretends to be an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>) than to believe a thing to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> because those <hi>Authors</hi> pretend it did so. For in their <hi>Affirmations</hi> they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times deliver what they think on their own <hi>Conjectural Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> wherein they are as <hi>Fallible</hi> as others. But what they have <hi>not mentioned,</hi> if it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to conclude that they <hi>knew</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:9"/>
it not, and that therefore there was then no <hi>Historical Evidence</hi> for it, seeing that could not have escaped their <hi>knowledge;</hi> yet thus much at least will follow that we cannot be satisfied that they had any such <hi>Evidence,</hi> which is enough to render it <hi>doubtful</hi> to us whether it were an <hi>Apostolical Tradition.</hi> Now that they did not mention this <hi>Supremacy,</hi> I do not desire the <hi>Ignorant</hi> to take the bare word of our Authors; but I am content that they trust their <hi>own Judgments</hi> concerning the passages produced, as far as they are capable of judging them; or where they find themselves <hi>una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that there they acquiesce in the Confessions of <hi>candid, learned Men,</hi> though of our Adversaries Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which is no more than what they
<pb facs="tcp:49109:9"/>
themselves count Prudent in the like Cases, when they occurr in the management of their secular affairs.</p>

Friends, but that it is unnecessary to say it on this occasion) yet the <hi>Thing</hi> must necessarily be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them on the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by which they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to censure the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and in that very <hi>sense</hi> wherein our Arguments are so conclusive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.

Indeed, if his Arguments had been <hi>Grammatical,</hi> there might have been some colour for
<pb facs="tcp:49109:14"/>
pretending that advantage was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ambiguity of the <hi>Word</hi> to pick out the most Invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sense among those many other more favourable ones of which it was capable; but being <hi>Notional</hi> and taken from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> they must necessarily be levelled against it in some certain signification. And it had been easie to have shewn that they do as clearly overthrow the <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Judgment in a Creature in the use of Fallible Means</hi> (which is the sense which I have here proved the <hi>Romanists</hi> obliged to maintain) though their <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> were derived from the <hi>Divine assistance;</hi> as if it were derived from their <hi>own Nature,</hi> as that of God is, which is the sense which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> would make to
<pb facs="tcp:49109:15"/>
be only concerned in these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It might easily have been also shewn that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> himself grants the very <hi>sense</hi> of the word here defined, and cannot deny but that it is very properly and naturally signified by it; nay that, by his own Principles, the Churches not using it in her Canons can be no Argument that she ever intended to leave pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons at their liberty to use it, or forbear it, as they pleased. Whence it were easie further to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, not only that it must needs be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable</hi> for private persons to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> it, but also that it must be justly <hi>Suspicious</hi> as much as to <hi>wave</hi> it (since it has been used,) though on pretence of another sense applicable to it, but never intended by them who brought it into the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> though at first they might
<pb facs="tcp:49109:15"/>
have forborn the introducing of it. And if it be not <hi>free</hi> to Subjects, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>deny</hi> or <hi>forbear</hi> it, what room can be left for their Indulgence so much celebrated in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? Nay, what Indulgence could it be, if they might indeed be excused from the <hi>Word,</hi> as long as they are obliged to maintain the <hi>Thing;</hi> I say <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> by doing that which cannot possibly be defended without suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it? Certainly they cannot think but that <hi>Actions</hi> are as significative as <hi>Words</hi> in reference to God and their own Consciences.</p>
                  <p n="11">§. 11. So also for the other point concerning the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> it is an usual Artifice whereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others are seduced, that they are perswaded that they may take the same Liberty that the <hi>French</hi>

their <hi>Convictions,</hi> when different from the Sense of those few inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essed Persons who are plainly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of the Government of that whole Communion, as that (till their <hi>Infallibility</hi> be first proved) it is not likely to pass for an Act of <hi>common honesty.</hi> Nay, their expecting such unreasonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions from them at first, would, to such Persons, be a very just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>suspecting</hi> them, when they should find themselves treated by them at the same rate as they might expect to be by the most professed <hi>Deceivers.</hi> For what more likely Art could any <hi>Deceiver</hi> use, than to perswade those, whom he had a mind to seduce, to trust in him without and against their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions? Nor is it likely that they who have no other inducement
<pb facs="tcp:49109:17"/>
than the <hi>intrinsick reasonableness</hi> of its <hi>proof</hi> should be perswaded to believe it as easily as they who have been inured to it by <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> of their <hi>Education.</hi> Nor is there that violence offered to their Faculties in following a <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>doubtful Proof</hi> in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular instance, as in renouncing their <hi>clearest Convictions</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally, in all matters to be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</hi> And therefore it is very possible for Persons favourable to the sense of the <hi>Romanists</hi> in many of the <hi>particular Disputes,</hi> still to be very averse to their pretences to <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;</hi> and this not (as it is usually said by our Adversaries) only out of a <hi>haughtiness</hi> and <hi>unwillingness</hi> to <hi>yield,</hi> but on <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>truly-Conscientious</hi> accounts.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:49109:22"/>
as strongly prove them obliged to <hi>separate</hi> from their own <hi>Brethren</hi> of that Perswasion. For these <hi>Councils</hi> have taken upon them to decide the Controversie concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> by declaring this <hi>Power</hi> to be in the <hi>Church diffusive,</hi> and themselves to be <hi>Lawful Representatives</hi> of that <hi>Church;</hi> and consequently that all Ecclesiastical Power, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy it self being also expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was subject to them. For can they think that Propositions, neither <hi>Necessary,</hi> as to their <hi>matter,</hi> nor <hi>Evident,</hi> as to their Proof, can oblige Subjects to their Belief under pain of incurring the Censure of <hi>Heresy,</hi> only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being defined by their <hi>Supreme Judge</hi> of <hi>Controversies?</hi> And is there any thing that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb facs="tcp:49109:23"/>
can pretend to have been more expresly defined by that <hi>Judge,</hi> than this is? If they will think to evade this Argument, by pretending that this Doctrine of the Power of their Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies is not so properly <hi>de fide</hi> it self, as a Principle antecedent to the belief of all Particulars that are so; yet this can derogate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from their obligation to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi> concerning it. For can they think themselves obliged to <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> for the denyal of one particular defined by that Authority? And is there not incomparably more reason they should do so for the denyal of the <hi>Authority</hi> it self? Is not the <hi>Authority</hi> it self more <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> than the <hi>particulars</hi> can be which, on these Principles, derive
<pb facs="tcp:49109:23"/>
their whole Credibility from it? And must it not be much more heinous to destroy the Credit of all possible Particulars, which, on these <hi>Principles,</hi> is included in the <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Controversies,</hi> than to refuse an actual Assent to any one Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? And as it hence appears, that the matter of these Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves is more <hi>momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,</hi> and more obliging to a <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> than themselves can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend those to be wherein they differ from us; so I may add farther, that the <hi>Separation,</hi> which ought in Conscience to follow hereupon, must be equally <hi>irreconcileable.</hi> For will it not come to the same Event, whether we utterly disown a visible <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,</hi> or whether we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed own one, but own such a one
<pb facs="tcp:49109:24"/>
as that our Adversaries cannot think themselves obliged to stand to his decision? In both Cases there is equally acknowledged a Liberty of <hi>Appeal</hi> from all Power that is acknowledged by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary. And that Power which must decide Controversies against an Adversary who does not think himself obliged (as much as in Conscience) to submit to such a Decision, must do it either by <hi>force</hi> or <hi>Arbitration,</hi> which are Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as allowable by our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as by those of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. Nay, in this Case they cannot plead even that pretence of Canonical Punctuality, at least so long to <hi>forbear</hi> separating from the Communion even of <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Hereticks,</hi> till their Cause were declared to be <hi>Heresy</hi> by
<pb facs="tcp:49109:24"/>
their <hi>competent Judge.</hi> For they who believe these <hi>Councils</hi> to have been the <hi>Supreme Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> must consequently conceive themselves obliged to believe that their <hi>Superiority</hi> over the <hi>Pope</hi> has been defined by a <hi>Canonical Authority;</hi> and they who do so, can have nothing left to excuse them for forbearing an <hi>actual Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi> And as it thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that they must hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>obliged</hi> to abstain from the Communion of those Persons who professedly and expresly own this Doctrine of the <hi>Popes Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>: So when they shall find that this <hi>Monarchy</hi> is indeed the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principle</hi> of the whole <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> as distinct from others; they must, by the same Principles, think themselves
<pb facs="tcp:49109:25"/>
obliged to abstain from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that <hi>whole Church,</hi> not only of those who do <hi>expresly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but also of others, though in <hi>terms</hi> denying it, as long as they keep to that Communion which cannot be kept without <hi>consequentially</hi> defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. It is in vain to think to weaken the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Decision</hi> of those Councils, because it was in a matter concerning their own <hi>Interest.</hi> For besides that this will give Us a plain advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against any <hi>Authority</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they can pretend that we are Canonically censured; They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are sensible, on other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that this is inseparably the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> to <hi>Judge</hi> even in matters of its <hi>own Interest;</hi> seeing there lies
<pb facs="tcp:49109:25"/>
no Appeal from it, even in such Cases, to any other Judicatory that might Judge more impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. And they who think the Supreme Judicatory <hi>Infallible,</hi> must think themselves also obliged, not only to a <hi>Canonical Acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> for Peace's sake, but also to an <hi>Internal Assent</hi> and Approbation of the Justice of such a Decree, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of Conscience. This I conceive at least sufficient to prove, in this Case of persons not proselyted, as well as in the former of persons already of that Communion, that they who do more firmly adhere to this Doctrine of the <hi>Superiority</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church diffusive,</hi> must think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged to <hi>separate</hi> from their <hi>communion</hi> when they are convinced of the inconsistency of this Doctrine with it. The only difference is that
<pb facs="tcp:49109:26"/>
this firmer adherence to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may more ordinarily and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be expected from Persons not yet Proselyted, than from those who are prejudiced in favour of the contrary by their Education in that Communion. These are those <hi>Dividing Principles</hi> intimated in the following <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Queries proposed to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,</hi>

A fourth Use of  this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is for the direction of <hi>Peacemakers,</hi> to let them see what it is that renders our reconciliation impossible; and which, if it be not first accommodated, must render all their endeavours in
<pb facs="tcp:49109:26"/>
particular Questions unsuccessful; and therefore against which they ought more earnestly to strive by how much they are more zealous for <hi>Catholick Peace.</hi> The way hitherto attempted has been to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reconcile our particular differences. This has been, either by clearing their respective <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> from all those things for which they have not <hi>expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,</hi> and of which <hi>express Professions</hi> are not exacted from Persons to be reconciled unto them, by how great Authority soever of their <hi>particular Communicants</hi> they have been countenanced or maintained. This way has been taken on their side by Mr. <hi>Veron,</hi> &amp;c. and on ours by Bishop <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague.</hi> Or where the Churches have declared themselves, there
<pb facs="tcp:49109:27"/>
by allowing the greatest Latitude of <hi>Exposition,</hi> and putting the most favourable Sense on their Decrees of which they are capable. Thus <hi>Grotius</hi> has dealt with the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>S. Clara</hi> with our <hi>English Articles.</hi> The design of all the endeavours of this kind has been to reconcile the <hi>Churches</hi> without any yielding on either side. I confess I think the number of Controversies may be exceedingly diminished by this way of proceeding, which must needs be very acceptable to any, who is more a Lover of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church's <hi>Peace</hi> than of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi> Many of the Tenets on both sides, that are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidiously represented by Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, will, on a closer examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appear to be either <hi>mistakes</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:27"/>
of the Writers meanings, or <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions</hi> of <hi>particular Writers,</hi> or <hi>senses</hi> of the <hi>Church's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> which were never designed by the <hi>Church</hi> that made them; and consequently unnecessary to be assented to in order to a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. But when all is done, they will fall very short of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the different <hi>Communions.</hi> For though all their <hi>particular Decrees,</hi> even concerning <hi>Faith,</hi> were made <hi>tolerable</hi> by these means, (1) yet that were not sufficient to prove their <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Lawful;</hi> and (2) yet there can be no hopes of reconciling all <hi>particular Decrees</hi> by these means, but some will still remain which will make their <hi>Communion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable</hi> to them of the other side.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:28"/>§. 20. 1. <hi>Though all their particular Decrees of Faith might, by these means, be made tolerable; yet that were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lawful.</hi> For neither is there any security that that <hi>sense</hi> of their <hi>Decrees,</hi> which might be taken for <hi>tolerable,</hi> would in <hi>Practice</hi> prove such as would be admitted by Governours; so as that they on the other side might, on their owning of that sense, be received to their Communion. No, though it were countenanced by <hi>Doctors</hi> of never so eminent note, nay, by the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> who should receive them. For still their <hi>Church</hi> ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be the most <hi>Authentick Expositer</hi> of her <hi>own meaning.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:28"/>
And I do not doubt but several of their <hi>Proselytes,</hi> who should go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to them on account of many of these <hi>moderate Explications,</hi> would find themselves mistaken in many things as soon as their <hi>Church</hi> had any obligation to explain her self concerning them. And though the <hi>Church</hi> might not think it worth her interposition to do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reconciliation of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Proselyte,</hi> yet She must certainly think her self obliged to it in order to the reconciliation of the <hi>whole Communions.</hi> Then many of these palliations would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be found so repugnant to her design<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so destitute of any plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible appearance, as though She had been willing to yield in <hi>earnest</hi> in instances wherein She might not <hi>seem</hi> to do so (and that is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

condescension that can in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be expected from a Church which pretends to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> at least <hi>while</hi> She pretends to be so) yet they would not afford them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so, as much as a <hi>Salvo</hi> for their reputation. Nay, though all her present <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>tolerable,</hi> and appeared so in that very sense wherein She really understood them; yet even this would not suffice for a solid <hi>reconciliation</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> as long as the same <hi>Authority,</hi> by which these other Decrees had been defined, is still owned to be <hi>Infallible.</hi> For still the next <hi>General Council</hi> (in the sense wherein they give that Title to such as are not truly <hi>Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental</hi>) may define new Articles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet defined, or at least <hi>declare</hi> such Propositions to be so, which, as

yet while they are not defined, may very innocently be <hi>disbelieved.</hi> And then, as they, who even now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what has been defined hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, not for the <hi>intrinsick Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the things defined; but for the <hi>Authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:49109:30"/>
distance as ever. Nor is this to be looked on as a Case unlikely to happen, considering that there are already many very suspicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines so universally received, as that their Learned men confidently tell us that some of them are <hi>ferè de fide,</hi> and doubt of others whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be not already <hi>altogether so.</hi> Where it is observable that the grounds of their judging so, are, either the expressness of those <hi>Decrees</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> which are already made concerning them, or the <hi>Universality</hi> of their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> or the stress which is laid upon them, which, in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, would prevail with such a <hi>General Council,</hi> if it had been assembled, to give their Suffrages for them.</p>
                  <p n="21">§. 21. 2. But though a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:49109:30"/>
of the Particulars hitherto defined might have been more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable for a solid Peace, than it hence appears likely that it would be, yet <hi>even this is not Practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by all the means of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation that have as yet been thought of.</hi> Some things have been defined in both Communions with such a design upon <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as that no mollifying Arts of Interpretation can prevail with any unprejudiced Person to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>Senses</hi> really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them are reconcileable. Nor indeed have the <hi>Romanists</hi> any reason to expect that we should agree with them in all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars defined by them, whilst we do not agree with them in ackowledging the Credibility of their <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Controversies.</hi> For, Antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:49109:31"/>
to their being defined, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess many of them so obscure as that they may pardonably be <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed</hi> and <hi>opposed.</hi> And how can any wise man expect that all Men should be of one mind in so many instances of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And yet even <hi>one</hi> unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Condition of Communion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone sufficient to make their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion unlawful, and the Churches irreconcileable.</p>
                  <p n="22">§ 22. Now that there are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things for which their Church her self is unavoidably concerned where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have all the reason, that can be desired, to expect that She should yield to us in order to the accommodation of our differences, I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> think I might confidently Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to as many <hi>Learned Men,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:31"/>
though of our <hi>Adversaries Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> as have had as well the <hi>Courage</hi> to speak their thoughts, as the <hi>Candor</hi> to follow their own Convictions. The Testimonies of many of them, to this purpose, are already so well known, as that I believe it will not be expected that I should exceed my present design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brevity by producing them. This therefore being supposed, it will plainly follow that no solid Peace can be expected with those of that <hi>Communion</hi> without some <hi>Concessions</hi> on their side; and therefore that which inevitably hardens them against all <hi>Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> must consequently ruine all hopes of a <hi>lasting Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</hi> Now this is done by their Doctrine of <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and their own Title to it.
<pb facs="tcp:49109:32"/>
This is it that makes them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to <hi>define</hi> such things as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confess to be <hi>inevident</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently to their own defining them. This makes it impossible for them (as long as they pretend to it) to submit those things as much as to a <hi>review,</hi> in this <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which were at first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in Ages of very great <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> This hinders them from <hi>yielding</hi> to the <hi>clearest Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to the contrary, or from <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging</hi> them even where they cannot chuse but yield to them. This keeps them from <hi>reforming</hi> any of those Errors, of which we have reason to believe themselves so sensible (since the great modern improvements of <hi>Ecclesiastical Learning</hi>) as that they would not have introduced them, if they had
<pb facs="tcp:49109:32"/>
not found them already admitted, and thought themselves obliged not to <hi>desert</hi> them, nor to believe any Evidence sufficient to prove them <hi>blame-worthy,</hi> when they had once found them so admitted. And therefore it will concern all hearty well-wishers to <hi>Catholick Peace,</hi> to lay out their Zeal and Industry principally to discredit this one Doctrine which is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pernicious to it.</p>
                  <p n="23">§. 23. And in order hereunto I have endeavoured to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the challenge of <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> to their whole <hi>Communion</hi> is truly grounded on a Principle disclaimed by considerable numbers of their <hi>Communicants;</hi> that is, the <hi>Popes absolute</hi> and <hi>unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Monarchy</hi> over the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:49109:33"/>
Church.</hi> Whence it will follow, that, though <hi>Infallibility</hi> did indeed belong to the <hi>Supreme Representative</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church diffusive,</hi> yet they can lay no claim to it who deny his <hi>Papal Monarchy.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who believe these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> to have been originally made only to the <hi>Catholick Church diffusive,</hi> and withal deny this <hi>absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> cannot lay any better claim to this <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> than any other part of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church diffusive</hi> that is as great and as considerable as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But themselves confess Churches no <hi>less ample</hi> for extent (and indeed <hi>more considerable</hi> for the multitude of <hi>Apostolical Sees</hi>) than their own, to be so far
<pb facs="tcp:49109:33"/>
from being <hi>Infallible,</hi> as that they believe them <hi>actually mistaken,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> and that for several Centuries together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the <hi>Authority</hi> which they can challenge on these Principles is only a <hi>Canonical</hi> one, such as is due to particular <hi>Provincial</hi> or <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Patriarchal districts,</hi> which are, on all sides, acknowledged to be <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi> Which will not only concern the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> but also all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councils that are only <hi>Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">§. 24. Now this Concession alone, that they are <hi>Fallible,</hi> would, at least, be sufficient to shew that they could not think it unlawful to <hi>review</hi> their own <hi>Decrees,</hi> and either to <hi>correct</hi> or <hi>repeal</hi> them, as they
<pb facs="tcp:49109:34"/>
should Judge it reasonable upon that review. And though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not for the Interest of the <hi>Publick</hi> that <hi>Governours</hi> should be <hi>too easie</hi> in rescinding their own Acts, and especially at the motion of such an challenge it as a Duty from them to rescind them, and when it cannot be done without an acknowledgment of their having been formerly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken; yet it is withal as little for that <hi>Interest,</hi> that they should wholly devest themselves of the Power of actually Practising it, when it shall appear necessary by the <hi>exigences</hi> of the <hi>Communities</hi> for which they are intrusted. And, if, in any Case, this may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be <hi>Expedient,</hi> there can be no reason to doubt but that it is so here. The thing is of

that <hi>importance,</hi> as that upon it depends the Reconciliation of the Divided Parties of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> which are neither likely to be subdued by the Power of any one, nor possible to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled without Concessions on <hi>some,</hi> if not on <hi>all,</hi> sides, by <hi>Churches,</hi> as well as by <hi>private Persons,</hi> and it cannot appear on which side the Concession is fit to be made, unless all submit to a <hi>tryal,</hi> and resolve, upon tryal, to yield to what they shall judge <hi>reasonable.</hi> Besides, there is a particular Reason why the <hi>Church</hi> should reserve an open Ear for all things that can be urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her information in matters of <hi>Faith.</hi> Not only in regard that the things are such as do not derive their <hi>Lawfulness</hi> or <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness</hi> from her <hi>Authority,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:35"/>
but are what they are, either <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False,</hi> Antecedently to it; so that her <hi>Authority,</hi> as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change the <hi>Nature</hi> of the things in themselves, so neither can it alter their <hi>obligation</hi> in reference to the Consciences of those who are otherwise perswaded: Nor that She must be Responsible to <hi>God,</hi> how little soever She be so to her <hi>Subjects,</hi> if She betray her <hi>trust</hi> in the <hi>Faith once delivered</hi> to her; and thereupon drive out of her Communion <hi>Persons,</hi> who ought to have been encouraged to continue it, and break off from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of other <hi>Churches</hi> with whom She ought to have maintained a correspondence: But also because her whole Authority depends on it. For if She be Erroneous in <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,</hi> especially if her Error
<pb facs="tcp:49109:35"/>
be by way of <hi>Defect</hi> in them, She is uncapable of being a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and consequently uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Ecclesiastical Authority.</hi> So that, as She tenders her whole Authority in <hi>other things,</hi> She is obliged to use all diligence to secure her self from Error in <hi>these,</hi> and it must be her best <hi>Policy</hi> to do so. Nay, the greatest <hi>Human Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi> that are, and who are most Critical in insisting on these <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualities</hi> of <hi>Policy</hi> in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they have once deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, yet think it no dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to a <hi>review,</hi> and to <hi>change</hi> their <hi>Judgments,</hi> upon <hi>better Information.</hi> And since the retriving of that sort of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which is requisite for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:49109:36"/>
came in with the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> her self is much better informed, and better qualified for Judging, than She was in those <hi>obscurer Ages</hi> wherein She first defined them.</p>
                  <p n="25">§. 25. Supposing therefore that She were thus disposed to come to a <hi>review,</hi> it plainly follows further, that the whole force of her <hi>new Decrees</hi> upon this review, must be resolved into the <hi>merit</hi> of the <hi>Cause.</hi> For when her <hi>Judgment</hi> has once been acknowledged <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> there can then remain no further pretence of any greater <hi>Certainty</hi> in her <hi>Conclusions,</hi> than in the <hi>Premises</hi> from whence they were deduced by her. And from hence it would be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb facs="tcp:49109:36"/>
to expect 1. that She would not upon this new review <hi>define</hi> what She should believe <hi>insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved</hi> Antecedently to her Definition. This being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to particulars, would cut off very many of her <hi>newly introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Articles</hi> which her most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Champions confess <hi>inevident</hi> Antecedently to her defining them. And we might expect the number of Articles, which would be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon this way of Tryal, the more considerable, if 2. all those <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Miracles</hi> and <hi>Revelations,</hi> and all those <hi>counterfeit Authors</hi> and <hi>Authorities</hi> were waved, which at the defining of these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were generally believed <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine,</hi> but are since as generally acknowledged to have been <hi>Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> All those Doctrines which,
<pb facs="tcp:49109:37"/>
upon such Testimonies as these, were taken for <hi>Apostolical,</hi> must lose their Credit of being so as soon as these <hi>Testimonies</hi> shall be convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of incompetency for assuring us what was <hi>Apostolical.</hi> Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally <hi>3.</hi> if none but the earliest Writers be trusted, as indeed none else are competent, for conveying <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> to us.

<pb facs="tcp:49109:38"/>
we do agree with the <hi>Romanists</hi> themselves, we can sufficiently prove them derived from the <hi>Apostles</hi> by <hi>competent Testimonies</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages through which they must have passed, without being any ways beholden to an <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> of <hi>Controversies.</hi> Nay that such an <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> is indeed a Means improper for such an End; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring many such things for its proof, to us, who must be supposed to live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at a distance from the time of its Original Institution, as are every way, at least, as liable to Dispute as the Controversies to be determined by it. So that hence it appears that we may be <hi>Christians,</hi> nay and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> too, that is, that we may believe as many Articles as at first were imposed as necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, without the least obligation
<pb facs="tcp:49109:38"/>
of being <hi>Romanists,</hi> that is, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all their superinduced No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Doctrines. And this is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use against them in the whole Dispute concerning the <hi>Resolution of Faith,</hi> where they pretend that the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the <hi>Sense</hi> of those Books, and consequently all the <hi>Articles</hi> which are proved from those <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> cannot be proved Credible <hi>to Us</hi> without the <hi>Authority</hi> of their <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Controversies;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that as we follow this <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in these things, so we ought to follow it in all other things equally recommended by it, which must therefore be equally Credible with them. This <hi>Consequence</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hold with them concerning whom the <hi>Supposition</hi> is true; and therefore it cannot be strange that
<pb facs="tcp:49109:39"/>
the <hi>Romanists,</hi> who profess to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our common Articles on the <hi>Credit</hi> of this <hi>Authority,</hi> should look on those whom they call <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> as <hi>choosers</hi> in Religion, and as <hi>self condemned,</hi> in refusing to believe <hi>other things</hi> as credible, and credible on the same Principles with <hi>those</hi> they do believe, they still supposing that they, whom they call <hi>Hereticks,</hi> believe the <hi>common Articles</hi> on the same Principles on which themselves believe them.

have proceeded to enquire after them, by knowing what it is that they are obliged by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to maintain on account of their being of that <hi>Communion;</hi> so that by finding these we have all their <hi>particular Doctrines</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to their <hi>first Principles.</hi> And the discovery of the <hi>weakness</hi> of the <hi>proofs</hi> producible for these (upon the former Supposition that they are obliged to <hi>prove</hi> them) is as clear a Discovery of the <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> from the <hi>first Principles</hi> as the nature of the thing will bear.</p>

A sixth and last Usefulness of this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> above others is, that it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a more easie proof, and a proof more likely to prevail <hi>ad homines.</hi> For the several Parties among our Adversaries will not only grant us

To them therefore I shall refer all those of that Communion, who shall doubt of the cogency of the proofs here produced, for further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. I could heartily wish that the <hi>odium</hi> of this <hi>reference</hi> might make them decline the Service; and
<pb facs="tcp:49109:41"/>
should take it for a highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable condescension, if such as they, who have devoted themselves to the Service of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> could be perswaded to declare their dislike of <hi>Principles</hi> so pernicious to <hi>Catholick Peace.</hi> But I fear it is a favour too great to be expected from them. If any therefore doubt of the other <hi>Premiss, viz.</hi> the <hi>indefensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of this challenge to <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and of this <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church virtual,</hi> on which that challenge must be grounded, he may be pleased to consult those of their Writers who defend the <hi>Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of <hi>General Councils,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Catholick Church diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.</hi> So that this way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be most sutable for <hi>all sorts</hi> of Adversaries. If they read it with a <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>satisfaction,</hi> they
<pb facs="tcp:49109:41"/>
will find <hi>that</hi> more easie when they shall consider that it proceeds only on that which themselves do partly grant true already, so that there will only one <hi>Premiss</hi> remain concerning which they can desire further satisfaction.

                     <hi>divide</hi> our <hi>Communions.</hi> They would have them take the <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Controversies</hi>'s word for the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</hi> That may be when they have found him.

<pb facs="tcp:49109:43"/>
why may not They be trusted also? If they be all trusted, their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions being so inconsistent, the <hi>Laick,</hi> who trusts them, must still be lest as irresolute as ever. Must they therefore follow the judgment of their <hi>most Credible Divines</hi> concerning it?

Besides the greatest <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> will not by themselves be allowed for any more than a <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49109:43"/>
and therefore a <hi>very fallible,</hi> inducement. But how much more so, when there are other <hi>Divines</hi> as eminent as themselves of <hi>another Judgment?</hi> And even <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> it self, if it be received on a <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible recommendation,</hi> will still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to no higher than a <hi>Fallible Proof;</hi> which even themselves cannot judge sufficient for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in such a Case as this is. If both <hi>Pretenders</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> be trusted on both sides as far as their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are <hi>not inconsistent</hi> with each other, this will effectually serve my purpose, and convince the <hi>Laick,</hi> who trusts them, of the <hi>insecurity</hi> of their <hi>whole Communion.</hi> For he must thus be obliged to grant both the <hi>Premisses</hi> of the <hi>Argument</hi> by which I have here proved it <hi>unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is this,</p>

                  <head>A PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IT is of no further concernment to acquaint the Publick with the occasion of penning these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, than as the occasion might have an influence on the design; and as it may be very useful to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Reader of the <hi>design,</hi> that he may the better know what to expect in the <hi>performance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He may therefore be pleased to understand that the following Queries were tendred to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist,</hi> who had a design of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb facs="tcp:49109:64"/>
her; and that they were answered by another hand, but on such Principles, or in such a way of management, as that it did not give her the desired satisfaction. This gave occasion to some that were concerned for her to shew the Paper to some others in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the inviting them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it in a way that might be likely to prove more successful. By this means of communication it came at length to my hands from a Person who first desired my Opinion concerning it, and then with some earnestness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
<pb facs="tcp:49109:64"/>
me to commit my thoughts to writing. Pursuant therefore to this occasion, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was in the first place to shew from sound Principles, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is able to defend her Reformation from the Errors of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and to clear her self, as far as She is charged with that Breach of Communion which followed thereupon, without giving any advantage to the <hi>Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> to justifie either their first Separation from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, or their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Subdivisions from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another.
<pb facs="tcp:49109:65"/>
Nor was I willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a Person in the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans condition, in any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies that might be spared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Injury to the <hi>merit</hi> of the <hi>Cause;</hi> or to debate even such as could not so be spared, by such Arguments as might exceed her opportunities of Enquiring, or her capacity of Judging, so as to oblige her to depend on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of others more Inquisitive and Judicious. But I have either waved <hi>Authorities</hi> where I could debate the Case by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments less liable to Dispute, and
<pb facs="tcp:49109:65"/>
better suited to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Gentlewoman; or where I have been necessitated to insist on them, I have endeavoured to make out their Credibility by such <hi>Presumptions</hi> as are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be understood, and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar in parallel Cases, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted as most <hi>Prudent,</hi> whenever <hi>unskilful Persons</hi> find themselves obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in the conduct of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>more skilful</hi> and <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> than themselves. And I have purposely avoided all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Authors,</hi> even where
<pb facs="tcp:49109:66"/>
necessary, but such as were to be had, even in <hi>English,</hi> and therefore might be consulted by the Gentlewoman her self.</p>
                  <p>I confess those other Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings fit for Scholars, as they are more <hi>subtle,</hi> so they are withal more <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>conclusive.</hi> But withal I consider, 1. that those things wherein <hi>Scholars</hi> have the advantage of <hi>unlearned Persons,</hi> are principally such wherein <hi>Reading</hi> is absolutely necessary for their Historical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance to us. It is certainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any to know what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb facs="tcp:49109:66"/>
were maintained in the <hi>Apostles times</hi> (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently what Doctrines are <hi>true,</hi> where they are supposed capable of no other Evidence of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, but because they were so maintained) without insight into the several Histories &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the intermediate Ages through which they are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. But for other things whose evidence of their being true, does not depend on such a conveyance, the Reason of the thing is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence; and of this every <hi>equally rational Person,</hi> how
<pb facs="tcp:49109:67"/>
little soever he be conversant in Authors, is an <hi>equally compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge.</hi> And of this kind are many of the things here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, on which the stress of the Cause depends. The prudent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will easily discern which they are, without my instancing. And 2. even in those things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on <hi>Positive Revelation,</hi> and wherein the only means of our Assurance of them is <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Tradition;</hi> though it be indeed true that Persons of little Reading cannot so competently assure themselves of the writings
<pb facs="tcp:49109:67"/>
and opinions of former Ages, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the assistance of others more conversant in those Studies: yet since it is not the way of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent rational Persons, therefore to conclude a thing to have been revealed by the Apostles, because such Authors tell us that it was so; much less because such Authors maintained it, as their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but first to assure themselves of such things on which the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility of such Authors in such matters may be made clear to us, and then of those Expressions from whence they conclude such
<pb facs="tcp:49109:68"/>
Authors to have given Testimony to such a thing as an Apostolical Tradition: it is plain that the judgment of these things depends wholly on the reason of the things themselves. And therefore where Learned Men are agreed, as to their accounts of the Authors and their Expressions; and where the only remaining Dispute is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such undoubted Works of such Authors be competent for the conveyance of a Tradition, and whether such Expressions, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all their circumstances, come home to the Controversies
<pb facs="tcp:49109:68"/>
at present debated; these are things whereof common Prudence and a cultivated natural Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may as well qualifie Men to pass a Censure as the greatest Reading imaginable. And this seems to me the best way in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this nature, to wave such things as were disputed among Learned men concerning their Historical Informations, and only to found my reasonings on their unanimous Concessions. And most of the Controversies betwixt <hi>Us</hi> and the <hi>Romanists</hi> are of that nature as to be capable of this
<pb facs="tcp:49109:69"/>
way of management. Now this way of not intermedling in the <hi>Disputes</hi> of Learned men, but only proceeding on their <hi>unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned concessions</hi> is (as most <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>satisfactory</hi> to the most accurate <hi>Learned</hi> men themselves, so) most <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> for those who are <hi>unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And <hi>3.</hi> even as to those other things wherein I have indeed proceeded on <hi>popular Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,</hi> yet considering that these are the only reasons which God has fitted to the capacities of the greatest part of Mankind, and
<pb facs="tcp:49109:69"/>
that God is in his Goodness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to give them reasons suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for their direction, and that the nature of the things themselves is of importance to his Government, and that it is therefore requisite that their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection be such as may not only <hi>excuse</hi> their <hi>mistakes,</hi> but <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> them of the <hi>Truth</hi> itself; I say, these things being consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there will be reason to believe that however fallible such <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Presumptions</hi> may be in their own nature, yet that God in his Goodness has so ordered
<pb facs="tcp:49109:70"/>
the matter in affairs of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that those who are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by these Presumptions may by the use of them be secured of the Truth it self in these particulars.</p>
                  <p>As for the Method observed in this Discourse, it is such as I conceived most clear and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive in few words, and yet withal most accurate and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to a doubting Person. For any one may be much more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of a <hi>Consequence</hi> when he is first secured of all its <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and he can much better judge of them when he has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb facs="tcp:49109:70"/>
prospect of them in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural order wherein they lye, and wherein they are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the deduction of such a Consequence. Yet I have neither deduced my Principles <hi>too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely,</hi> but <hi>as near</hi> as I could find them <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;</hi> nor have insisted on the proof of those that were <hi>clear,</hi> any further than I conceived it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to do so from the actual Disputes concerning the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> And I have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rather to <hi>prove</hi> than to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute;</hi> which I conceived to be a
<pb facs="tcp:49109:71"/>
course, as <hi>less Invidious</hi> to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries</hi> (who should find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no further concerned than as the <hi>consequences</hi> of <hi>positive Truths</hi> might make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd) so also <hi>more satisfactory</hi> to a Person in the Gentlewomans condition. And in the whole I am so little conscious of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of displeasing any to whom Truth it self might not prove dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing, as that if any Adversary shall think it worth his time to Answer what I have said, I am not my self affraid of provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from any thing which he can say in following my Precedent.</p>

                     <p>THE design of asking this Question is certainly to make our Confession of <hi>Novelty</hi> (in such Cases wherein our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries presume our <hi>Novelty</hi> so notorious as that we our Selves cannot deny it) an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Us; yet they themselves are concerned in some Cases to deny its cogency.

as to all intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses wherein <hi>Antiquity</hi> may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable, but that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is not so; and that in the sense wherein the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has begun since <hi>Luther,</hi> there is no reason to expect that She should have been <hi>Antienter,</hi> and that the <hi>Justice</hi> of her <hi>Cause</hi> does not require it; and that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> upon these Suppositions confessedly allowed to the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is no Argument for the <hi>Justice</hi> of her <hi>Cause</hi>: these things, I think, will contain a fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Answer to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans Question. I shall not at present engage on an accurate Discussion of these Heads: but shall only suggest such short Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations as may let her see how unreasonable our Adversaries

confidence is in this Argument, wherein they do so usually tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Therefore</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Antiquity</hi> is indeed necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be pleaded for <hi>Doctrines,</hi> such especially as are pretended to belong to the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and which are urged as <hi>Conditions of Communion.</hi> This is the Case wherein it is urged by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> in their very rational Discourses on this Argument. And for this, I think, we may challenge the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> her self to instance in one <hi>positive Doctrine</hi> imposed by us which She her self thinks not <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi> I am sure the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is so stated commonly, that we are blamed, not for Believing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing <hi>antient</hi> or <hi>necessary</hi> which is not, but, for not believing some
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49109:96"/>
things which She believes to be so. And if She her self believe all our <hi>Positives,</hi> and withal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that nothing is so to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved but what is <hi>Antient</hi>; it will clearly follow that She cannot, in consistency with her own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests, deny the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of our <hi>Positive Doctrines.</hi> But for the other <hi>Doctrines superadded</hi> by them, and denied by us, which are indeed the true occasion of the present Divisions of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we charge them with <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and are very confident that they will never be able to prove them, to the satisfaction of any Impartial Person, either from clear Scripture, or from <hi>genuine Antiquity</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>purest Ages,</hi> which are the way wherein we are willing to undertake the

proof of our <hi>positive Doctrines,</hi> Nay, their greatest Champions decline the tryal, and complain of the defectiveness and obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Primitive Christian Writers, which they would not have reason to do if they thought them clear on their side.</p>
                     <p>These things therefore being thus supposed, <hi>That no Doctrines ought to be imposed but what are</hi> Ancient; <hi>That ours are so by our Adversaries own Confession, and that our Adversaries Doctrines are not so; and that in Judging this, the</hi> private Judgments <hi>of</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons <hi>are to be trusted, as the measures of their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Practice</hi> (as it is plain that those Discourses of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally designed for the satisfaction

reason to fear that their Censures should be confirmed by God. And though I confess every Error in the <hi>Cause</hi> of the Churches Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures will not excuse the <hi>Censured Person</hi> for continuing out of her Communion, when the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be recovered by any <hi>Submission,</hi> how <hi>inconvenient</hi> and <hi>harsh</hi> soever, if it be not <hi>sinful</hi>; yet that is the very Case here, that we are not only <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> Excommunicated, but the terms proposed for our restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Communion would be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly sinful,</hi> as has been shewn before.<note place="margin">Vid.

                        <hi>REformation</hi> may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two wayes: Either<list>
                           <item n="1">1. As <hi>preached</hi> and <hi>imposed</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of <hi>Spiritual Censures,</hi> and of Exclusion from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, and a depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Priviledges conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to that Communion. And this is certainly the Right of the <hi>Church,</hi> and was accordingly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed by the <hi>Church</hi> in our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Reformation</hi>:</item>
                           <item n="2">2. As Enacted as a <hi>Law</hi> of

the <hi>Land,</hi> and consequently as urged the same way as other <hi>Laws</hi> are, under <hi>temporal Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>external Coercion,</hi> and encouraged by <hi>temporal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</hi> And this is undoubtedly the Right of the <hi>Secular power.</hi> And this was all in which the <hi>Secular power</hi> did concern it self in the <hi>Reformation.</hi>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>What I can further foresee in favour of our Adversaries is, that 1. The <hi>Secular Power</hi> ought in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> to be herein advised by the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi>: and 2. That though <hi>external obedience</hi> may be paid to the mistaken Decrees of the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power</hi> following the mistaken part of the <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> yet the Obligation (in Conscience and Right) of such Decrees must be derived from the <hi>Justice</hi> of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49109:127"/>
Churches proceedings in advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Magistrate</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that no Act of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> can make amends for any Essential defect in the proceedings of the <hi>Church.</hi> But the only Effect of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates concurrence in that Case is, that what is already perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without <hi>Heresy</hi> or <hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> may be by that means settled in such a particular <hi>Commonwealth</hi> without <hi>Schism</hi> or <hi>Sedition</hi> in the <hi>State.</hi> And therefore seeing they suppose that at the <hi>Reformation</hi> the greater number of the <hi>Bishops</hi> then being, were overawed and deprived of the Liberty of their Votes by the <hi>Secular Magistrate,</hi> and it is the nature of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties to be swayed by the greater Part; therefore they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49109:127"/>
may think it unreasonable to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the <hi>Reformation</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but only to a <hi>Schismatical part</hi> of it; so that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted this <hi>Reformation</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant from the <hi>Church,</hi> they think they do well to call our <hi>Reformation</hi> it self <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this therefore I Reply,<list>
                           <item n="1">1. That the use we make of this Topick of the <hi>Magistrates</hi> concurrence, is indeed no other than to clear our <hi>Reformation</hi> from being <hi>Seditious,</hi> which is ordinarily charged on Us by our Adversaries, and much more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily on the <hi>forreign Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item n="2">
                              <pb n="114" facs="tcp:49109:128"/>2. That for clearing the very proceedings of the <hi>Magistracy</hi> from being <hi>Heretical</hi> or <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> to the Conscience of the <hi>Magistracy</hi> it self, it is sufficient that the <hi>Magistracy</hi> gave its <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> to no other <hi>Church,</hi> but such as, at least, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the genuine Dictate of their Conscience, was neither <hi>Heretical</hi> nor <hi>Schismatical.</hi> But this Justification of the <hi>private Conscience</hi> of the <hi>Magistracy</hi> is, I confess, a thing we are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent not so necessarily concerned for; and therefore</item>
                           <item n="3">3. We grant farther, that for satisfying our own Consciences of the <hi>Justice</hi> of these proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Magistracy,</hi> it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitethat we be satisfied that they were Advised by that part
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49109:128"/>
of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whose <hi>Advice</hi> we conceive they ought to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. So that if this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Case we are speaking of, this, and this alone, will be a sufficient Vindication of the <hi>Magistrates</hi> proceedings to the Consciences of its <hi>Subjects.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item n="4">4. Therefore the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Advice</hi> followed by the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> may be resolved two wayes: Either from the <hi>merit</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi>; or from the <hi>Legal Authority</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> the <hi>Persons</hi> may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to have to be consulted on such occasions. As for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it is in the present Case the principal Dispute, Whether the <hi>Reformation</hi> undertaken by the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> was right or not? and therefore very unfit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49109:129"/>
on as a <hi>Presumption</hi> to prove the <hi>Magistrates</hi> proceedings Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. The later therefore only is proper to be insisted on here. And it consists of two charges: That by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> the <hi>Magistrate</hi> ought to have been advised by the <hi>Bishops</hi> then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of the several Sees; and That in advising with the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whoever they were, he ought to have allowed them the Liberty of speaking their minds, and to have been swayed by the greater part.

                              </gap>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so necessary, as that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> not observing them, may be presumed to act as no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the <hi>Clergy.</hi> Which is the Reason why they call our <hi>Reformation,</hi> wherein they suppose them not observed, <hi>Parliamentary.</hi>

                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:49109:129"/>1. <hi>Therefore</hi> as to the <hi>Legal Right</hi> of the <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> to advise the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Magistrate, two things may be Replyed</hi>:<list>
                           <item n="1">1. That this <hi>Legal Right</hi> may be forfeited by the Persons by their Personal misdemeanors, and of this forfeiture the <hi>Secular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> himself is the <hi>proper Judge</hi>; and that this was exactly the <hi>Popish Bishops</hi> Case at that time.</item>
                           <item n="2">2. That the consideration of this <hi>Legal Right</hi> is of no use for satisfying the <hi>Consciences</hi> of their <hi>Subjects,</hi> which yet is the <hi>only use</hi> that is seasonable for this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for the <hi>Canonical freedom</hi> to be allowed them in advising, and the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49109:130"/>
obligation of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> to follow the advice of the greater part: These <hi>Canonical Rights</hi> can only satisfie the Consciences of their own Communion, but cannot be pretended necessary to be observed, where there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Communions. <hi>For</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item n="1">1. The <hi>Romanists</hi> themselves never allow that freedom to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons out of their Communion, as was plain in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and still appears on all occasions.</item>
                           <item n="2">2. Especially in particular <hi>National Churches,</hi> as ours was, they themselves will not deny that the greater part may prove <hi>Heretical,</hi> and therefore likely to prevail by <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Votes</hi>;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49109:130"/>
in which Case themselves would notwithstanding think it unequal for the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to be swayed by them.</item>
                           <item n="3">3.
