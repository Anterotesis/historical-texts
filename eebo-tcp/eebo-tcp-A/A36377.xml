            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THoſe whom the indulgent Providence
of God has favour'd with great Riches
and Honours, as it has your Lordſhip,
are under a great neceſſity to have
their minds well accompliſht with Vertue, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Piety. No man can uſe an high Fortune
well, to his comfort and honour in this life, or his
happineſs in the next (which in ſome meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon this too), but he that is a wiſe and
good man. The more of theſe outward things
any perſon has in poſſeſſion, the greater degrees
of inward endowments are neceſſary to direct him
in the uſe of them; for greater ſervice to God,
and more good to men, is expected by the Donor
from him: and he is expoſed to the more and
the ſtronger temptations to evil. Great Fortunes
are like mighty Engines, which if they are wiſely
and carefully managed, will perform great and
uſeful effects: But if not, inſtead of ſerving their
end, they may daſh out the brains of him that
uſes them. They uſually ſerve to make men the
beſt, or the worſt of Mankind; either the moſt
glorious inſtances of Vertue and Religion, or the
moſt enormous ſinners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99246:3"/>
To ſome unhappy men that want theſe inward
Endowments, their great Poſſeſſions are only the
Inſtruments of wickedneſs: They ſerve to gratifie
and cheriſh fooliſh and hurtful Luſts. So the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors
of them become the ſlaves of ſin, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Captives to the Devil. The miſtaken men,
groſly impoſed upon by his ſubtil and malicious
arts, are brought into a ſordid and pernicious bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
whilſt they fancied themſelves enjoying an
uncontrolled liberty.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo theſe men unfit themſelves for all
good and heroick enterprizes and performances:
They blaſt their own glory, and interrupt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the praiſe and renown which they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
It is often their fate to ſee themſelves negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
as uſeleſs, whilſt meaner perſons, better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht,
and more fit for great truſts, are preferred
to them.</p>
            <p>Such men ſpend a few years in a wild extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
jollity, having the moſt of their pleaſures forced,
and ſo the leſs pleaſant: And the reſt of their days
they commonly waſt, perhaps in ſhame and poverty;
ſometimes in pain and ſickneſs too; and with theſe,
under the laſhes of an angry Conſcience. And if that
becomes ſo ſtupid and hard, as to ſcruple nothing
that is wild and wicked, they make the more haſte
to a miſerable death, and hurry to an endleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99246:3"/>
Thus Riches become the hurt of the owner for
whom they are kept, which was one of the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that <hi>Solomon</hi> long ago obſerved in the World.
And ſurely a great one it is, that a man ſhould
make himſelf miſerable by thoſe things that
might yeild him comfort in this life, and ſubſerve
his eternal happineſs: That he ſhould thus defeat
all the wiſe care, and tender kindneſs of thoſe
friends that gather'd, or preſerved his Riches for
him. 'Tis a ſad and deplorable thing, to ſee men
throw away the happineſs which they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
and wilfully run into thoſe miſeries that might
be avoided. But I hope, and heartily wiſh for a
better fate to your Lordſhip, to whom I account
my ſelf much obliged, and to whom therefore I
am very deſirous to be in ſome way ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>My Lord,</p>
            <p>It was to aſſiſt your Lordſhip, as well as my
weak abilities could, upon your lanching into a
dangerous World, your own Pilot, that you might
not thus make ſhipwrack of a good Conſcience, a
good Reputation, a large Eſtate, and a noble Soul,
that I firſt compoſed this Diſcourſe, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in your hearing. And for the ſame purpoſe
I do now, upon the deſire of ſome of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
very Honourable Relations, humbly preſent
it thus again. If it is in it ſelf ſuch as may be
ſerviceable towards Piety and Vertue, it may now
<pb facs="tcp:99246:4"/>
be the more ſerviceable to your Lordſhip, having
this advantage, that it may be deliberately conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
and the reaſon and importance of the Rules
it contains, may be better diſcern'd, than from a
tranſient delivery. I preſume it will be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to your Lordſhip's Prudence in this publick
way, if it be uſeful to ſo honeſt and good a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
both for your own, and other mens ſakes,
who, with your Lordſhip, may receive ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
thereby. And I humbly conceive it will be
acceptable alſo to your Lordſhip's great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending
Goodneſs, as a Teſtimony of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
deſire of your Lordſhip's Honour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;

            <head>PREFACE to the RICH.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO apply a helping hand towards the reformation of a prophane and
licentious Age, is an act of Charity, like that of endeavouring to
quench a raging fire. Vice and wickedneſs, like that devouring Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ruin the private Families where they are entertained; and
when they break out upon the publick, and become general, they
turn all the glory of a Nation, into the aſhes of confuſion, if a general reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
does not prevent. And you are the perſons as from whom our Vices, and our
Ruin do ever chiefly flow (pardon the ſevere truth): ſo alſo at whom we must
always begin effectually to reform. Whatever elſe may be imputed to me for thus
joyning my endeavour towards this, I hope you will alſo impute a good will and
love to my Country, and ſuffer that, in your opinion, to expiate the rest.</p>
            <p>There are Two things the uſual cauſes of your miſcarriage and ruin: one is
thewant of an early government of deſire; the other, the inſinuations of flatterers.</p>
            <p>Becauſe thoſe that are rich, have a large ability to gratifie their deſires, they
are apt to indulge theſe; to let them run without due controul and reſtraint: and
ſo their Riches prove a temptation and incitement, as well as an inſtrument of
wickedneſs. For ungoverned deſires will ſoon grow extravagant and unlawful,
and then puſh men to unlawful practiſes. Unleſs you are accuſtomed to early and
reſolute denials of concupiſcence, to moderate your very deſires by the Rules of
Religion, you are in a dangerous likelihood to fall into the worſt degrees of folly
and wickedneſs. What men do at firſt allow themſelves but to deſire, intending
to ſtop at wiſhes, that in a little time they commonly proceed to practice. And from
leſſer ſins in practice, they proceed to greater, one ſin making way for another.</p>
            <p>But there is nothing that you who are rich and great, are more expoſed to, than
flattery; nor can any thing be more fatal and miſchievous, than that uſually is,
if you have not a great deal of wiſdom to defend you from the miſchief of it.
Flatterers are a ſort of Vermine which the poor are happily free from: They moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haunt the houſes of the rich; and eſpecially thoſe where a great Fortune is,
under the management of an unthinking head, or ſtrong vicious inclinations.
Where ſuch a carcaſs is, thither will theſe Eagles be gather'd: There they obtain
the eaſieſt admittance; they have greatest ſucceſs, and do the most miſchief. This
worst ſort of men, while they pleaſe an eaſie perſon, by raiſing and maintaining
in him a high, tho groundleſs conceit of himſelf, obtain to be reputed great friends,
and the honestest, kindeſt men of his acquaintance. They ſet themſelves only to
applaud and commend, to extenuate the groſſest Vices, and put the names of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
on the leſſer that are in him they flatter; to repreſent whatever little and
defective goodneſs there is in him, as perfect and eminent. Thus they hinder him
that is ſo unhappy as to give them regard, from all endeavour to improve in
goodneſs, or to amend what is amiſs. A true friend would always pleaſe by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending;
but if he ſees reaſon for the contrary, he will ſometimes reprove, tho
it ſhould diſpleaſe, rather than do harm to him he loves, or than not endeavour
to do him good. It was an argument of great wiſdom in <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> (which <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi>
reports of him), That he was always wont to receive kindly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
<pb facs="tcp:99246:5"/>
and applauſes only of thoſe who he had obſerved would upon ſome
occaſions reprove and blame him. He well knew and conſider'd, that no man
can always deſerve to be commended; that the very beſt are not without ſome
defects and errors. A wicked flatterer (and wicked ſuch men moſt commonly
are) will urge you to the gratifying inferior and wicked appetites; he takes the
part of Vice againſt right Reaſon and Vertue. He will encourage you in the ſins
you are inclined to, and ſtrive to juſtifie them, and harden you againſt the checks
of Conſcience. Such an one is alſo uſually very officious and ſerviceable to any
wickedneſs, to aſſiſt and contrive for the commiſſion of it, and then to hide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it: But in things that are good and brave, in the projects of Vertue, he is not
forward to be imploy'd. He will perhaps induſtriouſly tempt a man to ſome ſin
wherein he can aſſiſt, that himſelf may be the more neceſſary, and may get
the more by the curſed imployment.</p>
            <p>Behold, Reader, how young and rich perſons are led to their ruin! By theſe
arts do miſchievous flatterers allure weak men into their power, and under their
government, either to make them a prey to their avarice or neceſſity, or elſe a
Tool to their crafty and wicked deſigns. Thus it often comes to paſs, that a great
Eſtate, which might be uſed with a great deal of honour, and after left to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
is waſted upon the ſcum and abject part of mankind; upon Pimps,
Bawds, Whores, Players, Fidlers, and Buffoons: A Tribe ſcarce fit to be named
in theſe Papers, much leſs to be the ordinary companions of Nobility and Gentry.
'Tis impoſſible that any man ſhould live in good repute, or illuſtrate his life with
any great and vertuous actions, who gives himſelf up to the conduct of ſuch
vile wretches as have no Vertue nor Honour.</p>
            <p>Now to prevent the miſchievous effects of theſe Two cauſes, Every man muſt
know, how duty to God obliges him to behave himſelf in the uſe of his gifts: He
muſt be convinced what is for his true intereſt, and what it becomes him in
point of true honour to do in this matter, to obtain approbation from God and
good men. He muſt alſo be perſwaded, ſo to deſire, and ſo to practiſe. This (Reader)
I have endeavour'd to ſuggest in the following ſheets. I have given you in the
ſeveral parts of the Diſcourſe, by piece-meal, I think almoſt a perfect character
of the pitiable and lamentable Object, a debaucht Gentleman; and alſo on the
contrary, that of one well accompliſht with thoſe great and true Ornaments that
illustrate a high Birth and Fortune. I muſt leave the Reader to chuſe which
he likes best, tho I have endeavour'd to perſwade him to that which is ſo.</p>
            <p>I intend not to trouble the Reader with Apology for any defects or failings in
the Diſcourſe; not becauſe I think it needs-none, but becauſe I judg it would be
vain and uſeleſs. Whatever real defects it has, it would be ſaid they ought to
have been amended, not excuſed. And all the Apology in the World, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
but there would be may ſeeming ones, becuſe of the many different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
and opinions of men. This I am ſure of, That whoever are inclin'd
to find fault, they would do it after all the excuſes that could be made; and ſuch
as are candid, and inclin'd to favour me, will over-look and pardon the defects,
and ſatisfie themſelves with what is good and uſeful. And <hi>they</hi> will excuſe
me to themſelves and others.</p>

of all. 'Tis his Providence that diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to every perſon in the World that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of preſent goods which he enjoyes; and
he has appointed Rules, according to which
every man ought to govern himſelf in the
uſe of that Portion. Creation gives him an unqueſtionable right
to Government, and we are indiſpenſably oblig'd to obey him
that made us. We are further obliged to obey him in the uſe
of preſent enjoyments, becauſe they are all his Gifts; who
can have more right in all things to rule us, than he from
whom we derive our being, and all that we enjoy?</p>
            <p>Further, 'tis as neceſſary as it is juſt and equitable, that
ſome Rules ſhould be given men in this affair: For how wild
and extravagant are they that only follow the dictates of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd
inclination; they live as without God in the World,
they forget all the obligations of gratitude and homage to him;
they are uſeleſs at leaſt to Mankind, fit for no good or great
employment; they apply themſelves to nothing that is good,
but follow their own Pleaſure; to gratifie their exorbitant
Luſts, they will ruine the Innocent, grind the faces of the
Poor, rob any that they can of their juſt Right by fraud or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
they will deſpiſe the limitations of the Laws of men, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99246:6"/>
good order, which are the ſtrength and glory of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
The unlimited obedience to inclination and appetite, has
been the overthrow of mighty Kingdoms, it has been the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of ancient and flouriſhing Families; it has often brought
particular perſons from greatneſs, riches and proſperity, to a
contemptible meanneſs, a miſerable Poverty, to painful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
and a haſty Death.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Remedy in this caſe provided, worſe than the
Diſeaſe: The Rules preſcribed are as excellent and good in
themſelves, as they are juſtly and neceſſarily preſcribed; they
tend directly to prevent theſe miſchiefs and Calamities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having any tendency to cauſe other, without impoſing
upon us any thing that is unbecoming or truly prejudicial.
The rules that God has given are certainly the fitteſt for us,
they enjoin nothing unnatural, for they are adapted by Infinite
Wiſdom; They are, we may aſſure our ſelves, as indulgent to
us, as they can be and be good; they prohibit nothing but
what is hurtful; they cannot be ſuppoſed to confine the uſe of
Gods gifts within too narrow and needleſs limits, becauſe they
are enjoined by infinite Goodneſs. 'Tis inconſiſtent with that
goodneſs which has beſtowed theſe things on Mankind for uſe
and delight, to hinder him by any rules from uſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in them ſo far as is good and convenient for him: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which accounts it becomes every man to endeavour, firſt,
to know the rules by which God expects he ſhould guide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the uſe of his enjoyments; and after that to obſerve
them.</p>
            <p>This Verſe that I have read, is part of a ſentence which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at the 29<hi>th.</hi> Verſe of the Chapter; which is an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to men, to regard with great indifferency the things of
this preſent Life: <hi>It remains</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>that they
which have Wives, be as thô they had none; and they that weep,
as thô they wept not; and they that rejoyce as thô they rejoyced not;
and they that buy, as thô they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this
World, as not abuſing it.</hi> Let not your Paſſions be much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by any thing here, that you may not abuſe it while you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99246:6"/>
enjoy, nor be uneaſie with diſcontent or grief for the loſs or
want of it. And he begins and cloſes the ſentence with a fit
argument to enforce the Exhortation, <hi>The time is ſhort, and
the faſhion of this World paſſes away;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, 'Tis
but a little while that we ſhall live in this world, and all things
here are lyable to change, there is no Condition but is of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
continuance, whether it be proſperous or adverſe.
Therefore let all men keep themſelves as indifferent to theſe
things as they can, and endeavour to uſe wiſely and innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whatever Portion God beſtows on them while they enjoy it.</p>
            <p>Theſe words afford to our Meditation this inſtruction.</p>
            <p>It ought to be the Care of all perſons to make a regular and good
uſe of thoſe outward enjoyments which the Providence of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
them.</p>
            <p>The following Diſcourſe on this, I ſhall divide into theſe
two parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To ſhow you how a man may uſe this World, ſo as not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
it.</item>
               <item>2. To illuſtrate the motives to this, that are included in the
Apoſtles argument, that the faſhion of this World paſſes away.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>To know in the firſt place wherein the right uſe of theſe things
does conſiſt,</hi> let us obſerve that ſummary of every mans Duty
which the Apoſtle layes down under Three Heads in 2 <hi>Tit.</hi>
12. where he directs men to live <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly</hi> and <hi>godly</hi>
in this preſent World: Thus ought we to guide our ſelves in
the uſe of what we enjoy, to take care that we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
in this, that reverence and pious homage which is due
to God; nor that Juſtice and Good-will towards other men,
which we may deſire to find in their carriage towards us; nor
that good and wiſe Government which beſt becomes, and is
moſt advantageous for our ſelves. Theſe three Heads include
all the rules that are to be obſerved in this matter, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
under theſe range them.</p>
            <p>1. He that would rightly uſe his Portion in this Life, muſt not
ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported thereby to the neglect or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of thoſe Duties of Piety which he owes to God: <hi>Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
theſe following Rules:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99246:7"/>
(1.) <hi>Take heed that you do not love your preſent Enjoyments more
than God:</hi> This is actual abuſe of them, as well as it diſpoſes
us to further abuſe, for they were never made nor beſtow'd
to draw our chiefeſt Affection to them; God is our chiefeſt
good, and does deſerve the higheſt Intereſt in our Affections:
He has made the mind of man capable to Contemplate and
admire himſelf, to Love him and apprehend his Love to us,
and be delighted therewith; to place then the chief affection
of ſo noble a being upon any thing below the Supream good;
is to abuſe both that and our ſelves; 'tis to content our ſelves
with that low thing as our Happineſs, which was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be ſo, and is in its nature unfit for it.</p>
            <p>Again, whatever thing has the greateſt ſhare of our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
'tis thereby in the place of a God to us, that will have
moſt influence and power in the whole government of us;
the homage of mind and body will be paid to it: An ardent
Love, let the object be what it will, prejudices the Judgment,
inclines the Will, leads all the reſt of the affections, and ſo all
the thoughts, the words and the actions, or the moſt of them
ſhall be moſt readily employed with ſome relation to that. If
any Creature then is thus lov'd, it becomes the Idol of a mans
heart, and we revive the abſurd Idolatry of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
who made every good thing a Deity: But did the true God
ever intend that his Creatures ſhould be thus exalted into a
competition with himſelf, for the adoration of Mankind? or
can we imagine that he made theſe things Servants to us, with
a purpoſe that we ſhould ſerve them, and live negligent of
our Duty to him.</p>
            <p>Since all our enjoyments are the free gifts of a bountiful and
gracious God, 'tis reaſonable they ſhould kindle in us the Love
of <hi>Him:</hi> The better and more delightful theſe are for kind,
and the larger Portion he beſtowes, we are the more bound
thereby to love him: Do not imagine that you can fix your
affections in a great degree on your preſent enjoyments, and
yet highly Love God too; theſe two diſpoſitions are like heat
and cold, which cannot conſiſt in an intenſe degree in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99246:7"/>
ſame Subject. This is that the Apoſtle means in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15.
where he ſayes, <hi>If any man loves the World, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not in him:</hi> As the one of theſe encreaſes, the other
does proportionably decreaſe; if you much love the things of
this World, you love them too much, and God too little.</p>
            <p>Now this errour and abuſe is practiſed in the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>1. To have the thoughts and affections wholly employed
about the things of this Life, and limited within the narrow
bounds of this ſublunary World; to take delight only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
and enjoying the Creatures here below; to have no
flights of mind, no aſpirings towards God; to have him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in our thoughts, and but very tranſiently when he is;
when the mind does never fix for a few moments upon him;
to think of God without any affection, without any deſire or
delight; this is evidently to love the things of this World
more than him: If the Judgment did eſteem him the chief
good, and were convinced of his excellencies, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
how ſuitable he is to the Capacities of happineſs in
man; if the Will did thereupon chooſe and fix upon him as
the center of its deſires, as its ultimate end, and beyond whom
it neither needs nor inclines to ſeek further for a full content;
this were really to Love him, and ſuitably to him and our
ſelves; and then the Meditations on him would be ſweet, as
they were to holy <hi>David,</hi> as he ſayes in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. and then
they would often return and abide with you; they would be
the gratefulleſt thoughts, obtain the eaſieſt admittance, and
entertain you longer than any without wearineſs: Then
would your concern to have an Intereſt in God be ſtronger
than the delight in what you enjoy at preſent; you would
more ardently deſire this, 'till you could obtain the aſſurance
of it, and that when obtained, would afford the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and ſatisfaction; the diſpoſition of your Soul would be
the ſame with that of the Pſalmiſt, when he ſaid, <hi>Whom have
I in Heaven but thee, and there is none on earth that I can deſire
beſides thee,</hi> Pſal. 73. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99246:8"/>
2. Again, They are certainly lovers of Pleaſure, more than
lovers of God, who allow themſelves in unlawful delights;
who follow thoſe Pleaſures which he forbids, and will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
break his commands than not gratifie their extravagant
deſires. 'Tis the inſeparable property of Love to God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the obſervance of his Commands. <hi>John</hi> 14. 21. This
would make a man deny himſelf, and reſiſt and mortifie his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
inclinations. Thoſe wild and lawleſs men that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
their pleaſures without any regard to what is lawful, or
what is ſinful, are under no influence or power either from
the love or fear of God. He that had ſo true apprehenſions of
God as to love him, would underſtand that his Law allows all
the Liberty that 'tis fit for us to take in the enjoyment of theſe
things. He would give himſelf leave deliberately to conſider
upon how many accounts 'tis unreaſonable to go further, and
thus he would be fortified againſt Luſt and Temptation.</p>
            <p>3. Moreover, That man whoſe Eſtate is dearer to him than his
Religion, who is not ready to forſake all his moſt pleaſant enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
rather than abandon his Duty, he loves this World more
than God. The queſtion in this caſe put to him is, whether he
will chuſe and content himſelf with Earth or Heaven? Whether
he will retain the poſſeſſion of preſent goods, or the unfailing
hopes of better? whether he will have God or the Creature
for his portion? And he in deſerting his Religion refuſes the
happineſs it would bring him to. He lets go the hopes of an
eternal happineſs, to retain for a few moments an uncertain
and temporal one: he preferrs the Creature before the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
and the ſhallow Streams before the infinite Fountain of
Bliſs. 'Tis the enjoyment of God which conſtitutes the Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Heaven, and 'tis no leſs thing than this is ſlighted, when
you deſert the way that leads to Heaven. Our Saviour has
told us, that he who does not forſake all preſent contentments
to follow him, if there be neceſſity for it, is not worthy of him.
Without this you have no intereſt in his Blood, in his Merits or
Interceſſion. If we are aſhamed or afraid of the Croſs of Chriſt,
we ſhall never wear the Crown of Glory. The Glories and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99246:8"/>
Honours which he has provided for the Saints will be poſſeſs'd
only by thoſe that continue ſuch to the end of their lives. The
moſt advantageous uſe we can make of our preſent poſſeſſions,
is to loſe them for righteouſneſs ſake; this is to transferr our
treaſures from Earth to Heaven, to change them from uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and periſhing, to durable and eternal Riches.</p>
            <p>(2.) Another rule of Piety to be obſerved is, <hi>That you put
your confidence only in God, and acknowledge your dependance to be
upon him:</hi> Thoſe to whom the Divine Bounty has beſtow'd a
plentiful portion of outward goods, are apt to terminate all
their hopes and expectations upon that for the ſupport and
comfort of their Lives; to forget that they derive from him all
their enjoyments, that his Bleſſing and concourſe gives them
all their ſufficiency and goodneſs. Our Saviour gives us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Character of this folly in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. beginning at the 16. <hi>v.</hi>
where in a Parable he introduces a man whoſe Wealth encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to abundance, and he takes care to diſpoſe of it to the beſt
advantage for ſecurity and uſe, but we find no expreſſion to
ſignifie that he owns it to come from God, he is not ſenſible
of a Providence in the caſe, that this happens to him by the
diſpoſal of Heaven; accordingly he contents himſelf in it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds
and rejoices in his felicity, upon the account of his
Wealth, but is ſtill unſenſible of his dependance upon God;
and thus the miſtaken Fool flatters himſelf in the 19<hi>th. v.
Soul take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry, for thou haſt goods
laid up for many years:</hi> Much pleaſure and content he
promiſes himſelf from his enjoyments, without ſeeking to
God for it: What (ſayes ſuch an one) ſhall I want?
my yearly revenue will allow me to provide my ſelf whatever
I deſire, and it is enough to laſt all my dayes in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of a pleaſant life; I will live free from care and trouble,
I will baniſh Buſineſs, baniſh ſorrow from my thoughts, and
pleaſe my ſelf 'till I dye. <hi>The rich mans Wealth</hi> (ſays <hi>Solomon)
is his ſtrong City, and as an high wall in his own Conceit;</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
himſelf from hence a laſting and impregnable happineſs,
but God is not in his thoughts. The ſenſual minds of men
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99246:9"/>
are wont to take notice only of ſenſible things, and becauſe
the concourſe and power of God is excerciſed unſeen towards
their ſupport, they are apt to take no notice of it: What they
do immediately, and to the apprehenſion of ſenſe derive ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and ſatisfaction from, to that they aſcribe it; theſe men
enjoy the gifts of God, without making acknowledgments
that they are his gifts, without owning that they depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him for their virtue and ſufficiency; they cover themſelves
every day with rich and convenient Cloaths, but without lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one thankful thought to the kind donour for them; they
make the Proviſion of their Tables, as nouriſhing and pleaſant,
and plentiful as they pleaſe, and then ſit down to it as a Swine
comes to his trough, with as little acknowledgment of their
dependance upon God; they expreſs no thankfulneſs to him
for having afforded ſo excellent Proviſion, nor implore his
Bleſſing to make it wholſome and nouriſhing. Conſider,
<hi>Man does not live by Bread alone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 3.</note> but by the vertue which
Gods Bleſſing gives it. Every thing in nature depends upon
a perpetual concourſe both in its being and operation; you
can derive nothing from any Creature, but what the firſt
cauſe enables it to afford; the beſt Food cannot nouriſh, the
moſt delicate cannot delight, no cloaths will give you warmth,
nor can you find eaſe on the ſofteſt Bed, the largeſt Eſtate
will not content the mind, nor any of your enjoyments ſerve
the end for which you uſe them, unleſs the all-ſufficient God
gives them Vertue and Power; ought not this to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
then? ſhould we not Pray to him for the comfort and
continuance of our Lives? ſhould we not render thanks to
him for all the happineſs we enjoy? Conſider too, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows
every good thing which you enjoy; and own that he
has made you rich, he has exalted you in the world: It was
in his Power to have put you in a mean place, to have cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you with rags, you might have trotted in the dirt and duſt
for a poor livelyhood among common men, you might have
been in that Beggars condition who ſtands hungry and cold at
your Gate, and he might have been in your warm Parlour, at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99246:9"/>
your plenteous Table, ſtill the Providence of God can make
ſuch an alteration. Let him then be owned as the Author of
all good, let him alone be truſted in. <hi>Charge them</hi> (ſayes the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy) that are rich in this World, that they
do not truſt in uncertain. Riches, but in the living God, who gives
us all things richly to enjoy,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17.</p>
            <p>(3.) Another Inſtance of of Piety which great and rich
perſons ought to charge themſelves with, is <hi>Humility towards
God.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> thought it neceſſary that ſuch ſhould
be admouiſhed <hi>not to be high-minded,</hi> as we ſee in that place
laſt quoted. Pride is a vice to which Mankind is ſo much
addicted, that it oft ariſes from things that are real diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.
We may ſometimes hear men boaſting of their
follies and ſins. Riches and Honours are things generally,
though not very deſervedly much eſteemed and admired in
the World; theſe muſt therefore be very apt to elevate the
minds of thoſe that poſſeſs them, beyond a true and modeſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of themſelves; and if they have ſuch effect, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the behaviour both towards God, and towards men.
It is but too neceſſary then to urge ſuch perſons to the practice
of <hi>Humility</hi> towards both. In this place I ſhall mention what
Humility towards God requires, and hereafter how it muſt
be expreſt in our behaviour towards men.</p>
            <p>To demean your ſelves in ſuch an humble manner towards
God as you ought, do not forget to acknowledge that you
are ſinners in his ſight: Own that you are derived from the
fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> and are of the Apoſtate, guilty race, however
honourable in the World a few of your Anceſtors may have
been: know that no greatneſs of birth can exempt from the
real and common pollution; that you derive a ſtain'd, infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nature of whomſoever you are born; that you are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Children of Wrath as well as others; are born Heirs of
Gods diſpleaſure, whatever heaps of Treaſure, large tracts
of Land, ſtately Houſes, or lofty titles you are born to. 'Tis all
one in this reſpect to have been firſt wrapt in Raggs, or Purple;
to have been nurſed in the ſtately Chambers of the great,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99246:10"/>
or carried about upon the ſhoulders of a Beggar.</p>
            <p>Acknowledge too the actual Tranſgreſſions of your lives;
that you have ſinn'd in thought, in word, in deed, in every
condition of life, in every Age, in every place that you have
been in, that <hi>your Iniquities are more in number than the Hairs
of your head.</hi> Acknowledge the aggravations which your ſins
have received from the circumſtances wherein they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
as that they have many times been contrary to the
knowledge and actual checks of Conſcience, contrary to the
wiſe and good inſtructions given you in your education, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the intreaties of your beſt Friends: they have been
committed upon or little or no temptation, or upon your wilful
and needleſs expoſing your ſelf to temptation; that having had
the more opportunity and ability to tranſgreſs by having a great
Eſtate, you have been perhaps actually the worſe, and ſo have
anſwered the greater kindneſs of God with greater affront.</p>
            <p>And upon the apprehenſion of theſe great and true diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
you ſhould entertain the meaneſt thoughts of your
ſelves, be vile in your own eyes, and own that you may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be ſo in Gods; that if he ſhould abhor, and condemn and
reject you into eternal puniſhment, he were righteous. Let
not the greatneſs of outward Proſperity hinder you from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the greatneſs of that wrath which is due for your
ſin; believe the greateſt to be due. Look upon your Riches
as an unprofitable poſſeſſion, which can be no advantage in the
day of his wrath; which cannot redeem the guilty Soul from
the eternal Priſon, to which if you die impenitent you muſt be
confin'd. Look upon your Honours as mean and contemptible
things, which can procure no reſpect from the great and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
God. Lament the ingratitude of your ſins as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
God, and the folly of them as they reſpect yourſelves;
that you have behaved your ſelves ſo unworthily towards him,
and have ſo little conſulted your own true intereſt. In a ſenſe
of the wretchedneſs of your condition, fly to the hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, and depend upon the ſatisfaction and merits of the
Redeemer alone, to find favour and acceptance with God. 'Tis
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99246:10"/>
not below the greateſt man to repent, but it is ſo to tranſgreſs.
The commiſſion of ſin degrades and debaſes man, the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for it, if true, raiſes him up again, to humble our ſelves
before God is the way to riſe in his eſteem. While we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
and lament for our ſins, he pities us; while we judge
and condemn our ſelves, he acquits and pardons; While
with deep reſentment we own our ſelves polluted, he will
cleanſe and ſanctifie us.</p>
            <p>2. Again you muſt expreſs your Humility towards, God by
magnifying all the exerciſes of his Goodneſs towards you,
and if you are very ſenſible of your ſin and unworthineſs, you
will have a very grateful ſenſe of his mercy. The leaſt gifts of
his bounty will be thankfully received, and ought to be ſo;
the ſmalleſt portion, the narroweſt Fortune, will keep out
diſcontent from the humble Soul, and he will praiſe the God
that beſtows any thing where nothing is deſerved. Aſcribe it
to the mercy of God, and the merits of the Redeemer, that
you are ſuffered to live, that you were nouriſht and brought
up though born in blood and pollution; though you had the
infection of Enmity againſt God wrought into your natures,
though you were <hi>conceived in ſin, and brought forth in Iniquity.</hi>
Much admire that when you had forfeited the leaſt favours, the
goodneſs of God ſhould be liberal to you, and load you with
a rich plenty of the good things of this life. Bleſs him eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for ſpiritual mercies, and the care that he has taken for
your happineſs in Eternity. Admire the goodneſs which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
your Baptiſm, and pray that it may prove the Laver
of Regeneration. It was unſpeakable mercy, when he might
have thrown you away into miſery, that he ſhould take you
into the boſom of his Church in order to bring you to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life. Adore the mercy that gave you by Parents, or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſuch inſtructions as direct to a wife, happy, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
courſe of life; and eſpecially have an high eſteem of
the favour, if theſe inſtructions have made any impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you; if you are formed thereby ſo as to live regularly, and
practiſe the Rules. Say, <hi>Lord what is man that thou art mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99246:11"/>
full of him, and the Son of man that thou thus viſiteſt him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Teſtifie your Humility further, by a ready ſubmiſſion to
the Divine Commands. Do not think you can be ſo great as to
be exempted from the obligation of his Laws who is Soveraign
over all things; or that the obligation of Obedience is leſs ſtrict
or indiſpenſable upon you, than upon others, when you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to him for greater gifts. A Humble mind will not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
at any of the Commands of God, nor account any courſe
too ſtrict which he enjoyns: He will ſay with the great pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of Humility, the bleſſed Jeſus, <hi>Lord, not my will, but thine
be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Again, you muſt alſo quietly ſubmit to every diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods Providence: own his Juſtice in every affliction he
layes upon you, and command your minds in Patience. 'Tis
unreaſonable as well as vain to murmure againſt God, and
'tis madneſs to rage and blaſpheme becauſe he chaſtiſes you.
This is like the wild <hi>Scythians,</hi> to ſhoot Arrows againſt the
Thunder, which will return upon your heads, and take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
for the bold impiety in your deſtruction. By a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſubmiſſion under Chaſtiſement, we obtain the Compaſſion
of the Father of mercies:<note place="margin">Prov. 15. 1.</note> This proves like a <hi>ſoft anſwer which
turns away wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Expreſs your Humility towards God, by a modeſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in his Worſhip, and an honourable eſteem of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
to meddle with theſe in a ſlight unſerious manner, is
to profane things that are Sacred.</p>
            <p>Your Prayers ought to be altogether ſerious and devout,
without the leaſt allowed Vanity of the Mind, or wandering
of the Eyes, Thoughts or Affections: Is it not moſt agreeable
and juſt that we ſhould behave our ſelves with all poſſible ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
when we are upon our knees, begging of the great
diſpoſer of all things for what is neceſſary to our Happineſs, or
rendering due Praiſe for abundant and free mercy?</p>
            <p>Again, your attention to the Holy Word of God, ought to
be very reverent and ſerious, ſuch as is due to divine Oracles.
The Holy Scriptures and what is dictated from them, deſerve
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99246:11"/>
to be regarded as divine Revlations, as a Meſſage or a Voice
from Heaven: The Commands are of divine Authority, the
Promiſes, the Threatnings are made by the Infinite and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God; and the greatneſs of him from whom theſe things
firſt come, ſhould ſtrike an aw, and beget a reverence to them
in the minds of all men, thô the Meſſenger from whom they
immediately receive them be their inferiour. Reverence and
eſteem the Word of God as the appointed means of Salvation;
he has determined, <hi>By the fooliſhneſs of Preaching to ſave them
that believe;</hi> thô the matter of it may ſeem fooliſh to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and prejudiced World, and thô the Preachers may ſeem
deſpicable to the Proud, yet the effects of Preaching are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
upon them that believe, upon ſuch as receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
that in this way are given to them: By ſo mean an
Inſtrument. God accompliſhes the great effect of the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of men; what words then can expreſs the madneſs and
folly of thoſe men that deſpiſe this Ordinance of God? they
have neither any Reverence for him who inſtituted it, nor
care for their own Happineſs.</p>
            <p>That you may not lightly and careleſly engage in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, conſider you have therein immediate concern
with an Infinite being, you preſent your ſelves before the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Majeſty whom all the Angels humbly adore; who is King
of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the God before whom the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth are as nothing; who is in Heaven as on a
Throne of unconceivable Glory, and thou art on Earth as at
his Foot-ſtool. What is the higheſt of men that he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
to behave himſelf with reverence in his addreſſes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Thô you are a little elevated among men, and ſtand high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than ſome others of them, yet you are infinitely below the
Deity.</p>
            <p>6. Further, let your Humility be exerciſed in having a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
modeſt Opinion of your beſt actions. Do not think high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of your deſerts upon the account of any good that you have
done: conſider it was the giver of every good and perfect gift
that gave the ability to do well; he excited the Will to it,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99246:12"/>
and his Providence preſented the opportunity. Acknowledge
the unhappineſs of mankind is ſuch, that no action can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by any man that is perfect, and does not in ſome reſpect
or other want a pardon. At the beſt you have but paid a debt
in what you have done, and anſwered an obligation laid upon
you. The beſt man ought to expect his reward for the beſt
ſervice of his life, meerly from the mercy of God in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4. Another Duty of Piety which thoſe that are rich ought
to reckon themſelves obliged to perform, is <hi>to promote Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as much as they can in the World;</hi> to endeavour God may be
generally honour'd, ſince he has graciouſly exalted them.
Thoſe whom he has lifted above their Neighbours, have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
opportunity to ſerve him in this kind than others: but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is expected from all men, and every man may help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the increaſe of Religion, whether he be in a publick or
a private ſtation.</p>
            <p>And to promote Religion, is the nobleſt and the moſt uſeful
kind of ſervice that you can perform; 'tis not below the greateſt
of men to ſet himſelf induſtriouſly to it. Religion is the End of
the rational Creature; that for which we are men, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with reaſon. To promote this, is to endeavour that God may
receive his juſt rights from men: till they become Religious,
they are ſo many Traitors and Rebels againſt the common So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.
This World, if it were without Religion, would be
a Wilderneſs, a Confuſion, without peace or order. This is
the Glory of mankind, the Beauty, the Strength, the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of any Society where it obtains: It is a ſure foundation
of Wealth, and Renown, and Stability, to any Community
of men. And on the contrary, no Greatneſs can be raiſed or
maintained without it. Wickedneſs and Irreligion have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
many well-eſtabliſht Empires, and Combinations,
but could never raiſe one. Air, Fire, and Water, are not
more univerſally uſeful and neceſſary to mankind than Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They can as well breath without Air, be warm in the
perpetual abſence of the Sun, or quench thirſt without Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as they can be happy without Religion prevailing amongſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99246:12"/>
them. Conſider too, that almoſt the whole world lies in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs!
And how little Religion is there remaining amongſt
us! Alas! to how great a degree is that Glory departed from
our <hi>Iſrael!</hi> This loudly proclaims what need there is that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one do endeavour according to his place, and power, to
encreaſe and ſpread it.</p>
            <p>1. You that are great, that have many eyes upon you,
ſhould promote Religion by a good and pious Example. You
are more largely known in your perſons than common men,
and yet more known by Name and Report; and as far as this
goes, your Example may do good or hurt to Religion. There
is a great propenſity in mankind to imitate thoſe whom they
reſpect, their Superiors: if you practiſe Religion, you give it
eſteem and repute in the World; and if you neglect it, 'tis expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to contempt and ſcorn: 'tis you that muſt bring it into faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and retrieve it from the too general contempt that it now lies
under. Conſider, that you do not only diſparage your ſelves by
a vicious converſation, but you infect others too; you contract
to your ſelves much guilt from the ſins of other men; from
all thoſe which your bad example does encourage: And if you
are bad men, you are the Peſts of the World, great cauſes of
ſin, and conſequent miſery.</p>
            <p>How much more are thoſe liable to the blame of other mens
ſins, and the infection of the World, who tempt others to
wickedneſs, who promote the kingdom and intereſt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and ſubſerve the grand <hi>Apollyon</hi> in his deſign of deſtroying
mankind? they may be reckon'd a ſort of inferior, incarnate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
who ſtrive to introduce vertuous and ſober perſons into
the wicked practices and cuſtoms of the Age.</p>
            <p>2. Further, Private perſons may promote Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the
well ordering of their own Families. So far they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and they ought to command the practice of this. The
greater any of theſe are, the further may he that is the head of
it promote Religion: your Children and Servants will help to
debauch, and infect the reſt of the World, if they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious:
for men will take their Examples from the families
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99246:13"/>
of great men, as well as from their Perſons: Keep up the
conſtant Worſhip of God in your Families, in Prayers, in
reading the Holy Scriptures, in ſinging Pſalms, and in a ſtrict
obſervation of the Sabbath. Are thoſe Families fit to be called
aſſemblies of Chriſtians, where there is no conſtant Worſhip
of God maintain'd? how can you expect any Bleſſing upon
your Society, unleſs you Worſhip God together? The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of a Family lyes in the Love, the Suitableneſs, the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
the Serviceableneſs of all the Members of it towards
one another, and theſe things he alone can beſtow. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Family cannot know whether thoſe under
him do Worſhip God at all or not, if they do it not together.</p>
            <p>If you would have thoſe of your own Family Religious,
you muſt be ſo your ſelf; thus far at leaſt your Example will
have great influence; it will have greater influence upon
your Domeſticks either towards good or ill, than any other
can: The Poet ſpeaks a great deal of truth in that ſentence,
<q>
                  <l>—Velocius &amp; citius nos</l>
                  <l>Corrumpunt vitiorum exempla domeſtica magnis</l>
                  <l>Cum ſubeant animos autoribus.<note place="margin">Juv. Satyr. 14.</note>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Examples of Vice which we dwell with, if they are
in our Superiours too, do corrupt us ſooner than any. The
nearneſs and daily converſe with you, is added to your Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority,
to make your bad example fatal to thoſe of your own
Houſe. The ſharpeſt Rebuke that can be expreſt in words,
is due to the folly of thoſe Parents who take no care how they
behave themſelves before their Children; who after they
have given them a Nature infected and diſpoſed to ill, that
they may not fail to ruine them, give them a bad Example too.</p>
            <p>Again, to make your Family Religious, you muſt reſtrain
thoſe under you from all manner of Wickedneſs, by reproving
the leaſt errours, and puniſhing others. Give them alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to do well, let this alwayes purchaſe your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
favour and good-will.</p>
            <p>But further, to effect this, you ſhould carefully Inſtruct
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99246:13"/>
your Children and Servants in the matters that concern their
Salvation; if you do not betimes take care to poſſeſs your
Children with good and vertuous principles, the adverſary
of their Souls will early ſow in their minds the tares of Vices;
and ſhould you be leſs induſtrious for the happineſs of your
own fleſh and blood, than the malicious Devil is for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?
ſhould any one hate them more than you Love
them, they will have cauſe to curſe you hereafter for having
given them being, if they mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>carry through your neglect;
<hi>Train up a Child in the way wherein he ſhould go, and when he is
old he will not depart from it,</hi> Prov. 22. 6. Let them be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to do well. The conſtant exerciſe of Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
from tender years, will make it eaſie and familiar; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
them in the matter of their Duty, and labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of the reaſons that perſwade to the practice of it;
tell them how honourable it is to be good and holy, what a
luſtre and beauty it has in the eyes of men; that this is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
beyond any thing even in a wicked World; no man is ſo
univerſally commended and eſteemed, as he that is ſtedfaſtly
and ſtrictly vertuous; tell them what a fragrant odour it
leaves behind, how it embalms the memory of the dead; with
what applauſe the Hiſtories of all Ages do mention brave and
good men. The moſt partial Hiſtories do never offer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
any man without aſcribing true Vertues to him: <hi>The
Memory of the juſt is bleſſed,</hi> Prov. 10. 7. Learn them to put a
high value upon the eſteem of wiſe and good men; let them
account it mean and baſe to be valued only amongſt thoſe
whoſe Vices make them the Scum of the Earth, who will
only applaud Confidence and Wit in doing fooliſh and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things; there is no applauſe of any men worthy to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued,
but that of ſuch men who are themſelves worthy of
Praiſe. Learn them to ſtand in great awe of their Creator,
to remember him in their Youth, to be more concern'd to
pleaſe him than men, to be moſt ambitious of his approbation
in what they do: Let them know that his pure Omniſcience
does continually obſerve them, that no darkneſs, no ſecrecy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99246:14"/>
can hide them from his view; that 'tis of no advantage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their crimes from the Friends that would reprove them,
ſince the righteous Judge of all the World obſerves, and will
at one time or other ſeverely reprove them: They only hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
themſelves by ſecrecy, from enjoying that admonition
which might be a means to cure their follies. Thus endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to convince their reaſon that they muſt be good, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by all great and good allurements, as they grow capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to apprehend them, to perſwade and incline their wills
to Religion. Be not contented only with your reſtraining
them from wickedneſs, but learn them as much as may be,
to reſtrain themſelves; faſten in their minds ſuch Principles
as may have power to keep them regular.</p>
            <p>As the obſervation of the Lords day is one part of our duty
towards God, ſo 'tis a practice that highly conduces towards
our performance of all other Duties; 'tis alwayes obſervable,
that the beſt men are thoſe that moſt ſtrictly devote this day to
Religion. You cannot poſſibly have a religious Family, unleſs
you keep thoſe that are under you to the publick and private
exerciſes of religious Worſhip on the Sabbath. This is to give
up one day in ſeven to the conſideration of divine things, and
'tis conſideration which muſt give them impreſſion and force
upon the minds of men; thoſe moſt important things reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Heaven, will have no influence upon us, if we do not
allow them a ſerious contemplation: On other dayes other
lawful and neceſſary employments will often interrupt you
in doing this. Take then the appointed time, and improve
it as well as you can for this purpoſe; give your Servants as
little other imployment on that day as you can, and keep them
as cloſe as you can to this; ſpend the time that remains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what the publick Worſhip will take up, in ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
exerciſes of Religion in the Family.</p>
            <p>3. Further, Thoſe that are great and rich men, thô not in
the Magiſtracy, may promote Religion among their Tenants
and poor Neighbours, by encouraging and countenancing
thoſe that incline to it, protecting them from Injuries, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99246:14"/>
them to your Service, and by frequent commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them in the hearing of others. You that have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Tenants, have perhaps ſo many Families that are in ſome
dependance upon you, whom you have opportunity to oblige,
and can encourage or diſcourage; ſo many will value your
favour or diſpleaſure, and may therefore be influenced to the
outward practice and profeſſion of Religion at leaſt, by your
carriage towards them: 'Tis an uſeful exerciſe of Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the promoting Religion, when you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will give Bibles
and good Books among your poor Neighbours, and to aſſiſt
them in the Education of their Children; ſuch as are very
poor, ſet their Children at the beſt to work, as ſoon as they
are able to do any Service, that they may earn ſomewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their own maintenance; and they can neither afford
them time, nor ſpare any coſt towards the teaching them ſo
much as to read; and ſo do many poor Souls live and dye in
a miſerable ignorance of thoſe things which concern their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
Oh pity theſe Wretches, and endeavour that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as you can, may have at leaſt this Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>4. You may yet more largely ſerve the Intereſt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by endeavouring as far as in you lies, that there may be
a learned and pious Miniſtry: It were a very publick Service
and benefit if you ſhould chuſe ſome poor Lad, that appears to
have a very good Wit and ſober Inclinations, and ſend him
to the School and the Univerſity; you may entertain in your
Family a deſerving perſon, 'till he can obtain a more publick
employment: you may out of your abundance ſpare ſome
yearly allowance to aſſiſt and encourage a man of mean for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
who with good aſſiſtance you have reaſon to think,
might be very uſeful in the ſervice of Religion. You may
add to the Revenues of ſmall Benefices, for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an able Miniſter.</p>
            <p>5. When perſons are admitted to a part in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
'tis certain that they have great opportunity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Religion; they can force men to at leaſt an outward
practice of it; they can puniſh Vice and Profaneneſs, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99246:15"/>
make it uneaſie to Men; they can make it aſhamed of its ſelf
when 'tis grown bold, or prevent its growing ſo; they can
reward, protect and countenance effectually thoſe that will
be good Men; they can command a general and ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Sabbath, and force men to aſſemble to one or
other of the places of publick Worſhip, whereby they will be
under the means to make them good men; 'tis in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to reſtrain, at leaſt from appearing in publick, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
liberty of Fancy, ſo much affected under the name of
<hi>Wit;</hi> which lies in finding out improbabilities in the cleareſt
and moſt important truths, and matter of ridicule in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
rules of Morality and Religion; a practice which tends
to make men Scepticks and Atheiſts, to overthrow Religion,
and civil Order and Government. Good Principles are the
foundation of good Order, and this humour deſtroyes all
Principles in the minds of Men, and leaves no foundation
at all, whereon to build Virtue or Piety in them: This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
the power of Conſcience, ſerves to juſtifie the groſſeſt
wickedneſſes, and hardens Men in their ſins. 'Tis much in
the Power of the Magiſtrate to procure an able faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
to protect them from Injury and Contempt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them in their work: But I deſire to be underſtood
to intend theſe things only for a little direction to thoſe young
Perſons that may hereafter be Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a brief account of thoſe Duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, which are required of all men to be regarded in
their uſe of preſent enjoyments.</p>
            <p>2. Further to ſhow wherein the right uſe of the things
of this World conſiſts, I proceed in the next place to ſuggeſt,
<hi>The Duties towards men which this requires, included under the
name of Righteouſneſs:</hi> And this includes all the Duties of the
ſecond Table of the Divine Law, required to be obſerved in
our carriage towards our Neighbours; it commands both
Juſtice and Mercy in that 2 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Tit.</hi> To do to others as
we would be done by, which is the great rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
is a rule both of Equity and Charity; he that exerciſes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99246:15"/>
Charity to the Poor, and ſhews Mercy to the miſerable, does
to them what he himſelf would deſire that others ſhould do
for him, if he were in their Condition: But I ſhall not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all the particulars under this Head, becauſe I ſtudy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
but only will lay down a few general rules, which ſhall
include all the particulars.</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>Let every man endeavour to be of ſome good uſe to the
Community he lives in:</hi> It ſhould be the hopes of a young man,
that he may in the time of his Life be able, and have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to do ſome good ſervice to Mankind: 'Tis generoſity
and good nature to be unwilling to live to himſelf alone. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
and fit your ſelf for employment, and then readily accept
it when it offers it ſelf; thô 'tis not wiſdom for a man haſtily
to ruſh into publick buſineſs, before he is well accompliſht,
and rightly called to it, yet when he is ſo called and fitted,
he ought not to decline or refuſe it; unleſs the circumſtances
happen to be ſuch, as that you cannot with a ſafe Conſcience
undertake it: 'Tis too great ſelfiſhneſs to conſider the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
danger, coſt or pains of an employment, wherein you
may do great ſervice to the publick, ſo as to be thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
from undertaking it: There is nothing great and
glorious, that is not hazardous and painful, and the more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and dangers attend any good Office, 'tis the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.
I cannot chuſe but tranſcribe thoſe two Stanza's

A good man will not ſeek an Office for the meer honour of
it, but to have opportunity to do good in the World; but
ſuch men ought to ſeek and receive in the right way any Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
conferr'd upon them, becauſe otherwiſe bad men who are
ambitious will poſſeſs and abuſe them; he is not worthy to
live in a Society, by and in which he enjoyes Riches or Honour,
who will not deny himſelf in his own eaſe and intereſt to ſerve
the publick ſafety and Proſperity: The damage and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
which you may ſuſtain in a publick employment,
ought not in caſe of neceſſity to be regarded, unleſs it would
be ſo great as utterly to diſable you for performing the Duties
of the place. A man ought not indeed to undertake what he
is not able to manage, for this would be a great prejudice to
the publick: What unprofitable and worthleſs wretches are
thoſe who give up themſelves to an idle enjoyment of their
own Pleaſures, to live in Eaſe and Luxury, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to do any good! they are the abject, the reffuſe things of
nature, differing from the whole Creation beſides; every
Creature beſides ſerves to ſome uſe and purpoſe, and they
live to none at all.</p>
            <p>There are publick employments ſuitable to the ſeveral ranks
and degrees of men, and every man ſhould be fit for ſome or
other of the employments that commonly belong to the men
of his rank, and readily apply himſelf to it.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral good Offices that great men may do to
the publick in a private condition, as I have in part ſhown al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
you may further help by your Interceſſion with the
Magiſtrate to protect the Innocent, to obtain favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
to men of Wiſdom and Honeſty, to right thoſe that
have been wronged, and relieve the Oppreſſed; you may vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
thoſe that may be miſrepreſented and falſely accuſed.</p>
            <p>You may be inſtrumental to recover or maintain Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Members of the ſame Society, which is an Office
expreſly and particularly bleſt in the Sacred Writ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 9.
'Tis an Office exceeding beneficial to Mankind, and therefore
highly pleaſing to God, to endeavour the promoting Peace
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99246:16"/>
among men: Peace cheriſhes Societies, and makes them
flouriſh in Arts, Trade and Religion: Love is the band that
tyes multitudes of men together, to the ſtrength, ſafety and
happineſs of the whole Combination. You may perhaps find
out wayes to employ many Poor, ſo to keep them from Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and enable them to maintain their Families, and ſubſiſt
without dependance on Charity.</p>
            <p>When you are called into any Authority, aſſure your ſelves
that you are raiſed by Divine Providence, more for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good than your own Honour; think it glorious to be in
ſuch a place a publick Benefit, 'tis to reſemble the Deity in a
high and noble manner, who is over all, and good to all, who
has power to do harm, and only does good: conſider how much
the happineſs of all thoſe that are within the Sphear of your
Authority, does depend upon your wiſe and juſt management
of your Office; let a generous pity make you loath to cauſe
the miſery of many of your fellow Creatures; 'tis a barbarous
thing to contrive and delight in the miſery of others, and 'tis
ignominious and ſhameful to cauſe it by your neglect; let it
be your care therefore, that thoſe who are in ſome meaſure at
your mercy, may have no reaſon to lament that they are ſo.</p>
            <p>(2.) Another rule of Righteouſneſs by which men ſhould
govern themſelves in the uſe and enjoyment of the things of
this World, is, <hi>To wrong no man of what is his due,</hi> to take or
withhold from no perſon what he has right to, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of your own pleaſure: Accuſtom your ſelves to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Juſtice, and do not deſire liberty to tranſgreſs the bounds
of it in any meaſure; deſire no Pleaſure which is a wrong to
your meaneſt Neighbour, in Perſon, Eſtate or Reputation. It
makes the Societies of men acquainted with more Wildneſs
and Cruelty than the Wilderneſs it ſelf, when the greater will
pleaſe themſelves to the hurt and damage of the leſs; while
a Beaſt of Prey devours to ſerve his neceſſity, a lawleſs vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
man ſpoils his Neighbour to ſerve the extravagance
of wanton deſires, and is the moſt inhumane of the two: they
are certainly very unrighteous, who to enjoy their Pleaſure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99246:17"/>
beyond all bounds, and to maintain their prodigal expences,
do contract vaſt debts which they know themſelves unable to
pay, or take no care to do ſo; this is to Riot at the coſt of
other men, to abuſe and rob perhaps him that loves you, and
from that Love opened his Purſe to your deſires: You care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
ſcatter that which it may be your Creditor took a great
deal of pains to ſcrape together; the Comfort which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
himſelf to take in what he had gathered, you diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
him of; you take the Bread as it were from the mouths
of him and his Family, perhaps to throw it to your Dogs, and
they muſt goe ragged and thin cloathed, that your meaneſt
Servants may be extravagantly fine.</p>
            <p>Again, 'tis a moſt cruel and unnatural Injuſtice which they
are guilty of, that waſt the Eſtate upon their own pleaſures,
which ſhould provide for a Wife and Children; and there
never was any Age ſo barbarous in this reſpect as ours; ſome
ſpend in <hi>ſuperfluity</hi> and <hi>needleſly</hi> upon themſelves, while they
ſuffer their Family to want the things that are <hi>neceſſary;</hi> ſome
waſt their Eſtates in the Company of <hi>Strangers,</hi> and <hi>their
own fleſh and blood</hi> do hardly partake of them; ſome are ſo
monſtrouſly cruel as to give away the affection due to a Wife,
a perſon it may be of Honour and great Virtue, with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
which ſhe brought them, to another woman that is
baſe in Birth, or at leaſt in Lewdneſs; as if they only took
care to be vexatious, and to leave her no Comfort: Some are
negligent of making a treaſure for their Children, thô the
Providence of God has put them in a way to do it, out of a
prodigal and voluptuous humour that ſpends at leaſt all that
comes in: And ſome neglect this out of a baſe unnatural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
which would not have their own Children live as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
as they have attained to do, without enduring (thô
it might not be neceſſary) the ſame pains and hardſhips; <hi>He
that provides not for thoſe of his own Houſe,</hi> (ſayes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<hi>is worſe than an Infidel,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 8.</p>
            <p>Does he that ruines her who committed her ſelf and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
to his Mercy, upon the Vows and Proteſtations of his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99246:17"/>
Love, perform thoſe Vows, or is he not falſe and forſworn?
does he well and faithfully diſcharge the truſt that was put in
him? does he kindly requite the Love that laid the greateſt
poſſible obligation upon him? No, there is no gratitude, no
faithfulneſs in that man. If one falls into the hands of ſavage
Thieves, he may be ſtript and robb'd, and be glad to eſcape
without further harm; but to be thus uſed by a man, who by
great pretences of kindneſs has allur'd me into his Power,
muſt be the higheſt baſeneſs in him, and the greateſt trouble
and vexation to me.</p>
            <p>What thanks do your Children owe you, who have begot
them to Sorrow and Miſery, when your extravagant Luſts
devour what ſhould afford them a good Education, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them after your Death? Certainly 'tis the proviſion that
Parents make for their Children, or their endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
well for them, the care and pains they take to render
them wiſe, good and uſeful to the World, and to enable them to
ſubſiſt without a precarious dependance, if they can, which is
the thing that layes the great obligation upon Children to
Love and reverence their Parents: 'tis for the moſt part meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accidental that they are born, and 'tis a great unkindneſs
and prejudice to give them being, without taking what care you
can for their Happineſs; have you natural affection, who to
enjoy unlawful and exceſſive Pleaſures, will leave them in a
condition that can have none at all. I cannot chuſe but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at thoſe men who inherit an Eſtate, which has kept up
the grandeur perhaps of a long race of honourable Anceſtors,
and by their folly and extravagance do ſpend it, and leave
their Children Beggars: They leave perhaps a bare Title to
their Children or other Relations, without any Riches to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it reſpect and eſteem: If theſe men had any thing of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirit, they would ſcorn to bring either their own Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or their Name and Title down into the dirt; ſuch are
the diſgrace, the ignominy of the Family; they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
with hatred, as long as they are remembred by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity;
I wonder that ſuch men are not afraid, leſt the Ghoſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99246:18"/>
of ſome departed Anceſtor ſhould diſturb them at thoſe mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
revels, which waſt the Eſtate, and bring the Honour
which they purchaſed with great Labour and hazard, into
contempt and diſgrace.</p>
            <p>(3.) Another rule of Righteouſneſs may be, <hi>To practice all
requiſite Humility in your carriage towards men;</hi> this is the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of requiring no more reſpect from others than is due to
us, and of giving to others all the reſpect that is due to them;
Let no man arrogate to himſelf thoſe excellencies which he
really has not, nor deſire the reſpect due to them whilſt he is
without them: There can be nothing more ridiculous, than
to ſee a rich Fool conceit himſelf wiſe, to think his mind is full
of Wiſdom, becauſe his Baggs are full of Gold and Silver;
or for him who bears a Title, to think himſelf upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
an Oracle: 'Tis too often ſeen, that they who have theſe
things in eminence above others, are ready to conceit that
they have Wit, Vertue or Beauty above them too, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
they expect to be Honoured; or if they do not conceit
they have every excellency in them, yet they put too high an
eſteem upon thoſe they have; they think nothing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a great Eſtate or a Title of Honour; and all the reſpect
of Mankind, they account due to themſelves. Thô the uſeleſs
Creatures live as Cyphers in the Univerſe, and only ſerve to
encreaſe the number of men; they are dogmatical in their moſt
fooliſh and miſtaken Opinions, and moſt peremptory and ſtiff
in all their unreaſonable humours and purpoſes. They are
deaf to advice, and offended at reproofs, and will not receive
any the moſt uſeful Inſtruction, becauſe that implies they
wanted it. They hate the moſt important advice that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, under the notion of Controll, and cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between obedience to the good Rules, and obedience to
thoſe that give them: They deſpiſe the dictates of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and vertue, if ſuggeſted by an Inferiour, from an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
that to regard them is to ſubmit to that Inferiour;
thus their Pride infatuates them to a willingneſs rather to be
ruined than directed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:99246:18"/>
Be not too deſirous of your own Commendation, nor too
much elevated when you hear it; thoſe who are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with their own Praiſe, do uſually not much care to
hear any mens Commendation but their own; but Humility
will not envy other men their juſt Commendation, nor blot it
with detraction.</p>
            <p>Do not deſpiſe him that is inferiour to you in any thing,
he may perhaps excell you in another: God ſeldom gives all
ſorts of excellency to one man; And as you would not have
him deſpiſe you for your want of that wherein he excells, do
not you deſpiſe him for his want of that wherein you excell.
The wiſe Providence of God has thus variouſly diſtributed his
Gifts, that all men might be uſeful, acceptable, neceſſary to
one another; every man ought to be reſpected for his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
endowment, and according as the nature of it does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:
Indeed no <hi>man</hi> ſhould be deſpiſed, for if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe in him, he is a <hi>man,</hi> a Creature capable of reaſon,
and bears ſome impreſſes of the Divine Creators Image. A
humble mind will not deſpiſe the love and offer'd Services of
the meaneſt perſon, but will account himſelf under obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to requite them with kindneſs and good Offices; he will
neither refuſe them, nor take them as ſo much due to him as
to deſerve no acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>So far as honeſty and the advantage of others will permit, a
humble man will endeavour to render himſelf eaſie and pleaſant
to all in a company, or in his neighbourhood; he will not ſo ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gratifie and humour himſelf, as not to deny his own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſometimes to gratifie another, which is the common error
of thoſe that are new Gentlemen, or ſuch as have gotten a
great Eſtate, but have not had a genteel Spirit infuſed by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
The civility of the World and that which we rightly
call a genteel Carriage, is nothing elſe but a humble deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
towards all that we converſe with.</p>
            <p>The richeſt, the nobleſt, that are not Magiſtrates, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themſelves to ſubmit to Magiſtrates, and give to each of
them the reſpect which is due to the place he holds. 'Tis a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99246:19"/>
Pride that tends to confuſion and all diſorder, when ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
and affront thoſe Officers of the State, who out of their
Office are meaner perſons than themſelves: They ought to be
reſpected in the exerciſe of their Authority, out of reverence to
the ſupream Authority which is over every man in the State,
and from whence they derive theirs. He that affronts the
meaneſt Authority, does in effect affront the higheſt, and is in
a preparation to ſlight the Authority of all Laws too. Such
things are never practiſed, but when Law and Order begin to
give way to the luſts of men: If the Cobweb be broken by
Waſps and Hornets, little flies will eſcape through the holes
which they make.</p>
            <p>(4) <hi>Exerciſe all the Mercy and Charity towards the Poor and
Miſerable, which the Providence of God affords you ability and
opportunity for.</hi> Imitate the Father of Mercies, and be ye <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful</hi>
as he is. He makes every Creature partake of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
The higheſt ſort have their dependance upon it, and
the meaneſt are not overlookt or neglected. It is pleaſing to
the infinite Fountain, to be alwayes flowing. And 'tis a high
and noble imitation of him, for you to take all occaſions of
communicating, as you have power, to thoſe that are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
Freely you have received from God, and ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
freely give. As you have been your ſelves beholden to
Mercy, you ought to exerciſe it, or you prove your ſelves
unworthy of it. What you give to the Poor, is treaſur'd in
the hands of God, from whence it will return in due time
with a moſt plenteous Encreaſe. Thus you put your <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities</hi>
to a <hi>good uſe,</hi> and ſhall obtain in reward of thus ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, many <hi>neceſſary bleſſings.</hi> 'Tis a large and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
encouragement to this excellent duty, which the wiſe
man gives in a few words, in 3 <hi>Prov.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Let not mercy
and truth forſake thee, bind them about thy neck, write them upon
the Table of thine heart, ſo ſhalt thou find favour and good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in the ſight of God and men.</hi> Let the Precepts and
Rules of Sincerity and Charity be faſtned in thee, let them
abide with thee as if written upon thy heart: Let them alſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99246:19"/>
appear in thy Practice, and adorn thy Converſation as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of Gold about thy neck. And then thou ſhalt be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
and eſteemed both by God and men.</p>
            <p>Perhaps there is no one ſort of good Works more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and pleaſing to <hi>God</hi> than this. How high an account he
ſets on it, appears, in that he deems the contrary to it a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi>
to himſelf, and the practice an <hi>honour.</hi> 14 <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.
Our Saviour pronounces an expreſs Bleſſing to this alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi>
5. 7. and makes the greateſt Promiſe that can be imagined or
deſired, to encourage men to it. <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful, for
they ſhall find mercy.</hi> They ſhall further partake of the divine
goodneſs Mercy in general is promiſed; which gives us leave
to expect all the various exerciſes of it; to expect whatever
is neceſſary to our Souls, and future Happineſs, and what is
neceſſary to the continuance and Comfort of this preſent Life.
Yea, the Mercy of God does not ſtop at him that is merciful,
but deſcends upon his Poſterity too, and <hi>his Seed is Bleſſed,
Prov.</hi> 37. 26.</p>
            <p>Among <hi>Men</hi> it procures a general Approbation and eſteem,
every one almoſt will love him that appears to love every one;
it poſſeſſes the Minds of Men ſo much in a mans favour, as it
conceals a great many faults, and expiates the reſt. Thô eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man may have ſome Enemies, the charitable man ſhall have
the feweſt of any: The unjuſt Accuſations and Detractions of
bad men, will provoke more to the hatred of themſelves than
of him; And on the contrary, there is nothing does ſo much
raiſe the envy of the World againſt Riches and greatneſs, as to
ſee all the Advantages of them terminate in the Poſſeſſors;
to ſee them ſeeking nothing elſe but their own eaſe and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and neglecting that good which they might do to others
without any prejudice to themſelves: ſelf-love is a vice as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
hated, as 'tis practiſed among men. He that allows it
in himſelf, will yet condemn it in another. He that ſeeks only
his own advantage, will ſeek it alone.</p>
            <p>In the Exerciſe of your Charity, obſerve the following
Rules.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99246:20"/>
1. All ſorts of men that are able, muſt reckon themſelves
bound to give ſome Alms of that which is their own. Thoſe
that labour for what they have, are not wholly exempted from
this Duty. But are commanded to make it one end of their
Labour,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 28.</note> to purpoſe and deſign this, that they may be able to
afford ſome relief <hi>to thoſe that are in want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The ordinary meaſure of your Charity ought to be taken
from your ability, as is directed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6, 7. Every man
may commonly conſider and allow for his own neceſſity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
and the decency of his condition, and of his Childrens
after him, and what remains after a moderate Proviſion for
theſe, he can properly ſpare. But in extream neceſſity of an
Object preſented, you ought ſometimes to enlarge your
Charity beyond theſe bounds.</p>
            <p>3. Every man that wants, is a fit Object of Charity; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſuch who make themſelves indigent by Idleneſs and Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.
And 'tis moſt Charity to them to leave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
help, that neceſſity may cure them. A Good man ought
to be preferred before a bad one, to receive your Charity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this will encourage Religion, and he is likely to make
the beſt uſe of what you give. But you ſhould not eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
any hard thoughts of a poor Neighbour, nor excuſe
your ſelves from aſſiſting him by groundleſs ſuſpicions. A Soul
truly Charitable is not forward to <hi>think evil,</hi> as the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 5.</p>
            <p>4. Do not give your Alms in a proud and contemptuous
manner; 'tis more unkind to diſdain and ſcorn, than 'tis a
kindneſs to relieve: You ſhould do it with a ſenſe that the
Providence of God might have made you the Receiver, and
him the Giver; and as you would wiſh to be treated in that
caſe, you ought ſo to uſe him. To give in a courteous and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner, adds a great luſtre and beauty to the action, and
doubles the benefit: When you have beſtow'd a Gift, you
ought not to inſiſt much upon the obligation, nor expect that
he who has been beholden to you, ſhould in every thing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
your humour, and be wholly at your devotion: This
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99246:20"/>
looks as if you ſold your Gift for his Liberty; as if you made
a bargain, inſtead of doing an act of Charity. If what you
gave, did at firſt proceed from kindneſs, you do in effect call
it back again, or require him to pay for it, perhaps more than
it was worth.</p>
            <p>5. Give your Alms readily and chearfully; God and men
love a chearful Giver; 'Tis a ſign of inward goodneſs, of a
powerful inclination to the good you do, when it flows readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and freely from you. When an act of Charity comes ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from a man, and is unneceſſarily delayed, 'tis to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that it does not proceed from a Charitable inclination;
'tis the effect perhaps of the indigent perſons importunity, and
not of the givers goodneſs; 'tis beſtowed for your own eaſe
and quiet, rather than out of compaſſion to the poor, and is
more a deed of Charity to your ſelves, than to him that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtains it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Rules of Righteouſneſs to be obſerved in the
uſe of preſent enjoyments.</p>
            <p>3. In the third and laſt place, <hi>We muſt uſe theſe things
with Sobriety, if we would uſe them ſo as not to abuſe them:</hi> And
this requires a due regard to our ſelves, to our own intereſt,
and honour, and tranquility, in the uſe of this World. That
men do not gratifie their Appetites, to the prejudice of the
mind or body, to the loſs and conſumption of the Eſtate and
Reputation, or to the neglect of thoſe duties which belong to
the place and condition they are in. Every man ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Circumſtances of his condition, whether he is high
or low, rich or poor, and have many Children or poor Relations,
or but few or none; and according to theſe he may allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a more or leſs ſplendid and plentiful enjoyment of his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That meaſure which is becoming, and in a manner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to one man, may to another be extravagant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive:
Beſides, the true end of every Creature that we enjoy
is to be conſidered, and to direct in the uſe of it; nothing
ſhould be uſed for any other than the right end, or in ſuch a
way as does not promote that, nor to that degree that will
contradict or deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:99246:21"/>
Theſe general Rules I have but briefly mentioned by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
becauſe I judge it will be moſt uſeful to propoſe them
connected and applyed to the particular matters which they
ought to direct, ſince it may conſiſt with deſigned brevity.
I ſhall therefore ſhew how Sobriety requires us to regulate
our <hi>Diet, Apparel</hi> and <hi>Recreations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>For the right government of your ſelves in Eating and
Drinking:</hi> Conſider, that the proper end of them is to nouriſh
and ſtrengthen the Body, to maintain it in life, in health and
vigour. Meat and drink are as Oyl to the vital flame, which
if they be duly adminiſtred, cheriſh it, but if poured on too
faſt, they put it out: A man may kill himſelf with exceſſive
uſing the means of life. 'Tis a great abuſe of theſe things, to
pleaſe a wild Appetite either with the quantity or quality of
them, to the prejudice of health; and he that deſtroys his
health, loſes that to which all Pleaſures are beholden for their
Pleaſantneſs. All the beſt enjoyments of outward things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prevent, but that the life will be a burden where this is
wanting: This is the pleaſant flavour of Wine, and the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sauce of your Sauces, without which they are all inſipid:
'Tis a certain folly then to incumber your ſelves with diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
which may a long while torment and trouble you, for the
ſake of ſo tranſient a pleaſure as that is, which attends the
ſwallowing of pleaſant Meats and Drinks, which is enjoyed
but in that moment wherein they are paſſing. A wiſe man
would endeavour to underſtand by advice and experience, what
meaſure and rule were moſt conducing to his Health, and
would ordinarily obſerve that. 'Tis lawful, and of ſome uſe at
ſome times, to enjoy theſe things a little beyond the meaſure
which is meerly neceſſary, as on publick or private Feſtivals, or
to expreſs the welcome of Friends; but to do this often, or
without moderation, will excite the ſenſual inclinations, and
make them unruly and extravagant; and this were to aſſiſt an
Enemy againſt our ſelves, and to cheriſh thoſe luſts which war
againſt the Soul. The wretch that has ſteept his brain in the
fumes of exceſſive drinking, expoſes himſelf to the mercy of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99246:21"/>
every temptation. There is no folly ſo very abſurd, no ſin ſo
great but he may commit it. Rapes, Murders, Adulteries,
have been the too frequent Attendants of Drunkenneſs. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a man has done that in his Wine which has been the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Mind, and his diſparagement all his dayes. 'Tis
neceſſary and uſeful at leaſt to a healthful and vigorous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to deny himſelf ſometimes the enjoyment of that meaſure
of theſe things which is commonly neceſſary; to tame the
fleſh, and keep it in ſubjection, that he may the better govern
himſelf.</p>
            <p>They uſe Meat and Drink beyond Moderation, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
them to that degree, that they ſtupifie the Mind, and
weaken the exerciſe of Reaſon. Drinking till Reaſon is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed,
thô but in a ſmall degree, is in that degree an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
Moſt certain it is, that habitual Gluttony and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs
have made ſome men almoſt Fools: Either they
have become ſtupid and dull Fools, or raſh and violent ones,
drown'd in Phlegm and Sloth, or infatuated with rage and
confidence. And in both caſes are they fit to be eaſily impoſed
upon, and to become a Prey or a Tool to greedy and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Knaves. But the beſt of the matter is, that honeſt men
need not much fear any faction that depends upon ſuch reel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Supporters.</p>
            <p>You muſt not ſpend much thought about what you ſhall
<hi>eat</hi> or <hi>drink,</hi> nor much of your time in theſe Pleaſures: This
is more than is neceſſary to promote the end of them, and
ſhows the Mind too much in love with the pleaſure it ſelf.
This is to make the enjoyment of that your End; and then
it will be too much your Buſineſs. You will live as if you
had nothing elſe to do but to eat and drink, and had no other
Preparation for Death to make, but to fatten a Carkaſſe for
the Worms. The only good that an intemperate Perſon does
in the World, is, that he is induſtrious to deliver it quickly
from an unprofitable burden. There is a juſt Wo denounced
againſt thoſe ſwiniſh Drunkards, that make it their frequent
practice to ſpend whole dayes in drinking, in <hi>Iſa. 5. 11. Wo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99246:22"/>
unto them that riſe up early in the morning, that they may follow
ſtrong drink, that continue untill night till the Wine inflames
them.</hi> Thus is all uſefull ſervice to God and men neglected,
and the Sinner at length contracts a habit of Idleneſs, and
becomes utterly negligent of his own moſt important Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts;
he regards not his Trade, nor his Eſtate, or Salvation.
For this ſin, becauſe it was to ſo high a degree become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
among the Jews, 'tis ſaid in the 13<hi>th</hi> verſe of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Chapter, that people were puniſht with <hi>captivity</hi>
and <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not ſafe nor prudent to contrive, that your Proviſion
be ordinarily very delicate and various: you are the more in
danger of exceſs, and do make your own Table a Snare to
you. The affectation of this, when 'tis for your own pleaſure,
ſhows a wantonneſs of the Appetite, that ought not to be
allowed, and too great a love to the pleaſures of the Palate.
Or elſe 'tis the effect of former exceſs, which having glutted
and weakned the Appetite, it now wants to be excited. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
uſually preſerves it ſo well, as to need little aſſiſtance
from Art. Nature in health wants little of the exerciſe of
Art, and it ſerves only Luxury and Exceſs.</p>
            <p>You muſt ſo proportion your expences upon your Diet, as
not to neglect any other neceſſities of your own, or thoſe
of the Poor, the Church, or the State. He that is ſo far a
Glutton or a Drunkard, ſeldom ſtops there. The extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
deſire encreaſes the more 'tis gratified, and will ſoon grow
beyond his ability to ſatisfie it; and then he will rob either
God or Man to make himſelf more able. He will make his
Feaſts, if he can, with the Spoils of the Church, the neceſſary
maintenance of oppreſs'd Orphans and Widows, and the
fruits of other mens hard labour: And thus he devours his
own reputation too, and makes himſelf odious to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>You muſt order your Apparel alſo by the direction of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety.</hi>
The proper ends of cloathing our ſelves, are to cover
our Nakedneſs, and conceal our ſhame; to defend and guard
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99246:22"/>
the. frail Body from all unkindneſſes of weather; and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
the ſeveral ranks and degrees of men, by ſuitable
Ornament. The ſenſual minds of men are commonly much
influenced by ſenſible things, and therefore are ſplendid or
grave habits uſed to procure that reſpect and veneration
which is due to thoſe Perſons that wear them. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
abuſe of Apparel, and that from which all the Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities
concerning it do proceed, is too much affectation of
Ornament, upon the account of that reſpect which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
paid to it in the world. Thoſe that leaſt underſtand
true excellency, and give the greateſt Veneration to external
ornament in others, are wont to be moſt concerned about
this for themſelves. They take leſs care to adorn and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
their Minds with Knowledge, Wiſdom and Vertue, than
to adorn their out-ſide with fine and gaudy Cloaths. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that advice of the Apoſtle in this caſe, which he gives,
1 <hi>Pet. 3. 3, 4. Let your adorning be</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>not that of the
out-ſide, of plaiting the hair, and of wearing gold, or of putting
on Apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which
is not corruptible, in a meek and quiet Spirit, which in the ſight of
God is of great value.</hi> 'Tis of more importance ſurely to have
thoſe excellencies which are in eſteem with God, than thoſe
which are only valued by the weakeſt of men. How little
muſt it deſerve of time, coſt and pains, to obtain the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Fools. A wiſe man, thô he will not ſlight altogether
this ſenſual means of procuring reſpect from the ignorant and
vulgar, becauſe that reſpect may in ſome caſes be neceſſary
to himſelf, and uſefull for them; yet he will not be much
concern'd about ornament, becauſe none but ſuch men will
value and reſpect him at all the more for that.</p>
            <p>Since this is all that Ornament ſerves for, he will not to
be fine, neglect the neceſſary defence of his body. He will
conſider, that the rude Elements pay no reſpect to a Faſhion,
and therefore will not expoſe himſelf to be hurt by them, for
the unprofitable reſpect of fooliſh men.</p>
            <p>He will not think that the matter of dreſſing can deſerve
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99246:23"/>
to be the ſole buſineſs of himſelf and a ſervant, for ſeveral hours,
and to be managed with a curious accuracy and care.</p>
            <p>'Tis doubtleſs a great folly for a man to employ a great
part of his Eſtate in the proviſion of his Apparel. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of the body is ſerved with a ſmall expence; and if you
will value the eſteem of men, 'tis wiſeſt to obtain by good and
generous actions the eſtimation of the beſt and wiſeſt men:
This is a more valuable reputation than you can purchaſe by
great expences on your Cloathing.</p>
            <p>He that affects to be fine above his quality and degree, that
he may have the greater reſpect, will find none at all: Some will
be as fooliſh as himſelf, and ſtrive to be equal to him; and all
others will deſpiſe and condemn him, either for his Pride,
or Prodigality. Cuſtom is the common Rule that preſcribes
what it becomes every mans quality and degree to wear.
But ſince alwayes ſome of every ſort are ſo fooliſh as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to equal their Superiours, and in ſo prodigal an Age
as ours is, the Cuſtom allows much more expence upon the
Apparel than is juſt or neceſſary; you ought to make thoſe
of your own ſort your Pattern, who are the moſt frugal and
moderate men. Together with the Cuſtom of the Times, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
your own Circumſtances; what is required by other
juſt occaſions of expence, and let the Cuſtom be obſerved only
ſo far, as Prudence and Juſtice will permit. Common practice
will not juſtifie any Vice in the ſight of God, thô it too often
does ſo in the opinions of men. And if it diſpleaſes him, that
others ſpend a great part of their Eſtates in the Ornament of
their Bodies, it will diſpleaſe him if you do ſo too. If a great
meaſure of what is ſpent in this purpoſe might be ſpared from
this, and better employ'd, it ought to be ſo, and the giver of
it expects that it ſhould be. And when you muſt render an
account how you have uſed the enjoyments that he gave, you
will appear, if you have been Prodigal in this matter, to have
been fooliſh if not unjuſt Stewards.</p>
            <p>(3.) Let your Recreations alſo be regulated by Sobriety.</p>
            <p>The goodneſs of God allows men the uſe of theſe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99246:23"/>
of body and mind: The powers of both are finite,
and may be wearied and waſted with continual labour; we
may divert our ſelves therefore ſometimes from buſineſs, to
be the better prepared to return to it again; but 'tis quite to
alter the nature and deſign of recreations, to make a buſineſs
of them, to ſpend all your time in running from one idle plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to another:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>He that lives in Pleaſure, is dead while he lives;</hi>
He is as uſeleſs to the World as a dead Carkaſs, and it may
be infects others too by a bad example, and he is as bad as
dead to himſelf, in regard that he does nothing towards his
own true Intereſt: He neglects all his moſt important affairs;
He becomes daily more and more a Slave to the malicious
Devil, by virtue of ſome ſins that grow confirm'd and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;
he ſwims down the ſtream of ſenſual Pleaſures, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the dead Sea of Pain and Perdition. In this careleſs
kind of Life, he is only buſie to deſtroy himſelf: He that
gives himſelf up to ſenſual pleaſure, does divert himſelf indeed,
but 'tis from Wiſdom, from Piety, from Virtue, from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Happineſs. Oh conſider how unprofitable a life this
is! what advantage have you from paſt dayes that have been
ſpent in Pleaſure? if you are ſick of the folly, and intend to
live more wiſely for the future, you have gain'd then ſome
advantage by them, but if you are hardened in the mad
courſe, and inclined ſtill to go on, you are much the worſe
for them. All wiſe and good men grieve to ſee a young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
wholly addicted to Pleaſure, they know the bitter Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
that will at one time or other follow this; they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
the torments of Mind, that early or late it will end in;
they know that every extravagance which you are now guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of, will one day prove a ſharp Sword to ſtab and wound
you.</p>
            <p>Recreations muſt not be uſed as <hi>Paſtimes,</hi> there can be no need
of any ſuch thing to us, who have but a little while to live,
and much to do; can you not tell what to do with your
time? is it ſo eaſie a matter to conquer vicious inclinations,
to wean your affections from their propenſity to ſenſible
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99246:24"/>
things, to furniſh your minds with every Virtue; that you
can do all this, and have too much time? if beſides this you
have any publick buſineſs to attend, you have more need to
redeem your time than to throw it away; if you may hereafter
have ſuch buſineſs, 'tis your wiſdom to improve the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of your preſent leiſure, for the preparing your ſelf to
manage it to your comfort and honour.</p>
            <p>Let the Recreations you chuſe be only ſuch as are lawful;
there are as many allowed as you can want, enow to ſpend
more time about than you can well afford; do not venture
therefore upon any that have certainly ſin in them;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Rejoyce
not in Iniquity;</hi> make not any ſins of other men the matter
of your delight or diverſion, 'tis contrary to the rule of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to be pleaſed with that which is ſo hurtful and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to the guilty perſon; 'tis the Pleaſure of a Devil to
tempt and draw men into ſin, and then laugh at them; do
not make your ſelves merry with ſacred things, they are not
matters to be jeſted with, which ought to be reverenced:
it is not neceſſary either to the Mind or the Body, nor cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſafe, and therefore not prudent to uſe thoſe Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
concerning which Divines are in diſpute whether they be
lawful or no, ſuch as they are which rely wholly upon chance,
as Dice and the like: in a doubtful Caſe, where no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
compells, 'tis too great a boldneſs not to abſtain from ſuch
things.</p>
            <p>Chuſe thoſe Recreations that are leaſt offenſive to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Wiſe, and avoid all that are not of good Report:
They I think are juſtly cenſur'd, who frequent publick Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Schools, and Balls, and eſpecially Maſqueraders. 'Tis
no preciſe moroſeneſs to cenſure thoſe who need not diſguiſe
or conceal themſelves, if they intended to do nothing ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
You muſt value and be concerned to maintain a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or you are loſt; there is little hope of that man, that
he will ever be good and truly honourable, who is grown re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of this; 'tis a wonder if he does not run into all
manner of wickedneſs, when the reſtraint of Shame is taken
off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99246:24"/>
'Tis great imprudence, to uſe thoſe Recreations that are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
temptations to wickedneſs. Since our power to reſiſt ſin
is very weak, and we are naturally more inclined to comply
with than reſiſt it; we ought by flying the temptations and
occaſions, to ſeek that ſafety which our own ſtrength cannot
give us. To young perſons the deſcription and repreſentation
of ſome ſins is a Temptation, eſpecially is it miſchievous,
when in the repreſentation the guilty perſon is introduced
wittily pleading for his ſin, and juſtifying or extenuating it
for thô what is wittily ſpoken, is not alwayes the truth, yet
it is generally apt to impoſe upon young perſons that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate,
and have not reſolutely fixed in themſelves good
Principles. You cannot ſay there is no harm in going of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the Play-houſe, if you become thereby more addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſenſual Pleaſures, which are there repreſented with all
poſſible advantages to charm and allure; unhappy Youth is
too much inclined to theſe without ſuch help: You do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
receive hurt by ſeeing Playes, if Luſt be inflamed, or
Pride in Apparel encreas'd, or you learn Diſſimulation, and
become ſtronger inclined to any of the Vices of the Age;
if you learn there to deſpiſe Morality, Government, Laws
and Religion, by ſeeing the errours and defects of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
and wiſe and good men repreſented and derided:
Humane nature is in all inſtances unperfect, and the greateſt
and beſt men are not without ſome faults, but to repreſent
thoſe of Magiſtrates and Miniſters upon a publick Theater,
to be ſcorn'd and laught at, has commonly the miſchievous
event of making Magiſtracy and Miniſtry vile, and the Age
licentious.</p>
            <p>Do not play out of Love to Money, or meerly to win of
others; this is the Trade of common Cheats, and tends to
make you ſuch; this gratifies a covetous humour, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
it, and is a relaxation that binds you faſter in the bonds
of Iniquity. Avoid too the contrary extream to this, and
be not willing to loſe more than is convenient: you muſt
not neglect to provide things neceſſary, and convenient, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99246:25"/>
decent for your ſelf and your family. Be not ſo unjuſt and
cruel, as to throw away your Creditors money, your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
wages, your Childrens bread and Inheritance, or
your Wives Portion, to enjoy ſo ſmall, ſo unneceſſary a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
as that of play. How barbarous is he, that will make
ſo many miſerable, without any neceſſity or real advantage
to himſelf. That you may not thô unwillingly, throw away
too much at play, it ſhould be your reſolution not to venture
too much: Venture no more than you may be willing to
loſe, and if that be gone, command your ſelf at that time to
proceed no further. Gaming does often inſenſibly entice men
into exceſs, in the time they ſpend at it, and in the Money
they expoſe: If they win, they are encouraged to both theſe,
in hopes that good luck will ſtill favour them: If they loſe,
they are tempted to go on with hope to turn their fortune,
and recover their loſſes: To recover a great deal at once, they
are tempted to expoſe a great deal more, and ſo frequently
loſe more to too much loſt already. It requires more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for a man to govern himſelf well in theſe matters, than
is commonly found in thoſe that are much addicted to them.</p>
            <p>Take heed that you be not tranſported with paſſion in
your play. All exceſs in it may follow, if you have once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Reins to paſſion; and beſides, you will be apt if you
are croſt, to blaſpheme God, and quarrel with your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
That is too dear a recreation, and much more ſad in the
conſequence than it can be pleaſant in the enjoyment, wherein
you offend God, and hurt your Neighbour and your own Soul.</p>
            <p>Thus I have finiſht the firſt and chief part of this deſign,
and ſhown you wherein the right uſe of the things of this
World does conſiſt.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the ſecond thing intended; which is, <hi>to
urge thoſe Motives included in the Apoſtles argument here, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you ſo to uſe this world as not abuſing it:</hi> His Argument
for this is, <hi>The faſhion of this World paſſes away;</hi> and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives

            <p>1. <hi>'Tis poſſible your preſent enjoyments may fail and be loſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the end of your life:</hi> There is hardly any good thing of
this World that men enjoy, which they can be aſſured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in poſſeſſion all their days.</p>
            <p>We cannot be certain of the continuance of our Riches.
<hi>Job,</hi> that on one day was the Wealthieſt man in all the Eaſt
Countrey in his time, became by the next, miſerably poor.
How many like Inſtances does Hiſtory preſent us with? And
how many more might our own obſervation in a few years
tell us, if we make obſervation? If you are Rich in Treaſures,
Thieves may ſteal them; if in Ships and Merchandize, the
ſtormy Sea may ſwallow them, or they may be ſeized by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
or adverſe Nations: If in Buildings, or a large ſtock of
rich Goods, Fire may conſume them; if in Lands, they may
be wreſted from you by Tricks of Law, and the knavery of
corrupted Judges and Lawyers. The negligence or impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Servants may ruine the Maſter, or if they are diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and wicked, they may draw from him to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
eſpecially, when the whole management of an Eſtate
is committed to them. The Providence of God may blaſt a
mans Eſtate, ſo that it ſhall waſt he knows not how, nor how
to prevent it. Riches, which you may hope will be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
againſt Adverſity, may expoſe you to it. Some have
been miſerable, and ſome have loſt their lives by being rich:
They are often a Prey to violence and injuſtice, when poorer
Perſons are let alone. In the Invaſions of Enemies, the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the great are rifled, while the poor lonely Cottage may
ſtand ſecure; and they themſelves are chiefly ſought for and
kill'd,<note place="margin">Jer. 52. 16.</note> or made Captives, while <hi>the Poor of the Land</hi> eſcape by
being deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>What conſtancy is there in the Honours of this World,
which depend upon the changeable inclinations and eſteem of
men? Has not the World often ſeen the greateſt Favourites of
Princes become the Objects of their hatred and ſcorn; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
and overthown by the detractions firſt, and then the
accuſations of envious men; who after they have ſhone a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
while with the borrowed luſtre of their Princes favour, have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99246:26"/>
gone down Eclips'd, and bluſht perhaps in their own blood
at their ſetting.</p>

when his Eſtate is thrown away: He that lacks bread, may

            <p>Now, if theſe things are gone away from you while you
live, all the Pleaſure, the Convenience of them is vaniſht too;
and then, what will the wretched man do to be happy, who
had ſet his chief affections on theſe things? What will he do
for delights, when all that he delighted in is gone? How
burdenſome and melancholly will the remaining part of his
life be! How often will he ſadly think, how happy he has
been, how miſerable he is! Should we truſt <hi>in uncertain Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
and not rather <hi>in the living God,</hi> when <hi>they</hi> may fail us,
<hi>he</hi> cannot! Shall we lay any confidence on friends, when
the minds of men are ſo mutable? Is not this to lean on a
broken Reed, which may fail our truſt, and would us
with diſappointment? What ſhame and confuſion will
ſeize him in an adverſe condition, who in his Proſperity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
himſelf haughtily towards others! How uneaſie will
it be to his lofty Spirit, to ſee himſelf the ſcorn of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
abjects! And yet certainly no man is ſo likely to meet
with contempt in a low condition, as he that practiſed it in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99246:26"/>
a higher. It ſhould be a provocation to brave actions, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider;
Perhaps my Fortune may not long continue my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
for the doing of them. A generous and publick
Spirit, a lover of mankind, would ſay, Since the enjoyment
of theſe things is uncertain, I will do all the good with them
to mankind that I can whilſt I yet retain them; I will induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſet my ſelf to this, leſt I loſe my advantages, and die
without doing any good in my time. If a man has exerciſed
much compaſſion to others in their Miſery, he will find much
in his own; if he has been injurious, and an oppreſſor, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one will retaliate, and the ſame meaſure that he gave to
others, ſhall be meted to him again. If by good and virtuous
actions a man has acquired the eſteem and friendſhip of good
and virtuous men, they will not deſert him in his adverſity,
but will join their aſſiſtance to comfort or raiſe him up; but
if all his Friends and Familiars, and all that eſteem him, are
men of no virtue, of debaucht Principles and Manners, they
will ſoon forſake him when adverſity comes: The cold blaſts
of that will very eaſily cool the love of ſuch men; and thô
they crowd his Table with their company while 'tis covered
with rich plenty, he may eat his morſels in melancholly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
when they are ſcanty and courſe. How uneaſie will
Poverty be to him that lived in boundleſs pleaſure; who could
deny himſelf in nothing, but was wont to gratifie every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
and now has nothing to enjoy? He is poſſeſt with high
and raging deſires, and has no means to ſatisfie them. A
temperate man will much more eaſily endure ſuch a change,
who has been wont ſometimes to croſs his own deſires, and
by that means has kept them moderate. 'Tis certainly the

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99246:27"/>
and all the admired Charms of Youth and Beauty:<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Man goes
to his long home, and the Mourners goe about the ſtreets:</hi> The
gawdy Rooms are hung with melancholy Sable, and his
Friends lay aſide Ornaments, and cover themſelves with black;
he is carried away to the dark ſilent Grave, to become neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
duſt, and a cold unbeautiful Clod; his place here ſhall
know him no more for ever; he goes to Eternity, never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to return again to time: His Walks, his Houſes, his Parks,
his Shop, the Exchange, the places of his Buſineſs, or his
pleaſure ſhall know him again no more for ever; <hi>Oh that men
were wiſe, that they would underſtand this, and conſider their lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the enjoyment of theſe things is tranſitory, and will
be ſhort, ſhould we place our Affections upon them? Good
things are uſually of greater or leſs eſteem with us, according
to their durableneſs; ſince therefore Life with its Pleaſures
are not durable, 'tis not worthy of a great Value. If we
could but frame a lively conception of the ſhortneſs of this
Life, how ſhould we deſpiſe the Pleaſures of it? Vain are the
Riches of the World, which are uſeful no longer than while
we live here; Vain are all the Honours and Applauſes of
the Age, which cannot reſcue us from Deaths dark Priſon,
nor attend us to the other World: What account would you
make of a fine houſe founded on a Quick-ſand? what account
of Mirth and Jollity in a ſmall Cock-boat on the wide Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?
what account of a Pleaſant Dream? ſuch alas is all the
Proſperity of this World: Open then thine eyes, thou deluded
admirer of theſe things, and take a view of the Eternal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and Glories of the World to come; ſee what Joyes,
what delights, what bright Manſions, what a bleſſed Society
do invite thy affections upward; the Infinite, Eternal, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
God, thy chief good, invites thy Affections, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
himſelf to be thy everlaſting Portion, and exceeding great
Reward; ſet thy affections then on things above, and let thy
deareſt treaſure be in Heaven; ſpend thy time more in ſtriving
to attain theſe, than in the enjoyment of preſent things;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99246:28"/>
conclude it moſt abſurd, to value things temporal above the
eternal, and to chuſe the frail pleaſures of this life, when they
ſtand in competition with thoſe that are ever laſting. To
make your paſſage out of this world comfortable, you muſt
be ſecure of Comforts in the other; you will be glad to leave
a Life ſo allay'd with frequent vexations, as this is, to every
man, when you have good hopes to enjoy that Happineſs
which knows no mixture of trouble: Since Death is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Neceſſity which every man muſt obey, 'tis the Wiſdom
and Intereſt of every one to provide that he may undergoe it
with Comfort.</p>
            <p>Since the end of all your preſent Pleaſures is certain and
near, live piouſly, righteouſly, and ſoberly in the enjoyment
of them, that ye may not when that time comes, be troubled
with a <hi>Guilty Mind.</hi> Oh how intolerable will it be to bear at
once the loſs of all your preſent Comforts, with the pangs of
a painfull death, and the torments of a deſpairing remorſe!
How ſad a ſtate will you think your ſelf in, when you are
ſummon'd to depart hence, and a rouzed Conſcience preſents
to your view a long Catalogue of enormous Crimes! Will
you not then wiſh you had lived a regular Life, when you
find your ſelf going to receive what a Life of wickedneſs has
deſerved. Oh how ungrateful now will be the remembrance
of unlawful Pleaſures, of your guilty exceſſes, and mad care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
of your immortal Souls! Now the ſting of ſinful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
is ſeverely felt, and they wound and torment the Sinner
more deep and ſenſibly than ever they pleaſed him before; it
torments him to think that for ſuch things he ſhould caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
himſelf, and incurr the eternal Wrath of God; and he
is ſeized with dread and horrour, at the thoughts of what is
likely for the future to become of him; he fears he ſhall be
baniſht by the angry Juſtice of God to ſome diſmal abode,
where no ſmall Comfort will ever come near him; that he
ſhall change his merry Companions for the curſed Society of
damned Spirits, to dwell among them a weak, ſcorn'd, abuſed
Stranger, to be vexed without pity by malicious Creatures,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99246:28"/>
whoſe own Torments encreaſe their rage; he would pray it
may be for Mercy, but his own remembred Cruelty daſhes
his hopes; he ſhow'd no mercy in his Life, but was deaf to
the wants and intreaties of the Poor, while he ſpent his wealth
in Riot and Luxury; he would cry to God to ſpare his Life a
little longer, and try how well he would manage the reprieve,
but that he calls to mind how deaf himſelf has been to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Commands, how he has deſpiſed the Promiſes and
Threats of God, and neglected all the warnings and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that were ſent to him:<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 24. to the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> And indeed, <hi>Since he has hated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and deſpiſed Reproof,</hi> to the laſt, <hi>God will now laugh at
his Calamity, and deſpiſe him when theſe fears come upon him:</hi> The
ſeaſon of abuſed Mercy is at an end, and deſerved Vengeance
begins and now to have been a holy and a good man, would
more avail than to have worn a Crown and wielded a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Now the greateſt of men is rejected, if he be an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Sinner; nothing but righteouſneſs and holineſs can find
any favour with the righteous and holy God: Now will he
that was injurious to men, find the great Soveraign of the
World a ſevere avenger of all wrongs; and he that abuſed his
enjoyment of the Creatures and gifts of God, ſhall be baniſht
from the Happineſs of enjoying God himſelf; this is the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
end of a wicked Life, and thus will the Wretch be uſed at
laſt, who abuſes his Portion here.</p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>By the abuſe of your preſent enjoyments, you encreaſe the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
of them, at leaſt with reſpect to your ſelves:</hi> You make
your changeable Condition here more liable to change, if you
do not uſe it well; a man muſt uſe a veſſel of Glaſs with more
care than he need to do one of Iron: The loſs of your enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
during Life, or by Death, may be cauſed or haſtened
by the abuſe of them.</p>
            <p>That Eſtate which might afford a man comfort and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
through a long life, a few years of extravagant expences
will make an end of: the deepeſt Bag has a bottom; and you
may obſerve by other men, that the greateſt Eſtate, if it be
not wiſely and moderately uſed, may in a little time be thrown
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99246:29"/>
away. <hi>The Glutton and the Drunkard ſhall come to Poverty;
and Drowzieneſs ſhall cloath a man with Raggs,</hi> ſayes the wiſe
man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 21. Again, <hi>By means of a whoriſh Woman a
man is brought to a morſel of bread, Prov.</hi> 6. 26. He ſhall be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
juſt as the Prodigal in the Parable; firſt gull'd and drawn
dry of all his Wealth, and to that purpoſe may be highly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
and carefully pleas'd and humour'd, and when he is poor
ſhall be deſpiſed as much, and kickt out of Doors, and then
like him he may have the honour to ſerve Swine, or be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to dine with them. Theſe ſins, when a man becomes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to them, do naturally bewitch him with a ſtrange care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
of all his Affairs, and tend to make him moſt laviſhly
prodigal. He cannot keep his expence upon them within any
other bounds than neceſſity forces: As long as his own Eſtate
will adminiſter to him, or others will lend, theſe wild ſins can
find occaſion for expence.</p>
            <p>The exceſſive and intemperate uſe of ſenſual pleaſures,
weakens and gluts the Appetite, and he that ſo uſes them, can
never have ſo high a Reliſh and ſenſe of them as he may that is
moderate. Fooliſh men through their greedy deſire of Pleaſure,
deſtroy the thing they love: The Rich Glutton cannot take ſo
much delight in his higheſt delicacies, as the hungry Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
does in his courſe fare.</p>
            <p>By Exceſs too, men deſtroy themſelves; they turn food in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Poyſon, and bring themſelves to miſery by their pleaſures.
It blaſts the health of their body, and fills them with uneaſie
diſtempers; and hereby their lives are made miſerable, and
their death is haſtened: After a few tedious and groaning years
they drop betimes into their Graves. Sobriety and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are the moſt effectual means to cheriſh the health and life.
But a man muſt begin and practiſe them from his youth, that
they may have this effect: 'Tis late to begin it when you have
corrupted the blood, and evaporated the ſpirits, and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
diſtempers: the Jewel health is much more eaſily kept,
than recover'd when 'tis once loſt.</p>
            <p>Poverty, Sickneſs and Death, the great Enemies of your
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99246:29"/>
Pleaſures, are the natural Conſequents of the intemperate
uſe of them. But beſides, theſe evils may be expected to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this, from the juſt judgment of God. As he is highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at every abuſe of his gifts, he may teſtifie that diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
by taking them away from you, or you from them.
Conſider, careleſs Sinner, that you continually provoke the
righteous God, to put an end to all your Mirth and Pleaſure;
every irregularity you are guilty of deſerves this, and perhaps
does haſten intended Vengeance: The more you abuſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of God, the more unlikely do you make the continuance
of it.</p>
            <p>Now conſider theſe things but a little, and the folly of a
lawleſs intemperate Life will moſt plainly appear; is it not
an unparalel'd folly to purchaſe a little wild Mirth at the dear
rate of a miſerable remainder of Life, and a haſty Death?
Alas how little of the Pleaſures of this Life do you enjoy, who
are ſo ſoon overtaken by Diſtempers! what delight can a
Man take in his dainties, when his ſick Stomach nauſeates
them? what Pleaſure is there in Muſick when the Head akes,
or is affected with a Frenzy or a Lethargy? what delight has
the Sinner in his moſt pleaſant Sins, when he lies languiſhing
in a Bed, his feeble Limbs not able to ſupport him, and there
he is rotting alive? the remembrance of them is rather vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
than pleaſant, whe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the pains he feels were contracted
by them. How little of the Pleaſures of Life do they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
that ſoon dye, are cut off in the midſt of their dayes,
and carried out to be laid in the Duſt? Methinks if there
were no other Argument for Temperance, the Love of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſhould perſwade to it: Conſider too how ſad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
that Death will be, which you are conſcious that
your ſelves have haſtened; when you think how many
years longer in a courſe of nature you might have lived,
and now are called haſtily away from all that you have
loved and delighted in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:99246:30"/>
Thus do careleſs Sinners purſue their own Miſery and
Vexation, when they allow themſelves a boundleſs gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their Luſts, and ſeem to be only in the purſuit
of Pleaſure; let it therefore be your reſolution and care, ſo
to uſe this World as not abuſing it.</p>
            <p>Now I have finiſht both the intended parts of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
I have ſhown you how to behave your ſelves in
the uſe of your preſent enjoyments towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your Neighbour, and your ſelves; and the motive
which the Spirit of God thought worthy to perſwade men
thus to uſe theſe things, I have illuſtrated; what ſucceſs
this Diſcourſe has upon the Reader, I know not, but
doubtleſs the great God obſerves; either it will reclaim or
withhold thee from the Vices of a mad Age, or make
thee more guilty in following them, after having received
another Exhortation to the contrary: Thou doſt not in
tend perhaps to run into the great extravagances menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
but yet art unwilling to obſerve the ſtrictneſs of
Rule; but conſider, that ſin is very apt to encreaſe, that
the ſmall degrees of tranſgreſſion allow'd make way for
greater, and they make it juſt with God, and provoke
him to give thee up to ſuch a high degree of ſin, as may
ſeverely puniſh its ſelf. Conſider, this general Rule which
I have explain'd and urg'd, is the Command of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, thou canſt not willingly break it without Offence
to him; 'tis of no leſs conſequence to obſerve or ſlight it,
than to enjoy his favour or incurr his diſpleaſure: Oh
think how eaſily he can cruſh the bold offending Worm!
think what a danger he is in who ſtands expoſed by his
Crimes to the Divine Vengeance! Dread the invincible
thunder of his Wrath! Think what Vengeance is due
from God to him who makes his Advantages to do much
good, the means to do much evil; who contradicts the
end of God in the Gifts that he has beſtowed on him,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99246:30"/>
and has been only the more wicked, for the Bounty of
God towards him; who to gratifie his own wanton and
unneceſſary Appetites, has often Offended; what ſevere Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
muſt ſuch a Sinner deſerve? Conſider that this
general rule directs you to uſe your Portion with Credit
and Comfort, to make your Life as happy in what you
have, as that can make it; to improve your Portion to
the beſt advantage; It directs to ſuch a courſe as will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your paſſage out of Life eaſie and chearful, attended
with a quiet mind, with the applauſes of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and all your good Actions will then afford you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
thoughts and reflections; It directs you ſo to uſe
your Portion, as to make your Death as much lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by others, as welcome to your ſelf, ſo as to embalm
your Name, and make your Memory bleſt and praiſed to
Poſterity. This rule directs you to ſuch an uſe of your
preſent enjoyments, as will be matter of Conſolation to
you in the other World, matter of eternal ſatisfaction and
joy, when the good deeds which you wrought here, ſhall
there be eternally rewarded.</p>
            <p>I think then the Reader may eaſily conclude, I have been
pleading with him in his own behalf, for himſelf and his own
intereſt; I have been urging nothing but what Self-love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Wiſdom would chuſe: Who would think it
ſhould be a Preſumption in me to imagine, that in ſuch a caſe
I ſhall prevail with many? can it be a difficult thing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
Men to that which is their own Intereſt? but alas, it
does too often prove ſo! Blinded by Luſt and Temptation;
men will not ſee their true Intereſt in the cleareſt diſcovery
that can be made of it. God alone can effectually open the
eyes of men to underſtand that, and incline their Wills to
chuſe and purſue it; to him therefore I commit the Reader
with this Prayer.</p>
