            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

shall offer is this; <hi>That the dearest of
Gods Children may think themselves in
a state of Damnation. David</hi> is a full
instance to confirm this Doctrine, 51
<hi>Psal. 11, 12. Cast me not away from thy

Salvation. David</hi> had lost the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
sense and feeling of Gods
love, and began highly to question
his Salvation, <hi>Asaph</hi> also, 77 <hi>Psalm</hi>
7, 8, 9. shews what a great conflict
he had with diffidence. <hi>Will the Lord
cast off for ever? will he be favourable
no more? is his mercy clean gone? hath
God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in
anger shut up his tender Mercies?</hi> And
so <hi>Heman</hi> here in the Text; <hi>Thou hast
laid me in the lowest Pit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59581:7"/>1. Because the Spirit of Bondage
always goes before the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption;
God doth break and bruise
the Souls of his Servants, before he
doth bind up and heal them; He
makes the Sinner to hear the terrible
voice of the Law, before he hears the
comfortable voice of the Gospel; He
throughly convinceth us of Sin, and

us apprehend Christ as a Saviour to

            <p>All that are brought into Heaven

such a poor Soul? this is that which
makes so many under the Spirit of
Bondage, to fear that God will cast
them off for ever, and to complain
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59581:8"/>
as though they were in Hell already.</p>
            <p>And questionless, the great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

hath been the reason that made any
so bold to say, <hi>That there is no Hell but
that of Conscience.</hi> The Apostles words
<hi>Rom. 8. 15. For ye have not received the
Spirit of Bondage again to fear,</hi> do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that all the Elect undergo the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors

            <p>2 Reason is, because God may, and

            <p>Many pretious Servants of God lie
in the Little-ease of an afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

as if God had forsaken Him, it

it is but a moment compared with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity)
but Reprobates are forsaken

            <p>3. A Child of God may relapse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some Sin which he had repented of,
and that may cause terror of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
God Redeemed, and brought
up <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but they would

God to fright him out of such wicked

attempt by the terrors of Conscience;
If God shoot terrours into the Soul,
they will stick fast, and make us go
heavily, if God set our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ins in order
before us, He can make the sense of
Sin to be more painful then the most

Wracks and Strapadoes are but

               </gap>asie punishments to the wracking of
Conscience; to set out the misery of
such a condition, the Scripture tells
us, <hi>The Spirit of a man may bear his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,

strength of body may wrestle with a
Disease, but the trouble of mind is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable
and insupportable; the grief
of the Soul, is the Soul of grief. If
we see the fits of an Ague so easily
master the greatest Spirits, and make
them quiver and quake in a cold fit,
and burn and be distempered in a hot
fit; if a Disease can so punish the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
then what terrours can the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59581:10"/>
dart into the Soul, even to
make our very knees to shake as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar</hi>'s
did when he saw the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
against him; and for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
namely, because it was a hand
from God; and because the writings
mentioned the loss of his Kingdom.
A wounded Conscience is the more
filled with horror, because the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is from God, and it doth threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the loss of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>What Consternation was there,
what sad thoughts, during the time of
that devouring Fire in <hi>London?</hi> O
then, when the Soul looks on God as
a consuming fire, and thinks it shall
dwell with everlasting burnings, what
horror and disquiet must it needs be
seized with?</p>
            <p>Usually God dealeth with obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Sinners, as Men deal with sturdy
Rogues, (put heavier Irons upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59581:10"/>
them, and give them severer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
the more we load our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
with Sin, the more God loads
us with terrors of Conscience, and
so gives us sour sauce for the seeming
sweet-meats of Sin; If we have been
great and notorious sinners, God may
chastise us with Scorpions. <hi>Manasseh</hi>
was a great sinner, and it is said (<hi>he
was taken among the Thorns, and bound
in Fetters,</hi> in the 2 <hi>Chron. 33. chap.</hi> 11.
<hi>Ver.</hi> The more we have delighted in
any sin, the more it will torment
conscience when God reckoneth with
us for it: <hi>Paul</hi> a refractory Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
was strucken to the ground when
God converted him.</p>
            <p>4. Reason why a child of God may
think himself damned for a time, is,
because the wisdom of God bringeth
much good out of this evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this will
make us more highly to prize both
our Redeemer and our Redemption
too: How sweet and comfortable is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59581:11"/>
the sight of a Pardon to a condemned
person? Ho wpretious is a glimpse of
Christ's love in any promise to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
condemned in his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
How comfortable is the
thought of Christ to Justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie, unto
those Souls that are ready to be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up of Despair? what love,
what thankfulness will such a sight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in such a Soul? How thankful
were the famishing <hi>Egyptians</hi> to <hi>Iosep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

47 Gen. 25. Thou hast saved our Lives</hi>
(though they exchanged their Land
for Bread,) Then what thanks is due
to Jesus Christ who saveth our Souls
freely?</p>
            <p>2. This good ariseth from this evil
of an afflicted Conscience, that it will
mightily increase our hatred of Sin;
This is one of Gods great designs in
breaking our bones for sin, that he
may break our Souls from sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
a Christian that hath lain long in
the stocks of the Law, to commit any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59581:11"/>
of his former sins, will he not answer,
(I will not buy Repentance at so dear
a rate?) had your Soul been so long
broken on the wheel of Conscience as
mine hath been, had you so long car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in your bosom the burning coals
of an accusing Conscience; had you
been thus scorched with the flames of
Hell, surely, like the burnt Child you
would dread the fire more, you would
not dare to add sin to sin, and heap up
more wrath.</p>
            <p>3. We are made to Pray more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly;
the Prisoner at the Bar begs
heartily because he is begging for life;
A self-condemned sinner prayes hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
because he is begging for the life
of his soul.</p>
            <p>4. The terrors of Conscience will
make us more humble and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
all our days, pride will not so
easily breed in this bitter wood, the
Worm takes the sweetest wood soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
the Wormwood of Conscience
kills pride.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59581:12"/>5. Gods breaking and bruising is
in order to a perfect cure,</p>
            <p>The last reason why a child of God
may think himself damned: it may
arise either from a neglect of a serious
examination of our condition, or
from a melancholy temper which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
very much to such despairing
thoughts.</p>
            <p>Who hath not either read or heard
what strange conceits melancholy
hath caused some to have of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?
some fancying themselves to be
a Fourm, and that every one would sit
on them; others thinking themselves
to be a Glass, and that every thing
would break them; or to be like <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar,</hi>
to have the Soul of a
Beast, and to eat grass like a Beast,
(which some say was but a strange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of a strong melancholy,) even
such strange apprehensions may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
christians have of their
Souls, insomuch that many christians
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59581:12"/>
have thought themselves to be in H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll,
and for a long time have led most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
lives by that fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of of wrath and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to devour them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application</hi> is, 1. For Information,
We must not censure those too hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that lie under a Spirit of Bondage;
those are not damned that may think
themselves in a damned state, the new
birth hath grievous pangs and throes;
those whose sin is ever before their
faces, must needs cry out of a heavy
burthen of wrath.</p>
            <p>Before this Spirit of Bondage, we
are like <hi>Issachar,</hi> who is called a <hi>strong
Ass couching under two Burthens,</hi> Gen.
49. <hi>Ver.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>We have a burthen of guilt, and a
burthen of wrath, and yet we are not
sensible of either; but the Spirit of
Bondage shews the intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59581:13"/>That I may endeavour to speak
something to afflicted Consciences,</p>
            <p>Although you say a Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
is a woful condition, yet I assure
you your condition was much worse
before you came under this Spirit of
Bondage.</p>
            <p>To be hardned in Sin, is a worse
condition, then to be thus harrased by
Conscience for Sin; to be bold to
commit sin, is far worse then to be
bruised for sin committed: you are in
a great deal worse condition then all
Hypocrites that go quietly to Hell;
How many thousand in the world that
are guilty of the same sins you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of, and yet are senseless as
stones? It is good to hear christians
roar in the sense of sin: to hear a man
that is bruised with a fal sensibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
and tell where his pain lies, is
a good sign that there is hopes of his
recovery: It is the same in a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
to complain of sin, and cry out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59581:13"/>
in the fear of that wrath due to sin, is
a good sign that Conscience is alive,
that Conscience is awake.</p>
            <p>A seared Conscience is far worse
than an afflicted Conscience; a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
condition is the very worst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
if you rightly consider, you
have cause to bless God for a Spirit
of Bondage, that while many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are riding Post to Hell, God hath
stopt you that were running the same
Road; Remember therefore for your
comfort, that many have been lead to
the place of Execution, and have
stood with the rope about their necks,
having the sentence of death in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and yet have been pardoned
after so great a fright; Many christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are dealt with after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
God may leave them a long
while in the Jaylors custody, in fear
of eternal Execution, (I mean buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed
by Satan under temptations to
despair) and yet God may come in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59581:14"/>
with a Pardon at last, only he intends
to fright us from sin by this means
for the future. I have heard of one
whose friends had got him a Pardon,
and yet suffered him to be lead to the
place of Execution, to make him be
more afraid of lewd courses for the
future: There may be a Pardon for
us in Gods hand, and yet it may not
so presently be given into our hand;
Nay, if you have been very long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Spirit of Bondage, though God
give a Pardon into your hand, yet
you may not be able to read it, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the dread of Exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ution)
Many now living besides me, may
remember a man in <hi>Oxford,</hi> that was
to draw Lots for his life, and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

death, that he threw it away, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that he was to die, until some
that stood nigh him read his Lott, and
told him that was to live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so it may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59581:14"/>
fare with an afflicted Conscience, God
may write (<hi>Live,</hi>) and yet the fear of
Hell may so far stupify the Soul, that
it may not be able to read the writing;
In case of temptation it is safest to let
some other Christian read the writing
for us, to let other Christians judge
of our condition.</p>
            <p>Remember therefore, that you were
under Satans Bondage, before you
were under the Spirit of Bondage; it
is much better to be Gods Prisoner,
than Satans, a man hardned in sin, is
a Prisoner without hope; but a man
bruised for Sin, is a Prisoner of hope;

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59581:15"/>It is a great comfort to a Patient

therefore there is no hope for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. It is a happy turn that
you see the want of Grace. 2. It is

            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> 2. To have Grace is one
thing, and to know that we have
Grace is another; that <hi>Ioseph</hi> liveth
is one thing, and that <hi>Iacob</hi> knows
that <hi>Ioseph</hi> liveth, is quite another
thing, for <hi>Iacob</hi> thought he had been
torn in pieces by some wilde beast,
and made a solemn mourning for him,
<hi>Gen. 34. Ver.</hi> 34, 35. In the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

the Note in the Margent of the Bible,
<hi>is greater than may be forgiven:</hi> He

it proved to be so, because he said
so: Unbelief makes sin unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

               </gap>etch
more tears from my eyes, then my
sins; How bitterly did <hi>Peter</hi> weep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

How plentifully did <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>
shed tears when we washed our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours

            <p>Abundance of tears do not always
declare true Repentance; We read of

            </p>
            <p>Tears seem to us to be all of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,

               <hi>Esau</hi>'s tears, and <hi>Peter</hi>'s, both wept
bitterly, and yet both of them wept
savingly.</p>
            <p>There may be true repentance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a flood of tears; the Thief on the
Cross was truly penitent, and yet we
do not read of a tear that dropt from
his eyes: <hi>David</hi> truly repented, and
yet we find no mention of any tears
when <hi>Nathan</hi> told him of his sins, 2.
<hi>Sam. chap. 12. ver.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his <hi>Cases of Conscience</hi>
hath abundantly satisfyed us, that
tears are not absolutely necessary to
true Repentance; some are naturally
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59581:19"/>
more dry of constitution, and barren
of Tears than others. I knew a Boy
that was not able to shed a tear to save
a whipping: True Repentance is to
be judged of, more by the inward sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the heart, then by the outward
sorrow that runs down the cheeks;
the greater the inward grief is, the
fewer tears will fall; as a high wind
keeps back the showers off, the great
combustion in the soul may keep back
the showers of tears; And so there
may be true Repentance with drie
cheeks.</p>
            <p>There is great weeping and wailing
in Hell, but no true Repentance.</p>
            <p>Children are more easie to shed tears
than grown men; Sighs and groans
is the usual way of expressing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
sorrow.</p>
            <p>And whereas you say you cannot
weep so much for sins as for outward
sufferings: for ought that we can
find, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> wept more at the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59581:19"/>
of Death, than when he humbled
himself for the pride of his heart.
<hi>Isai. 38. ver.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi>'s sickness drew more tears
from him than his Sins, <hi>Psal. 2. ver.</hi>
5, 6. What bitter lamentation did
he make when he received the unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
tidings of <hi>Absalom</hi>'s death? 2.
<hi>Kings chap.</hi> 18. last <hi>ver.</hi> and 19. <hi>chap.
4. ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those things that most press the
outward senses, do squeeze out most
tears: To see our House on fire, would
more easily force tears from our eyes,
than to hear a Sermon of the fire of
Hell, although that be much more
dreadful news.</p>
            <p>To conclude this particular; A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor
that is condemned to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
may shed more tears than one
that is pardoned; and yet he that is
pardoned may be more penitent than
he that is executed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59581:20"/>It is dangerous to make any stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
to measure true Repentance; for if
you will set any, it must be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all: so that unless you are sure
that you weep as bitterly as <hi>Peter,</hi> or
<hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> the Devil will still
tell you it is not true Repentance: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it looks so like a Papistical trick
(as if you thought that rivers of tears
could wash away sin without the
blood of Ghrist:) And when we have
wept until we can weep no more, if
Faith be not mixed with our Tears, it
is but legal Repentance.</p>
            <p>Alass! But I have committed foul
facts since my first conversion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> So did both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and
how did they recover themselves but
by Faith in Jesus Christ, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59581:20"/>
from dead works; Therefore
confess your sins to God, and think
of that comfortable portion of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
1. Epistle <hi>Iohn 2. chap. ver. 1.
If any man sin we have an Advocate with
the Father, Iesus Christ the Righteous:</hi>
It is not said, If any man sin not,
but <hi>if any man sin;</hi> Thus poor sinners
go loaded to Heaven with abundance
of experience of the riches of Gods
Grace, and freeness of his Mercy in
pardoning their heinous transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>There are commonly Three hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
in the way of afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>
            <p>1. Looking only upon Sin.</p>
            <p>2. A proud kind of seeming Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
            <p>3. A searching for the fruits of
Repentance, before we are sure of
Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59581:21"/>1. Many look only upon their
Sins, and not to their Saviour.</p>
            <p>Alass sayes the afflicted Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
my Sins are crying Sins,
Crimson Sins, Scarlet Sins, Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Sins, foul, frequent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against much Light, much
Love, against much Means, much
Mercy: If a wounded Man should
only look upon the bleeding wound,
would it not make him faint for
fear that he should bleed to death?
But when he seeth the skilful Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon
about to dress it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
his skill to cure it, this
upholds his sinking Spirits; even
so poor Sinners must needs faint,
and despair of Pardon, while they
look no further than their Sins,
which despairing thoughts would
soon vanish, if then we could
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59581:21"/>
look up to our Saviour, are not all
sins easie to be pardoned by Infinite
mercy.</p>
            <p>It was an excellent answer that one
returned the Devil, when he told
him of the heinousnefs of his sins,
<hi>thy sins should be pardoned too, if thou
couldst believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ can more easily pardon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
offences to us, then we can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to one another; He delighteth to
forgive much, so to engage us to love
him much. When some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
that his Daughter was dead, and
bid him not trouble the Master, <hi>Mark
5. ver.</hi> 35, 36. Christ bids him <hi>fear
not, only believe;</hi> and so to that other
person, <hi>Mark 9. ver. 23. If thou canst
believe,</hi> all things are possible to
him that believeth.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Martha</hi> said, <hi>by this time he
stinketh, for he hath been dead four days,
Ioh. 11. ver.</hi> 39, 40. Christ checks her,
<hi>Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldst
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59581:22"/>
believe, thou shouldst set the Glory of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These were all desperate c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ses, and
therefore the more proper for Christ
the Great Physitian.</p>
            <p>Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an cure inveterate Ulcers,
aswel as green wounds; therefore look
up to Christ, while you look down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your sins; see what power Christ
hath to save, while you behold what
power sin hath to damn; that so while
you see in your selves great cause of
despair, you may see in Him far greater
cause of hope.</p>
            <p>2. Hindrance to afflicted Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
is, a proud humility, or a kind
of seeming mannerlyness; It may be
like <hi>Peter,</hi> thou thinkst it not good
manners to let Christ wash thy Feet,
<hi>Iohn 13. ver. 8. Thou shalt never wash
my Feet; Calvin</hi>'s note on those words
is, <hi>Pride often lurketh under pretence of
humility;</hi> away with this destructive
manners, seeing that the great work
which God requireth of us, is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ as our Saviour, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59581:22"/>
to believe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> He both can and will
save us to the uttermost, surely we
cannot do it too soon.</p>
            <p>3 Hindrance. It may be that thou
searchest for the ripe fruits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
before thou art sure that
thou hast Faith; in the work of our
spiritual ingrafting into Christ, we are
like crab-stocks newly grafted, which
do not instantly bear fruit the same
day, or week, or the same month that
they are grafted; If we be truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
into Christ by Faith, Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and the fruits of it will appear
afterwards, but not the same hour
that we are ingrafted, (I mean not so
as to be discerned by us) look after
Faith first, before you search after
Repentance; Faith will help us to
repent: <hi>Paul</hi> did not bid the Jailor to
repent, but believe first, <hi>Acts 16. ver.</hi>
30, 31. He knew that Faith would
work Repentance; If the Devil tell
you (<hi>that you should hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> repented soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59581:23"/>
Remember that true Repentance
can never be too late, Christ dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you sinned; If therefore you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ now, you shall be as
surely pardoned as if you had begun
your repentance sooner: Repent, for

remember that the repenting Thief

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59581:23"/>The Devil lets them alone of whom

<hi>Iohn 8. ver. 11. neither do I condemn
thee;</hi> And yet he said to the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifying
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59581:24"/>
Pharisees, <hi>Ye shall die in your
sins.</hi> That sinner that confesseth and
bewaileth his guiltiness, him Christ
absolveth; but that Soul that thinks
it self Righteous without Christs
Righteousness, He abhorreth.</p>
            <p>If sin be your burden, Christ calls
you to Him; and therefore this some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that tells you you are damned,
must be from Satan that old lyer.</p>
            <p>You may know the Devil to be a
lyer in this, as well as in other things;
for God never made Satan of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie

saved, and who are to be damned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But pray tell me,</p>
            <p>Suppose the Devil should tell you
that you should be saved, would you
believe him then?</p>
            <p>Why then do you heed him now,
that he sayes you shall be damned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>
you should be saved; so now you have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59581:24"/>
cause to mistrust it less, because he tels you that you shal be damned; If the
Devil should possibly know that you
should be damned, for certain he
would never tell you so, for fear of
awaking your Conscience, and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you look after Salvation; If Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ do not tell us that we are
damned, we need not regard what
Satan says, for whatever he saith, he
is a lyer.</p>
            <p>This is not the first lie Satan hath

it is his Office to take care of such,
God hath sent him for that end and
purpose.</p>
               <p>2 Reason is, the helplesness of such
poor sinners, they can do nothing
but weep and complain, sigh and
mourn, and disquiet themselves more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59581:33"/>
at the apprehension of their misery,
but do not know what to do to ease
their consciences; therefore the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
nature of Christ makes him have
a tender eye towards such.</p>
               <p>3 Reason. Because such are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for Christ to deal with, such are
prepared to welcom the Gospel:
Christ preacht to the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,
but they thought themselves
to be whole and needed not a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
and therefore despised his help:
but when he preached to the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
and Sinners, they followed him;
He preached to that <hi>Mary</hi> noted as a
sinner, and she followed him weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Luke 7. ver. 37. All the Publicans
and Sinners drew nigh to hear.</hi> Luk. 15.
<hi>ver.</hi> 1. Whereupon the Pharises mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which gave an occasion to
those Parables in that chapter, of the
lost Sheep, the lost Groat, and the lost
Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59581:33"/>Christ is sent to save those that see
their lost condition without him, and
such only will bid welcom to the
Gospel.</p>
               <p>4 Reason why Christ hath such an
eye to afflicted consciences, is, Because
Satan is so buisy with them, he seeks
to drive them to final despair of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and to suggest thoughts of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther:
Therefore as the Devil
hath an evil eye towards them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them, Christ hath an eye of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and compassion towards them, to
deliver them, and to preach Salvation
to them, if Satan desire to winnow
<hi>Peter,</hi> Christ will take the greater
care of him; if Satan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>empt <hi>Peter</hi> to
denie his Master, Christ will look
back upon him to reclaim him again:
Now this is a pattern for Christ's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to imitate; have an especial
eye to the sin sick Souls, the broken
hearted. In the close of the former
Sermon I hinted that some Advice
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59581:34"/>
was needful unto Ministers how to
deal with afflicted consciences, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it unto this place, where I
might present them with such a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
pattern to follow. Afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
during the time of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they are like blind men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deal with them as such, lay no
stumbling blocks before them, make
your Doctrine plain and obvious, be
you instead of eyes unto them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the office of a good guide, and
lead them to Christ, and to the Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, and to the Promises;
they are broken and bruised already,
therefore deal gently with them,
handle their Souls with smooth, and
not with rugged hands.</p>
               <p>We say a Chirurgeon needs an
Eagles eye, a Lyons heart, and a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
hand: so we may say of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
he needs an Eagles eye, to be
of a piercing sight in the Mysteries of
the Gospel; He needs a Lyons heart,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59581:34"/>
having to do with wounded and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous
Souls; He needs a Ladies hand,
having to do with broken hearted sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Afflicted consciences are thirsty,
and ready to faint; therefore lead
them to the Rock Jesus Christ,
from whose side (being struck by the
rod of God,) do only flow those wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that can allay the scorching heat
of an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>flamed Conscience, and can
refresh and revive the drooping Soul
that boweth under his burthen of
temptations; hence do issue those wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that can cleanse the Conscience,
and wash away the guilt of sin, which
makes it so disquiet and tormenting:
after <hi>David</hi> had sinned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi>'s rod struck the Rock, that
water might gush out to the thirsty <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites:</hi>
God's rod struck the Rock
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59581:35"/>
Jesus Christ, that Mercy might flow
out more freely to the thirsty sinner;
If they be thirsty, lead them to Christ
<hi>the Fountain of living waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A wounded Spirit is shot with a
poysoned arrow, (I mean the sting of
sin) be you therefore that loving friend
that may draw out the venome with
your mouths; (I mean, by your godly
council and seasonable advice.)</p>
               <p>Do not tell afflicted Consciences of
a God only, but of a God reconciled
in Christ: put them into the clift of
this Rock Jesus Christ, when you
shew them any thing of the Glory of
God.</p>
               <p>They are bruised, therefore speak
not all Law unto them, but mingle
Gospel with it, least you break those
whom God hath bruised.</p>
               <p>Shew them the cleansing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting

               <p>While they cry out of their own
sinfulness, set before them Christ's
perfect Righteousness, and that He
freely offers to cloath them with it;
shew them not only Christs ability to
save, but Christs willingness to save;
for that is sound advice given by a late
writer; <hi>That Soul which is disquieted
for sin, must be pacifyed by something
that is not sin: He that is sensible of his

a perfect righteousness somewhere else,

Press the Lord with His own words,
to exalt His great name by cleansing
and pardoning thy sins; and the
more and the greater they are, the
more will His Mercy be glorifyed:
Seeing God designeth to be glorifyed
in the great Attribute of his Mercy,
we cannot glorifie it more, than by
throwing our selves upon it.</p>
               <p>If Satan aggravate our Sins, (as
he never fails to do it to the purpose,
when he finds a sinner despairing,)
then we must set all the true colours
upon Mercy, great Mercy, glorious
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59581:37"/>
Mercy, rich Mercy, abundant Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that which is beyond all that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
can say of our sins (Infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
Shew them therefore, that by
casting our Souls upon Gods free
Mercy, we do exceedingly glorifie
the Mercy of our God, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of our Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Do not rob God of the glory of
his Mercy by your unbelief.</p>
               <p>But if the broken hearted sinner
yet object against it self; Alas my sins
are no ordinary sins, then do you put
them in mind, that Christ is no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
person, His blood is no ordinary
price, His Redemption no ordinary
work, and Gods Mercy in Christ is
no ordinary matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> did not despair of Pardon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he saw himself to be chief of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
1 <hi>Tim. 1 ch. ver.</hi> 15. but gloried
so much the more in Christs coming
to save such as he was: A Soul that
is once enabled to look upon Christ as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59581:37"/>
his Saviour, will not despair though
Conscience tell him he is a great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but can be as willing to accuse

not despair of pardon, but imploy
Satans malice as an argument for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
love to Jesus Christ: Those that
despair of Mercy, should be much
pressed with the great injury done to
Gods Infinite Mercy, and to Christs
Infinite Merit by such as despair of
Pardon; for it is as much as to make
God an unmerciful God, and Christ
to be an Impotent Saviour: and it is
a most dangerous sin in respect of us,

               <p>Satan holdeth many under despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoughts a long time, by telling
them that they have not been broken
enough yet by the terrors of the Law,
and therefore are unfit for pardoning
mercy yet.</p>
               <p>Pray is not this a strange reasoning,
as if you should say to a sick man,
you seek to be cured too soon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your

               <p>If Faith be the condition of the

of Reverend Dr. <hi>Sibbs:</hi> Judas <hi>did far

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59581:39"/>The Pharisees upbraided Christ,
that he was a friend to Publicans and
Sinners, <hi>Matt. 11. ver.</hi> 19. to teach
thee that he is no enemy to the vilest
sinner that cometh to Him for mercy.
Afflicted consciences are weak sighted;
or like the Disciples, <hi>their eyes are held,
Luk. 24. ver. 16. Christ is near them,
but they see him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore let all Ministers, and
also all good Christians endeavour to
help that defect, by leading them unto
Christ, and opening the Promises of
the Gospel unto them; end since they
feel the sting of the fiery Serpent in
their Souls, shew them their Saviour,
who is the truth of the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
help them to lean upon Christ
that tryed Stone, so called <hi>Isa. 28. ver.</hi>

whom neither the weight of the sins
of the whole world, nor the maliee
of all the Devils in Hell, nor the rage
of his persecutors on Earth, nor the

weight of Gods wrath due for the sins
of mankind, (which was much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than all the former) could once
make to yield at all, or to fly out of
its proper place; and therefore Christ
is only fit to be the chief corner stone.
He is the only immovable Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
able to bear up the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

builds his Soul upon this Foundation,

<pb facs="tcp:59581:42"/>
abhor a dissolution, yet it covets
happiness; so that Reason it
self may well assent to the desire
of being dissolved; when Faith
hath rightly informed it that it
is far better; for it is wisdom to
admit a change, when we are
sure it shall be for our greater
advantage.</p>
               <p>Sir, if you thus look on Death
(though as a dark entry) yet as
the ready passage to our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Mansions, then I shall
need to say no more, either to
quiet your Spirit concerning the
Death of your dear Wife, at
whose Funeral this Sermon was
Preached, or to make you more
<pb facs="tcp:59581:43"/>
willing to entertain more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
thoughts of your own disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
If it be far better to be
with Christ, than to linger still
on Earth, then what remains?
but that we patiently bear the
departure of our dearest Friends
and nearest Relations, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
expect our own; that we
may be so far from fearing death,
as rather to welcom it: who
baulks a friends Invitation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he imployes a Blackamore
to be the Messenger? What
though Christ send his <hi>Negro</hi>
(Death?) seeing it is to invite
us to a Feast with him in his
Kingdom; We know Christ is
<pb facs="tcp:59581:43"/>
our best Friend, and though at
first we may startle at the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,
yet the very Message
shews that Death be-friends us
too; If God make this Sermon
useful to be your remembrancer
in these great duties, let him
have all the Praise while you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the profit.</p>
               <signed>Your affectionate Brother

There are Mansions, not Tabernacles,
to denote the unchangeableness of the
condition of Saints in Heaven; here on
Earth you can have but moveable
Tents, but in Heaven you shall have
a settled condition, a Mansion-house,
even in our English phrase, signifies
that House where we live most of our
time: Great Men may have several
Houses, and yet but one of them is
called their Mansion-house; that is
to say, the place of their most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
abode, where they dwell the
most part of the year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is but a short
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59581:47"/>
time that we spend on Earth, but we
shall dwell for ever in Heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Christians are here spoken of,
as being Great Persons (being made
Honourable by Christ) who, though
they may have Earthly Tabernacles,
yet have but one Mansion-house, and
that is Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many Mansions;</hi> There is not only
room for Me, but for all my Members
also.</p>
               <p>Though there may be so many
thousands of glorious Inhabitants in
Heaven already, yet there is still room
for every Saint too.</p>
               <p>In Scripture God is represented to
us, as a great Housholder, and the
Saints are called Gods Houshold or
Family; Every wise man provides a
House according to the largeness of
his Family: <hi>Aretius</hi> says, that the
word Mansions, is a word of diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where little is spoken of the
greatest matter; as if we would call
the vast Ocean, a great Pond.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:59581:47"/>We must not imagine that Heaven
is divided as the Earth is (into several
Habitations) but Heaven is fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Mansion, because there is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

Men live in their flitting-houses, as I
may call them, where they stay but a

Saint in Heaven shall have a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Glory and happiness.</p>
               <p>2. In Heaven there is a permanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and therefore called a Mansion;
for the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
word <hi>Mansiones,</hi> and the English
word <hi>Mansions,</hi> do all imply the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Glory and happiness in
Heaven.</p>
               <p>3. Heaven is called a Mansion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
in respect of the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Glory in Heaven. In a Kings
Court there are several Offices, but all
are contented, for all are Courtiers;
In Heaven, the House is the same, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59581:48"/>
the happiness is the same; but there
are different degrees of Glory: But
the Saints in Heaven shall be as free
from envy, as the Stars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are: one Star differs from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Glory, yet they do not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
about their different degrees of
Light and Lustre; no more shall the
Saints in Gods House: <hi>If it were not
so I would not have told you;</hi> I would
not delude you, or feed you with vain
hopes, promising that which I cannot
perform: When you come to Heaven
you shall find much more than what
you are able now to understand of the
happiness you shall inherit there. <hi>I go
to prepare a place for you;</hi> The great
end of Christs ascending into Heaven,
is to prepare a place for his Elect, to
make way for their coming thither:
take notice of our Saviours Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
He doth not say, <hi>Let not your
hearts be troubled, for ere long I will
make you earthly Princes, and make you

he gives them comfort of another kind,
I am preparing Glory for you, <hi>Let not
your hearts be troubled.</hi> When by my
Death and Resurrection I have fitted
all things for your entertainment, I
will come again, and receive you unto
my self.</p>
               <p>It was the manner of Bride-grooms,
when they had made all things ready,
to come themselves, and fetch home
their Brides to their Fathers houses:
<hi>I go to prepare,</hi> and I will come again
and fetch you unto my self. O the
wonderful tenderness and infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention
of Divine Love; Christ
will do all himself. He came once
from Heaven already to make himse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

known unto us; but his love engageth
him to make one journey more to fetch
us, and take us up unto himself: then
he came to prepare us for Heaven; He
is now gone to prepare Heaven for us:
<hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> These
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59581:49"/>
may allude to Travailers, (as <hi>Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>

Our Saviour attempereth his Speech

out in these humane colours, because
we are much taken with these things
and partly because the Disciples did
yet dream that Christ would establish
a worldly Kingdom, and would have
ruled some time as an Earthly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch;
Christ therefore in a sweet and
friendly manner works them off from
expecting any such thing here, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

shall have honour and happiness, but

to prepare a place for all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
though by our sins we both sold
him and crucified him, <hi>Hebr. 6. v.</hi> 20:
Christ is called the Saints fore-runner,
implying that the Saints shall follow
him into heaven.</p>
               <p>Before Christ ascended, he said,
<hi>Father, I will that they also whom thou
hast given me be with me where I am,
Iohn 17. ver.</hi> 24. Therefore he is gone
before to prepare a place for them:
Heaven is prepared already, but our
Sins had shut it against us; Christ is
gone to provide admission for us.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine I shall offer, is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Christians must look on Heaven
as their dwelling place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reasons of the Doctrine are,</p>
               <p>1. Because God designeth heaven
as our Dwelling-place: A Christian
hath a Body and a Soul, an earthly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59581:50"/>
and an heavenly part: A Body form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Earth, and a Soul infused
from heaven; This Earth was made
for the delight of the Body, here is
beauty to delight the Eye, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the Taste, and variety to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
the outward Sences: But Heaven
was made for the Soul; In the Body
we resemble the Beasts on Earth, in
the Soul we resemble the Angels in
heaven; The Body is contented with
the things of the Earth, and thinks it
good to be here; but the Soul finds
nothing able to satisfy it here on earth
And therefore is always mounting up
to heaven by contemplation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to be dissolved from its earthly
clay. God made Man looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
towards heaven, and the Beasts
bowing downward towards the earth
to shew us that the Earth is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place for brute Beasts; but heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
is the place whither Man should
aspire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:59581:50"/>2 Reason why Christians should
look on heaven as their Dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
lyeth in the Text; Because
Christ prepares it for them: and where
can he better provide a place than in
his and our Fathers house? <hi>I asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to
my Father and your Father,</hi> Joh. 20.
ver. 17. My Father by Nature, your
Father by Grace, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
it; Where can he better prepare
a place for his Elect than in his own
Kingdom? It's the Kingdom of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.
chap. 1. ver.</hi> 11. Where can Christ
better prepare a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace for them, than
in that Kingdom which God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath freely bestowed on them?
<hi>Luke 12. ver. 32. Fear not little Flock,
for it is your Fathers good pleasure to
give you a Kingdom; fear not want or
trouble here, but look on your selves as
Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Where
can he prepare a place better than in
that Kingdom which Christ also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59581:51"/>
for them? <hi>Luk. 22. ver.</hi> 29,
30. <hi>And I appoint unto you a Kingdom,
that ye may eat and drink at my Table,
and sit on Thrones <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>udgeing the twelve
Tribes of</hi> Israel; And therefore you
may be sure that this is meant of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
For here on Earth Saints do not
sit on Thrones, but rather on Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils,
as <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> did; they do
not Judge here, but rather are judged
and hardly censured.</p>
               <p>3 Reason why Christians must look
on Heaven as their Dwelling-place,
is, because the word of God directs us
so to do; <hi>To s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t our affection on things
above, and to seek those things:</hi> to look
on the world but as our Inne; but on
Heaven as our home.</p>
               <p>4 Reason. Because experience doth
shew, that on Earth Christians have
no certain Dwelling-place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
<hi>ver.</hi> 11. here we travail and meet with
troubles; here we sojourne, here we
suffer, here we have no continuing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59581:51"/>
City, but we seek one to come, <hi>Heb.
13. ver.</hi> 14. Indeed neither Believer,
nor Unbeliever have any settled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
on Earth; But it is more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
appropriated to Believers.</p>
               <p>1. Because of the Worlds ill deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them; they are always dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them from Post to Pillar, as we
say, from place to place; <hi>Moses was</hi>
much longer a stranger in <hi>Madian,</hi> then
a Courtier in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Because Believers do look upon
Earth as an uncertain place, where
they cannot set up their rest; they
look on the world as a Camp, where
they wall meet with opposition, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then as a City where they should
expect safety and quiet. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
expects his resting place to be in
that City which <hi>Abraham</hi> looked for,
<hi>Hebr. 11. v. 10. A City that hath Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
whose Builder &amp; Maker is God.</hi>
All the Cities on Earth are so easily
removed, as if they had no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59581:52"/>
Heaven only is an immoveable
City.</p>
               <p>Last Reason why Christians must
look upon Heaven as their dwelling
place, is, to move them to a Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Conversation; such as our hopes
is, such will our Conversation be; if
your hope be only in this life, then
your trade and dealing, your thoughts
and actions shall be to get worldly
things, your Conversation will be
earthly; the prevailing degree of love
in all you do, will be for earthly
things; or as the Scripture doth phrase
it, <hi>you will mind earthly things, Philip.
3. ver.</hi> 19. All our aims, actions, and
endeavours will be but to get Money,
to buy Land, to build Houses, to settle
your rest on Earth; your discourses
will be about dividing the Inheritance
like theirs, <hi>Luk. 12. ver.</hi> 13. or about
making more room for your worldly
store like the fool in the Gospel: but
if your hope be in Heaven, <hi>your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59581:52"/>
will be Heavenly.</hi> Hope is a
deep dye that casts a tincture, and
leaves its colour in the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of a Christian.</p>
               <p>He that looks on the world as his
Pilgrimage, or place of Travel, will
provide only as for a Traveller; But
he that looks on the Earth as his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
place, will be providing as for
an Inhabitant: one Room will suffice
a Traveller; but an Inhabitant want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a whole house; a few things will
suffice a man in his Journey, but an
Inhabitant needs a great deal of Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture;
and therefore the Scripture
alwayes puts a difference between a
man in the World, and a man of the
world. <hi>Iohn 15. ver.</hi> 19..</p>
               <p>By our feet we walk on earth, but
by our heart we dwell in heaven.</p>
               <p>Application.</p>
               <p>1. For Information. To teach us
what thoughts we must have of earth
and heaven: We must look on the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59581:53"/>
earth as <hi>David</hi> did, to be but the house
of his Pilgrimage, <hi>Psalm 119. ver.</hi> 54.
But we must look on heaven as our
Mansion-house, as the Text doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
it, <hi>a place prepared for us to
dwell in for ever:</hi> And what a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
place must heaven needs be, which
the Bridegroom of our Souls hath
now been 16 hundred years preparing
for his Bride? We must look upon
heaven as our home, our Fathers
house.</p>
               <p>If you ask what ground a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
hath for this confidence? I answer,
the Text telleth us, <hi>Christ is gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prepare a place for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ entred into heaven as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
person in the name of his Elect,
and so is gone to take possession in
their right, as a Guardian takes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of a house and Land in the
right of his Ward; but Christ entred
in his own right and ours both, as he
is our Guardian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59581:53"/>The high-Priest under the Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the holy of holies, with the
names of the twelve Tribes on his
Brest-plate, to shew that he acted
there for them whose names were
there written; Christ our great high
Priest is entred into heaven, whereof
the holy of holies was but a Type:
thither hath he carryed the names of
his Elect, for whom he is to provide
Mansions; and therefore Christians
are said to have an <hi>Inheritancereserved
in Heaven for them. 1 Pet. chap. 1. ver.</hi>
4. how should this make us high in
our hopes, and lowly in our hearts?
heaven is ours in Reversion; Great
hopes, or hopes of great things beget
great Spirits, and keep Men from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any base or sordid things, which
are below what they hope for: a
Christians hope keeps up his heart,
and hinders him from doing any thing
unbeseeming his hope: The Eagle
scorns to catch at Flies; A Christias
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59581:54"/>
is that true Eagle, that soareth above
these petty things below; the hope of
Heavenly Mansions should should lift
us above the Earth. 2. It should make
us lowly in our hearts, not to strive
and fight for places here, but to be
contented with any place, remembring
that while we are in this world we are
out of our proper place; Those that
are neglectful to look after Heavenly
Mansions, are most quarrelling for
places on Earth; a christian may call
all the things of this world <hi>Esek,</hi> and
<hi>Sitnah,</hi> as <hi>Isaack</hi> named those 2 Wells,
about which the <hi>Philistines</hi> strove with
him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 20, 21. If God give House
or Land to a christian, it doth but
make the Men of the world strive with
him and hate him for it, as the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi>
did envy <hi>Isaack</hi>'s Flocks &amp; Herds,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 14. But a Christian may call
Heaven <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> by the name of <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi>'s
Well which they strove not for.
Now God hath made room for me,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59581:54"/>
says <hi>Isaack;</hi> a christian hath one place
which ugodly men will not strive for;
namely Heaven: what an Argument
therefore is this, to remove our desires
from earthly Houses, and to fix them
on our Heavenly Mansions? in Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Houses we are always either want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
room, or furniture, or food, or
peace in eating it, or assurance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing,
but our Heavenly Mansions
have all these properties.</p>
               <p>Heaven is a good place, for it is of
Christ's own preparing; Heaven is a
large place, there is many Mansions,
room enough, and provision enough
of all things to make a Saint happy.
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant asked <hi>Rebeckah, (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
there room in thy Fathers house for us to
lodge in?</hi> She answered, <hi>we have both
Straw and Provinder enough, and room
to lodge in, Gen. 24 ver.</hi> 23—25. A
Christian need not make such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
concerning Heaven, there is
room enough, and provision enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59581:55"/>God prepared the world for <hi>Adams</hi>
use, before he sent him to be there;
God built the House, and ready fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
it, and then raised up Man. God
our Redeemer is gone to prepare Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
before he carry his Members thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Heaven is also a safe place; where
God dwelleth there can be no fear of
enemies to molest us. <hi>Israel</hi> in the
earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> had plenty, but not
safety; the <hi>Cananites</hi> continually were
invading them; Heaven only is the
place of Peace. The Heavenly <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
is described to have a great wall,
and high, and 12 Gates, and 12 An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
watching at the Gates, and the
City to be built upon a great and high
Mountain. <hi>Revel. 20. ver.</hi> 10—12.
Namely, all things that may import
safety.</p>
               <p>Heaven is too high for danger to
climb up to it; it is so immured that
there can be no scaling it, the Gates
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59581:55"/>
are so strong, that there is no break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them open, and the Watchers so
watchful that there can be no fear of
surprize.</p>
               <p>And in Heaven also is suitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
there we shall dwell with God,
the Holy Trinity, with Holy Angels,
aud Saints; here on Earth unsuitable
company may make us weary of our
Habitations. <hi>Lot</hi> chose the Plain of
<hi>Sodom</hi> to dwell in, but what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
place did it prove to that
righteous man, by reason of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
company of those beastly <hi>Sodomites?</hi>
no doubt had he known their evil
manners before, nothing could have
tempted him to have thought of dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
there.</p>
               <p>Christians that know and see this
Earth to be a <hi>Sodom,</hi> must not choose
it for their dwelling place.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Heaven is a place that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for ever; Worldly Cities
have no firm Foundations, but the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59581:56"/>
Wall of Heaven is described to have
twelve Foundations, <hi>Rev. 21. ver.</hi> 14.
Earthly Houses may be burned, or
beat down either by accident or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
as we see a woful instance in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
that City most famed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world; but you know that the
World it self is reserved for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conflagration: will you make
that your Dwelling-place, which you
know must be destroyed?</p>
               <p>We linger like <hi>Lot,</hi> and are loath
to come out of this <hi>Sodow;</hi> but the
Lord is merciful by sending us many
crosses, pulleth us hence.</p>
               <p>This sheweth us further how we
come to neglect Heavenly Mansions;
We over-value Earthly Tabernacles,
and that makes us undervalue heavenly
Mansions, Earthly Houses are visible,
their Gardens, and Orchards, Parks,
and Forrests, Fish-ponds, and Motes,
Arbors, and Banquetting-houses; but
Heavenly Mansions, and what Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59581:56"/>
is made there, is only known to
Faith, 1. <hi>Cor. chap. 2. ver.</hi> 9. as it is
written, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard,
neither have entred the heart of Man the
things which God hath prepared for them
that love him;</hi> which if it be true of
those things prepared in the Gospel,
it is more true of those things prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Heaven.</p>
               <p>This consideration of Heavenly
Mansions may much quiet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

seemed so earnest to get to Heaven, as
is set out by his postures of running

yet his great earthly Possessions hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him from being prevailed with
by the promise of Heavenly treasure

<hi>Gen. 33. v.</hi> 14. though I grant
his fear of <hi>Esau</hi> might be a great cause
also.</p>
               <p>Those Christians are in most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of neglecting Heavenly Mansions,
that are well seated in Earthly places,
<hi>haec sunt quae faciunt invitos mori,</hi> these
things make us unwilling to die. Let
us use the Earth as the Birds do, the
Air is their proper place, and they care
not to descend on the Earth but only
for their times of Feeding; so long as
they keep aloft they are secure; but
when they come to settle on the
Ground, there are Nets or Guns, or
some Snare to endanger them: So long
as Christians keep their thoughts on
Heaven, and the thing above, they are

or other to catch them, though your
daily Bread grows on Earth, yet look
on Heaven as your home, and send
your thoughts &amp; desires thither again,
that it may appear though you Table
here, you expect to dwell in Heaven.
A few words more, and then I shall
conclude.</p>
               <p>1. Be content though God allo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

this world, seeing Christ is preparing
a place for you in a better world.</p>
               <p>2. Get your affections more wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from earthly Houses (you that have
them) and fix your thoughts more on
those Heavenly Mansions; Because
Children know no better things, they
are so much in love with every paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gew-gaw; It is our ignorance of
the Joys in Heaven that makes us so
greatly pleased with these toyes on
Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59581:58"/>3. Be not immoderate in grieving
for any Relations or Friends departed,
(no, though you have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So long as we are in the Body, we
are absent from the Lord; the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> groaned earnestly in desires of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying

chap. 5. ver.</hi> 2. and he gives us his
Reason in the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> Who would
not go out of a thatcht Cottage to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit

Lord, do but leave an Earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,

and will you think it too s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them, caused them to die

number Death among their priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and bid it welcom; If I could
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59581:59"/>
offer your Wife or Children, House,
or Land, would you say, (<hi>no I thank
you, I cannot spare them yet, they shall
tarry with me one year longer before they
go to possess it.</hi>) We are wiser in earthly
matters, why are we such fools in
Heavenly matters? if we did cordially
believe, and seriously meditate on the
blessedness in Heaven, we should

               <p>1. Let us hear his own Confession
how great a sinner he was, <hi>chief of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
not only <hi>sensu humilitatu,</hi> so in
his own apprehension; nor only <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandorum
primus,</hi> chief sinner of those
that shall be saved; but as he was a
proud Pharisee that went about to set
up his own righteousness in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to Christs rightouiness:
Surely, (except the unpardonable sin)
there cannot be a greater sin than this;
and in this sense Christs words may be
understood, that Publicans and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
were nearer Heaven, than the
self-justifying Pharisees, <hi>Mat. 21. ver.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:59581:63"/>The Apostle confesseth how exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

yield to cast away the thoughts of his
own righteousness, and to relie upon
the righteousness of Christ imputed;
and this made him persecute unto the
death all such as professed a contrary
way of being justified; and herein he
was a greater sinner, than if he had
been a Thief, or Drunkard, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this is the highest Trespass against the
great Command of the Gospel; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that we should embrace Christ as
he is called, <hi>the Lord our righteousness,
Ier. 23. ver.</hi> 6. There is more hopes

Christ can have no greater enemies,

               <p>For a Physician perfectly to cure
one that is stark mad, and bring him
to his right mind, this shews great
skill indeed: this God hath done;
<hi>Paul</hi> was exceeding mad, persecuting
all wheresoever he met them, that
professed to be justifyed by Faith in
Christs Righteousness; and yet the
Grace of God hath perfectly cured
him, and now makes him to seek to
Christ for Righteousness, and count
his own Righteousness but dung, and
to preach the same way of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to others. If a Chyrurgeon go
into an Hospital, and pick out those
that are most desperately sick &amp; lame,
and cure them, is it not the greater
argument of his skill? so here in <hi>Paul</hi>'s

               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59581:65"/>3. Consider how graciously God
dealt with him after Conversion, in
imploying him as a Prime Officer in
the Church of Christ; yea, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-builder,
and as a chief Pillar of
that Church which he sought before
to pull down. God sent him as an
honorable Embassador to bear Christs
name before Kings, and the Children
of <hi>Israel,</hi> whose great ambition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was to be the Saints common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner:
Christ intended that <hi>Paul</hi>
should suffer much for his name, who
came to <hi>Damascus</hi> to make all them suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that professed Christs name.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable, that of all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,

with him, that he that was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
enemy to Christ before his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
is now used as the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared
friend of Christ after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and hath the most glorious
discoveries of Christ, and of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59581:66"/>
of his Gospel of all others, and
now his name may be called Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
indeed; for here is a Scene on
which before Conversion, corrupt
Nature acted her outragious Fury;
and after conversion, sanctifying Grace
sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such an extent, as few Stories can
parallel. In <hi>Saul</hi> was seen as much
as can well be in a Man void of Grace;
and in <hi>Paul</hi> was discovered as much as
need be looked for in the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Saint; his former madness is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled
by his present zeal, and now
all that <hi>Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had raked together, intending onely
thereby to defend the righteousness of
the Law, and the Traditions of the
Elders, and to dispute against Christ
and his Gospel; God imploys it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to make him more able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the <hi>Iews,</hi> and to prove that
Jesus is the very Christ, <hi>Acts 9. ver.
22.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:59581:66"/>None preach Christ crucifyed so
plainly, and the Doctrine of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by Christs impured Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
so powerfully, and so thorowly
as <hi>Paul</hi> does; none beat so much on
this string, as he, <hi>Romans 3 ver. 27.
Galat. 2. ver. 16.</hi> and in <hi>Galat. 3. ver.
10.</hi> None cry down the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Law so vehemently, nor
cry up the imputed Righteousness of
Christ so earnestly as <hi>Paul</hi> does: thus
as he was behind no man in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
before his conversion; so was he
not infer, or to the very chief Apostles
after conversion, but laboured more
abundantly than they all, <hi>I Cor. chap.
15. ver. 10.</hi> Now he would preach
nothing but Christ crucifyed, <hi>1 Cor.
chap. 2. ver.</hi> and would glory in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but in the Cross of our Lord
Jesus, <hi>Gal. 6. ver. 14.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> was
even a miracle of Mercy, and a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pattern of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:59581:67"/>The next particular is, why <hi>Paul</hi>
was hung out as a pattern of Free
grace?</p>
               <p>1. Because he had been such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
persecuter; and therefore as
the noise of his mad and ignorant zeal
had filled the world before, so now
the news of his conversion would be
the more wonderful, and he would be
the more fit to be a pattern, because
the Example of so great a Sinner,
would be more encouragement for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinners to seek for Mercy, <hi>Galat.
1. ver. 23, 24.</hi> When the Churches
heard that <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Faith
which he once destroyed, they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
God in him. When sinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that <hi>Paul</hi> was pardoned, they
may glorify Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Mercy by seeking
Pardon too.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi> was made a Pattern of Free
Grace, because he was an eminent
Iew, and by Sect, a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> and so
might prove a leading Pattern to all
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59581:67"/>
the <hi>Iews,</hi> and to that obstinat Sect of

                  </gap>o follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in renouncing the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Works, and embracing the
Righteousness of Faith: <hi>Paul</hi> was well
read in all their Jewish Traditions,
and was as zealous of them as they,
and therefore they might see more of
the power of Grace in his conversion,
that now made him h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zard his own
life to advance that way, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he persecuted unto Death.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Paul</hi> was chose to be a Pattern,
because in such a Pattern the freeness
of Grace would appear more clearly,
here all the world may see, that we
are not saved out of any Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen;
here was nothing to fit him to
receive Grace (unless making havock
of the Church be a preparatory work)
Such Works the <hi>Romish</hi> Saints are full
of; here was a raging Persecutor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and pardoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:59581:68"/>It is not our Faith apprehending
Christ that saves us, but our Christ
apprehended by Faith; Christ is the
meriting cause, and Faith is the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Paul</hi> was set as a Pattern of
Free Grace, to encourage other sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
beholding the Mercy of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him to look after Mercy too, that
as in a Glass or Mirrour, all men may
see more clearly the freeness of Grace,
it is a good means to prevent our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
when we see such an instance of
pardoning Mercy before our eyes; and
this leadeth me to the last particular:
What encouragement may other sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
draw from this great pattern of
<hi>Paul</hi>'s obtaining Pardon. My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not, that others should expect
to be miraculously converted, as <hi>Paul</hi>
was; (for you may as well expect to
be caught up into the third Heaven:)
But by <hi>Paul</hi>'s being pardoned, you
may look after a Pardon: <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59581:68"/>
and was obedient to the voice
from Heaven, and so obtained Mercy.
This voice from Heaven was the voice
of Christ, <hi>why p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>?</hi> and
<hi>Acts 9. ver. 5. I am Iesus whom thou
persecutest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gospel now is Christs voice
from Heaven, he that believeth this
voice, and is obedie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and he that will not obey Christs

                  </gap>ver be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
It is remarkable, that Christ
did not tell <hi>Paul</hi> by the voice from
Heaven, what he should do, but
sent him to be taught by <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
who was a Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<hi>Acts 9. ver. 6.</hi> So now he doth
not miraculously tell sinners what they
must do to be saved, but sends them
to his Word and Ministers to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed;
and therefore pray compare
those two places together, <hi>Hebr. 4 ver.
7. To day if you will hear his voice:</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59581:69"/>
what is that voice of Christ? <hi>Luk. 10.

               <p>Though indeed begging is now
grown such a common Trade, that
you may be soon wearied out with
Beggers; such is mans emptiness, that
he cannot be always giving; but such
is Gods fulness, that he delights to
be dealing of his dole of Mercy; the
oftner you come to the door of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the better you shall speed, and
therefore this is an encouraging Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern:
And consider beloved, how
great is Gods goodness in giving us
such Patterns to invite us to the throne
of Grace?</p>
               <p>To see <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> two
Publicans pardoned, may encourage
all Publicans to look after Pardon too;
to see <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59581:70"/>
went seven Devils; and the Woman
taken in the very act of Adultery, both
pardoned, may encourage all sinners
to seek pardon; to hear <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>I was
a Blasphemer, and a Persecutor, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious,
but I obtained Mercy,</hi> may great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encourage all sinners to follow God
by Prayer for to shew them Mercy;
it is a very great mercy that we have
not only Promises of Pardon, but also
Patterns of notorious sinners that have
been pardoned.</p>
               <p>1. Because such Patterns suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
declare the infinite merit of
Christs death: who could be fitter
Trumpets of Christs Power and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
then those blind, and lame, and
leprous, and the Woman cured of
her bloody Issue, and that other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
bowed together; all which Christ
cured in the days of his Flesh?</p>
               <p>When the Jews spake against Christ,
the man whom he had restor'd to sight
pleaded hard for him, <hi>Iohn 9. ver. 30.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59581:70"/>
33. If this man were not of God he could
do nothing:</hi> The Jews knew not what
to object, but proudly asked him, <hi>Dost
thou undertake to teach us, ver. 34.?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What can any poor sinner object
against the Power &amp; Mercy of Christ,
when they see ten Lepers cleansed at
once? but may be enforced to cry
out with that Leper, <hi>Matt. 8. ver. 2.
Lord if thou wilt thou canst make me
clean:</hi> He that cured Ten, can cure
ten Millions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it is not so with
bodily Physicians, their Art is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
but Christ is the infallible Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician.</p>
               <p>To hear that Christ came to save
sinners, may not move us so much as
to see it in the Examples of <hi>Manasseh,</hi>
and the Theef on the Cross, and those
others before-mentioned; such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
instances do abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that the merit of Christs death
is exceedingly beyond the demerit of
our sins; Christs healing all manner
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59581:71"/>
of diseased that were brought unto
him shews that he can heal all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of diseased Souls that come unto
him now.</p>
               <p>2. Such Instances do evince, that
God is ready to deal out Pardons to
all sorts of Sinners, let their Sins be
what they will, that come in Christs
name to ask Pardon: the poor Soul
is apt to say, How shall I know that
God will pardon such a wretched sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as I am? Why you may believe
it in such Patterns as <hi>Paul,</hi> and those
before mentioned.</p>
               <p>3. It is a great Mercy to have such
Patterns of pardoning Mercy; for in
these we may more clearly see what is
the great design of free Grace? namely
to set open the door of Mercy, and
invite all sinners to come freely, and
to give pardons to all that will come
to God in Christs name: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the two greatest
Apostles and Pillars of the Church,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59581:71"/>
are both set as Patterns of Free Grace,
to encourage other sinners to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pardon; <hi>Peter</hi> denyed, yea abjured
his Saviour, and yet was pardoned.
<hi>Paul</hi> persecuted him, and blasphemed
his name, and compelled others to do
so to, and yet was pardoned: Now
as some prophane wretches in <hi>Salvians</hi>
time did presume to sin, because <hi>David,</hi>
and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> sinned, <hi>Si</hi> David,
<hi>cur non &amp; ego; si</hi> Noah, <hi>si</hi> Lot, <hi>cur non
&amp; ego?</hi> Here the poor penitents may
turn their presumption into a blessed
hope, and say with an humble confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>si</hi> Petrus <hi>cur non &amp; ego? si</hi> Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
<hi>cur non &amp; ego? si</hi> David, <hi>si</hi> Noah,
<hi>si</hi> Lot, <hi>cur non &amp; ego?</hi> If all these
were pardoned, why may not I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
God for pardon?</p>
               <p>Gods gracious design in suffering
such Examples to be Registred of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
sinners that were pardoned, is,
that by such presidents of Mercy, all
other sinners might take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59581:72"/>
to seek for Mercy in such mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>mles as these, Satans grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ction is answered to our
hands.</p>
               <p>What doth such a wicked creature
as you hope for pardon? in such pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rcy, as <hi>Manasseh, Peter,
Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and the like. God teacheth us
how to answer the Devil: God hath
pardoned as great sinners as I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
therefore I am sure God can pardon
me, and I believe God will pardon all
that seek to him in Christ for pardon;
and therefore I will ply the Throne of
Grace in Christs name to beg pardon;
In such patterns God doth as it were
make a shew of his Mercy, that we
may see no sins are so great but they
shall be pardoned, if we do not add
Unbelief unto them. Mr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>
hath an excellent note to this purpose
on <hi>Pauls</hi> conversion The most notorious
persecuter that the Gospel had yet
found, is chosen of all others to be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59581:72"/>
the Doctor of the Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>les, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
his own example, or rather the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
example of Gods Mercy in his
conversion, might be a comfortable
Doctrine to those notorious sinners of
the Gentiles, as well as his Preac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is a great Mercy to have
such Patterns of pardoning Mercy,
because such instances are a good
means to keep all sinners from despair;
your case is not desperate if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour
can shew you a President of
the like: If the Physician can shew
you many now living whom he hath
recovered of the same distemper, this
may be a good encouragement for you
to hope for a cure too: This is <hi>Paul</hi>'s
meaning when he calls himself <hi>chief
of sinners,</hi> and says, <hi>that he obtained
Mercy for this cause, that he might be a
pattern to others;</hi> as much as to say,
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n me God shews as from an high Tower,
that all sinners may be pardoned as I was,
if they seek to him in Christs name as I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59581:73"/>
did;</hi> and as <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>they that fear
thee, will be glad when they see
me, Psal. 119. ver. 24.</hi> it may be
turned here, they that see <hi>David</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
and <hi>Paul</hi> pardoned, they may
be glad of such encouraging patterns
to make them hope for pardon too;
the Doctrine of free Grace is the only
Doctrine to invite guilty sinners, if
pardon be offered freely to all that will
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome to God in Christ: Then if I
go to pray to God for pardon in the
name of his Son Jesus Christ, I shall
be pardoned as well as they; and this
consideration moves the poor sinner to
go to the throne of grace to beg pardon.</p>
               <p>God who hath no respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
can have no motive from within,
but his own free love, to pardon a
poor sinner; and the word <hi>Sinner,</hi>
sufficiently declares that there can be
no motive from without; therefore,
the same Free Grace that hath pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
other sinners, will pardon all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59581:73"/>
that seek pardon; Yea, this is a
good sign that God intends to pardon
us, when he makes us with <hi>David</hi>
pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arnestly to be pardoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Application;</hi> is for Exhortation, to
press all sinners to draw that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
from this glorious pattern of
<hi>Paul</hi>'s obtaining Mercy, which God
intends us; <hi>Why do we sit still,</hi> as the
Lepers said one to another, <hi>2 Kings
chap. 7. ver. 3.</hi> Why do not we pray
for pardon?</p>
               <p>There are three things which God
doth most delight to glorify, his name,
his Son, his Covenant, and then we
most glorify these three things when
we look after pardon. As for Gods
Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he tells us p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Gates, <hi>Rev. 21. ver. 12.</hi> intimating

to the Throne of Grace; But there is
a day of Judgement coming, then God
will as much delight to glorifie his
Justice in damning all those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to seek for Pardon in the day of
Grace.</p>
               <p>There are Twelve Steps that lead a
sinner to the hope of Pardon.</p>
               <p>1. To see his absolute need of
Pardon.</p>
               <p>2. To set a possibility of Pardon;
for we can have no hope of that we
judge impossible; he sees it possible
by the glorious Patterns of such as
have been pardoned.</p>
               <p>3. To desire a Pardon.</p>
               <p>4. To admire the freeness of Grace
in all such as have obtained Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59581:75"/>
5. To see that the only way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Mercy, is, to believe in the
Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>6. To see Christs ability to pardon,
and to begin to seek after him.</p>
               <p>7. To read and eye the promises
of Pardon.</p>
               <p>8. To believe the truth of those
Promises.</p>
               <p>9. To desire to have an Interest in
those Promises.</p>
               <p>10. To venture our Souls on the
free offer of Pardon.</p>
               <p>11. To follow God by Prayer in
the name of Christ to pardon us.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Now the sinner arriveth at
the Cape of good Hope, and a good
Hope is the beginning of assurance.</p>
               <p>When the poor sinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Christ, then it begins to hope
for Pardon.</p>
               <p>No matter what the Disease was,
if the party had but Faith to be healed,
as is said of the Man lame in his
Feet, <hi>Acts 14. ver. 9.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59581:75"/>No matter what our sins are, if we

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave but Faith to believe in Christ for
Pardon. Physicians care not for med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in dangerous cases; but such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
cases bring more glory to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; thus curing him that had

through these natural impossibilities,
made Christs power be more admired
by all that saw his Miracles: even so
this high pattern of <hi>Paul</hi> a Persecuter,
and a Blasphemer, and one of the chief
of sinners; and yet obtaining Mercy,
doth much more advance the riches
