            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The moderne well discouered the vse
and exercise of more affections, then
loue, within the fadome and compasse
of zeale; but in helping that default,
went themselues somewhat wide, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3200:9"/>
came not close to the marke: which I
ascribe not to any defect of eye-sight in
those sharpe sighted Eagles; but onely
to the want of fixed contemplation.
And to speake truth, I haue oft won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
why poore <hi>Zeale,</hi> a vertue so high
in Gods books, could neuer be so much
beholding to mens writings as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a iust treatise, which hath been the
lot of many particular vertues of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
worth; a plaine signe of too much
vnder-value and neglect.</p>
               <p>He that shall stedfastly viewe it, shall
finde it not to be a degree or Intension
of loue, or any single affection (as the
<hi>Schools</hi> rather confined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defined zeal)
neither yet any mixt affection (as the <gap reason="illegible: blurred" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
rather compounded then compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the nature of it) but an <hi>hot tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
higher degree or intension of them all.</hi>
As varnish is no one colour, but that
which giues glosse and lustre to all; So
the opposites of zeale, keye-coldnes and
luke-warmenesse, which by the lawe of
contraries must bee of the same nature,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3200:9"/>
are no affections, but seuerall tempers of
them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> warrants this description where
he speakes of the twelue Tribes.<note place="margin">Act 26. 7</note> 
                  <hi>They
serued God with intension or vehemency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The roote shewes the nature of the
branch. Zeale comes of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a word fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the very sound and hissing noise
which hot coales, or burning iron make
when they meete with their contrary.
In plaine English, zeale is nothing but
heate, from whence it is that zealous
men are oft in Scripture said to burne
in the spirit. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>He that doth moderately or remisly
affect any thing, may be stil'd <hi>Philemon</hi> a
louer: He that ernestly or extreamely,
<hi>Zelotes</hi> a zelot: who to all the obiects of
his affections, is excessiuely and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
disposed, his loue is euer feruent,
his desires eager, his delights rauishing,
his hopes longing, his hatred deadly,
his anger fierce, his griefe deepe, his
feare terrible. The Hebrewes expresse
these Intensions by doubling the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:3200:10"/>
This being the nature of zeale in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
Christian zeale of which wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
onely to speake, differs from carnall
and worldly, chiefly in the causes and
obiects.</p>
               <p>It is a spirituall heate wrought in the
heart of man by the holy Ghost, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing
the good affections of loue,
ioy, hope, &amp;c. for the best seruice and
furtherance of Gods glory, with all the
appurtenances thereof, his worde, his
house, his Saints and saluation of soules:
vsing the contrary of hatred, anger,
griefe, &amp;c. as so many mastiues to fly
vpon the throat of Gods enemies, the
diuell, his Angels, sinne, the world with
the lusts thereof. By the vertue whereof
a <hi>Zealot</hi> may runne through all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,

out of euery pipe, after this manner for

what vnsatiable thirst the couetous

vpon his honour, the voluptuous
vpon his pleasure; the same the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
striueth in equall, yea, (if possible)
farre exceeding tearmes to conuert and
conferre vpon God and his worship.</p>
               <p>In briefe, to open a little creuise of
further light, and to giue a little glimpse
of heat: Zeal is to the soule, that which
the spirits are to the body; wine to the
spirits, putting vigour and agility into
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3200:11"/>
them. Whence comes that elegant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis
in the Scripture. <hi>Be not drunke
with wine wherein is excesse, but bee filled
with the spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ is said to lead his Spouse into
the wine cellar: which Simily <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
delighting oft to repeat,<note place="margin">Ser. 41. in Cant. 49</note> in two or
three Sermons interprets of a speciall
measure of zeale inspired into his
Church. Thus (saith he) Christ led his
Disciples into the wine cellar on the day
of Pentecost; and filled them, and the
house with such zeal as they came forth
like Giants refreshed with wine, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to the people as men drunke with<note place="margin">Act. 2</note>
new wine.</p>
               <p>It is to the soule as wings to the foule:
this also is a Scripture embleme to pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Angels with wings, as in the
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gings of the Temple, &amp; in the visions
of the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in token of their ardent
and zealous execution of Gods will:
whence also they haue their name <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim;</hi>
he maketh his ministers a flame
of fire.<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:3200:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To this fire and these wings, which
we in the Lords praier desire to imitate,
there is nothing in vs answerable but
our zeale; As wheeles to the chariot:
which makes vs not goe, but runne the
waies of Gods commandements, and
so runne that we may obtain. As sailes
to the ship, and wind to the sailes, to
which alludes the phrase so frequent in
Scripture, <hi>Plerophorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As courage to the souldier, metall to
the horse, dust to the ground which
makes it bring forth much fruit, yee an
hundred fold: viuacity to all creatures.
To conclude this, this is that celestiall
fire which was shaddowed out vnto vs
by that poore element in comparison
and beggerly rudiment, the fire (I
meane) of such necessary vse in the law,
which rather then it should be wanting,
the Lord caused it to descend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
that it might cause the Sacrifices
to ascend thither again as a sweet incense
vnto the Lord without which no burnt
offering was acceptable.</p>

               <p>But now, as then, there are certaine

on those that offer the right fire, and
serue the Lord in spirit and truth: yet

               <p>Against these, as then, so now seuere

to put a difference, mistake poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonfull
weedes for wholsome hearbes,
to their owne destruction; and for the
sake of the one, reuile the other to the
wrong of God and his Saints.</p>
               <p>It fares not otherwise with the soule
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the body: besides the natiue &amp;
radicall heat, the principall instrument

               <p>To discerne of those, requires some

Thus, Comets blaze more then fixed
Starres. Aguish heates breed flushings,

hiding of Art the best Art: the godly

in externall humiliation, affected

know how to rend the garment, hang

launce their skinnes with <hi>Baals</hi> Priests;
and yet strangers to a wounded spirit:
not but that true and hearty zeale doth
lift vp the eyes, knock the breast, dance
before the Arke. Therefore this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
may deceiue the vnwary; Let
<hi>Ely</hi> take heed of iudging <hi>Hannaes</hi> spirit
rashly by the moouing of her lips: yet
hypocrites so vsually straine nature and
without a cause exceed, and that in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and vppon the stage, that for the
most part, their actions and affections
are palpable: as <hi>Iesuites, Cappuchines,</hi> &amp;c.
yea in many histrionicall Protestants:
Horse-coursers iades wil bound, curuet

matters ioyned with omission and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

duties, prodigall: niggardly &amp; sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the waighty things of the Lawe:
these haue at command good wordes,
countenance, yea teares from their eyes,

hauing this worlds goods, and see their

for the carcasse, beguiling the simple,

               <p>Fourthly, these fires cannot keepe

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
these spirites cannot keepe themselues
within their owne circles. True zeale
loues to keepe home, studieth to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et

they know how to spare <hi>Agag</hi> and the

their great Masters, and meddle with

of fire that comes from aboue to
spare the yeelding sheath, and melt the
resisting metall, to passe by the lower
roofes, and strike the towred pinacle, as
<hi>Nathan, Dauid, Elias, Ahab, Iohn, Herod,
Ionas, Niniuie, &amp;c.</hi> Note also in all their

These delight in cruelty, the brand

to liue, their very mercies are cruelty:
especially in their owne cause, they heat
the fornace seuen times hotter then in

               <p>Lastly, these Meteors and vapours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
haue no constant light,<note place="margin">Variable and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</note> or continued
heat (as the fixed starres euer like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues)
but haue onely their aguish fits,

they are good vnder the rod as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
again in prosperity like the fat kine
of <hi>Bashan,</hi> ingratefull and forgetfull:
sometimes in prosperity when the sun
of peace shineth on them, &amp; the fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
influence of great ones, they shoot
forth their blade with the corne on the
house top, running with the streame, &amp;
sailing with the wind; sometimes their
zeale depends vpon the life of <hi>Iehoiada;</hi>
sometimes on the company of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
commonly in the beginning they
blaze like straw fires, but in the end goe
out in smoake and smother; whereas in
their entrance into profession, they gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped

into shewes, and made some
girds at hand, they tire, giue in, and end
in the flesh, whereas all naturall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are swiftest toward their end.</p>
               <p>The vestall fires were perpetuall, and
the fire of the Altar neuer went out.
Spices and wefts of these euills may be
found in the sincerest Christians: but
they suffer not these dead flyes to ly and

zeale;<note place="margin">Be not ouer iust hath 7. expositions. here. 2. or 3. more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</note> of all these the preachers caueat

three which are known by their names.
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, turbulent zeale, wild fire.</p>
               <p>The first, wanting truth and sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
propounds sinister ends:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:3200:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The second, knowledge and discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
takes wrong waies.</p>
               <p>The third, loue and humility, exceeds
measure.</p>
               <p>The first abounds amongst subtile &amp;
crafty professors, and is to be abhorred
and detected.</p>
               <p>The second amongst simple and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout,
is to be pitied and directed.</p>
               <p>The third amongst passionate and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate,
and is to be moderated and
corrected.</p>
               <p>The first is the meere vizor of zeale,
looking asquint one way and tending
another; pretending God and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
intending some priuate and sinister
end; first, either of honour and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as <hi>Iehu</hi> who marched furiously,
and his worde was the Lorde of hosts,
but his proiect was the kingdome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, at filthy lucre: as <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and his followers, who cried great is
<hi>Diana</hi> of Ephesus; but meant her little
siluer shrines. It cannot bee denied, but
many such there were who helped to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3200:16"/>
pull downe the Abbies; not out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hatred to those vncleane cages, but
to reare their owne houses out of the
ruines, and spoyled copes to make cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions.
<hi>Iudas</hi> complained of superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but grieued it fell besides his bagge;
many, temporalities tithes and glebes,
vnlawful, because they are loth to forgo
them: If <hi>Iezabel</hi> proclaime a Fast, let
<hi>Naboth</hi> looke to his vineyard; If the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer
and tradesman frequent sermons,
let the buyer and borrower looke to
themselues. It is too common a thing
to make zeale a lure and state, to drawe
customers; a bait of fraud, a net to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap;
with malicious <hi>Doegs,</hi> to make it
a stalking horse for reuenge against
the Priest, thereby to discharge their
gall at Ministers and other Christians,
for the omission and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission of such
things, as them selues care not for; with
the <hi>Strumpet</hi> in the Prouerbs, to wipe
their mouthes, and frequent the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that they may be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suspicion.</p>
               <p>All these euills, haue I seene vnder
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3200:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the sunne-shine of the Gospell: but by
how much, zeale is more glorious then
common profession, by so much is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
feruency more detestable then
vsuall hypocrisie; yea, no better then
diuelish villany &amp; double iniquity: such
painted wals and whited sepulchers,
the Lord will breake downe. Let all
<hi>Timothies</hi> and <hi>Nathanaels</hi> learne to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
them, and discard them: The cure
of this was deeply forelaid by Christ;
<hi>I counsell thee to buy gold tryed in the fire:</hi>
all is not gold that glistereth, an image
of faith breeds but a shew of zeale; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
seemed to trust in Christ, but Christ
would not trust them: but such faith as
will abide the fire, brings forth zeale
that will abide the touchstone.</p>
               <p>The second, is erronious or blinde
zeale, not according to knowledge
Rom. 10. I beare many deuout Papists
witnesse (though I feare the learnedst
of them be selfe condemned) that they
haue this zeale perswading themselues,
they doe God best seruice, when they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3200:17"/>
please the diuell most in their will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
The same witnesse I beare many
<hi>Separatists</hi> (though I feare most of them
be sicke of selfe conceit ednesse, new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenesse,
and desire of mastership:) who
would not suspect such zeale, which
condemnes all reformed Churches, and
refuseth communion with such as they
themselues confesse to bee Christians,
and consequently such as haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Christ. It would grieue
a man indeede, to see zeale misplaced,
like metall in a blind horse; to see men

The cure of this diuinely is forelaid by

Angels haue eyes as well as wings to

               <p>The third kinde, is turbulent zeale,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3200:18"/>
called by <hi>Iames</hi> bitter zeale, a kinde of
wild-fire transporting men beyond all
bounds, and compasse of moderation;
proceeding sometimes of a weakenesse
of nature in men, that haue no stay of
their passion, like to Clockes whose
springs are broken, and Cities whose
walls are down. Zeale is a good seruant,
but an ill master: metall is dangerous in
a head-strong horse. And so the <hi>Poets</hi>
(which were the Heathens Prophets)
shadowed out the cure of this, in <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uas</hi>

diuerse of the malicious world vse to

length; if they see any forwardnesse in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3200:26"/>
the peaceablest spirit, they ascribe it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to vaine glory, or couetousnesse;
the onely springs that set their wheeles
on going: but of this the knower of the
hearts must iudge betweene vs.</p>
               <p>When slaundering will not serue,<note place="margin">4 Obiect. They keep no meane.</note>
then fall they to glauering, cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glancing at zeale, whiles they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the golden meane wherein ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
consists. But Christians, take heed
none spoile you through such Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy;
or rather Sophistry: for true
Philosophy will tell you that the meane
wherein virtue is placed, is the middle
betwixt two kindes, and not degrees:
And it is but meane virtue that loues
the meane in their sense.</p>
               <p>Oh say they,<note place="margin">5 Obiect. Vndiscreet.</note> but some discretion
would doe well; It is true, but take
withall <hi>Caluins</hi> caueat to <hi>Melanchton:</hi>
That he affect not so the name of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
man, and listen to such Syrens
songs, till he lose his zeale.</p>
               <p>I haue obserued, that which the
world miscalls discretion, to eate vppe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3200:27"/>
zeale, as that which they call policy,
doth wisdome. As <hi>Ioab</hi> stabbed <hi>Abner,</hi>
vnder a colour of friendshippe: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
vndermineth Christ, by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to be his vicar. The feare of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
makes most come too short; of
the two extremities, wee should most
feare lukewarmenesse: rather let your
milk boyle ouer then be raw.</p>
               <p>From glauering, they fall to scoffing;
yong Saints, will proue but old Diuels;
these hot-spurs will soone runne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
out of breath. But we say, such
were neuer right bred; such as prooue
falling starres, neuer were ought but
meteors; the other neuer loose light or
motion: spirituall motions may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
and perpetuall.</p>
               <p>When none of these wil take, they fal
to right downe rayling; these Puritans,
these singular fellowes, &amp;c. vnfit for
all honest company. I hope the states
Puritan, and the common Puritan bee
two creatures. For with that staffe the
multitude beates all that are better then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3200:27"/>
selues, and lets fly at all that haue any
shew of goodnes. But with that which
most call Puritanisme, I desire to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God. For singularity, Christ calls
for it, and presseth &amp; vrgeth it; What
singular thing doe you, or what odde
thing doe you? Shall Gods peculiar
people, doe nothing peculiar? The
world thinks it strange, wee runne not
with them into excesses, and do not as
most doe, that we might escape derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.
Iudge you which of these men
shall please: I beleeue none shall euer
please Christ, till they appeare odde,
strange, and precise men, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sort; and yet neede not bee ouer
iust neither. Let them that haue tender
eares, stop them against the charmes of
the world, and scornes of <hi>Michol,</hi> vnles
they were wiser: let him that hath a
right eare, heare what Christ saith to
the Churches, <hi>Be zealous.</hi>

An Art lately so taught, as I shall
neede onely, to point at the choise
theames, suiting and furthering this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
I need not go far to fetch this
fire: I may strike it out of euery word
of this Epistle to <hi>Laodicea.</hi> Behold the
Lord God, especially thy Lord Christ
in his glorious titles, and Maiestie; for
so hee beginnes his visions to <hi>Iohn;</hi>
and his Epistles to the Churches, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
their dull hearts. By such appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions
did hee set on fire the heart of
<hi>Moses</hi> in the burning bush; and enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Stephan,</hi> his first Martyre: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
and proportionable to which,
are our serious contemplations. Behold
him as one that seeth thee, and knoweth
thy works; the rowsing preface of all
these letters. <hi>Caesars</hi> eye made his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
prodigall of their blood. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist
thinks God takes as much notice
of him and his prayers, as he doth of
the humming of flies and bees; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3200:33"/>
therefore, no maruell if his seruice be
formall and fashionable. The faithfull
Christian by faiths prospectiue sees him
at home, and heares him saying, Well
done thou good seruant; which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him to work out his heart. Behold
him as the beginning of creatures, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the newe creature. Oh! what
loue hath hee shewed thee in thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption?
out of what misery, into
what happinesse, by what a price, to
what end; but that thou shouldest be
zealous of good workes? Behold him
as the faithfull witnesse, that witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himselfe for thee a good witnesse,
and here faithfully counsels thee to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his patterne. Behold him as a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and royall rewarder of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Take thy selfe into paradise, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to thy selfe thy crowne, thy throne,
thy white robes; looke not on the
things that are seene, but on the farre
most excellent waight of glory,
look vpon these, and faint if thou canst.
Behold also hee is a consuming fire, a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3200:34"/>
zealous God, hating lukewarmenesse;
not onely destroying <hi>Sodom</hi> with fire
and brimstone, and prouiding <hi>Tophet</hi>
for his enemies; but awaking also his
drowzie seruants, by iudgements (as
<hi>Absolon Ioah</hi> by firing his corne) his
Israelites by fiery serpents: whom hee
loueth, hee chasteneth, and keepeth
them in the fornace of fiery tryalls, till
they come to their right temper. Hee
standeth and knocketh: if nothing will
arouze vs, a time will come, when hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

Christ shall come in flaming fire, to
render vengeance with fire vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
We therefore, that know the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

               <p>From God turne thine eyes vnto
man: set before thee the pillar, and
cloud of fiery examples, that haue

a dull Iade, that will not follow: The
stories of the scriptures, the liues of
the fathers, the acts and monuments
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3200:34"/>
of the Church, haue a speciall vertue for
this effect. The very pictures of the fires,
and Martyrs, cannot but warme thee.
If thou canst meet with any liuing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,

the tongue: Such as meditate by inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
neuer chewing the cud and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
their meat, they may happely get
a smackering for discourse and table-talke;
but not enough to keepe soule
&amp; life together, much lesse for strength
and vigour. Such as forsake the best fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
and waxe strange to holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
(as now the manner of many
is) how can they but take cold? Can
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3200:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one coale alone keep it selfe glowing?</p>
               <p>Though it goe not out for want of
matter, yet may it be put out by sundry
accidents; when it is newly kindled it
may be put out with scoffes and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
if <hi>Peter</hi> take not heed, and fence
himselfe well against them; but if once
throughly growne, such breath will but
spread and encrease it.</p>
               <p>It is possible fire may be oppressed
with too much wood, and heat suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with too much nourishment: ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
prayer, reading, and study, may
be a wearinesse both to flesh and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
but it so rarely happeneth that I
neede not mention it; and yet the soule
hath it satiety. There be some such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
ouer-nice men in this sense al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
who haue not learned that God
will haue them mercifull to themselues:
It is oftner smoothered for want of
vent and exercise. Let such as vse not,
and expresse not their zeale, bragge of
their good hearts; surely they haue
none such, or not like to haue them
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3200:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such. <hi>If Nichodemus</hi> had not buried
Christ by day, wee might haue feared
his zeale had gone out, for all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
by night.</p>
               <p>Yet this is not so ordinary, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
it by the quench-coale of sin;
grosse sinne euery man knowes will
waste the conscience, and make shippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke
of zeale: but I say, the least
known euill vnrepented of, is as a thiefe
in the candle, or an obstruction in the
liuer. I feare <hi>Dauid</hi> serued God but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,
till hee published his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
he that steales his meate, though
pouerty tempt him, yet giueth thankes
but coldly: zeale and sinne, will soone
expell the one, or the other, out of their
subiect; can you imagine in the same
roofe, God and Beliall, the Arke and
Dagon? Lastly, and most commonly,
foraine heare will extract the inwarde,
and aduemicious heate consume the
naturall.</p>
               <p>The Sunne will put out the fire; and
so will the loue of the world, the loue
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3200:37"/>
of the Father, they cannot stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in intense degrees, one cannot
serue both these masters, with such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as both would haue. Seldome
seest thou a man make haste to be rich,
and thriue in religion. Christs message
to <hi>Iohn</hi> holdes true, The poor are most
forward in receiuing and following the
Gospell: as thou louest thy zeale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of resoluing to be rich, lest gaine
proue thy godlinesse; take heede of
ambitious aspiring, least Courts and
great places, prooue ill aires for zeal,
whither it is as easie to go zealous, as to
returne wise: <hi>Peter</hi> whiles he warmed
his hands, cooled his heart; Not that
greatnesse and zeale cannot agree, but
for that our weakenesse many times
seuers them. If thou beest willing to dy
poore in estate, thou maiest the more
easily liue rich in grace. <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the
poorest of the seuen Candlestickes, hath
the richest price vpon it.</p>
               <p>The diligent practice of these cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
will make easie the practice of this

thinke they haue enough, and need no

much zeale as truely to wish my selfe
<hi>Anathema,</hi> vpon condition it had heate

all, to bee in effect as spoken to none,
directs mee what I would speake to
Churches, to speake to particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
Now the principall in our Church,
vnder that Archangel of the couenant,
I most willingly acknowledge to bee
my Lorde the King, as an Angel of
light. And why not that very Angel,
who by his writing hath begunne to
poure out the fift viall vpon the throne
of the beast, darkened his kingdome,
caused them to gnaw their tongues for
griefe, and blaspheme for the smart of
their wounds; though as yet they will
not repent of their errours. The Lord
anoint him more and more, with this
oyle aboue all the Princes of the earth,
that from his head, it may run downe
vpon our skirts; make him shine in
zeale aboue all other starres, to the
warming &amp; enlightening of this whole
Horizon; set him vp as a standard for
his people; cloath him with zeale, as
with a cloake, to recompence the fury
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3200:38"/>
of the aduersaries, that hee may strike
the Aramites, not three but fiue times
till they be consumed; that he may put
the Ammonites vnder the iron sawes,
harrowes, axes, which haue prouoked
him as much, as euer they did <hi>Dauid,</hi>
2. Sam. 12. But yet as in the time of
the old Testament the custody of the
fire and light was the charge of the
Priests; so here I obserue Christ to lay
it vpon his Ministers, interpreting his
rule by his practice, <hi>Tell the Church,
Tell the Angel of the Church;</hi> honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that despised office, with that state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stile; intimating the vnion betweene
people and Minister, that they should
be as one: what is spoken to the one, is
spoken to the other; not as some, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
make Clergie and Layty two mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
in diuision and opposition; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet as some spirites that lay all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
but implying a propriety, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in grace and zeale in the Ministers,
whom the preacher calls the Master of
the assemblies; that they should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3200:39"/>
as farre the people, as Angels do
men, and that he will reckon with them
for the religion of the people, because
cold Priests make bold sinners; zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Iehoiada</hi> may make <hi>Iehoash</hi> the
King zealous, so long as he liues with
him. We therefore men and brethren,
or rather men and Angels, vpon whom
it lies to keepe life and heate in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
of the world, to consume the
drosse of vices and heresies, that haue
fallen into the sinke of our times; we
that are to make ready our people for
the second comming of Christ, is the
spirit of <hi>Ely</hi> thinke wee sufficient for
vs? what manner of persons ought wee
to be, burning in spirit, feruent in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
thundring in preaching, shining in
life and conuersation? why is it then
my brethren (oh let my plainest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes,
be the fruites and signes of my
best loue to mine owne Tribe; let
them not be as breakings of the head,
but as precious balme to those
whose honour with the people, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3200:39"/>
to my life) why is it that some
of vs pray so rarely and so coldely in
priuate (the euills of our times will
not out but by frequent fasting and
feruent prayer) in publique so briefly,
so perfunctorily, and feebly, that wee
scarse haue any witnesses of what wee
saie? why are there yet remaining any
Mutes amongst vs? why are there any
tongues that dare speake against often
or zealous preaching? Doth not <hi>Paul</hi>
adiure vs before him that shall iudge the
elect Angels, that we preach instantly,
in season, and out of season? Reade we
the commentaries of that text, or let
the practice of Ancients expound it;
and tell mee if euer olde or new inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
that charge, of bare reading, of
quarterly, or monethly, yea, or of once
on the Saboath preaching onely, as if
that were fully sufficient, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoring
or desiring any more? If
alwaies often preaching bee prating,
what meant the practice I say, not only
of <hi>Caluin,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> but of <hi>Chrysostom,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3200:40"/>
Basil, Ambrose,</hi> with other of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
preaching euery day in the week,
some of them twise in the weeke, none
of them so seldome, as such would bear
the world in hand. What meant sundry
ancient Councells, (the eleuenth of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
in Spaine) yea euen of Trent it selfe,
to excite the torpor of the Bishoppes
of their times, as their Canons speake,
enioyning frequent preaching, calling
for more then almost any man is to
performe.</p>
               <p>But heere I may turne reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
into reioycing, that preaching
is growne in any better fashion and
grace with our times, by royall and
reuerend, both examples and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
only I wish that euery <hi>Archippus</hi>
may fulfill his Ministery, be instant and
constant in preaching. <hi>Salomon</hi> the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and wiser hee grew, the more hee
taught the people, sharpened his goads,
and fastned his nailes; whereas many
amongst vs are so wise in their youth,
as to affect the foolishnes of preaching;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3200:40"/>
but in their dotage, Ease slayes the
foole; when the door is oyled, it leaues
creaking; they must then fall to make
much of themselues, till contrarie with
the Prophet they cry out, My fatnesse,
my fatnesse, my belly, my belly; so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
their lungs, that they will bee
sure neuer to die of <hi>Dauids</hi> consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of zeale; let such preach, say they,
that want liuing: and if for shame they
preach at all, it must be rarely and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily,
for breaking of their winde, (my
meaning is not to taxe such, whom
God dismables by weakenes of body)
or such as recompense their rarity
with industry, as <hi>Perkins,</hi> &amp;c. and yet
forsooth these thinke they may iustly
challenge, and weare the double honor
of countenance and maintenance; I
maruell with what right, or with what
face, so long as there remaineth express
Canon of Scripture, bequeathing it to
those, that toyle in word and doctrine.
Neither will zeale set vs on worke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to preach, or to preach often to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3200:41"/>
the infamy of bare readers; but
it will teach vs to preach painfully, and
that in the euidence and demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not so much of art, or nature,
as of the spirit and grace; regarding
onely, that the people know Christ and
him crucified; not caring whether they
knowe what wee haue read, how many
quotations our memory will carry le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
how roundly wee can vtter our
minde, in new minted wordes, in like
sounding, idle, vaine, and offensiue <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranomasies;</hi>
I blush to fall into the least
touch of that kinde: yet at once to
shew and reprooue that childish folly,
It is a view of vaine preaching, turning
sound preaching into a sound of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
tickling mens eares, like a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling
cymbal, feeding them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
spoyling the plaine song,
with descant and diuision: what is this
but to shew our owne leuitie and want
of true art; indeede affecting such a
dauncing, piperly and effeminate elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
(as <hi>Tully, Demosthenes,</hi> or any
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3200:41"/>
Masculine Orator would scorne) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of that diuine powerfull deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which becommeth him, that speaks
the Oracles of God. If euer we mean
to doe any good, wee must exhort and
reprooue, with all vehemency and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
lifting vppe our voyce as a
trumpet, as the sonnes of thunder;
pearcing their cares, witnessing, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and contending, according to our
gift whatsoeuer it bee, to manifest our
affections, that wee may worke vpon
the people; which all the art in the
world will not teach vs to doe: onely
zeale at the heart will naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it, without straining or affecting.
If God require the heart as well as the
head; why should wee not labour to
mooue the affections, as well as inform
the iudgement? there is a doctrinall, &amp;
as som tearm it, a Doctorly kind of prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching,
which is admired of some that
vnderstand it not; of others that could
be content with the Masse againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was gentle, and had no teeth in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3200:42"/>
it. And such Sermons I haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
heard, for matter void of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but so deliuered as if one were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Part, or saying a lesson by heart.
It hath called to minde a song which
sometimes I haue met withall, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
composed, full of sweete ayre,
surely and truely sung; but with flat
and dead voyces without spirit, which
hath marred the musicke: Of such a
Sermon and preacher, the countrey
mans verdit did well, that said, this man
may be a great scholar, but hee wants
beetle and wedges to heaw our knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
timber withall, our greene wood
will not burn vnless it be better blowen:
you shall sometimes see an excellent
horse of shape and colour, hauing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those marks <hi>Du Bartas</hi> describes
in <hi>Cains</hi> supposed horse; which yet
wanting metall hath beene of little
worth, and lesse vse. If there were no
other preachers then these, which hold
themselues the onely profound and
learned preachers, I muse what should
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3200:42"/>
become of conuersion of soules, which
they that couet, must come with the
spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> to turne the hearts of
the fathers to their children. I may in
trueth, and I hope with modestie speake
with the Preacher, that in obseruing I
haue obserued, and haue found that
diuerse great Clarkes haue had but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fruit of their ministery; but hardly
any truely zealous man of God (though
of lesser gifts) but haue had much
comfort of their labours, in their owne
and bordering parishes, being in this
likened by <hi>Gregory,</hi> to the yron on
the Smiths anvile sparkling round
about. And if for this any bordering
neighbours, whose cold labours work
not the like successe, shall accuse them
of some kind (I know not what) of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
in bewitching the people; they
may well reply, Behold our zealous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are our charmes, and zeale all
our witchcraft, as <hi>Latimer</hi> well answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one that accused the people of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
for not affecting him that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3200:43"/>
one of his printed sermons, that
he had indeed his Stick, but wanted
his Rosen; meaning his zealous manner
of preaching and liuing, without which
last, all the former will doe but little
good, if a good ensample of life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
not their doctrine, as lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
doth thunder. For there are some
(I speake it with sorrow of heart) that
seem to haue fire in their preaching, but
cary water in their life; being notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proud, couetous, or debauched, stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with odious vices. Let vs heare
the summe of all. Doo we loue Christ
more then ordinary? would wee giue
proofe of our trebble loue to him? Let
vs then feede his flocke with a trebble
zeale, expressed in our prayer, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and liuing: Let vs make it appear
to the consciences of all, that the top
of our ambition is Gods glory: and
that we preferre the winning of soules,
to the winning of the world.</p>
               <p>This title of Angels why may it not
also be extended to Magistrates, as well
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3200:43"/>
as that higher stile, of Gods? Sure I am
that the scarlet robe of zeale would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
well become them. <hi>Iethro</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it their prime and essentiall chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter;
God and <hi>Moses,</hi> their onely and
sole, in the charge and commission to
<hi>Iehoshua</hi> so oft repeated; <hi>Onely be of good
courage.</hi> And if <hi>Dauid</hi> were now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
his Psalme; I thinke hee might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the forme of his counsell, and say,
<hi>Be zealous yee Rulers and Iudges of the
world,</hi> and not wise and politicke: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnder the tearmes of wisdome, he
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehends indeed the zeal we call for,
the most now adayes being <hi>Gallioes,</hi>
wise onely for the matters of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth; not hauing a sparke of
that spirit which was in <hi>Phineas, Daniel,</hi>
and <hi>Nehemias</hi> &amp;c. for the Lord of
hosts, or to his lawes and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
as if God had made Magistrates
keepers onely of the second table, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of men, and not of Christians;
guardians onely of ciuill societies, and
not of his Church, and shepheards also
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3200:44"/>
of his flocke. Are Idolatries, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
profaning of Sabaoths, no sins?
Why then either haue not the lawes
force and strength enough in them (as
somtime we are answered when we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain)
or why are they not executed for
the suppressing of these raigning sins? are
not all they punished with death in the
Scriptures, as well as breaches of the
second table. Blood I leaue to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant.
Church, and admire clemency
in rulers, as much as any; but yet I
know the profane dissolutenesse of the
times, requires a three stringed whip
of seuerity to purge our <hi>Augean</hi> stable
of the foule abuses, whipt often with
pennes and tongues, but spared by
them that beare the sword (a man may
say of many gouernours) altogether in
vaine for matters of religion. Are not
kings of the earth charged to re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the bloudy strumpet of Rome?
Why then doth the hurtfull pittie of
our times imbolden and increase their
numbers? <hi>Laodicea</hi> it selfe, I doubt not,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3200:44"/>
for matters of mine and thine, had (as
their name imports) good ciuill iustice
and iusticers; but what was God the
nearer for it? doth hee not threaten for
all that to spue them out of his mouth?
shall hee not curse those that doe his
work negligently, fearfully &amp; partially?
Our times complaine of two speciall
canker-worms of iustice, which eate vp
zeale in Magistrates. The first, is coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
which makes men of place to
transgresse for a morsell of bread; the
zeale of their owne houses, consumes
the zeale of Gods house: The building
of great houses, keeping of great hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
&amp; matching with great houses, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and leauing of great houses behinde
them; makes them so rauenous, that
they deuoure so much, as choakes all
their zeale; which would teach them
to shake their laps of bribes, and scorn
to accept gifts, though men would aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them for the peruerting of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The other is cowardise and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes:
which how vnfit, and base a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3200:45"/>
did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> thinke it for a man of
his place? no better then shynesse in a
fore-horse, whose eyes men fense on
both sides, that they may lead the way,
and goe without starting; vnto which,
zeale is answerable in Magistrates, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them onely to see him that is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
without casting a squint eye at
men; to sing to God onely of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and mercy, without runing their
songs to mans eare; to walke in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
way without turning, either to the
right or left hand for fear or fauour. Oh
that there were such an heart in our lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
how easily would our people fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low!
what a spring-tide of zeale should
wee haue, if the Sunne and Moone
would cast out a benigne aspect vpon
them! Doth it not flourish in all those
shires and townes, where the word and
sword doe iointly cherish it? In others
which are the greatest number, how
doth it languish and wane away, and
hang downe the head? where is it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
places of the land to be seene? I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3200:45"/>
had almost said in my haste and heate,
there is none that hath zeale, no not
one, there is no courage for the trueth;
but that I remember that <hi>Eliah</hi> was
checked for ouershooting himselfe in
his too short and quicke computation.
I hope the Lorde hath his fifties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs, though but thinne sowne in
comparison of the swarmes of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
recusants, and Church-Papists, of
profane Atheists, key-cold worldlings,
and luke warme professors. The bodies
of our many seuerall congregations,
yea euen of the better sort, whereunto
haue they beene likened by our separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
aduersaries; but vnto the Prophet
<hi>Hosea</hi> his cake, halfe baked vpon the
hearth, hauing one side, that is the one
side to the world-ward in publike ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
scorched a little and browned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer;
but the inside to Godward, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
and family duties, no better then
dough; many of them making indeede
some shew, as the out-landish fruites
that are plashed vpon our walles, but
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3200:46"/>
wanting heate neuer come to maturitie.
If wee should make good their resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,
how then should we please the
stomacke of God? who hath indeede
brooked and borne vs a long time, I
doubt but wamblingly. How neare
were we going in 88. and in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
treason? Do we thinke he will euer
digest vs, in the temper wee are in?
which (to confesse the truth of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shionable
Christian) what is it but a
state of neutrality, indifferency, or such
a mediocrity, as will iust serue the time,
satisfie law, or stand with reputation
of neighbours? beyond which, if any
step a little forward, do not the rest hunt
vpon the stop? If there hap to breake
out a sparkle of zeale in any one house
in a parish; is not the whole towne in
an vprore, as when the bells ring awke
euery man brings his bucket to the
quenching of this fire? If hell bee in an
alehouse, who cries out of it? and as for
our Sundayes Church seruice, which is
all that God gets at our hands; how
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3200:46"/>
perfunctorily, and fashionably is it slub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
ouer; how are his Sabaoths made
the voider and dung-hill for all refuse
businesse, diuided between the Church
and the alehouse, the may-pole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
beguiling the pulpit; what man
would not spue to see God thus wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped?
This want of deuotion makes
the foule mouthed Papists to spet at vs:
this want of reformation, makes the
queasie stomacked Brownists cast them
selues out of our Church; and shall God
alwaies suffer the land to beare vs? But
behold, he stands at the door &amp; knocks,
by treasons, by plagues, by the hammer
of dearths, discontents, fires, inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
especially by the word; his locks are
wet with waiting. Oh before he shake
off the dust of his feete against vs, and
turne to some other nation more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
let vs open the doore, that he may
come in and sup with vs; if he loue vs,
he will purge vs, and scourevs, by one
chastisement or other; if hee haue no
pleasure in vs, he cannot but vnburden
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3200:47"/>
his stomacke of vs; If all the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
should turne the deafe eare, yet let
me intreat and charge you of my flock
to heare his voyce, &amp; be zealous. Since
my comming amongst you, I haue han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
some bookes of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Epistles to the Romanes, to
the Hebrewes, of Saint <hi>Iames, Peter,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Iohn,</hi> out of them taught the doctrine of
the Law, of faith, loue, &amp; good works:
now in the choyce of this Epistle of
Christ to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> my desire was to
boile vp the former to their iust tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
in which worke I can willingly be
content to spend my strength, &amp; daies,
if God see it fit. I cannot bee a better
sacrifice then to God, and for you, if
I waste my selfe, so you may haue light
and heat; what else is the end of my
life? God hath giuen you a name, your
zeale is gone abroad, and I hope you
haue many names among you; the Lord
increase their number and zeale. If but
one of vs this day, shall open this door
of his heart with <hi>Iehoshua,</hi> let others
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3200:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
choose, I and my house will serue the
Lord more zealously then heretofore;
neither I nor he shall haue lost our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
A liuely picture casts the eye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
euery one that comes near it: such is
the word with whom, &amp; with which we
haue to do; Let him that is now cold,
grow colder and colder; but let him
that hath an eare, heare what hath been
said to the Churches; And bee zealous
and amend.</p>
               <p>The Lord giue vs not onely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
but zeale in all things: hee
Baptize vs with fire: hee breath on vs,
and inspire into vs the spirit of life and
power, &amp;c. So shall we runne the waies
of his commandements.</p>
