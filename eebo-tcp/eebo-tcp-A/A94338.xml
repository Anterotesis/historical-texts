            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mr. <hi>Liſle</hi> his Speech.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord Major, and you worthy Gentlemen of the famous City of <hi>London,</hi> I am commanded by the Lords and Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſembled, to obſerve to you ſome Paſſages out of theſe Letters which you have heard; They are Paſſages of that nature, though it be moſt happy for this Kingdom and Parliament to know them, yet my very heart doth bleed to repeat them.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that I ſhall obſerve to you, is concerning the Kings endeavours to bring For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Forces, a Forraign Prince with an Army into this Kingdom: By his Letters to the Queen, which you have heard read, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to haſten the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> with an Army into <hi>England;</hi> It is well known to the Parliament, that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> is a Prince highly eſteemed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with Jeſuits of any Prince in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and yet the King writes to the Queen, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113086:3"/>
haſten the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to come with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that I ſhall obſerve to you, are, Endeavours to overthrow the Law of the Land by Power, to Repeal the Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes of this Realm by Force and Arms, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by Force and Arms to Repeal all the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this Kingdom againſt Papiſts; I ſhall read a Paſſage to you, which you have already heard, out of one of the Kings Letters to the Queen; The Letter vvas dated the Fifth of <hi>March,</hi> 1644.</p>
            <q>I give thee power, in my Name, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that I will take away all the Penall Statutes in England, againſt the Roman Catholikes, as ſoon as God ſhall enable me to do it, ſo as by their means, or in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, I may have ſo powerfull aſſiſtance as may deſerve ſo great a favour.</q>
            <p>When we conſider, that the Statutes of this Kingdom againſt Papiſts muſt be taken away by Force; when we conſider that the Laws of this Kingdom are to be Repealed by Power, who cannot but when hee calls to minde the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113086:3"/>
Declarations that have been made to put the Laws in execution againſt Papiſts, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations that have been made, and have been often made to maintain the Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who can chuſe but grieve to think of it.</p>
            <p>The third thing (Gentlemen) that I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to you, is concerning the uſe, and the Ends that have been made (which you may obſerve out of theſe Letters) of a Treaty with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, I ſhall read His Majeſties words to you in the Letter of the Fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> 1645. a Letter to the Queen;
<q>And be confident that in making peace, I ſhall ever ſhew my conſtancy, in adhering to Biſhops and to all Our friends, and not forget to put a ſhort period to this perpetuall Parliament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in His Letter to the Queen of the Ninth of <hi>February,</hi> 1644. there is this Paſſage,
<q>Be confident that I will never quit Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, nor the Sword.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We did all hope, that the end of a Treaty had been to ſettle a happy Peace, a firm and a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Peace; but now we ſee by the Kings
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113086:4"/>
Letter, that His Reſolutions are, ſtill to keep the Sword in His own hands: We did all hope, that the end of a Treaty was to ſettle Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government according to the Proteſtation, the Solemn Vow and Covenant which we have all taken; But you ſee by the Kings Letter, that He avows it to the Queen that He will never quit Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>We did all hope, that the end of a Treaty was rather to confirm the Parliament then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it; but the King ſayes in His own Letter, that He will not forget at this Treaty, to put a ſhort period to this perpetuall Parliament.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing that I ſhall obſerve to you (for you will have the reſt obſerved to you by a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hand) is concerning the Kings diſavowing this Parliament to be the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> we cannot have any greater aſſurance of any thing from the King, then of this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; there is no Law ſtronger that gives any property to the Subject, then the Law is to continue this preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>This is ſo well known to the world, that Kingdoms &amp; States abroad acknowledge it; and now for the King to diſavow it, after it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and continued by Act of Parliament after
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113086:4"/>
the King hath ſo lately acknowledged it, now ſo ſuddenly to diſavow it, how can we be more confident of any aſſurance or Act from his Majeſty?</p>
            <p>There be many things more obſervable in theſe Letters, but I ſhall leave them to thoſe worthy Gentlemen that come after me.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="speech">
            <head>Mr. <hi>Tate</hi> his Speech.</head>
            <p>THe Letters are ſo full, that I ſhall rather be your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer of what you have heard in them, then give you any obſervations upon them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall preſent before you a very ſad Spectacle, the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> bleeding, a Kingdom all in Peace without any thoughts of War, without any thoughts of Arms; and of a ſudden, a Popiſh party ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up, laying hold upon all the Forts, Seizing all the Lands, and all the goods of the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and not content with that, when they had done, killing one hundred thouſand of them, man, woman and childe: Theſe Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> that had thus inhumanely mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſo many Proteſtants; (here is the ſadneſſe) Now the Favourites of the King, and thoſe Subjects that the King did profeſſe to maintain, in maintaining Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Rebels; we that by Acts of Parliament of the Kings own Grant, had the Iriſh Rebels Lands and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113086:5"/>
Territories granted to us to maintain a War againſt them; Now becauſe we maintain that War, we are Rebels and Traytors; and the Iriſh Rebels becauſe that they ſtand againſt you, they ſhall be freed from all penall Laws, they ſhall have any thing that they deſire, nothing is too dear for them, any Laws may be altered for their ſakes; but when the Proteſtants come to deſire an alteration of Law for the advancement of the Proteſtant Religion, and for the ſettlement of the Proteſtants, nothing can be granted to them by a Proteſtant King, but every thing to the Iriſh: I ſhall ſay but a word more, and pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it; The condition why all this is granted to the Iriſh, and denied to you, it is only this, That the Iriſh may come over into <hi>England</hi> to cut your throats, as they cut the throats of all the Iriſh Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland;</hi> this is the cauſe for which they are encouraged to come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if there be ſuch a reward for Treachery, if there be ſuch a fruit of the Proteſtations of the King, what can we expect. All I have to ſay, is, you ſee you muſt ſtand to your Armes, and defend your ſelves; for there is no hopes for you, unleſſe you can ſubmit your necks to the Queen, and be transformed into Iriſh Rebels and Papiſts: I know not how you can obtain any favour at Court, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially having ſuch a Mediator, as you have a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is ſo hated by this King, as long as that mediates for you, you ſhall have nothing, but if you can have a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Catholique Queen to ſollicite in your behalf, you ſhall have any thing: I know you are too much Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Proteſtants to ſubmit to ſuch baſe conditions; therefore lay aſide all diviſions, and unite your ſelves in this Cauſe, that you may be Maſters of the Popiſh party, that otherwiſe will kill you all.</p>

            <p>MY Lord Mayor and you worthy Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the City of London, I ſhall not trouble you to repeat any of the Letters that you have heard read, I doubt not but you that heard them do remember moſt of them, only this I will ſay to you; That for my part I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have more cauſe of joy or ſorrow, for this which this day you have heard. Cauſe I know we have to be ſorrowfull, that things are ſo ill with us as they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I am ſure we have cauſe to rejoyce, that things are now diſcovered and brought to light, that have been ſo long hid in darkneſſe. This day is a day of diſcovery; heretofore thoſe that ſpak thoſe things that you have herad this day manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted unto you; were accounted the Malignant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, they were termed Rebels, they were ſuſpitious jealous people without cauſe; The Lords and Commons in Parliament, they have heretofore declared their fears of the things that you ſee now proved: Anſwers have been given to thoſe fears with ſlights and ſcornes. Things are this day diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to you that were enjoyned to be kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret by the ſtrongeſt engagements; the goodneſſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113086:6"/>
of God giving ſucceſſe to our Armie hath brought theſe things to light. Before his Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Parliament, the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons by a Petition to him, did preſent unto him their fears, occaſioned by the favouring of <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants; their fears that he would bring in forraign Forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would change and alter the Laws, they gave him their Reaſons for all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he was pleaſed to give his Anſwer with denying all, as they affirmed all: For that of Forraign Forces, becauſe he gave a punctuall Anſwer to that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will tell you what it was: When they told him that they were informed that the Popes Nuncio did deal with the French and Spaniſh Kings, to ſend to him 4000. men a peece, the King did An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them:
<q>That it was improbable in it ſelfe, and ſcandalous to him, for which he deſired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration at their hands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And at another time he Anſwers that very point concerning Forraign Forces poſitively, and ſaith:
<q>No ſober nor honeſt man can beleeve that We are ſo deſperate or ſo ſenceleſſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113086:6"/>
                  <hi>(they are his very words)</hi> to entertain ſuch a deſigne, As to bring in Forraigne Forces, which would not onely bury this Our Kingdome in diſtraction and ruine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Our owne Name and Poſterity in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſcorne and infamy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You have heard what hath been ſaid for that, you have heard his own Letters, how he deals with the Queen, and how preſſing he is with her to bring into this Kingdome the Duke of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne with his Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Duke of Lorraigne you know is a Catholike Popiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Forraigne Prince: So you ſee how much he is altered from what he thought then, and how his endeavours are now, that both honeſt men and ſober men may beleeve that hee would do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he writes to her with ſuch earneſtneſſe, to pray her to do it for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

making war againſt the Parliament, then againſt our own children, that we will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and obſerve the Asts aſſented to by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s this Parliament, without violation; and that we have not, nor ſhall not have, any thought of uſing of any force, unleſſe we ſhall be driven to it for the ſecurity of Our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſon, and for the defence of the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the Kingdome, and the juſt Rights and Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in another of his Printed Declarations he hath ſaid:

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:113086:7"/>And in another Declaration, he ſaith, That
<q>He is reſolved not onely duely to obſerve the Laws himſelfe, but to maintain them, againſt what oppoſition ſoever, though with the hazard of his being.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in his Declaration concerning his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go into Ireland, which is alſo Printed, he calls God to witneſſe, the ſincerity of his profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there made, with this aſſurance;
<q>That his Majeſty will never conſent, upon what pretence ſoever, to a toleration of the Popiſh profeſsion there; or the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws now in force againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Recuſants in that Kingdome.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What could his Majeſty have ſaid more to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his people.</p>
            <p>Now compare his actions with his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and compare his Letters to the Queen, with his promiſe and proteſtations to the Parliament, and you will ſay <hi>Quantum mutatus,</hi> how much is his Majeſty changed.</p>
            <p>All that we have heard read, we may divide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:113086:8"/>The firſt concernes the Letters, Propoſitions, and tranſactions, concerning Ireland.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, the Letters from the Queen to the King.</p>
            <p>The third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Letters from the King to the Queene.</p>
            <p>Concerning Ireland, you have heard the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions made, to the Queen, for fending into this Kingdome diverſe Iriſh Rebels, under the Command of two profeſſed Papiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6000. of them were to be under the Command of the Lord Glamorgan, the Earl of Worceſters eldeſt ſon, the other of 10000. under the command of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell Fitz Williams: the terms that they were to come upon, were read to you in the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which themſelves ſent to the Queen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You will not think that theſe came to maintain the Laws, but to deſtroy them, not to maintain the Proteſtant Religion, but to overthrow it, theſe Propoſitions being ſent to the Queene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by her and ſhe ſent them to the King.</p>
            <p>For the Letters concerning Ireland they were written by the King to the Earl of Ormond, who is now Governourthere: in ſome of them Letters, the King gives way to the ſuſpending of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113086:8"/>
Law, I which was an Act of Parliament, in the 10. year of Henry the 7. it was called Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings Lavv, becauſe Sir Edvvard Poynings vvas Governour of Ireland, vvhen that Lavv vvas made; that Lavv made all Statutes that vvere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made in England, of force in Ireland; and the King may as vvell ſuſpend all the Lavvs there, as that Lavv; by that Lavv of Poynings, all Lavvs that vvere after to be preſented at the Parliament in Ireland, muſt be firſt ſent hither for approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before they could be preſented to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no Parliament muſt be called there before the cauſes of calling the Parliament, and the Acts to be paſſed in that Parliament, are firſt ſent hither and approved but that Lavv novv muſt be ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>Further, in the Letters to the Lord of Ormond you ſee the King doth not count it a hard bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for to make a Lavv in Ireland to ſuſpend or to take avvay the penall Lavvs, againſt Papiſts there, ſo that they vvill help him here, againſt his Proteſtant Subjects: when this promiſe was made the Declaration was not remembred, wherein the King doth declare, that upon no pretence whatſoever, he will tollerate the Popiſh
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113086:9"/>
profeſſion in Ireland, or aboliſh the Laws againſt Popiſh Recuſants now in force there. He further ſaith in another Letter to my Lord of Ormond, that rather then he will fail of making a peace or a ceſſation with the Rebells, he would have him ingage himſelfe to joyn with the Rebels againſt the Scots, and the Lord Inchequin, which is the main viſible Proteſtant Forces, that are in Ireland: all this is enjoyned to be kept ſecret, from all but two or three of the chiefeſt Rebels in Ireland, whom you heard named in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: you may further obſerve, that a peace was treated of with the Rebels about the ſame time that the King did Treat with the Parliament here concerning Ireland; and the King wiſhed a quick diſpatch of the peace there, leaſt if hee ſhould make a peace here firſt, he could not ſhew ſuch favours to the Iriſh as he intended; they are the words of his letter.</p>
            <p>You may ſee by all the letters to my Lord of Ormond, that the King did little ſtick at any thing to grant to the Rebels, for a peace with them, but how little he granted to the Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, at the laſt Treaty, I hope all the world will ſoon know.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:113086:9"/>The next are the Queens Letters to the King; in them you may ſee Her unwearied indeavours by Sea and Land to raiſe Forces againſt the Parliament to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, you ſee ſhe marcheth in the head of an Army, and calls her ſelf the Generaliſſima; you may ſee further in her Letters, the great intereſt ſhe hath in the Kings Counſels, no Office or Place can be diſpoſed of without her, you may ſee by her Letters, her advice concerning Peace, in making Peace, ſhe adviſeth the King not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon thoſe that have ſerved him, for fear they forſake him in his need; ſhe expreſſeth whom ſhe meaneth, <hi>the Biſhops and the poor Catholiques;</hi> ſhe adviſeth the King for the honour of God, that he truſt not himſelf in our hands; if he go to <hi>London</hi> before the Parliament is ended, ſhe tels him he is undone; you may ſee by her Letters, how active ſhe is with the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> for ſending over ten thouſand men, you may ſee her advice concerning this Parliament; <hi>She ſaith, that perpetuall Parliament muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded,</hi> the reſt ſhe ſaith will follow, if the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace without that, ſhe will into <hi>France</hi> ſhe ſaith, I am ſure you cannot forget theſe Paſſages.</p>
            <p>In the Kings Letters to the Queen you may obſerve theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Apology to her, for calling us a Parliament at the laſt Treaty, it ſeems ſhe was offended at it, and you may ſee by His Letters with what difficulty he did it, for he ſaith, that if but two more had joyned with him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to the contrary, he would never have done it, yet he hath told us, he will keep all the Acts of this Parliament inviolable: how theſe can ſtand together, let all men judge; he hath told us that he will maintain the Laws, and obſerve them himſelf, yet you ſee he lay the blood of that Kingdom that is ſhed in theſe wars, upon the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the innocent blood (as he cals it) of my Lord of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113086:10"/>
               <hi>Strafford,</hi> yet my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> was condemned by himſelf, and by the Law, that he ſaith he will maintain.</p>
            <p>You ſee how preſſing he is to the Queen to procure aide from the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> upon hopes of his coming he is very glad, and ſaith, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſhall help to tranſport his Souldiers: compare this with his former Declarations concerning Forraign Forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it needs no ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, we have all of us more cauſe to pray for him.</p>
            <p>For his maintaining the Laws, you may obſerve in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dated in <hi>March</hi> laſt to the Queen, there is this paſſage.
<q>I give thee leave to promiſe in my name, to all that thou thinkeſt fit, that I will take away all the penall Laws againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiques in England, as ſoon as God ſhall enable me to do it, ſo as I may by their means have ſuch aſsiſtance, as may deſerve ſo great a favour and enable me to do it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this promiſe of his, he enjoynes much ſecreſie, which he had need to do, being ſo contrary to former Declarations, and Proteſtations.</p>
            <p>If this be done, he may as well alter and take away all our Laws, both for property and Liberty; theſe Laws againſt Papiſts are of as much force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and binde as much as any Laws whatſoever: upon all theſe Letters and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages together you may obſerve the great deſigne, to put an end to this Parliament, although it cannot be done without the consent of the Lords and Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the Kings joyning with them.</p>
            <p>You ſee another deſign is, to take away all Laws againſt Recuſants, and that muſt be when the King is able to do it, as he ſaith, and that cannot be without force; you ſee,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113086:10"/>
to enable himſelf to do theſe things, He invites in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Forces, you ſee he deals with Papiſts &amp; Proteſtants, and all to aſſiſt Him againſt the Parliament: You ſee in thoſe Letters, what Priviledges and immunities are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Papiſts, and nothing at all to His Proteſtant Subjects; you ſee the great truſt He repoſeth in the Queen, to make a bargain for Him, although it concern Religion, which is the ſtrongeſt point of confidence He can expreſſe to Her; I need not repeat the words: You cannot but obſerve the Reward that He beſtows upon them that contrary to their truſt repoſed in them by the Kingdom have diſſerted the Parliament: He tels the Queen He is free from the place of baſe mutinous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in His <hi>Mungrell Parliament</hi> there; <hi>Let the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward befall all ſuch as ſhall betray</hi> their truſt repoſed in them by the Kingdom; You may ſee whom you have cauſe to thank, for the ſeizing of your goods in <hi>France,</hi> you heard it read, upon the ſcore of whoſe kindneſſe it was ſet.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, you may ſee by the Letters, if a Peace be had, what a one it ſhall be, it ſhall be ſuch a one as ſhall invite the Queen to return.</p>
            <p>The Treaty for it ſhall be according to the Inſtructions given to the Commiſſioners, which upon the Kings word, <hi>are according to the little Note the Queen ſo well remembers:</hi> In making Peace the King aſſures her, He will be conſtant in adhering to the Biſhops, &amp; all His friends, thoſe whom the Queen cals in her Letter, the poor Roman catholiques.</p>
            <p>Laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In making Peace, He will not forget to put an end to this Parliament; but ſome will ſay, What's all this to us?</p>
            <p>Yes, it much concerns us all, that we may pray for, and pitty our King, and to learn us to look to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>You ſee by their Letters the way they hope to bring about all their deſignes, they ſay it is by our diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113086:11"/>
our ſelves, they ſay the City is divided in it ſelf, they ſay the Houſes of Parliament are divided among themſelves, and they ſay, they are divided one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſay, one part goes one way, and another part goes another way; I hope, that which appears by theſe Letters, will make us all go the ſame way for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of this Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Letters that ye have heard read, are beyond all exceptions; the Kings Letters all of His own hand, and in many places Corrected by himſelf. The Letters to the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> are all His own hand; there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Letters beſides them, now read, which were taken at the Fight, all of them together, with theſe read, are depoſited into an indifferent place, that any one that will may ſee them.</p>
            <p>By what you have heard read, you ſee the unwearied indeavors of your Enemies to deſtroy you, they are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, let us be vigilant in proſecuting this Cauſe we have undertaken, that we may have a happy end of theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py differences; do you of the City agree among your ſelves in the proſecuting of this Cauſe, though you may differ in private opinion in other things; I hope and pray that both Houſes of Parliament m<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y ever agree in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of this Cauſe, which I doubt not but they will as they do: let us all go on together, hand in hand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the maintenance of this Cauſe, according to our Proteſtation; we cannot do it without unity among our ſelves; if we have diviſion among our ſelves, we undo our ſelves, and hazard the Cauſe; if we in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Quarters agree among our ſelves, I hope we ſhall be invincible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will conclude with this Sentence, <hi>Si fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis inſeperabiles, eritis inſuperabiles,</hi> if we be inſeparable and undivided, we ſhall be invincible: Let us all do our duties faithfully, and leave the iſſue to God.</p>
