            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But there are ſome that frequent <hi>Harlots</hi> houſes to
beare their Friend company (as they affirme,) not knowing, or
at leaſt not conſidering the corruption of their Nature, nor their

the counſell of the vngodly, and to ſtand in the way of ſinners.
Some beeing ſetled on the Lees of their Sinnes, make it almoſt

griuouſly they offende Almightie GOD, tranſgreſſing his
holy Ordinances; nor weighing how they Defile their bodyes,
which are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt: nor conſidering into
what penurie and want they may be brought to: nor fearing the

               <hi>and ſhall goe aſtray
through his great folly.</hi> Theſe thinges while I conſidered
with my ſelfe, I remembred a Dialogue betweene two, written
in Latine by that reuerend learned man <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> to diſſwade
young Women from this euill kind of life, by ſhewing the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
filthineſſe thereof. I haue inlarged it both with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of more perſons, and larger matter; endeuouring to warne
both young Men, and young Women; yea, and all of what age
or condition ſoeuer, to take heed of this foule vice, and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ſinne, which will exclude them out of Heauen, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
not. I know that the multitude of Bookes in this age, are
many: but good Bookes, which tende either to the inſtruction
of Vertue, or to the deſtruction of Vice, are to be regarded, and
diligently read: But filthy and vnchaſt Pamphlets, (whereof
the World is too full) are fitter to be burned as corrupters of
Youth: And who ſoeuer doth ſo miſſpende his time, and abuſe
his Witte, and peruert the good guiftes and graces of God, ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:26219:4"/>
receiue condigne puniſhment, and his owne Bookes ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as witneſſes againſt him. I now intreat thee (courtious
Reader) to peruſe this little Treatiſe: and if thou thinke it
needfull for theſe times, fitte to promote Gods glorie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to men; as I hope, and am perſwaded it is, giue God the
glorie, and pray for mee his vnworthy ſeruant.</p>

Delay in all things is dangerous; hee that is not
fitte to day, may be leſſe fitte to morrow: now thou art
in health and thy ſenſes are freſh, and thy vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſtrong, and thy memorie ripe; if thy body were
ſicke, it may be ſickneſſe would weaken all theſe, and
thy paine would make thee impatient. And whereas
thou ſpeakeſt of old Age; Who hath any charter of
his life? Wee are Tenaunts at will, God may thruſt vs
out of our houſe and giue vs no warning: And this we
haue ſeene often how ſodainely many haue been taken
out of this life; as the <hi>Rich man</hi> that promiſed vnto
himſelfe many dayes,<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> and gloryed in his abundance,
and this ſentence was giuen againſt him, <hi>Thou Foole, this
night they ſhall fetch away thy ſoule.</hi> Therefore let vs not
preſume to repent when wee are old, but euen to day
let vs repent, becauſe we know not whether we ſhall
liue till to morrow. Moreouer, thou wouldeſt haue me
merry with thee, and enioy the pleaſures of ſinne: Let
mee tell thee <hi>Thais,</hi> that I haue learned to be merry in
the Lord; for other mirth is but momentanie and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie:
and I haue learned to renounce the pleaſures
of my Fleſh, and of the World, becauſe they are but for
a little ſeaſon; but they doe procure eternall torment,
as the example of the <hi>Rich Glutton</hi> doth teach.</p>

the Light diſcouereth their euill deeds. But if you

thee not with corruptible thinges, as Siluer and

make thee one of his members the Child of God, and

               <p>You ſpeake <hi>Parmeno,</hi> as you are: you are a
goodly Apple-ſquire, a Pander to ſuch Punks as <hi>Thais</hi>
is: you draw by one line, &amp; are an vpholder of bawdry?
and though you fetch that old Baud, neither ſhe nor
you, ſhall make me goe from that truth which I haue
ſpoken; and if you make haſt, you ſhall finde me here
to auerre that I haue vttered. And now <hi>Thais,</hi> conſider
with me, that this flower of thy beautie which procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
thee Louers, it will ſhortly vaniſh away, for either
ſickneſſe, or age, will deface it; what wilt thou then
doe thou wretched woman? No Dung-hill will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred

become a Baud, for ſuch are the proceedings of your

               <p>I confeſſe, (my <hi>Sophronius,</hi>) that all theſe things
which thou ſayeſt, are true; but tell me I pray you,
from whence you haue learned this holines? You were
wont to be a good fellow, and to delight in me: no man
came more often to me, and more vntimely, then you.

               <p>I wonder not a little, that you are ſo transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
my <hi>Sophronius;</hi> for commonly they which goe to

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophro.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell thee, my <hi>Thais:</hi> Becauſe I went not
with the ſame minde, nor after the ſame faſhion that
many young Gentlemen and others doe; for they goe
to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſee the Pope that <hi>Antichriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Papastupor Mundi.</note> the wonder of
the world, to ſee and learne <hi>Italian</hi> trickes, to learne to
court and ſerue their Miſtris. And I will tell thee
<hi>Thais,</hi> the occaſions to make a man a Libertine, are
there abundantly offered; for a man may be there, what
he will, ſo hee ſhew not any liking of godlyneſſe and
honeſtie, and therefore no maruaile though they that
haue been at <hi>Rome</hi> (for the moſt part) returne worſe
then when they went.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Thais.</speaker>
               <p>O my <hi>Sophronius,</hi> you forget your ſelfe, <hi>Rome</hi>
is accounted a holy place, the Pope is called <hi>Chriſts <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car;</hi>
they call others which conſent not vnto them, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques,</hi>
and profeſſe them ſelues the onely <hi>Catholiques</hi>
of the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophro.</speaker>
               <p>I know, <hi>Thais,</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> is accounted a holie
place; but I thinke they that eſteeme it ſo, haue not bin
there: for though it was ſome times an holy Citty where
many of Gods Saintes did liue, yet now it is become an
vnfaythfull Citty, a Cage of vncleane Birdes, a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
for perfidious and fugitiue perſonnes, and a ſinke
of al euill. When I diligently obſerued how licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
how viciouſly, how inordinatly men liued there,
committing moſt ſinnes without checke, I did admire
how they could call that place <hi>Holy,</hi> where men did
lead ſuch vncleane liues. The Pope is called <hi>Chriſts
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar,</hi> and is borne vpon mens ſhoulders, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
as a God; but he doth not follow the ſteppes
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> herein, but doth cleane contrary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes
<pb facs="tcp:26219:9"/>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and therefore he may rather be called
<hi>Antichriſt;</hi> And whereas the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> call others
<hi>Heretiques</hi> who diſſent from them, I can aſſure thee
<hi>Thais,</hi> that they hold and maintaine foule and ſhamefull
Hereſies, as I can proue by the holy word of God. And
whereas they call themſelues <hi>Catholiques,</hi> &amp; appropriat
that name vnto themſelues, they doe but as ſome that
called themſelues <hi>Iewes,</hi> and were not <hi>Iewes,</hi> as S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
doth teach, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3. 9. for they hold many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the holy <hi>Catholique</hi> Fayth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Thais.</speaker>
               <p>If this be true (my <hi>Sophronius</hi>) which you ſay,
I doe the more admire that you ſhould returne ſo holy
from ſo vnholy a place; We ſee that men generally are
ſo beſotted and inchaunted with the pleaſures of this
life, that they affect thoſe places where they may moſt
inioy them; and deſire rather to abide there where they
may haue libertie to inioy the pleaſures, of the fleſh,
then where men are warned to auoyde theſe <hi>Syrenes</hi>
and haue the Iudgements of God denounced againſt
them for their ſinnes. I ſpeake this from my owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
Tell me therefore (my <hi>Sophronius,</hi>) by what
meanes you are ſo transformed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophro.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell thee (my <hi>Thais</hi>) plainely, wiſhing
that it may be as profitable to thee, as it hath bin gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to mee. I chaunced (by the goodnes and grace of
God) to fall into the companie of a graue Father, who
was a <hi>Protiſtant</hi> Miniſter, who had bin at <hi>Rome</hi> to ſeeke
his Sonne, who ſecretly had ſlipt from him to ſee the
Countrie, and to learne faſhions; but hearing that he
was returned to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> he came backe againe, &amp; as we
trauailed togeather, he inquired of me of what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
I was? I told him an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man: he demaunded of
me the cauſe of my comming into thoſe Countries: I
anſwered him, to ſee Faſhions, and to vnderſtand the
ſtate of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion which I heard commended
in mine owne Countrie; and alſo to obſerue the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb facs="tcp:26219:9"/>
and faſhions of the <hi>Catholiques</hi> which I had heard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
prayſed of our Engliſh <hi>Catholiques,</hi> in my
owne Countrie. And when he had heard me to the end,
he ſpake on this manner vnto me. My Son, ſaith he (for ſo
he called me, ſpeaking in Latine) Beware and take heed
of thoſe Popiſh <hi>Catholiques,</hi> which are the Sinagogue of
<hi>Sathan,</hi> and thanke God that you are come out of <hi>Rome,</hi>
yea out of <hi>Babilon,</hi> who exalteth her ſelfe as a Queene, and
yet is that Strumpet ſpoken of in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> of <hi>S. Iohn.</hi>
And beleeue mee, <hi>Poperie</hi> is a bundle of Iniquitie: For,
haue you not ſeene how Curtizans are ſuffered &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
vnder the <hi>Popes</hi> noſe: yea, many of the <hi>Popes</hi> haue
had their Paramours. The Stewes and Brothell houſes are
euery where alowed. They boaſt of the Scriptures, and
yet they falſifie them, &amp; keepe them from the people, that
they may keepe them in blindneſſe. They iuſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelus,
and yet are moſt wicked. Their Clergie liue in all
manner of pleaſures of the fleſh. They hold it that a
Prieſt liuing in Adulterie &amp; Fornication, doth not ſinne
ſo much, as when he taketh a Wife. The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> (which is
the laſt Order amongſt them, and the worſt) doe hold it
meritorious to kill the King of the Countrie, if he be not
of their Religion: And therefore who ſoeuer holdeth the
grounds of <hi>Poperie,</hi> is in a moſt dangerous eſtate. But my
Sonne, ſearch the Scriptures, as our Sauiour Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth,
and they ſhall reueale vnto you the miſteries of
our Saluation, and diſcouer all their iuglings &amp; impieties.
I gaue him great thanks, and haue followed his counſell:
Since which time, I haue been ſtudious in the Scriptures,
and euery day I perceiue the groſſe errours of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes,</hi>
their counterfait Holineſſe, their deepe Hipocriſie,
and their great Iniquitie. Now therefore, my <hi>Thais,</hi> if you
tender your owne ſaluation, deteſt <hi>Poperie,</hi> and forſake
this ill kind of life that you haue led: yet there is hope, if
you earneſtly repent, God will receaue you; for hee
would not the death of Sinner, but rather that he ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:26219:10"/>
repent. To day therefore, whiles God doth admoniſh
you, heare his voyce, and harden not your hearts againſt
God; ſo ſhall you eſcape eternall condemnation.</p>

               <p>If this kind of life (my <hi>Sophronius</hi>) be ſo euill, if
it be ſo dangerous, and if ſo great a puniſhment doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
vnto it, I maruaile that it is ſo common; and I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naile
why ſome haue affirmed, that Fornication is but a

               <p>I told you, that the vniuerſalitie of a ſinne,
doth not make it to be no ſinne, nor excuſe a ſinne; for
we ought not to follow a multitude to doe euill. And
whereas ſome ſay, that it is but a tricke of Youth, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Fornication, &amp; that it is no fault; theſe are the words
of <hi>Heathen</hi> men, which had not the light of Gods word:
ſuch euill Words corrupt good Manners. But the Word
of God doth tell vs,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4. <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

forſake it. But alaſſe (<hi>Sophronius</hi>) how ſhall I liue? How

commit your ſelfe to <hi>Sophronius</hi> to be ordered? Will you
giue ouer this pleaſant and gainefull kind of life? No, no,
(my <hi>Thais</hi>) let not him deceiue you, to draw you vnto
Miſerie and Penurie. What can you more deſire, then
you haue? You haue the Pleaſures of this life, you haue
coſtly Garments, daintie Fare, Money at will, and the
companie of luſtie Gallants at commaund; and will you
leaue this kind of life, to waite and attend vpon others,
who are now attended vpon? Will you be at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of others, who may your ſelfe commaund? To
doe ſo, were extreame follie. And you <hi>Sophronius,</hi> who
ſeeme to be ſo altred from the man you were, when you
went from vs; I doubt not, but you will be as kind to
<hi>Thais:</hi> as you haue bin: for if you haue not her to vſe at

In ſooth ſir your yeeres are to young to teach me.
I meane not to forſake this kinde of life yet? I haue vſed
it too long to leaue it, I will endeauour to bring young
Gentlemen to <hi>Thais,</hi> to enioy their pleaſure: Should not
young men reioyce in their youth, &amp; cheere their hearts

that filthy courſe of life yet, take heed that you harden
not your heart againſt God, and ſo heape vp wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the day of wrath. And whereas you ſay, you haue
vſed it too long to leaue it herein, you ſhew how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a thing it is to accuſtome ones ſelfe to any euill; It
is an eaſie thing to fall into any ſinne, but it is hard to get
out of it. And whereas you ſay, you will be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to bring others to follie and to impietie, know this,
that thou ſhalt the more ſeueerely be puniſhed, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as thou doeſt not onely euill of thy ſelfe, but art a

deteſt that filthie and vncleane life whereunto thou
haſt brought mee: for had not GOD in mercie made
<hi>Sophronius</hi> an inſtrument to reclayme mee, I had good
cauſe to curſe thee; for thou dideſt draw mee to this
abhominable life. Thou art ſhee that did procure
mee to forſake my Parents, and their good counſaile,
to practiſe this odious and wicked courſe: therefore I
doe now defie thee, and all ſuch leawde Women as you,

Doe not you call mee Mother, and confeſſe your ſelfe

your mockes and ſcornes ſhall not much offende mee:
and though I promiſed to be ordered by you, I now
ſee my follie therein, and am ſorrie for it; and I know
that euill Promiſes are better broken then kept. And
though I called thee Mother, I ſee now (to my griefe) that
thou wert a wicked Mother to mee. And though you
dare mee, and feare mee with diſcouering my follie; I had
rather be hated of thee &amp; the World, &amp; poynted at, then
haue the diſpleaſure of Almightie God; but if he loue me,
(as I know he will) if I loue him, and hate all iniquitie, I
little care for the hatred of the World: For I now ſee
that they which are Gods friendes, ſhall be hated of the
World. And indeed, if you had your deſert, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
to be poynted at, and to be ſeueerely puniſhed
for intiſing of young Maydes vnto follie: and I will
