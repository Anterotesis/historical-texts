            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

past, the following established Articles are published by the Magistracy of
the most excellent Rivisors and Regulators of the Publick Revenues in the Exchequer,
and approved by the Senate the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Instant.</p>
            <p>THat there shall be put up an Adventure containing One hundred and fifty thousand
Tickets, or Bolletines, to be taken out in three Months time by all persons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
as well Subjects as Strangers, paying two Duckets for each Ticket or Bolletine,
which three Months shall begin from the day of publishing.</p>
            <p>To this Effect, a Booth shall be built in St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s place, wherein shall sit a Magistrate
deputed for this Undertaking, who shall subscribe and number the Tickets, or Bolletines,
that shall be given out to any Person or Persons, and shall answer to the Name or Sentence
each Person shall please to add to the Number (if they shall think fit to add any) for
their further satisfaction; And this shall likewise be noted in the printed Books to be made
for this purpose only, so that they shall particularly answer each Bolletine or Ticket of the
said Undertaking, and shall be delivered to whom ever shall pay the two Ducats.</p>
            <p>There shall be sent a proportion of Tickets and Books to the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> for the easier
and sooner effecting the said Undertaking, where the same method shall be used as in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and at the time expired the Books and Monies shall be sent to <hi>Venice</hi> to the Persons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the keeping of each.</p>
            <p>The Money which shall be received by the Payments for the said Tickets, shall be
kept in a Chest by it self by the Person appointed, to be punctually paid to those who
shall have the benefitted Tickets.</p>
            <p>As soon as the 150000 Tickets are compleated, there shall be the like number of
Tickets printed and numbred, that shall answer to those that shall have been given
out; and also the Notes of the Books, which Tickets shall be locked up in a Vessel or
Urn, in the presence of the most excellent Assistants deputed to oversee the drawing;
and this shall be kept by the said Assistants, so that there shall be no fear of Alteration,
or any Cheat imaginable.</p>
            <p>There shall also be prepared the like number of Blank Tickets, among which
shall be the Four hundred and ten benefitted Tickets, as hereunder declared,
and shall be put in another vessel or Urn, and those, as well as the others numbred, shall
be put each of them into an Iron Box, and the day shall be appointed to begin to draw
them, which shall be publickly proclaimed, and continue daily and publick in the Hall of
the most Serene great Councel, always with the assistance of those that shall be decreed
for it.</p>
            <p>The benefitted Tickets that shall be put in the said Vessel, and printed with the same,
declared thereon, shall from time to time as they are drawn, be noted (by a Secretary)
with their numbers in a Book kept apart for that purpose; which Note shall be underwrit
by one of the Assistants at the drawing, the said Book to be kept and shewed in publick or
private.</p>
            <p>The Money of the benefitted Tickets to be paid to them or their lawful Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives,
and immediately to whomsoever shall present the Tickets given out the
following day that they shall have been so fortunate; and this Money shall not be liable
to be stopt or sequestred by any pretence whatsoever in Law, or the like, either publick or
private, and this by a particular Priviledge. This also shall extend to discharge the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
that by the Publick shall be paid to the Register.</p>

               <head>Given by the Magistracy of the most excellent Revisors

the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of March, 1693.</head>
               <p>IN IMITATION now of this <hi>Venetian</hi> Adventure, but without the Possibility of
one third of the Profit that will be got by it there, and with much more Advantage
to Adventurers, Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> the Groom-Porter, at the special Request and Desire of
many eminent Merchants, and others (so fond of the Matter, that they return Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Venice</hi> to invest in those Tickets, which would never be done, if it might be on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
terms here) does in the same manner propose the giving out Fifty thousand
Tickets, at Ten shillings per Ticket, to be in like manner drawn at the end of Four Months,
to be reckoned from the First day of this <hi>Iuly</hi> 1693. or sooner, if the same shall be
sooner filled up against so many Blanks, wanting only Two Hundred and Fifty,
which are to be Benefitted Tickets, and in value as herein after exprest. And for the
better convenience of dispensing the Tickets for the ease of the Adventurers, and for
their full satisfaction that the Money laid down for these Tickets shall again be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid
them, if the Tickets should not be drawn in the time, upon giving back only
their Tickets to the Goldsmiths who have signed the same; And that those to whom
Fortune dispenses these Benefitted Tickets, whether absent or present, may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
sure accordingly to have the Money <hi>in specie,</hi> as herein after exprest. And that all
possible fairness, in seeing the Benefitted Tickets duly put in, and duly drawn out as they
ought, and every other thing done that ought to be done in this Case, wherein the method
at <hi>Venice</hi> made use of, for signing and giving out Tickets both in City and Country, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
of them in Books printed on purpose, and numbred just to answer the Tickets given
but, for which Ten shillings apiece must be paid, shall and is truly intended to be the
same as near as possible can be, that shall be made use of here; with this difference only,
That whereas at <hi>Venice</hi> the State is to answer for the just and well-performing of all things
in the Articles printed, and for so doing, is allowed above 33 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> here the Groom-Porter,
who sets up this Adventure, for all his Cost, Care, Pains and Management, is
allowed only 10 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and no more; and in stead of Officers deputed by that Senate
to manage the matter to the satisfaction of all Parties concerned, has and does hereby
depute <hi>Richard Lascells</hi> near <hi>Charing-Cross, Ioseph Fells</hi> by the <hi>New-Exchange, Iohn Coggs</hi>
against St. <hi>Clements</hi> Church in the <hi>Strand,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Child</hi> and <hi>Richard Hoare</hi> in <hi>Fleetstreet,

Receivers of all Monies to be so paid in for Tickets, and to sign and give out Tickets for
the same; who have undertaken to be answerable for the Money so by them to be received,
and to answer and pay the same as herein before or herein after expressed. And Sir <hi>Benjamin

which there is nothing to be ordered or done without the Concurrence of Five at least
of the Persons before-named; so that there will be no room left to doubt of Justness
and Fairness throughout the whole managing of it; and nothing, ever like this, was
at so small Advantage proposed.</p>
               <p>And to answer the 25000 <hi>l.</hi> so to be taken for 50000 Tickets to be given out at Ten
shillings apiece, there will be 250 Benefitted Tickets to make up the said 25000 <hi>l.</hi> aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> only to be allowed for the Trouble and Charge; and as soon as the
50000 Tickets are given out and compleated, the Overseers before-named shall meet
and call for the Books, and see all the Money so placed as to be ready to be paid on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
to such Persons or their lawful Representatives as shall present the Benefitted
Tickets; and the same shall be accordingly so paid the following day after they have been
so fortunate; and the said Overseers shall then also appoint the Day to begin to draw these

from which Book the outermost Ticket Signed by the Goldsmith shall be first cut, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Person that so pays the Ten shillings for it; the next, which will be just like the
Tickets given out, is to be cut, and put into a strong Box, whence it is to be drawn; and
then the third, just the same with the other two, will remain still in the said Book, so
that to whoever Chance gives a Ticket that entitles him to a Benefit, must bring or send
the said Ticket to the place where the same shall be drawn, and there it must answer
(to prevent all mistakes) the Ticket of the same number drawn, which will likewise
answer that that's left in the Book, and it so appearing to do, the Benefit to be forthwith
delivered.</p>

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48860:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And now,</p>
               <p>The better to demonstrate how this is to be drawn and done,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note.</hi> All Tickets in the second place to be cut out of the Book, as aforesaid, just num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
and marked like those given out, are, in the presence of the Managers, to be put up
into a large Glass to be sealed and lockt up in an Iron, or other strong Box, and there
Jumbled together, and kept so lockt up, 'till 'tis drawn, and the Blanks, with the 250
Benefitted Tickets in like manner, in the presence of the said Managers, are to be put into
another such like Glass, to be also sealed up and lockt in another strong Box, and there
to so remain, 'till drawn out, which is to be done thus:</p>
               <p>An Oval Table is to be set in the great Room in <hi>Freemans-Yard</hi> in <hi>Cornhil, London,</hi>
round which, the Managers and Clerks in order are to sit, and at one End shall be placed
the Box wherein are the Tickets so numbred and markt, as aforesaid; and at the other
End of the Table the other such Box, wherein are such Benefitted Tickets and Blanks,
out of both which, one by one, by some Strangers, they are all to be drawn out thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> From among the Tickets so numbred and markt, one shall be drawn, and then
from the Blanks and Benefitted Tickets another, which is to be before all the Company
opened; and if it does prove a Blank, the said Blank and numbred Ticket at the same time
drawn shall without more ado be put together into a Hole in the middle of the Table
for that purpose provided: But if it does prove a Benefit, that and the numbred Ticket
shall be both filed up together; but first shall be noted (by the Clerk) with the said num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Ticket at the same time drawn, in a Book kept apart for that purpose, which Note
shall be underwrit by two of the Overseers then present, the said Book to be kept and
shewed in publick and private, and Printed as soon as all the Tickets are drawn out,
that all Persons may see to what Number each Benefit does belong, and so accordingly
come for the same: And all this to prevent, as aforesaid, Mistakes; And, that no possible
Suspition may remain of any foul Play in this Thing,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note.</hi> The numbred Tickets as aforesaid, being put in one Glass, and the Blanks and
Benefitted Tickets in another, the said Glasses sealed up just before the Tickets are going
to be drawn, shall be took out of the strong Boxes, and showed to the Company present,
with the Numbred Tickets, Blanks and Benefitted Tickets in them, and be then shaked
and jumbled together, that there may be no placing of either; which Glasses shall then
afterwards be again placed in the strong Boxes, from whence all shall be drawn.</p>
               <p>In short, whoever is any way possest of any one of these Numbred Tickets, so signed by
any one of the Eleven Goldsmiths aforesaid, will this way be certain, that another such
Ticket so Numbred and Marked as that he is possest of, shall for him be put in and drawn
at this Adventure; where, whether absent or present, he will have an equal Chance with
the rest for the Benefits proposed; and be sure that what Sum of Money soever Good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
this way shall design him, on produce of his Ticket that entitles him to it, shall
forthwith be paid at demand, free from all Charge, or any Deduction whatever.</p>
               <p>All Persons are desired to take Notice, That although near four Months are allowed for
receiving the Money, and giving out Tickets, 'tis however intended that the same shall be
drawn as soon as the Number is compleat; which is hoped before <hi>Bartholomew-</hi>Day.</p>
