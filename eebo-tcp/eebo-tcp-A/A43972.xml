            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IF in time, as in place there were Degrees of high and low; I verily believe that the higheſt of time, would be that which paſſeth betwixt, 1640, and 1660. For he that thence as from the Divils Mountain, ſhould have looked upon the World, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Actions of Men, eſpecially in <hi>England,</hi> might have had a proſpect of all kinds of Injuſtice, and of all kinds of Folly that the world could afford, and how they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by their Hypocriſy and ſelf-conceit, whereof the one is double Iniquity, and the other double Folly.</p>

                  <p>I ſhould be glad to behold the Proſpect. You that have lived in that time, and in that part of your Age; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Men uſed to ſee beſt into good and evil; I pray you ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>In the year 1640. The Government of <hi>England</hi> was Monarchical, and the King that reigned, <hi>Charles</hi> the I. of that Name, holding the Soveraignty by Right of a Diſcent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued above 600 years; and from a much longer Diſcent King of <hi>Sotland,</hi> and from the Time of his Anceſtors <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a man that wanted no Vertue, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Body or Mind, nor endeavour'd any thing more,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66130:3"/>than to diſcharge his duty towards his God, in the well-governing of his Subjects.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>How could he than miſcarry, having in every County ſo many Train'd-bands, as would (put together) have made an Army of 60000 Men, and divers Magazines of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, in places fortified.</p>
                  <p>If thoſe Souldiers had been (as they and all others of his Subjects ought to have been) at his Majeſties command: The Peace and Happineſs of the three Kingdoms, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as it was left by K. <hi>James;</hi> but the people were corrupted generally, and Diſobedient Perſons eſteemed the beſt Patriots.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>But ſure, there were Men enough, beſides thoſe that were ill-affected, to have made an Army ſufficient for to have kept the People from uniting into a Body able to oppoſe him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly, if the King had had Money, I think he might have had Souldiers enough in <hi>England;</hi> for there were very few of the common People that cared much for either of the Cauſes, but would have taken any ſide for pay and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: But the Kings Treaſure was very low, and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that pretended the Peoples eaſe from Taxes, and other ſpecious things, had the Command of the Purſes of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and of moſt Cities and Corporate Towns in <hi>England,</hi> and of many particular Perſons beſides.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>But how comes the People to be ſo corrupted, and what kind of People were they that did ſo ſeduce them?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>The Seducers were of divers ſorts. One ſort were <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Miniſters</hi> (as they called themſelves) of Chriſt; and ſometimes in their Sermons to the People Gods Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, pretending to have a Right from God to govern every one his Pariſh, and their Aſſembly, the whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There were a very great number, though not comparable to the other, which notwithſtanding that the Popes Power in <hi>England,</hi> both Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical had been by Act of Parliament aboliſhed, did ſtill retain a belief, that we ought to be governed by the Pope; whom they pretended to be the Vicar of Chriſt, and in the Right of Chriſt to be the Governour of all Chriſtian People, and theſe were known by the Name of <hi>PAPISTS,</hi> as the <hi>Miniſters</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66130:3"/>I mentioned before, were commonly called <hi>PRESBY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERIANS.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There were not a few, who in the beginning of the Troubles were not diſcovered, but ſhortly after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves for a Liberty in Religion, and thoſe of different Opinions one from another: Some of them (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would have all Congregations free and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon one another) were called <hi>INDEPENDANTS;</hi> others that held Baptiſm to Infants, and ſuch as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not into what they are Baptized to be ineffectual, were called therefore <hi>ANABAPTISTS:</hi> Others that held, that Chriſts Kingdom was at this time to begin upon Earth. were called <hi>FIFTH-MONARCHY-MEN;</hi> beſides divers other Sects as <hi>QUAKERS, ADAMITES,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe names and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Doctrines I do not very well remember, and theſe were the Enemies, which aroſe againſt his Majeſty from the private Interpretation of the Scripture expoſed to every Mans ſcanning in his Mother Tongue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There were an exceeding great number of Men of the greater ſort, that had been ſo educated, as that in their youth having read the Books written by famous men of the Ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealths, concerning their Policy and great Actions, in which Book the Popular Government was extol'd by that glorious Name of Liberty, and Monarchy diſgraced by the Name of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny: they became thereby in love with their form of Government: And out of theſe men were choſen the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the <hi>HOUSE OF COMMONS:</hi> Or if they were not the greateſt part, yet by advantage of their Eloquence were always able to ſway the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The City of <hi>London,</hi> and other great Towns of Trade, having in admiration the proſperity of the low Countries, after they had revolted from their Monarch, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were inclined to think, that the like change of Government here would to them produce the like proſperity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There were a very great Number, that had either waſted their fortunes, or thought them too mean for the good part? they thought were in themſelves: and more there were that had able bodies, and ſaw no means how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66130:4"/>to get their Bread: Theſe longed for a War, and hoped to maintain themſelves hereafter by the lucky chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a Party to ſide with, and conſequently did for the moſt part ſerve under them, that had greateſt plenty of Money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The People in general were ſo ignorant of their Duties, as that not one perhaps of 1000. knew what Right any man had to command him, or what neceſſity there was of King or Commonwealth, for which he was to part with his Money againſt his will, but thought himſelf to be ſo much Maſter of whatſoever he poſſeſt, that it could not be taken from him upon any pretence of Common Safety without his own conſent. <hi>King,</hi> they thought was but a Title of the higheſt honour, which <hi>Gentlemen, Knight, Baron, Earl, Duke,</hi> were but ſteps to aſcend to with the help of Riches, and had no Rule of Equity, but Precedents and Cuſtom, and he was thought wiſeſt and fitteſt to be choſen for a Parliament, who was worſt averſe to the granting of Subſidies, or other publick Payments.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>In ſuch a Conſtitution of People, methinks the King is already outed of his Government: ſo as they need not have taken Arms for it: For I cannot imagine, how the King ſhould come by any means to reſiſt them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>There was indeed very great difficulty in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but of that point you will, be better informed in the purſuit of this Narration.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>But I deſire to know firſt the ſeveral grounds of the Pretences, both of the <hi>Pope</hi> and of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> by which they claim a Right to govern us, as they do in chief, and after that, from whence, and when crept in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of that <hi>Long Parliament</hi> for a <hi>Democraſie.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they challenge this Right from a Text in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. and other like Texts, according to the Old <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation, in theſe words, <hi>And he that out of Pride ſhall refuſe to obey the Commandment of that Prieſt, which ſhall at that time Miniſter before the Lord thy God, that man ſhall, by the Sentence of the Judge, be put to Death:</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were the people of God then, ſo is all Chriſtendom the People of God now, they infer from thence, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom they pretend to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66130:4"/>be High Prieſt of all Chriſtian People, ought alſo to be obeyed in all his Decrees by all Chriſtians upon pain of Death: Again, whereas in the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>all Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth, go therefore and teach all Nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, and teach them to obſerve all thoſe things, that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you,</hi> from thence they infer, that the Command of the Apoſtles was to be obeyed, and by conſequence the Nations were bound to be governed by them, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Prince of the Apoſtles, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and by his Succeſſors the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>For the Text in the Old Teſtament, I do not ſee how the Commandment of God to the <hi>Jews</hi> to obey their Prieſts can be interpreted to have the like force in the Caſe of the other Nations Chriſtian, more then upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Unchriſtian: For all the World are Gods People, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we alſo grant, that a King cannot of an Infidel be made Chriſtian without making himſelf ſubject to the Laws of that Apoſtle of Prieſt, or Miniſter, that ſhall convert him. The <hi>Jews</hi> were a peculiar people of God, a Sacerdotal Kingdom, and bound to no other Law, but what firſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and afterwards every High Prieſt did go and receive imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Mouth of God in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Ark, and in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> of the Temple. And for the Text in St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> I know the words in the Goſpel are not, <hi>Go teach,</hi> but <hi>Go and make Diſciples;</hi> and that there is a great difference between a Subject and a Diſciple, and between teaching and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding; and if ſuch Texts as theſe muſt be ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, why do not Chriſtian Kings lay down their Titles of Majeſty and Soveraignty, and call themſelves the <hi>Popes</hi> Lieutenants? But the Doctors of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> ſeem to decline that Title of <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> in their diſtinction of <hi>Power Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> but this Diſtinction I do not vell underſtand.</p>

                  <p>By <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> they mean the Power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Points of Faith, and to be Judges in the Inner Court of Conſcience of Moral Duties, and of a Power to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66130:5"/>puniſh thoſe men that obey not their Precepts by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Cenſure, that is, by Excommunication; and this Power, they ſay, the <hi>Pope</hi> hath immediately from Chriſt, without dependance upon any King or Sovereign Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, whoſe Subjects they be that ſtand Excommunicate: But for the Power Temporal, which conſiſts in judging and puniſhing thoſe actions, that are done againſt the Civil Law, they ſay, they do not pretend to it directly, but onely indirectly; that is to ſay, as far forth as ſuch actions tend to the hinderance or advancement of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia.</hi>

                  <p>What Power then is left to Kings and other Civil Sovereigns, which the <hi>Pope</hi> may not pretend to be <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ad Spiritualia?</hi>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>None, or very little; and this Power the <hi>Pope</hi> not onely pretends to in all Chriſtendom, but ſome of his Biſhops alſo in their ſeveral Dioceſſes, <hi>jure Divino;</hi> that is, immediately from Chriſt, without deriving it from the <hi>Pope.</hi>

                  <p>But what if a man refuſe Obedience to this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Biſhops,</hi> what harm can Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication do him, eſpecially if he be a Subject of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Sovereign?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Very great harm; for by the <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it to the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> he ſhall be puniſhed ſufficiently.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>He were in an ill caſe then that adventured to write or ſpeak in defence of the Civil Power, that muſt be pun ſhed by him, whoſe Rights he defended like <hi>Uzza,</hi> that was ſlain, becauſe he Would needs, unbidden, put forth his hand to keep the Ark from falling. But what if a whole Nation ſhould revolt from the <hi>Pope</hi> at once? what effect could Excommunication have upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Why they ſhould have no more Maſs ſaid by any of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Prieſts. Beſides, the <hi>Pope</hi> would have no more to with them, but caſt them off; and ſo they would be in the ſame caſe as if a Nation ſhould be caſt by their King, and left to be governed by themſelves, or whom they would.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66130:5"/>
                  <p>B. This would not ſo much be taken for a puniſhment to the People as to the King; and therefore when a Pope Excommunicates a whole Nation, me-thinks he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Excommunicates himſelf than them. But I pray you tell me what were the Rights the Pope pretended to in Kingdoms of other Princes?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Firſt, and exemption of all Prieſts, Friers, and Monks in Criminal Cauſes, from the Cognizance of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Judges. Secondly, Collation of Benefices on whom he pleaſed, Native or Stranger; and Exaction of Tenths, Fruits, and other Payments. Thirdly, Appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> in all Cauſes, where the Church could pretend to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. Fourthly, To be the Supreme Judge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lawfulneſs of Marriage, (<hi>i, e.</hi> concerning the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Succeſſion of Kings) and to have the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of all Cauſes concerning Adultery and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Fifthly, a power of abſolving Subjects of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of their Oaths of Fidelity to their Lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, when the Pope ſhould think fit, for the extirpation of Hereſie.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>This power of abſolving Subjects of their obedience, as alſo that other of being Judges of Manners and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is as abſolute a Sovereignty as if poſſible to be; and conſequently there muſt be two Kingdoms in one and the ſame Nation, and ſo no man be able to know which of his Maſters he muſt obey.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>For my part, I ſhould rather obey that Maſter that had the Right of making Laws, and of inflicting Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than him that pretendeth onely to a right of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Canons, that is to ſay, Rules: and no Right of Co-action, or otherwiſe Puniſhing, but by Excommunication.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>But the Pope pretends alſo, that his Canons are Laws; and for puniſhing, can there be a greater than Excommunication, ſuppoſing it true (as the Pope ſaith it is) that he that dies Excommunicate is damn'd; which ſuppoſition, it ſeems, you believe not, elſe you would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have choſen to obey the Pope, that could caſt your
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66130:6"/>Body and Soul into Hell, than the King that can onely kill the Body.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſay true; for it were very uncharitable in me to believe, that all <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> (except a few Papiſts) that have been born and called Hereticks, ever ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be damn'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>But for thoſe that die Excommunicate in the Church of <hi>England</hi> at this day, do you not think them alſo damn'd? and he that is Excommunicate for diſobedience to the King's Law, either Spiritual or Temporal, is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate for ſin, and therefore if he die Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and without deſire of reconciliation, he dies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent; you ſee what follows. But to die in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Precepts and Doctrine of thoſe men, that have no Authority or Juriſdiction over us, is quite another caſe, and bringeth no ſuch danger with it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>But what is this Hereſie which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo cruelly perſecutes, as to depoſe Kings that do not, when they are bidden turn all Hereticks out of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Hereſie is a Word, which when it is uſed without paſſion, ſignifies a private Opinion; ſo the different Sect of the old Philoſophers, <hi>Academians, Peripateticks, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans, Stoicks,</hi> &amp;c. were called Hereſie: But in the Chriſtian Church, there was, in the ſignification of that word, comprehended, a ſinful oppoſition to him that was chief Judge of Doctrines in order to the Salvation of mens Souls; and conſequently Hereſie may be ſaid to bear the ſame relation to the Power Spiritual, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion doth to the Power Temporal, and is ſuitably to be perſecuted by him that will preſerve a Power Spiritual, and dominion over mens Conſciences</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>It would be very well (becauſe we are all of us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to read the holy Scriptures, and bound to make them the Rule of our actions both publick and private) that Hereſie were by ſome Law defined, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Opinions ſet forth, for which a man were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and puniſhed as a Heretick; for elſe, not onely men of mean capacity, but even the wiſeſt and devouteſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66130:6"/>Chriſtian may fall into Hereſie, without any will to oppoſe the Church; for the Scriptures are hard, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations different of different men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>The meaning of the word Hereſie is by Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in Act of Parliament, in the Firſt Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> wherein it is ordained, that the Perſons who had by the Queens Letters Patents, the Authority Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual (meaning the High Commiſſion) ſhall not have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Adjudge any matter or cauſe to be Hereſie, but only ſuch as heretofore have been Adjudged to be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, by the Authority of the Canonical Scriptures, or by the Firſt 4 General Councils, or by any other General Council, where the ſame was declared Hereſie by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and plain words of the ſaid Canonical Scriptures or ſuch as hereafter ſhall be adjudged Hereſie, by the High Court of Parliament of this Realm; with the aſſent of the Clergy in their Convocation.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>It ſeems therefore, if there ariſe any new Error that hath not been yet declared Hereſie, (and many ſuch may ariſe) it cannot be Judged Hereſie without a Parliament; for how foul ſoever the error be, it cannot have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Hereſie, neither in the Scriptures nor in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, becauſe it was never before heard of; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there can be no Error unleſs it fall within the compaſs of Blaſphemy againſt God, or Treaſon againſt the King) for which a man can in Equity be puniſhed: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides who can tell what is declared by the Scripture, which every man is allowed to read and interpret to hemſelf? nay more, what Proteſtant either of the Laity or Clergy (if every General Council can be a competent Judge of Hereſie) is not already condemned; for divers Councils have declar'd a great many of our Doctrines to be Hereſie (as they pretend) upon the Authority of the Scriptures.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>What are thoſe points, that the firſt four General Counſels have declared Hereſie?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>General Councel</hi> held at <hi>Nicaea</hi> declared all to be <hi>Hereſie,</hi> which was contrary to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. Upon occaſion of the Hereſie of <hi>Arrius,</hi> which was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Divinity of Chriſt, the <hi>Second General Councel</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:66130:7"/>held at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> declar'd Hereſie the Doctrine of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius,</hi> which was that the Holy Ghoſt was created. The <hi>Third Councel</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Epheſius,</hi> condemned the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> that there were two perſons in Chriſt. The <hi>Fourth</hi> held at <hi>Calcedon</hi> condemned the Error of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches,</hi> that there was but one nature in Chriſt. I know of no other Points condemned in theſe four Councels, but ſuch as concern Church-Government, or the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines taught by other Men in other words: And theſe Councels were all called by the Emperors, and by them their Decrees confirmed, at the Petition of the Councels themſelves.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſee by this, that both the Calling of the Council, and the confirmation of their Doctrine and Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had no obligatory force, but from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Emperor; how comes it then to paſs, that they take upon them now a Legiſlative Power, and ſay their Canons are Laws? That Text, <hi>all Power is given to me in Heaven and Earth,</hi> had the ſame force then as it hath now, and conferred a Legiſlative Power on the Councils not only over Chriſtian men, but over all Nations in the world.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>They ſay no; for the Power they pretend to is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from this, that when a King was converted from <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> he did by that very Submiſſion to the Biſhop that converted him, ſubmit to the Biſhops Government, and became one of his ſheep, which Right therefore he could not have over any Nation, that was not Chriſtian.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Did <hi>Silveſter</hi> (which was <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great converted by him) tell the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror his New Diſciple before hand, that if he became a Chriſtian he muſt become the Popes Subject.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>I believe not, for it is likely enough, if he had told him ſo plainly, or but made him ſuſpect it, he would either have been not Chriſtian at all, or, but a Counterfeit one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>But if he did not tell him ſo, and that plainly it was foul play, not only in a Prieſt, but in any Chriſtian. And for this Derivation of their Right from the Emperors conſent,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66130:7"/>it proceeds only from this, that they dare not challenge a Legiſlative power, nor call their Canons, Laws in any Kingdom in Chriſtendom; farther than the Kings make them ſo: But in <hi>Peru,</hi> when <hi>Atabalipa</hi> was King, the <hi>Fryer</hi> told him, that Chriſt being King of all the World had given the dipoſing of all the Kingdoms there to the Pope: And that the Pope had given <hi>Peru</hi> to the <hi>Roman Emperor Charles</hi> the 5. and required <hi>Atabalipa</hi> to reſign it, and for refuſing it, ſeiſed upon his Perſon by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army there preſent, and murdered him: You ſee by this how much they claim, when they have power to make it good.</p>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>When began the Popes to take this Authority upon them firſt?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>After the Inundation of Northern People had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the Weſtern Parts of the Empire, and poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Italy,</hi> the People of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves, as well in Temporals as Spirituals to their Biſhop; and then firſt was the Pope a Temporal Prince, and ſtood no more in ſo great fear of the Emperors, which lived far off at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> In this time it was that the Pope began by pretence of his Power Spiritual, to encroach upon the Temporal Rights of all other Princes of the Weſt, and ſo continued gaining upon them, till his Power was at the higheſt, in that 300 years or thereabout, which paſſed between the time of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 3. and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. For in this time Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> 1. depoſed <hi>Chilpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> then King of <hi>France,</hi> and gave the Kingdom to one of his Subjects <hi>Pepin:</hi> And <hi>Pepin</hi> took from the <hi>Lombards</hi> a great part of their Territory, and gave it to the Church: Shortly after the <hi>Lombards</hi> having recovered their Eſtate, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great retook it, and gave it to the Church again, and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 3. made <hi>Charles</hi> Emperor.</p>
                  <p>B. But what Right did the Pope there pretend for the creating of an Emperor?</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>He pretended the Right of being Chriſts Vicar, and what Chriſt could give, his Vicar, might give; and you know that Chriſt was King of all the World.</p>

                  <p>Yes, as God, and ſo he gives all the Kingdoms of the World, which nevertheleſs, proceed from the conſent of People either for fear; or hope.</p>

                  <p>You ſee by this the Emperor never acknowledged this gift of God was the gift of the Pope, but maintained the Popedom was the gift of the Emperor; but in proceſs of time by the negligence of the Emperor (for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Kings makes them that they cannot eaſily deſcend into the obſcure and narrow Mines of an ambitious Clergy,) they found means to make the people believe, there was a Power in the Pope and Clergy: which they ought to ſubmit unto, rather than to the Commands of their own King, whenſoever it ſhould come into Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, and to that end deviſed and decreed many new Articles of Faith, to the diminution of the Authority of Kings, and to the disjunction of them and their Subjects, and to a cloſer adherence of their Subjects to the Church
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66130:8"/>of <hi>Rome's</hi> Articles, either not at all found in, or not well founded upon the Scripture, as firſt, That it ſhould not be lawful fur a Prieſt to Marry. What influence could that have upon the power of Kings? do you not ſee that by this, the King muſt of neceſſity either want the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and therewith a great part of the Reverence due to him from the moſt Religious part of his Subjects, or elſe want Lawful Heirs to ſucceed in? by which means being not taken for the Head of the Church, he was ſure in any controverſie between him and the Pope, that his Subjects would be againſt him.</p>

                  <p>Is not a Chriſtian King as much a Biſhop now, as the Heathen Kings were of old? for amongſt them, <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus</hi> was a name common to all Kings; is not he a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop now, to whom god hath committed the charge of all the Souls of his Subjects, both of the Laity and of the Clergy? And though he be in relation to our Saviour, who is the chief Paſtour of Sheep, yet compared to his own Subjects, they are all Sheep, both Laick and Clergy, and he the onely Shepherd; and ſeeing a Chriſtian Biſhop is but a Chriſtian endued with power to govern the Clergy; it follows, that every Chriſtian King is not onely a Biſhop but an Archbiſhop, and his whole Kingdom his Dioceſs: And though it were granted, that Impoſition of hands were neceſſary for a Prieſt, yet ſeeing Kings have the power of Government of the Clergy that are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, even before Baptiſm, the Baptiſm it ſelf where he is received as a Chriſtian, is a ſufficient Impoſition of Hands, ſo that whereas before he was a Biſhop, now he is a Chriſtian Biſhop.</p>

                  <p>For my part I agree with you, this prohibition of Marriage to Prieſts came in about the time of Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>William</hi> the Firſt, King of <hi>England,</hi> by which means the Pope had in <hi>England,</hi> what with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and what with Regular Prieſts, a great many luſty Batchelors at his ſervice. Secondly, that <hi>Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion</hi> to a Prieſt was neceſſary to Salvation. 'Tis true, that before that time, Confeſſion to a Prieſt was uſual, and performed for the moſt part (by him that Confeſſed)

                  <p>Within the ſame time, that is, between the time of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third of <hi>England,</hi> began their ſecond Policy, which was, to bring Religion into an Art, and thereby to maintain all their Degrees of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church by Diſputation, not onely from the Scriptures, but alſo from the Philoſophy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> both Moral and Natural; and to that end the Pope exhorted the ſaid Emperor by Letters, to erect Schools of all kinds of Literature, and from thence began the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Univerſities; for not long after, the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities began in <hi>Paris,</hi> and in <hi>Oxford.</hi> It is true, that there were Schools in <hi>England</hi> before that time, in ſeveral places, for the inſtruction of Children in the Latin Tongue, that is to ſay, in the Tongue of the Church; but for an Univerſity of Learning there was none erected till that time, though it be not unlikely there might be then ſome that taught Philoſophy, Logick, and other Arts, in divers Monaſteries, the Monks having little elſe to do but to ſtudy. After ſome Colledges were built to that purpoſe, it was not long before many more were added to them by the Devotion of Princes and Biſhops, and other wealthy men, and the Diſcipline therein was confirmed by the Popes that then were, and abundance of Scholars ſent thither by their friends to ſtudy, as to a place from whence the way was open and eaſie to preferment both in Church and Commonwealth. The profit the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them, and in effect received, was the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Pope's Doctrine, and of his Authority over Kings and their Subjects, by School Divines, who ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make good many points of Faith incomprehenſible, and calling in the Philoſophy of <hi>Aristotle</hi> to their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, wrote great Books of School Divinity, which no man elſe, nor they themſelves, were able to underſtand, as any man may conceive that ſhall conſider the writing of <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> or <hi>Scotus,</hi> or of him that wrote Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon him, or of <hi>Suarez,</hi> or of any other School-Divines
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66130:9"/>of later times, which kind of Learning neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hath been much admired by two ſorts of men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prudent enough. The one of which ſorts were thoſe that were already Devoted, and really affectionate to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, for they believed the Doctrine before, but admired the Arguments, becauſe they underſtood them not, and yet found the Concluſions to their mind; The other ſort were negligent men, that had rather admire with others, than take the pains to examine, ſo that all ſorts of people were fully reſolved that both the Doctrine was true, and the Pope's Authority no more then that was due to him. I ſee that a Chriſtian King, or State, how well ſoever provided he be, of Money and Arms, (where the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſuch authority) will have but a hard match of it, for want of men; for their Subjects will hardly be drawn into the Field, and fight with courage againſt their Conſciences.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66130:10"/>been in love with Parliaments, were not diſpleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> beginning a little before, was now by a great many men of the greateſt Judgments ſo well received, as that there was no hope to reſtore the Pope to his Power by Rebellion. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Revenue of the <hi>Abbies</hi> and all other <hi>Religious Houſes,</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hereby into the <hi>Kings</hi> hands, and by him being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of to the moſt eminent Gentlemen in every County, could not but make them do their beſt to confirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the poſſeſſion of them. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> was of a nature quick, and ſevere in the Puniſhing of ſuch as ſhould be the firſt to oppoſe his deſigns. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion from abroad, if the Pope had given the Kingdom to another Prince, it had been in vain, for <hi>England</hi> is another manner of Kingdom than <hi>Navarre,</hi> beſides the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces were imployed at that time one againſt another; and though they had been at leaſure, they would have found perhaps no better ſucceſs than the <hi>Spaniard</hi> found afterwards in 1588.

                  <p>No, I do not find the Biſhops did many of them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the King; for having no power without him it had been great imprudence to provoke his Anger; there was beſides a Controverſiy in thoſe times between the Pope and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66130:10"/>the Biſhops, moſt of which did maintain, that they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed their Juriſdiction Epiſcopal in the Right of God, as immediately as the Pope himſelf did exerciſe the ſame over the whole Church; and becauſe they ſaw that by this Act of the King in Parliament they were to hold their power no more of the Pope, and never thought of holding it of the King, they were perhaps better content, to let the Act of Parliament paſs in the reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> had taken ſuch great root in <hi>England</hi> that they threw out a great many of the Pope's new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, with Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſucceeding him, reſtored again, together with all that had been aboliſhed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, ſaving (that which could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored) the Religious Houſes, and the Biſhops, and Clergy of King <hi>Henry</hi> were partly burnt for Hereticks, partly fled, and partly recanted; and they that fled betook themſelves to thoſe places beyond Sea, where the Reformed Religion was either protected, or not proſecuted, who after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> returned again to favour and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that reſtored the Religion of her Brother King <hi>Edward,</hi> and ſo it had continued to this day excepting the interruption made in this late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and other <hi>Democratical</hi> men: But thus the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion were now caſt out by the Law, yet there were abundance of people, and many of them of the Nobility that ſtill retained the Religion of their Anceſtors, who as they were not much moleſted in points of Conſcience, ſo they were not by their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination very troubleſom to the Civil Government, but by the ſecret practice of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and other Emiſſaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they were made leſs quiet than they ought to have been; and ſome of them to venture upon the moſt horrid Act that ever had been heard of before, I mean upon the <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon,</hi> and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> have been looked upon as men that would not be ſorry for any diſorders here that might poſſibly make way to the reſtoring of the Pope's Authority: and therefore I named them for one of the diſtempers of the State of <hi>England</hi> in the time of our late King <hi>Charles.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, for the matter of their Sermons, becauſe the anger of the People in the late <hi>Roman</hi> Uſurpation was then freſh, they ſaw there could be nothing more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with them, than to Preach againſt ſuch other Points of the Romiſh Religion as the Biſhops had not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that ſo receding farther from Popery than they did, they might with glory to themſelves, leave a ſuſpition on the Biſhops, as men not well purged from Idolatry.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:66130:13"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, before their Sermons, their Prayer was, or ſeemed to be, <hi>ex tempore,</hi> which they pretended to be dictated by the Spirit of God within them, and many of the People believed, or ſeemed to believe it; or any man might ſee, that they did not take care before-hand what they ſhould ſay in their Prayers: and from hence came a diſlike of the <hi>Common-Prayer-book,</hi> that men might not ſee to what they were to ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They did never in their Sermons, or but lightly, againſt the Lucrative Vices of men of Trade or Handicraft, ſuch as are feigning, lying, couzening, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and other uncharitableneſs, (except want of charity to their Paſtor, and to the Faithful) which was a great eaſe to the generality of Citizens, and the Inhabitants of Market-Towns, and no little profit to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, By preaching up an opinion, that men were to be aſſured of their ſalvation, by the teſtimony of their own private ſpirit, meaning the holy Ghoſt dwelling within them: And from this opinion, the People, that found in themſelves a ſufficient hatred towards the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and an ability to repeat the Sermons of theſe men at their coming home, made no doubt, but that they had all that was neceſſary, how fraudulently and ſpitefully ſoever they behaved themſelves to their Neighbours, that were not reckoned amongſt the Saints, and ſometimes to thoſe alſo.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, They did indeed with great earneſtneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity inveigh often againſt two ſins, Carnal Luſt, and vain Swearing, which without queſtion was very well done, but the common people were thereby inclined to believe, that nothing elſe was ſin, but that which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Third and Seventh Commandment; for few men do underſtand by the name of Luſt, any other Concupiſcence, than that which is forbidden in the Seventh Commandment; for men are not ordinarily ſaid to Luſt after another man's Cattle, or other Goods or Poſſeſſions, and never made much ſcruple of the acts of Fraud and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but endeavoured to keep themſelves from Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs onely, or at leaſt from the ſcandal of it. And whereas
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66130:13"/>they did both in their Sermons and Writings maintain and inculcate, that the very firſt motions of the Mind, that is to ſay, the delight Men and Women took in the ſight of one anothers Form, though they checked the proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo that it never grew up to be a Deſign, was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Sin; they brought Young men into Deſperation and to think themſelves damn'd becauſe they could not (which no man can, and is contrary to the Conſtition of Nature) behold a delightful Object without Delight; and by this means they became Confeſſors to ſuch as were thus troubled in Conſcience, and were obeyed by them, as theſe Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Doctors in all Caſes of Conſcience.</p>

                  <p>'Tis true, I had forgot that, but it was before ſuch as were free enough from it, (I mean) the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who would eaſily believe themſelves oppreſſed, but never Oppreſſors: And therefore you may reckon this amongſt their Artificers, to make their People believe they they were oppreſſed by the King, or perhaps by the Biſhops, or both, and inclined the meaner ſort to their Party after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when there ſhould be occaſion; but this was but ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly done in the time of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> whoſe fear and Jealouſie they were afraid of: Nor had they as yet any great power in the Parliament Houſe, whereby to call in queſtion her Prerogative by Petitions of Right, and other Devices as they did afterwards when Democratical Gentlemen had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them into their Council, for the deſign of changing the Monarchical Government into Popular, which they called Liberty.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66130:14"/>They did not challenge the Soveraignty in plain terms, and by that name, till they had ſlain the King; nor the Rights thereof, altogether, by particular Heads, till the King was driven from <hi>London</hi> by Tumults raiſed in the City againſt him, and retired for the ſecurity of his perſon to <hi>York,</hi> where he had not been many days when they ſent unto him Nineteen Propoſitions, whereof above a Dozen were Demands of ſeveral Powers, Eſſential parts of the Power Soveraign, but before that time they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome of them (in a Petition which they called <hi>a Petition of Right</hi>) which nevertheleſs the King had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in a former Parliament: though he deprived himſelf thereby, not only of the Power to Levy Money without their conſent, but alſo of his ordinary Revenue by Cuſtom of Tonnage and Poundage, and of the Liberty to put into Cuſtody ſuch men as he thought likely to diſturb the Peace, and raiſe Sedition in the Kingdom: As for the men that did this, 'tis enough to ſay, they were the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the laſt Parliament, and of ſome other Parliaments in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and the end of the Reign of King <hi>James:</hi> To name them all is not neceſſary, farther then the Story ſhall require; moſt of them were Members of the Houſe of Commons, ſome few alſo of the Lords: But all ſuch as had a great Opinion of their ſufficiency in Politicks, which they thought was not ſufficiently taken notice of by the King.</p>

                  <p>How could the Parliament, when the King had a great Navy, and a great number of Train'd Souldiers, and all the Magazines of Ammunition in his power, be able to begin the War.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>The King had theſe things in his Right, but that ſignifies little, when they had the Cuſtody of the Navy and Magazines, and with them all the Trained Souldiers, and in a manner all the Subjects were by the Preaching of Presbyterian Miniſters and the ſeditious whiſpering of falſe and ignorant Politians made his Enemies, and when the King could have no Money but what the Parliament ſhould give him, which you may be ſure ſhould not be enough to maintain his Legal Power, which they intended
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66130:14"/>to take from him. And yet I think they would never have adventured into the Field but for that unlucky buſineſs of impoſing upon the <hi>Scots</hi> (who were all Presbyterians) our <hi>Book of Common Prayer,</hi> for I believe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would never have taken well that the Parliament ſhould make War upon the King upon any provocation, unleſs it were in their own defence, in caſe the King ſhould firſt make War upon them, and therefore it behoved them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the King that he might do ſomething that might look like Hoſtility: It hapned in the year 1637. that the King by advice (as it is thought) of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> ſent down a <hi>Book of Common Prayer</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> not differing in ſubſtance from ours, nor much in words, beſides the putting of the word Presbyter for that of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, commanding it to be uſed (for Conformity to this Kingdom) by the Miniſters there, for an ordinary of Divine Service, this being read in the Church at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> cauſed ſuch a Tumult there, that he that read it had much adoe to eſcape with his life, and gave occaſion to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Nobility, and others, to enter (by their own Authority) into a Covenant amongſt themſelves to put down Epiſcopacy without conſulting the King; which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently did, animated thereto by their own Confidence, or by aſſurance from ſome of the <hi>Democratical Engliſh-men,</hi> that in former Parliaments had been the greateſt oppoſers of the King's Intereſt, that the King would not be able to raiſe an Army to chaſtiſe them without calling a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which would be ſure to favour them, for the thing which thoſe Democraticals chiefly then aimed at, was to force the King to call a Parliament, which he had not done of ten years before, as having found no help, but hindrance, to his deſigns in the Parliaments he had formerly called. Howſoever contrary to their expectation by the help of his better affected Subjects of the Nobility and Gentry, he made a ſhift to raiſe a ſufficient Army to have reduced the <hi>Scots</hi> to their former obedience, if it had proceeded to Battle: And with this Army he marched himſelf into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was alſo brought into the Field againſt him, as if they meant to fight; but then the <hi>Scotch</hi> ſent to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66130:15"/>King for leave to treat by Commiſſioners on both ſides, and the King willing to avoid the deſtruction of his own Subjects, condeſcended to it, the iſſue was peace, and the King thereupon went to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and paſſed an Act of Parliament there to their Satisfaction</p>

                  <p>No, but yeilded to the aboliſhing of it, but by the means the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were croſſed in their hope of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the <hi>Democraticals,</hi> formerly oppoſers of the King's Intereſt, ceaſed not to endeavour ſtill to put the two Nations into a War, to the end the King might buy the Parliaments help at no luſs a price than Soveraignty it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>But what was the Cauſe that the Gentry and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Scotland</hi> were ſo averſe from Epiſcopacy? For I can hardly believe that their Conſciences were extraordinarily tender, nor that there were ſo very great Divines as to know what was the true Church Diſcipline eſtabliſhed by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, nor yet ſo much in love with their Miniſters as to be over-ruled by them in the Government either Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, for in their lives they were juſt as other men are, Purſuers of their own Intereſts and Preferments, wherein they were not more oppoſed by the Biſhops than by their Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>

                     </gap>hollars ſhould (as they muſt when they are made Biſhops) be their Fellows. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That from the emulation of Glory between the Nations, they be willing to ſee their Nation afflicted with <hi>Civil War,</hi> and might hope by aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rebels here to acquire ſome Power over the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;</hi> at leaſt ſo far as to eſtabliſh here the Presbyterian Diſcipline, which was alſo one of the points they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards openly demanded. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They might hope for in the War ſome great ſum of Money as a reward of their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66130:15"/>aſſiſtance, bendes great Booty, which they afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but whatſoever was the cauſe of their hatred to Biſhops, the pulling them down was not all they-timed at; if it had (now that Epiſcopacy was aboliſhed by Act of Parliament) they would have reſted ſatisfied, which they did not; for after the King was returned to <hi>London</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Presbyterians and Democraticals, by whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they had put down Biſhops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> thought it reaſon to have the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Scotch</hi> for the pulling down the Biſhops in <hi>England;</hi> and in order thereunto, they might perhaps deal with the <hi>Scots</hi> ſecretly to reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with that pacification which they were before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with; howſoever it was, not long after the King was returned to <hi>London</hi> they ſent up to ſome of their friends at Court a certain Paper containing (as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) the Articles of the ſaid pacification: a falſe and ſcandalous Paper, which was by the King's Command burnt (as I have heard) publickly, and ſo both parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the ſame Condition as they were in when the King went down with his Army.</p>

                  <p>He might indeed, but it had been but a kind of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition to have made him General upon that account, though many Generals heretofore have been choſen for the good luck of their Anceſtors in the like occaſions.

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:66130:16"/>for which cauſe, after his death, they choſe his Son for General, with ill ſucceſs.

                  <p>The King ſent Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> with Commiſſion and Inſtructions into <hi>Scotland</hi> to call a Parliament there, (but all was to no purpoſe) and to uſe all the means he could otherwiſe; but the <hi>Scots</hi> were reſolved to raiſe an Army, and to enter into <hi>England,</hi> to deliver (as they pretended) their grievances to his Majeſty in a Petition, becauſe the King (they ſaid) being in the hands of evil Counſellors, they could not otherwiſe obtain their right: but the truth is, they were otherwiſe animated to it by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical and Presbyterian <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with a promiſe of reward, and hope of Plunder.

                  <p>It is ſtrange to me, that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> being but one Iſland, and their Language almoſt the ſame, and being governed by one King, ſhould be thought Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to one another: The <hi>Romans</hi> were Maſters of many Nations, and to oblige them the more to obey the Edicts of the Law ſent unto them by the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> they thought fit to make them all <hi>Romans;</hi> and out of divers Nations, as <hi>Spain, Germany, Italy,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to advance ſome, that they thought worthy, even to be Senators of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to give every one of the common People the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which they were protected from the contumelies of other Nations where they reſided: Why were not the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> in like manner united into one People?</p>

                  <p>King <hi>James,</hi> at his firſt coming to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> did endeavour it, but could not prevail: But for all that, I believe the <hi>Scotch</hi> have now as many priviledges in <hi>England</hi> as any Nation had in <hi>Rome,</hi> of thoſe which were ſo (as you ſay) made <hi>Romans,</hi> for they are all Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized, and have right to buy Land in <hi>England</hi> to them and their Heirs.</p>

                  <p>I ſee little equity in this, that thoſe Nations that are bound to equal obedience to the ſame King, ſhould not have equal Priviledges: and now ſeeing there be ſo very few born before King <hi>Jame</hi>'s coming in, what greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges had thoſe ingrafted <hi>Romans,</hi> by their Naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation in the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the State of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves more than the <hi>Scotch?</hi>

                     <hi>D.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Romans,</hi> when any of them were in <hi>Rome,</hi> had their voice in the making of Laws.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>And the <hi>Scotch</hi> have their Parliaments, wherein their aſſent is required to the Law there made, which is as good. Have not many of the Provinces of <hi>France</hi> their ſeveral Parliaments, and ſeveral Conſtitutions? yet they are all equally Natural Subjects to the King of <hi>France.</hi> And therefore for my part, I think they were miſtaken, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> in calling one another Foreigners. Howſoever that be, the King had a very ſufficient Army, wherewith he marched towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by that time he was come to <hi>York,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was drawn up to the Fronteers, and ready to march into <hi>England,</hi> (which alſo they preſently did) giving out all the way, that their march ſhould be without damage to the Countrey, and that their Errand was onely to deliver a Petition to the King for the redreſs of many pretended Injuries they had received from ſuch of the Court, whoſe counſel the King moſt followed: ſo they paſſed through <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:66130:18"/>quietly till they came to a Ford in the River of <hi>Tine,</hi> a little above <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> where they found ſome little op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from a party of the King's Army ſent thither to ſtop them, whom the <hi>Scots</hi> eaſily maſtered; and as ſoon as they were over, ſeized on <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and coming far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on, upon the City of <hi>Dureſme,</hi> and ſent to the King to deſire a Treaty, which was granted, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners on both ſides met at <hi>Rippon,</hi> the concluſion was that all ſhould be referred to the Parliament which the King ſhould call to meet at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the third of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> following in the ſame year 1640. And thereupon the King returned to <hi>London.</hi>

                  <p>So the Armies were disbanded.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>No, The <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was to be defrayed by the Counties of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Dureſme,</hi> and the King was to pay his own till the disbanding of both ſhould be agreed upon in Parliament.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>So in effect both the Armies were maintained at the King's Charge, and the whole Controverſie to be deſided by a Parliament, almoſt wholly Presbyterian, and as Partial to the <hi>Scotch</hi> as themſelves could have wiſhed.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>And yet for all this they durſt not preſently make War upon the King; there was ſo much yet left of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to him in the Hearts of People as to have made them odious if they had declared what they intended, they muſt have ſome colour or other to make it be believed, that the King made War firſt upon the Parliament. And beſides they had not yet ſufficiently diſgraced him in Sermons and Pamphlets, nor removed from about him thoſe they thought could beſt counſel him, therefore they reſolved to proceed with him like skilful hunters, Firſt to ſingle him out by men diſpoſed in all parts to drive him into the open field, and then in caſe he ſhould not ſeem to turn head to call that making a War againſt the Parliament. And firſt, They called in queſtion ſuch as had either Preached, or written, in defence of thoſe Rights which belonging to the Crown they meant to uſurp, and take from the King to themſelves, whereupon ſome few Writers and Preachers were Impriſoned, or forced to fly: The King not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66130:18"/>theſe, they proceeded to call in queſtion ſome of the King's own Actions in his Miniſters, whereof they Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd ſome, and ſome went beyond Sea, and whereas certain perſons having endeavoured by Books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to raiſe Sedition, and committed other Crimes of high Nature, had therefore been cenſured by the Kings Council in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and Impriſoned; the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by their own Authority, to try (it ſeems) how the King and the people would take it (for their Perſons were inconſiderable) ordered their ſetting at Liberty, which was accordingly done, with great Applauſe of the People that flocked about them in <hi>London</hi> in manner of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.

                  <p>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> for the defence of the Sea had power to Tax all the Counties of <hi>England</hi> whether they were Maritine or not, for the Building and Furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ships, which Tax the King had then lately found cauſe to impoſe, and the Parliament exclaimed againſt it as an oppreſſion: And one of their Members that had been Taxed but 20 Shillings, (mark the Oppreſſion, a Parliament-man of 500 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> a Year Land Taxed at 20 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) they were forced to bring it to a Tryal at Law, he refuſing payment, and he was caſt again: When all the Judges of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were demanded their Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the legality of it; of Twelve, that there are, it was judged Legal by Ten; for which, though they were not puniſhed, yet they were affrighted by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>What did the Parliament mean when they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt it as illegal? Did they mean it was againſt <hi>Statute Law,</hi> or againſt the Judgments of Lawyers given heretofore, which are commonly called <hi>Reports?</hi> or did they mean it was againſt Equity, which I take to be the ſame with the Law of Nature?</p>

                  <p>It is a hard matter, or rather impoſſible to know what other men mean, eſpecially, if they be crafty, but ſure I am Equity was not their ground for their pretence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66130:19"/>of Immunity from Contributing to the King, but at their own pleaſure, for when they have laid the Burthen of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the whole Kingdom and governing it upon any perſon whatſoever; there is little Equity he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on others for the means of performing it, or if he do, they are his Soveraign, not he theirs, and as for the Common Law, contained in <hi>Reports,</hi> they have no force but what the King gives them, beſides it were unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that a corrupt or fooliſh Judge's unjuſt Sentence ſhould by any time, how long ſoever, obtain the authority and force of a Law, but among the <hi>Statute Laws</hi> there is one called <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or <hi>The great Charter of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Engliſh men,</hi> in which there is one Article that no man ſhall be deſtrained, that is, have his Goods taken from him otherwiſe than by the Law of the Land.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>No, that leaves us in the ſame doubt which you think it clears; for where was the Law of the Land then? Did they mean a another <hi>Magna Charta</hi> that was made by ſome King more ancient yet? No, that Statute was made not to exempt any man from payments to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but for ſecuring of every man from ſuch as abuſed the King's Power by ſurreptitious obtaining of the King's Warrants, to the oppreſſing of thoſe againſt whom he had any Suite in Law: But it was conducing to the end of ſome rebellious Spirits in this Parliament, to have it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in the wrong ſenſe, and ſuitable enough to the underſtanding of the reſt, or moſt part of them to let it paſs.</p>

                  <p>I have heard often that they ought to pay what was impoſed by conſent of Parliament to the uſe of the King, but to their own uſe, never before; I ſee by this it is eaſier to gull the multitude than any one man amongſt them, for what one man that has his Natural Judgment depraved by accident, could be ſo eaſily couſed in a matter that concerns his Purſe, had he not been paſſionately carried away by the reſt to change of Government, or rather to a liberty of every one to govern himſelf.</p>

                  <p>I can make no other Judgment, but that they who were then elected, were juſt ſuch as had been elected for former Parliaments, and as are like to be elected for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to come, for the Common people have been, and and always will be ignorant of their duty to the Publick, as never meditating any thing, but their particular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, in other things following their immediate Leaders, which are either the Preachers, or the moſt potent of the Gentlemen that dwell amongſt them, as Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for the moſt part follow their Captains, if they like them: If you think the late miſeries have made them wiſer, that will quickly be forgot, and then we ſhall be no wiſer then we were?</p>

                  <p>What other deſign was he like to have, but what you heard before? the advancement of his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Countreys where the Univerſities were ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; there they learned to diſpute for him, and with unintelligible diſtinctions to blind mens eyes, whilſt they encroached upon the Rights of Kings; and it was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument of that deſign, that they fell in hand with the work ſo quickly: For the firſt Rector of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> as I have read ſome-where, was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lombard,</hi> who firſt brought in to them the Learning called <hi>School-Divinity,</hi> and was ſeconded by <hi>John Scot</hi> of <hi>Duns,</hi> who lived in or near the ſame time, whom any ingenious Reader, not knowing what was the deſign, would judge to have been the moſt egregious Blockhead in the world; ſo obſcure and ſenſleſs are their Writings: And from theſe, the School-men that ſucceeded learnt the trick of impoſing what they lift upon their Readers, and declining the force of true Reaſon by verbal Forks, I mean diſtinctions that ſignifie nothing, but ſerve onely to aſtoniſh the multitude of ignorant men; as for the underſtanding Readers, they were ſo few, that theſe new ſublime Doctors cared not what they thought, theſe School-men were to make good all the Articles of Faith which the Pope from time to time ſhould command to be believed; amongſt which, there were very many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Rights of Kings, and other Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, as aſſerting to the Pope all Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, they ſhould declare to be neceſſary <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> (that is to ſay) in order to Religion.</p>
                  <p>From the Univerſities alſo it was that Preachers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and were poured out into City and Countrey, to terrifie people into obedience to the Popes Canons and Commands, which for fear of wakening Kings and Princes too much, they durſt not yet call them Laws.</p>
                  <p>From the Univerſities it was, that the Philoſophy of

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was made an ingredient to Religion, as ſerving for a Salve to a great many abſurd Articles concerning the nature of Chriſt's Body, and the ſtate of Angels and Saints in Heaven: which Articles they thought fit to have believed, becauſe they bring ſome of them profit, and others reverence to the Clergy, even to the meaneſt of them; for when they ſhall have made the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the meaneſt of them can make the Body of Chriſt, who is there that will not both ſhew them reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and be liberal to them or to the Church, eſpecially in the time of their ſickneſs, when they think they make and bring to them their Saviour?</p>

                  <p>This is not much, nor was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> of ſuch credit with them, but that when his opinion was againſt theirs, they could ſlight him; whatſoever he ſays is impoſſible in Nature, they can prove well enough to be poſſible from the Almighty power of God, who can make Bodies to be in one and the ſelf-ſame place, and one Body to be in many places at the ſame time, if the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation require it, though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deny it. I like not the deſign of drawing Religion into an Art, whereas it ought to be a Law. And though not the ſame in all Countreys, yet in every Countrey indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nor that they teach it as Arts ought to be taught, by ſhewing firſt the meaning of their Terms, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving from them the Truth they would have us believe, nor that their Terms are for the moſt part untelligible, though to make it ſeem rather want of Learning in the Reader, than want of ſair dealing in themſelves; they are for the moſt part <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> words, wried a little the point towards the Native Language of the ſeveral Countries where they are uſed.

Their Doctrine have cauſed a great deal of Diſpute concerning Vertue and Vice, but no knowledge of what they are, nor any method of attaining Vertue, nor of avoiding Vice.</p>
                  <p>The end of Moral Philoſophy, is to teach men of all ſorts their Duty, both to the publick, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Eſtimate Virtue, partly by a Mediocrity of the Paſſions of Men, and partly by that, that they are praiſed; whereas it is not the much or little praiſe that makes an Action Virtuous, but the Cauſe; nor much or little blame that makes an Action Vitious, but its being unconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Laws, in ſuch men as are ſubject to the Law; or its being unconformable to Equity or Charity in all men whatſoever.</p>

                  <p>So I do: The Vertue of a <hi>Subject</hi> is comprehended wholly in obedience to the Laws of the Commonwealth.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66130:22"/>To obey the Laws is Juſtice and Equity, which is the Law of Nature, and conſequently is Civil Law in all Nations of the World; and nothing is Injuſtice or Iniquity, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then it is againſt the Law: Likewiſe to obey the Law is the Prudence of a <hi>Subject;</hi> for without ſuch obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience the Commonwealth (which is every Subjects ſafety and protection) cannot ſubſiſt. And though it be Prudence alſo in private men, juſtly and moderately to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet craftily to withold from the Publick, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud it of ſuch part of the Wealth as is by Law required, is no ſign of Prudence, but of want of knowledge of what is neceſſary for their own defence.</p>
                  <p>The Vertues of Soveraigns are ſuch as tend to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Peace at Home, and to the reſiſtance of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies. Fortitude is a Royal Vertue, and though it be neceſſary in ſuch private men as ſhall be Soldiers; yet for other men the leſs they dare the better it is, both for the Commonwealth, and for themſelves. Frugality (though perhaps you would think it ſtrange) is alſo a Royal Vertue, for it increaſes the publick ſtock, which cannot be too great for the Publick Uſe, nor any man too ſparing of what he has in truſt for the good of others. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality alſo is a Royal Vertue, for the Commonwealth cannot be well ſerv'd without Extraordinary Diligence and Service of Miniſters, and great Fidelity to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, who ought therefore to be incouraged, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that do him ſervice in the Wars. In ſumm, all Actions or Habits are to be eſteemed Good or Evil, by their Cauſes and Uſefulneſs in reference to the Commonwealth, and not by their <hi>Mediocrity,</hi> nor by their being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; for ſeveral men praiſe ſeveral Cuſtomes, and that which is Vertue with one, is blam'd by others; and contrarily, what one calls Vice, an other calls Vertue as their preſent Affections lead them.</p>

                  <p>They perform this Duty (I think) as well as any other Miniſters, I mean, the Loyal Party; and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians have always had an equal care to have God's Houſe free from prophanation, to have Tithes duly paid,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66130:24"/>to have the Sabbath day kept holy, the Word preached, and the Lord's Supper and Baptiſm duly adminiſtred. But it is not the keeping of the Feaſts and of the Faſts, one of thoſe Duties that belong to the Honour of God, if it be, the Presbyterians fail in that.</p>

But even this is a ſeaſon for the Paſſive obedience, we muſt patiently ſuffer what he inflicts on us for ſuch refuſal, and not, to ſecure our ſelves, riſe up againſt him.</p>

Beſides, you cannot doubt, but that they who in the Pulpit did ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the People to take Arms in defence of the then Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, alledged Scripture, that is the Word of God for it. If it be lawful then for Subjects to reſiſt the King when he commands any thing againſt the Scripture, that is contrary to the command of God, and to be Judge of the meaning of the Scripture, it is impoſſible that the life of any King, or the peace of any Chriſtian Kingdom can be long ſecure. It is this Doctrine that Divides a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom within it ſelf, whatſoever the men be (Loyal or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels) that Write or Preach it publickly. And thus you ſee, that if thoſe ſeditious Miniſters be tried by this Doctrine, they will come off well enough.</p>

                  <p>I ſee it, and wonder at People, that having never ſpoken with God Almighty, nor knowing one more than another, what he hath ſaid, when the Laws and the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher diſagree, ſhould ſo keenly follow the Miniſter, for the moſt part an ignorant, though a ready tongu'd Scholar, rather than the Laws that were made by the King, with the conſent of the Peers and the Commons of the Land.</p>

                  <p>Let us examine his words a little nearer; firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Paſſive obedience. When a Thief hath broken the Laws, and, according to the Law, is therefore executed, can any man underſtand, that this ſuffering of his is an obedience to the Law? Every Law is a Command to do
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66130:25"/>or to forbear; neither of theſe is fulfilled by ſuffering. If any ſuffering can be called obedience, it muſt be ſuch as is voluntary; for no voluntary action can be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſubmiſſion to the Law. He that means that his ſuffering ſhould be taken for obedience, muſt not onely not reſiſt, but alſo flie, nor hide himſelf to avoid his puniſhment. And who is there among them that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Paſſive obedience, when his life is in extreme danger, that will voluntarily preſent himſelf to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Juſtice? Do not we ſee that all men when they are led to Execution, are both bound and guarded, and would break looſe, if they could, and get away? ſuch is their Paſſive obedience. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſate in Moſes's chair; all therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do, Matth.</hi> 23.3. which is a doing an an Active obedience; and yet the Scribes and Phariſees appear not by the Scriptures to have been ſuch godly men, as never to command any thing againſt the revealed will of God.</p>

                  <p>Muſt Tyrants alſo be obeyed in every thing actively, or is there nothing wherein a Lawful Kings commands may be diſobeyed; what if he ſhould command me with my own hands to execute my Father, in caſe he ſhould be condemned to die by the Law?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>This is a caſe that need not be put, we never have read or heard of any King or Tyrant ſo inhumane as to command it; if any did, we are to conſider, whether that command were one of his Laws; for by diſobeying Kings, we mean diſobeying his Laws, thoſe his Laws that were made before they were applied to any particular perſon: For the King, though as a Father of Children, and a Maſter of domeſtick Secrets, yet commands the People in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral never but by a precedent Law, and as a Publick, not a Natural Perſon; and if ſuch a Command as you ſpeak of were contrived into a general Law, (which never was, nor never will be) you were bound to obey it, unleſs you depart
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66130:26"/>the Kingdom after the publication of the-Law, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the condemnation of your Father.</p>

                  <p>Your Author ſays farther, in refuſing active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the King, that commanded any thing contrary to God's Law, we muſt be very well aſſured that the thing is ſo contrary; I would fain know-how is it poſſible to be aſſured?</p>

                  <p>I think you do not believe, that any of thoſe Refuſers do immediately, from God's own mouth, receive any Command contrary to the Command of the King, who is God's Lieutenant, nor any other way than you and I do; that is to ſay, than by the Scriptures: And becauſe men do for the moſt part rather draw the Scriptures to their own ſenſe, than follow the true ſenſe of the Scripture, there is no other way to know certainly, and in all caſes, what God commands or forbids us to do, but by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of him or them, that are conſtituted by the King to determine the ſenſe of the Scriptures, upon hearing of the particular Caſe of Conſcience which is in queſtion; and they that are ſo conſtituted, are eaſily known in all Chriſtian Common-wealths, whether they be Biſhops, or Miniſters, or Aſſemblies that govern the Church under him or them that have the Sovereign Power.</p>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>Some doubts may be raiſed from this that you now ſay; for if men be to learn their Duty from the Sentence which other men ſhall give concerning the meaning of the Scriptures, and not from their own Interpretation, I underſtand not to what end they were Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and every man not onely permitted, but alſo exhorted to read them; for what could that produce but diverſity of Opinion, and conſequently (as man's nature is) Diſputation, breach of Charity, Diſobedience, and at laſt Rebellion? Again, ſince the Scriptures were allowed to be read in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> why were not the Tranſlations ſuch, as might make all that's read underſtood, even by mean ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66130:26"/>Did not the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuch as could read, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Law in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Language, as well as we do our Statute Laws in <hi>Engliſh?</hi> And as for ſuch places of the Scripture as had nothing of the Nature of a Law, it was nothing to the Duty of the <hi>Jews</hi> whether they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood or not, ſeeing nothing is puniſhable but the tranſgreſſion of ſome Law. The ſame queſtion I may ask concerning the New Teſtament; for I believe that thoſe men, to whom the Original Language was natural, did underſtand ſufficiently what Commands and Counſels were given them by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, and his immediate Diſciples. Again, how will you anſwer that queſtion which was put by St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John, Acts</hi> 4.19. when by <hi>Ananias</hi> the High-prieſt, and others of the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they were forbidden any more to teach in the Name of Jeſus, <hi>Whether is it right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God?</hi>

                  <p>The caſe is not the ſame, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had ſeen and daily converſed with our Saviour, and by the Miracles he wrought did know he was God, and conſequently knew certainly, that their diſobedience to the High Prieſt's preſent command was juſt. Can any Miniſter now ſay, that he hath immediately from God's own mouth received a Command to diſobey the King, or know otherwiſe than by the Scripture, that any Command of the King, that hath the form and nature of a Law, is againſt the Law of God, which in divers places he directly and evidently commandeth to obey him in all things. The Text you cite doth not tell us, that a Miniſter's Authority, rather than a Chriſtian King's, ſhall decide the queſtions that ariſe from the different Interpretations of the Scripture. And therefore where the King is Head of the Church, and by conſequence (to omit, that the Scripture it ſelf was not received but by the Authority of Kings and States) chief Judge of the Rectitude of all Interpretations of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to obey the King's Laws and publick Edicts, is not to diſobey, and obey God: A Miniſter ought not to think, that his skill in the <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues, if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66130:27"/>he have any, gives him a triviledge to impoſe upon all his fellow-ſubjects his own ſenſe, or what he pretends to be his ſenſe of every obſcure place of Scripture; nor ought he, as often as he hath found ſome fine Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation not before thought on by others, to think he had it by Inſpiration, as fine as he thinks it, is not falſe; and then all his ſtubbornneſs and contumacy towards the King and his Laws is nothing but pride of heart and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion, or elſe impoſture. And whereas you think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or perhaps hurtful, to have the Scriptures in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> I am of another mind; There are ſo many places of Scripture eaſily to be underſtood, that teach both true Faith and good Morality, and that as fully as it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, of which no Seducer is able to diſpoſe the mind of any ordinary Readers, that the reading of them is ſo profitable, as not to be forbidden, without great damage to them and the Common-wealth.</p>

                  <p>All that is required both in Faith and Manners for Man's Salvation, is, I confeſs, ſet down in Scripture as plainly as can be: <hi>Children, obey your parents in all things. Servants, obey your maſters in all things. Let all men be ſubject to the higher powers, whether it be the King, or thoſe that are ſent by him. Love God with all your ſoul, and your neighbour as your ſelf,</hi> are words of the Scripture, which are well enough underſtood; but neither Children, nor the greateſt part of Men, do underſtand why it is their duty ſo to do; they ſee not that the ſafety of the Common-wealth, and conſequently their own, depends upon the doing of it. Every man by Nature, without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, does in all his actions look upon, as far as he can ſee, the benefit that ſhall redound to himſelf by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; he reads, that <hi>covetouſneſs is the root of all evil,</hi> but he thinks, and ſometimes finds it is the root of his Eſtate. And ſo in other caſes, the Scripture ſays one Scripture ſays one thing, and they think another, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Grievances were commonly ſuch as theſe: The King's too much Liberality to ſome Favourite; the too much Power of any Miniſter of State of Officer; the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>How then can a King diſcharge his Duty, as he ought to do; or the Subject know which of his Maſters he is to obey? For here are manifeſtly two Powers, which when they chance to differ, cannot both be obeyed.</p>

                  <p>'Tis true, but they have not often differed ſo much to the danger of the Commonwealth, as they have done in this Parliament of 1640. In all the Parliaments of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> before the year 1640. my Lord of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> did appear in oppoſition to the King's Demands, as much as any man, and was for that Cauſe very much eſteemed and cryed up by the People as a good Patriot, and one that couragiouſly ſtood up in defence of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for the ſame cauſe was ſo much the more hated, when afterwards he endeavoured to maintain the Royal and Juſt Authority of his Majeſty.</p>

                  <p>After the Diſſolution of that Parliament holden in the year 1627 and 1628, the King finding no Money to be gotten from Parliaments, which he was not to buy with the Bloud of ſuch Servants and Miniſters as he loved beſt, abſtained a long time from calling any more, and had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained longer, if the Rebellion of the <hi>Scotch</hi> had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to it. During that Parliament the King made Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> a Baron, recommended to him for his great ability, which was generally taken notice of by the diſſervice he had done the King in former Parliaments, but which might be uſeful alſo for him in the times that came on; and not long after that he made him of the Council, and again Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which place he diſcharged with great ſatisfaction and benefit to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and continued in that Office, till by the Envy and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Lords and Commons of that unlucky Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 1640. he died, in which year he was made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the King's Forces againſt the <hi>Scotch</hi> that then entred into <hi>England,</hi> and the year before Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> The Pacification being made, and the Forces on both ſides Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, and the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> now Sitting, it was not long before the Houſe of Commons accuſed him to the Houſe of Lords of High-Treaſon.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> had heard all that paſſed at his Trial, and had declared he was unſatisfied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Juſtice of their Sentence, and (I think) notwithſtanding the danger of his own Perſon from the fury of the People, and that he was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled to give way to his <hi>Execution,</hi> not-only by ſuch as he moſt relied on, but alſo by the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> himſelf, he would have pardoned him, if that could have preſerved him from the Tumult raiſed and countenanced by the <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſelf, for the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of thoſe they thought might favour him, and yet the King himſelf did not ſtick to confeſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that he had done amiſs, in that he did not reſcue him.</p>

                  <p>Why did the <hi>Scots</hi> think there were ſo much danger in the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury?</hi> he was not a Man of War, nor a Man able to bring an Army into the Field; but he was perhaps a very great Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>That did not appear by any remarkable events of his Councils, I never heard but he was a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man for his Morals, and a very zealous promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church Government by Biſhops, and that he deſired to have the Service of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and the Houſe of God adorned as ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably as was poſſible, to the Honour we ought to do to the Divine Majeſty. But to bring, as he did,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66130:37"/>into the State his Former Controverſies, I mean his ſquablings in the Univerſity about Free Will, and his ſtanding upon Punctilio's concerning the Service-Book and its Rubricks was not (in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) an Argument of his ſufficiency in Affairs of State. About the ſame time they paſſed an Act (which the King conſented to) for a Triennial Parliament, wherein was Enacted, That after the preſent Parliament, there ſhould be a Parliament call'd by the King within the ſpace of three years, and ſo from three years to three years to meet at <hi>Westminster</hi> upon a certain day named in the Act.</p>

                  <p>But what if the King did not call it; finding it perhaps inconvenient or hurtful to the Safety or Peace of his People which God hath put into his Charge; for I do not well comprehend how any Soveraign can well keep a People in order when his hands are-tied, or when he hath any other Obligation upon him, than the benefit of thoſe he Governs. And at this time for any thing you told me they acknowledged the King for their Soveraign.</p>

                  <p>I know not, but ſuch was the Act: And it was farther Enacted, That if the King did it not by his own Command, then the Lord Chancellour or the Lord Keeper for the time being ſhould ſend out the Writs of Summons: And if the Chancellour refuſed, then the Sheriffs of the ſeveral Counties of themſelves at the next <hi>County Courts</hi> before the day ſet down for the Parliament's meeting, ſhould proceed to Election of the Members for the ſaid Parliament.</p>

                  <p>What a great Progreſs made the Parliament towards the ends of the moſt ſeditious Members of both Houſes in ſo little time. They ſat down in <hi>November,</hi> and now it was <hi>May;</hi> in this ſpace of time, which is but half a year, they won from the King the Adherence which was due to him from his People: they drove his faithfulleſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from him, beheaded the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> obtained a Triennial Parliament after their own Diſſolution, and a continuance of their own ſitting as long as they liſted; which laſt amounted to a total extinction of the King's right in caſe that ſuch a Grant were valid, which I think is not: unleſs the ſoveraignty it ſelf
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66130:38"/>be in plain terms renounced; which it was not, but what Money by way of ſubſidue or otherwiſe did they grant the King in recompence of all theſe his large conceſſions?</p>

                  <p>None at all, but often promiſed they would make him the moſt glorious King that ever was in <hi>England;</hi> which were words that paſſed well enough for welmeaning with the <hi>common</hi> People.</p>

                  <p>Yes they deſired the whole and abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and to change the <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government into an <hi>Oligarchie,</hi> that is to ſay, to make the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſting of a few <hi>Lords,</hi> and about 400 <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,</hi> abſolute in the ſoveraignty for the preſent, and ſhortly after to lay the Houſe of <hi>Lords</hi> aſide, for this was the Deſign of the <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters,</hi> who taking themſelves to be, by right, the onely Lawful Government of the <hi>Church,</hi> endeavoured to bring the ſame Form of Government into the <hi>Civil ſtate,</hi> and as the Spiritual Laws were to be made by their <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi> ſo their Civil Laws ſhould be made by the <hi>Houſe of Commons;</hi> who, as they thought, would no leſs be ruled by them afterwards, than formerly they had been; wherein they were deceived, and found themſelves out-gon by their own <hi>Diſciples,</hi> though not in Malice yet in Wit.</p>

                  <p>The Parliament were not very keen againſt them that were againſt the King.

For the truth is, the Charge they brought againſt them was ſo general, as not to be called an Accuſation, but Railing. As firſt; They ſaid, they nouriſhed Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Prerogatives and Liberty between the King and his People, to the end, that ſeeming much addicted to His Majeſty's Service, they might get themſelves into places of greateſt Truſt and Power in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

                  <p>You ſee what a heap of Evils they have raiſed to make a ſhew of ill Government to the People, which they ſecond with an enumeration of the many ſervices they have done the King in overcoming a great many of them, though not all, and in divers other things, and ſay, that though they had contracted a Debt to the <hi>Scots</hi> of 22000 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> and granted ſix Subſidies, and a Bill of Pole-money worth ſix Subſidies more, yet that God had ſo bleſſed the Endeavours of this Parliament, that the Kingdom was a gainer by it; and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Catalogue of thoſe good things they had done for the King and Kingdom: For the Kingdom they had done (they ſaid) theſe things; They had aboliſhed Ship-money, They had taken away Coat and Conduct-money, and other Military Charges, which they ſaid amounted to little leſs than the Ship-money; That they ſuppreſt all Monopolies, which they reckoned above a Million yearly ſav'd by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; That they had quell'd Living Grievances mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Evil Counſellors and Actors by the Death of my Lord <hi>Strafford;</hi> by the flight of the Chancellor <hi>Finch,</hi> and of Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> by the Impriſonment of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Judges; that they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66130:44"/>had paſt a Bill for a Triennial Parliament, and another for the Continuance of the preſent Parliament, till they ſhould think fit to Diſſolve themſelves.</p>

                  <p>That is to ſay, for ever, if they be ſuffered. But the ſumm of all thoſe things which they had done for the Kingdom, is, that they had left it without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without Strength, without Money, without Law, and without good Council.</p>

                  <p>They reckoned alſo putting down of the High-Commiſſion, and the abating of the Power of the Council-Table, and of the Biſhops, and their Courts; the taking away of unneceſſary Ceremonies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, removing of Miniſters from their Livings that were not of their Faction, and putting in ſuch as were.</p>

                  <p>Yes, In the Northern Counties were quartered the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, which the Parliament call'd in to oppoſe the King, and conſequently their Quarters was to be diſcharged.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>True, but by the Parliament that call'd them in.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>But they ſay no; and that this Money was given the King, becauſe he is bound to protect his Subjects.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>He is no farther bound to that, than they to give him Money wherewithal to do it. This is very great Impudence; to raiſe an Army againſt the King, and with that Army to oppreſs their Fellow-ſubjects, and then require that the King ſhould relieve them; that is to ſay, be at the Charge of Paying the Army that was raiſed to fight againſt him.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, That His Majeſty would deprive the Biſhops of their Votes in Parliament, and remove ſuch Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in Religion, Church, Government, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as they had brought in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he would remove from his Council, all ſuch as ſhould promote the Peoples Grievances, and Imploy in his great and public Affairs ſuch as the Parliament ſhould confide in.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That he would not give away the Lands Eſcheated to the Crown by the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>This laſt point, methinks, was not wiſely put in at this time; it ſhould have been reſerv'd till they had ſubdued the Rebels, againſt whom there were yet no Forces ſent over: 'Tis like ſelling the Lion's Skin, before they had kill'd him. But what anſwer was made to the other two Propoſitions?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>What anſwer ſhould be made but a Denial?</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time the King himſelf Exhibited Articles againſt ſix perſons of the Parliament, five whereof were of the Houſe of Comons, and one of the Houſe of Lords, accuſing them of High Treaſon: and upon the fourth of <hi>January</hi> went himſelf to the Houſe of Commons to demand thoſe five of them; but private notice having been given by ſome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous perſon about the King, they had abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves, and by that means fruſtrated His Majeſties Intention; and after he was gone, the Houſe making a hainous matter of it, and a High Breach of their Priviledges, adjourned themſelves into <hi>London,</hi> there to ſit as a General Committee, pretending they were not ſafe at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> for the King, when he went to the Houſe to demand thoſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66130:45"/>perſons, had ſomewhat more attendance with him (but not otherwiſe armed than his ſervants uſed to be) than he ordinarily had, and would not be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (though the King did afterwards wave the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of thoſe perſons) unleſs he would alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to them thoſe that gave him Counſel to go in that manner to the Parliament-Houſe, to the end they might receive condign puniſhment, which was the Word they uſed inſtead of Cruelty.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>This was a harſh Demand: Was it not enough that the King ſhould forbear his Enemies, but alſo that he muſt betray his Friends? If they thus tyrannize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the King before they have gotten the Soveraign Power into their Hands, how will they tyrannize over their Fellow-Subjects when they have gotten it?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Not above 2 or 3 Days, and then were brought from <hi>London</hi> to the Parliament-Houſe by Water in great Triumph, guarded with a tumultuous num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Armed Men, there to ſit in ſecurity in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of the King, and make Traiterous Acts againſt Him, ſuch and as many as they liſted, and under favour of theſe Tumults, to frighten away from the Houſe of Peers all ſuch as were not of their own Faction; for at this time the Rabble was ſo inſolent, that ſcarce any of the Biſhops durſt go to the Houſe for fear of Violence upon their Perſons: inſomuch that Twelve of them excuſed themſelves of Coming thither, and by way of Petition to the King remonſtrated that they were not permitted to go quietly to the Performance of that Duty, and proteſting againſt all Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as of none Effect, that ſhould paſs in the Houſe of Lords during their forced Abſence, which the Houſe of Commons taking hold of, ſent up to the Peers one of their Members to accuſe them of High Treaſon; whereupon Ten of them were ſent to the Tower, after which time there was no more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66130:46"/>words of their High Treaſon, but there paſſed a Bill, by which they were deprived of their Votes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And to this Bill they got the King's Aſſent, and in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> after they Voted the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould have no more to do in the Government of the Church, but to this they had not the King's Aſſent, the War being now begun.</p>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>What made the Parliament ſo averſe to Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and eſpecially the Houſe of Lords, whereof the Biſhops were Members: For I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould do it to gratifie a number of poor Pariſh Prieſts that were Presbyterians, and that were never likely to ſerve the Lords; but, on the contrary, to do their beſt, to pull down their power, and ſubject them to their Synods and Claſſes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>For the Lords, very few of them did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the intention of the Presbyterians; and beſides that, they durſt not, I believe, oppoſe the Lower Houſe.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe they meant to make uſe of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; and with pretended Sanctity, to make the King and his Party odious to the People, by whoſe help they were to ſet up <hi>Democracy,</hi> and Depoſe the King; or to let him have the Title only ſo long as he ſhould Act for their purpoſes: But not only the Parliament, but in a manner all the People of <hi>England,</hi> were their Enemies upon the account of their behaviour, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (they ſaid) too imperious. This was all that was colourable laid to their charge; the main of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them down was the Envy of the Presbyterians, that incenſed the People againſt them, and againſt Epiſcopacy it ſelf.</p>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but every Miniſter ſhall have the delight of ſharing the Government, and conſequently of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to be reveng'd on them that do not admire their Learning, and help to fill their purſes, and win to their ſervice them that do.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis a hard Caſe, that there ſhould be two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to trouble the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their own, other than every particular man may have; and that their quarrels ſhould be only about Opinions, that is, about who has the moſt Learning, as if their Learning ought to be the Rule of Governing the whole World. What is it they are Learned in? is it Politicks and Rules of State? I know it is called Divinity; but I hear almoſt nothing preacht but matter of Philoſophy; for Religion in it ſelf admits of no Controverſie: 'Tis a Law of the Kingdom, and ought not to be diſputed. I do not think they pretend to ſpeak with God, and know his will by any other way than reading the Scriptures, which we alſo do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, ſome of them do, and give themſelves out for Prophets, by extraordinary Inſpiration; but the reſt pretend only (for their Advancement to Benefices, and Charge of Souls) a greater skill in the Scriptures than other men have by reaſon of their breeding in the Univerſities, and knowledge there gotten of the Latin Tongue, and ſome alſo of the Greek and Hebrew Tongues wherein the Scriptures were written; beſides their knowledge of Natural Philoſophy, which is there publickly taught.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>As for the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, it was once (to the Detection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fraud, and to the Ejection of the Romiſh Power) very profitable, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary. But now that is done, and we have the Scripture in Engliſh, and Preaching in Engliſh, I ſee no great need of Latin, Greek and Hebrew: I ſhould
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66130:47"/>think my ſelf better qualified by under ſtanding well the Languages of our Neighbours, French, Dutch, and Italian. I think it was never ſeen in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Power of Popes was ſetup, that Philoſophy was much conducing to power in a Commonwealth.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>But Philoſophy, together with Divinity, hath very much conduced to the Advancement of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof, to places of the greateſt Authority, next to the Authority of Kings themſelves, in moſt of the Antient Kingdoms of the world, as is manifeſtly to be ſeen in the Hiſtory of thoſe times.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, what were the Druids of old time in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> what Authority theſe had you may ſee in <hi>Caeſar, Strabo,</hi> and others, and eſpecially in <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> the greateſt Antiquary perhaps that ever was, who ſpeaking of the Druids (which he calls Sarovides) in <hi>France,</hi> ſaith thus; There be alſo amongſt them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Philoſophers and Theologians that are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured, whom they alſo uſe as Prophets. Theſe men by their skill in Augury, and Inſpection into the Bowels of Beaſts ſacrificed, foretel what is to come, and have the multitude in obedience to them; and a little after; It is a cuſtom amongſt them, that no man may ſacrifice without a Philoſopher, becauſe (ſay they) men ought not to preſent their Thanks to the Gods, but by them that know the Divine Nature, and are as it were of the ſame language with them; and that all good things ought by ſuch as theſe to be prayed for.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>I can hardly believe that thoſe Druids were very skilful either in Natural Philoſophy or Moral.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor I; for they held and taught the Tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of Souls from one Body to another, as did <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> which Opinion, whether they took from him, or he from them, I cannot tell. What were the <hi>Magi</hi> in <hi>Perſia</hi> but Philoſophers and Aſtrologers? You know how they came to find our Saviour by the Conduct of a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66130:47"/>Star, either from <hi>Perſia</hi> it ſelf, or from ſome Country more Eaſtward than <hi>Judea:</hi> were not theſe in great Authority in their Country? And are they not in moſt part of Chriſtendom, thought to have been Kings? <hi>Aegypt</hi> hath been thought by many the moſt Antient Kingdom and Nation of the world, and their Prieſts had the greateſt power in Civil Affairs that any Subject ever had in any Nation. And what were they but Philoſophers and Divines? Concerning whom the ſame <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaies thus; The whole Country of <hi>Egypt</hi> being divided into three parts, the Body of the Prieſts have One as being of moſt credit with the people, both for their Devotions towards the Gods, and alſo for their Underſtanding gotten by Education, and preſently after: for generally thoſe men in the greateſt Affairs of all the King's Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, partly Executing, and partly Informirg and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing; foretelling him alſo (by their skill in Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Art in the Inſpection of Sacrifices) the things that are to come; and reading to him out of their Holy Books ſuch of the Actions there recorded, as are profitable for him to know. 'Tis not there as in <hi>Greece,</hi> one man, or one woman that has thé Prieſthood, but they are many that attend the Honours and Sacrifices of the Gods, and leave the ſame Imployment to their poſterity, which next to the King have the greateſt Power and Authority. Concerning the Judicature amongſt the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> he ſaith thus; From out of the moſt eminent Cities, <hi>Hieropolis, Thebes</hi> and <hi>Memphis,</hi> they chuſe Judges, which are Council not inferiour to that of <hi>Areopagus</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> or that of the Senate in <hi>Lacedoemon;</hi> when they are met, being in number thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they chuſe one from among themſelves to be Chief Juſtice; and the City, whereof he is, ſendeth another in his place: This Chief Juſtice wore about his neck, hung in a gold Chain, a Jewel of precious Stones; the name of which Jewel was Truth, which when the Chief Juſtice had put on then began the Pleading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:66130:48"/>And when the Judges had agreed on the Sentence, then did the Chief Juſtice put this Jewel of Truth on one of the Pleas. You ſee now what power was acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Civil matters by the conjuncture of Philoſophy and Divinity: Let us come now to the Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews;</hi> was not the Prieſthood in a Family (namely the <hi>Levites</hi>) as well as the Prieſthood of. <hi>Aegypt?</hi> Did not the High-Prieſt give Judgment by the Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldeans?</hi> Of theſe the ſame Author ſays thus; The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> are a Sect in Politicks, like to that of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts; for being ordained for the ſervice of the Gods, they ſpend the whole time of their life in Philoſophy, being of exceeding great reputation in Aſtrology, and pretending much alſo to Prophecy, foretelling things to come by Purifications and Sacrifices; and to find out by certain Incantations the preventing of harm, and the bringing to paſs of good. They have alſo skill in Augury, and in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Dreams and Wonders; nor are they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful in the Art of Foretelling by the Inwards of Beaſts ſacrificed, and have their Learning not of the Greeks; for the Philoſophy of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> goes to their family by Tradition, and the Son receives it from his Father. From <hi>Aſſyria</hi> let us paſs into <hi>India,</hi> and ſee what eſteem the Philoſophers had there. The whole multitude (ſays <hi>Diodorus</hi>) of the <hi>Indians,</hi> is divided into ſeven parts, whereof the firſt is the Body of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, for number the leaſt, but for eminency the firſt; for they are free from Taxes; and as the are not Maſters of others, ſo are no others Maſters of them. By private men they are called to the Sacrifices, and to the care of the Burials of the Dead, as being thought moſt beloved of the Gods, and skilful in the Doctrine concerning-Hell; and for this Imployment
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66130:48"/>receive Gifts and Honours very conſiderable. They are alſo of great uſe to the people of <hi>India,</hi> for being taken at the beginning of the year in the great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, they foretell them of great Drouths, great Rains, alſo of Winds, and of Sickneſſes, and of whatſoever i profitable for them to know beforehand.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Author concerning the Laws of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> ſaith thus, The Laws of the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> ſeem very different from thoſe of other Nations, and eſpecially about the Election of their Kings; for the Prieſts propound ſome of the chief men among them named in a Catalogue: and when the God, (which according to a certain Cuſtom is carried about to Feaſtings) does accept of him, the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude Elect for their King, and preſently adore and honour him as a God, put into the Government by Divine Providence. The King being choſen, he has the manner of his life limited to him by the Laws, and does all other things according to the cuſtom of the Country, neither rewarding nor puniſhing any man otherwiſe than from the beginning is Eſtabliſh'd amongſt them by Law; nor uſe they to put any man to death, though he be condemn'd to it, but to ſend ſome Officer to him with a Token of Death, who ſeeing the Token, goes preſently to his own houſe, and kills himſelf preſently after Bat the ſtrangeſt thing of all is that which they do concerning the Death of their Kings. For the Prieſts that live in <hi>Meroe,</hi> and ſpend their time about the worſhip and honour of the Gods, and are in greateſt Authority; when they have a mind to it, ſend a Meſſenger to the King, to bid him dye, for that the Gods have given ſuch order, and that the Commandments of the Immortals are not by any means, to be neglected by thoſe that are by nature Mortal, uſing alſo other ſpeeches to him, which men of ſimple Judgment, that have not reaſon enough to diſpare againſt thoſe unneceſſary commands, as being edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated under an old and undelible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But in the time of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Ergamenes,</hi> King of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> having had his breeding in Philoſophy after the manner of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> being the firſt that durſt diſpute their power, took heart as befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a King; came with Soldiers to a place called <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where was then the Golden Temple of the <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians;</hi> killed all the Prieſts, aboliſhed the Cuſtom, and rectified the Kingdom according to his will.</p>

                  <p>It was ſo; but were not the Prieſts cruel to cauſe their Kings, whom a little before they adored as Gods, to make away themſelves? The King kill'd them for the ſafety of his perſon, they him, out of Ambition, or love of Change. The King's Act may be coloured with the good of his People; the Prieſts had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt their Kings, who were certainly very godly, or elſe would never have obeyed the command of the Prieſts by a Meſſenger unarmed to kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Our late King, the beſt King perhaps that ever was (you know) was murdered, having been firſt perſecuted by War at the Incitement of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Miniſters, who are therefore guilty of the Death of all that fell in that War, which were, I believe, in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> near one hundred thouſand perſons. Had it not been much better that thoſe ſeditious Miniſters which were not perhaps a thouſand, had been all kill'd before they had Preached? It had been (I confeſs) a great Maſſacre; but the killing of a hundred thouſand is a greater.</p>

                  <p>But I intend not by theſe Quotations to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend either the Divinity, nor the Philoſophy of thoſe Heathen people, but to ſhew only what the Reputation of thoſe Sciences can effect among the people: For their Divinity was nothing but Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and their Philoſophy (excepting tho know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts, and from them the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had gotten by long Obſervation and Study in Aſtronomy, Geometry, and Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick) very little, and that in great part abuſed in Aſtrology and Fortune-telling; whereas the Divinity of the Clergy in this Nation (now conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red apart from the mixture that has been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in part retained here of the babling Philoſophy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and other Greeks, that has no Affinity with Religion, and ſerves only to breed Diſaffection, Diſſention, and finally Sedition and Civil War, as we have lately found by dear experience in the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the Presbyterians and Epiſcopals) is the true Religion. But for theſe Differences, both Parties, as they were in Power, not only ſuppreſſed the Tenets of one another, but alſo whatſoever Doctrine look'd with an ill Aſpect upon their Intereſt; and conſequently all true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, eſpecially Civil and Moral, which can never appear propitious to Ambition, or to an Exemption from Obedience due to the Soveraign Power.</p>
                  <p>After the King had accus'd the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> a Member of the Lords Houſe, and <hi>Hollis, Haſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig, Hampden, Prinn,</hi> and <hi>Stroud,</hi> five Members of the Lower Houſe, of High Treaſon; and after the Parliament had Voted out the Biſhops from the Houſe of Peers, they purſued eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally two things in their Petitions to His Majeſty, the one was, that the King would declare who were the perſons that adviſed him to go as he did to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66130:50"/>the Parliament-Houſe to apprehend them; and that he would leave them to the Parliament to receive condign puniſhment; and this they did to ſtick upon His Majeſty the diſhonour of Deſerting his Friends, and betraying them to his Enemies. The other was, that he would allow a Guard out of the City of <hi>London</hi> to be commanded by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> for which they pretended they could not elſe ſit in ſafety, which pretence was nothing but an upbraiding of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for coming to Parliament better accompanied than ordinary, to ſeize the ſaid five ſedicious Members.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſee no reaſon in petitioning for a Guard, they ſhould determine it to the City of <hi>London</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and the Command by name to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> unleſs they meant the King ſhould underſtand it a Guard againſt himſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Their meaning was, that the King ſhould underſtand it ſo, and as (I verily believe) they meant he ſhould take it as an affront; and the King himſelf underſtanding it ſo, denied to grant it, though he were willing, if they could not otherwiſe be ſatisfied, to command ſuch a Guard to wait upon them, as he would be reſponſible for to God Almighty. Beſides this, the City of <hi>London</hi> petition'd the King (put upon it, no doubt, by ſome Member of the Lower Houſe) to put the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> into the hands of perſons of Truſt, meaning ſuch as the Parliament ſhould approve of. And ſo appoint a Guard for the ſafety of His Majeſty and the Parliament. This method of bringing Petitions in a Tumultuary manner by great multitudes of Clamorous people, was ordinary with the Houſe of Commons, whoſe Ambition could never have been ſerved by way of Prayer and Requeſt, without extraordinary terror.</p>
                  <p>After the King had waved the proſecution of the five Members, but denied to make known, who had adviſed Him to come in perſon to the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66130:50"/>Houſe of Commons, they queſtioned the Attorney-General, who, by the King's command, had Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the Articles againſt them, and Voted him, <hi>A Breaker of the Priviledge of Parliament.</hi> And no doubt had made him feel their Cruelty, if he had not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily fled the Land.</p>
                  <p>About the end of <hi>January,</hi> they made an Order of both Houſes of Parliament, to prevent the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over of Popiſh Commanders into <hi>Ireland;</hi> not ſo much fearing that, as that by this the King Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf chooſing his Commanders for that Service, might aid Himſelf out of <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this was no great matter in reſpect of a Petition they ſent His Majeſty about the ſame time, that is to ſay, about the Twenty ſeventh, or Twenty eighth of <hi>January,</hi> 1641. wherein they deſired, in effect, the abſolute Soveraignty of <hi>England,</hi> though by the name of Soveraignty they challeng'd it not, whil'ſt the King was living; for to the end, that the fears and dangers of this Kingdom might be removed, and the miſchievous deſigns of thoſe who are Enemies to the Peace of it, might be prevented, they pray that His Majeſty would be pleaſed to put forthwith,</p>

                  <p>Were there really any ſuch fears and dangers generally conceived here? Or did there appear any Enemies at that time, with ſuch deſigns as are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Petition?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>They Petition'd His Majeſty alſo, to let the Prince ſtay at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, or ſome other of His Majeſties Houſes near <hi>London.</hi> They tell him alſo, <hi>That the Power of Raiſing, Ordering and Diſpoſing of the</hi> Militia, <hi>cannot be granted to any Corporation, without the Authority and Conſent of Parliament. And thoſe Parts of the Kingdom, that have put themſelves into a poſture of Defence, have done nothing therein, but by direction of both Houſes, and what is juſtifiable by the Laws of this Kingdom.</hi>

                  <p>It was a putting of themſelves into Arms, and under Officers, ſuch as the Parliament ſhould approve of.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They Voted that His Majeſty ſhould be again deſir'd, that the Prince might continue about <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They Voted a Declaration to be ſent to His
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66130:52"/>Majeſty by both the Houſes, wherein they accuſe His Majeſty of a deſign of altering Religion, though not directly Him, but them that counſel'd Him; whom they alſo accus'd of being the Inviters and Fomenters of the <hi>Scots</hi> War, and Framers of the Rebellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And upbraid the King again, for accuſing the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and the Five Members; and of being privy to the purpoſe of bringing up His Army, which was rais'd againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> to be employ'd againſt the Parliament. To which His Majeſty replied from <hi>New-market.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon it was Reſolv'd by both Houſes, <hi>That in this Caſe of extream Danger, and of His Majeſties Refuſal, the Ordinance agreed upon by both Houſes, for the</hi> Militia, <hi>doth oblige the People by the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom. And alſo that whoſoever ſhould execute any Power over the</hi> Militia, <hi>by colour of any Commiſſion of Lieutenancy, without Conſent of both Houſes of Parliament, ſhall be accounted a Diſturber of the Peace of the Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon His Majeſty ſent a Meſſage to both Houſes from <hi>Huntingdon, Requiring Obedience to the Laws Eſtabliſhed, and Prohibiting all Subjects, upon pretence of their Ordinance, to Execute any thing concerning the</hi> Militia, <hi>which is not by thoſe Laws warranted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this the Parliament Vote a ſtanding to their former Votes; as alſo, <hi>That when the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament, which is the Supreme Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Kingdom, ſhall declare what the Law of the Land it, to have this not only queſtioned, but contradicted, is a high Breach of the Priviledge of Parliament.</hi>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought that he that makes the Law, ought to declare what the Law is; for what is it elſe to make a Law, but to declare what it is; ſo that they have taken from the King not only the <hi>Militia,</hi> but alſo the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative Power.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>They have ſo. But I make account the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power (and indeed all Power poſſible) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Power of the <hi>Militia.</hi>

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:66130:53"/>
                  <p>After this they ſeize ſuch Mony as was due to His Majeſty upon the Bill of Tunnage and Poundage, and upon the Bill of Subſidies, that they might diſable him every way they poſſibly could. They ſent Him alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other contumelious Meſſages and Petitions after His coming to <hi>York,</hi> amongſt which one was, <hi>That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord Admiral, by indiſpoſition of Body, could not command the Fleet in Perſon, He would be pleaſed to give Authority to the Earl of</hi> Warwick <hi>to ſupply his place;</hi> when they knew the King had put Sir <hi>John Penington</hi> in it before.</p>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>To what End did the King entertain ſo many Petitions, Meſſages, Declarations, and Remonſtrances, and vouchſafe His Anſwers to them, when He could not chooſe but clearly ſee they were reſolv'd to take from Him His Royal Power, and conſequently His Life? For it could not ſtand with their ſafety, to let either Him or His Iſſue live, after they had done Him ſo great Injuries.</p>

                  <p>Beſides this, the Parliament had at the ſame time a Committee reſiding at <hi>York,</hi> to ſpy what His Majeſty did, and to inform the Parliament thereof; and alſo to hinder the King from gaining the People of that County to His Party: ſo that when His Majeſty was Courting the Gentlemen there, the Committee was Inſtigating of the Yeomanry againſt Him; to which alſo the Miniſters did very much contribute, ſo that the King loſt His opportunity at <hi>York.</hi>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>Why did not the King ſeize the Committee into His hands, or drive them out of His Town.</p>

                  <p>I know not; but I believe, He knew the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had a greater Party than He, not only in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> but alſo in <hi>York.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Towards the End of <hi>April</hi> the King, upon Petition of the People of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> to have the Magazine of <hi>Hull</hi> to remain ſtill there, for the greater ſecurity of the Northern Parts, thought fit to take it into his own hands. He had a little before appointed Governor of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66130:53"/>the Town the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> but the Townſmen having been already corrupted by the Parliament, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to receive him, but refus'd not to receive Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> appointed to be Governor by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The King therefore coming before the Town, Guarded only by a few of His own Servants, and a few Gentlemen of the Country thereabouts, was deny'd Entrance by Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> that ſtood upon the Wall; for which Act, he preſently cauſed Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> to be Proclaim'd Traytor, and ſent a Meſſage to the Parliament, requiring Juſtice to be done upon the ſaid <hi>Hotham,</hi> and that the Town and Magazine might be delivered into His hands.</p>
                  <p>To which the Parliament made no Anſwer, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof publiſhed another Declaration, in which they omitted nothing of their former Slanders againſt His Majeſties Government, but inſerted certain Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions declarative of their own pretended Right, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That whatſoever they declare to be Law, ought not to be queſtioned by the King.</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. <hi>That a Parliament, for the Public Good, may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of any thing wherein the King or Subject hath a Right; and that they, without the King, are this Parliament, and the Judge of this Public Good, and that the King's conſent is not neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>That no Member of either Houſe ought to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for Treaſon, Felony, or any other Crime, unleſs the Cauſe he firſt brought before the Paliament, that they may judge of the Fact, and give leave to proceed, if they ſee Cauſe.</hi>

                  <p>Yes, and more too, if need be; <hi>London</hi> (you know) has a great Belly, but no palate nor taſte of Right and Wrong.</p>
                  <p>In the Parliament Roll of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. amongſt the Articles of the Oath the King at his Coronation took, there is one runs thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concedes Juſtas Leges &amp; Conſuetudines eſſe tenendas, &amp; promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Which the Parliament urged for their Legiſlative Authority, and therefore interpret <hi>quas Vulgus elegerit,</hi> which the People ſhall chooſe; as if the King ſhould ſwear to protect and corroborate Laws before they were made, whether they be Good or Bad: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the words ſignifie no more, but that he ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and corroborate ſuch Laws, as they have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; that is to ſay, the Acts of Parliament then in being.</p>
                  <p>And in the Records of the Exchequer it is thus <hi>Will yea grant to hold and keep the Laws, and rightful

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>I think His Anſwer very full and clear; but if the words were to be interpreted in the other ſence, yet I ſee no reaſon why the King ſhould be bound to ſwear to them; for <hi>Henry</hi> IV. came to the Crown by the Votes of a Parliament, not much inferior in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs to this Long Parliament, that Depoſed and Murdered their Lawful King, ſaving that it was not the Parliament it ſelf, but the Uſurper that murdered King <hi>Richard</hi> II.</p>

                  <p>About a week after, in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> the Parliament ſent the King another Paper, which they ſtil'd, <hi>The Humble Petition and Advice of both Houſes:</hi> Containing Nineteen Propoſitions, which when you ſhall hear, you ſhall be able to judge what Power they meant to leave to the King, more than to any of His Subjects. The firſt of them is this:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That the Lords, and other of His Majeſties Privy Council; and all great Officers of State both at home and abroad, be put from their Imployments, and from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ſave only ſuch as ſhould be approved of by both Houſes of Parliament; and none put into their places, but by approbation of the ſaid Houſes. And that all Privy Counſellors take an Oath for the due Execution of their places, in ſuch form as ſhall be agreed upon by the ſaid Houſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>That the great Affairs of the Kingdom be Debated, Reſolv'd and Tranſacted only in Parliament; and ſuch as ſhall preſume to do any thing to the contrary, to be reſerved to the Cenſure of the Parliament; and ſuch other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State as are proper for His Majeſties Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ſhall be Debated and Concluded by ſuch as ſhall from time to time be choſen for that place by both Houſes of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66130:55"/>Parliament. And that no Publick Act concerning the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom which are proper for his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, be eſteemed valid, as proceeding from the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, unleſs it be done by the Advice and Conſent of the Major part of the Council, atteſted under their Hands; and that the Council be not more than</hi> 25, <hi>nor leſs than</hi> 15; <hi>and that when a Counſellors place falls, it ſhall not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, without the aſſent of the Major part of the Council; and that ſuch choice alſo ſhall be void, if the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after confirm it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>That the Lord High Steward of</hi> England, <hi>Lord High Conſtable, Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Lord Treaſurer, Lord Privy Seal, Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, Lord Admiral, Warden of the Cinque Ports, chief Governor of</hi> Ireland, <hi>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Wards, Secretaries of State, Two Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, and Chief Baron, be always choſen with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of both Houſes of Parliament; and in the Intervals of Parliament, by the Major part of the Privy Council.</hi>

On the other ſide, the King came to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and there did ſet up his Standard Royal, and ſent out Commiſſioners of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray to call thoſe to him, which by the ancient Laws of <hi>England</hi> were bound to ſerve in the Wars.

                  <p>I underſtand now how the Parliament deſtroy'd the Peace of the Kingdom, and how eaſily, by the help of Seditious <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters, and of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ignorant Orators, they reduced the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into Anarchy: but I believe it will be a harder task for them to bring in Peace again, and ſettle the Government either in themſelves, or in any other Governor, or form of Government; for granting that they obtain the Victory in this War, they muſt be beholding for it to the Valor, good Conduct, or Felicity of thoſe to whom they give the Command of their Armies, eſpecially to the General, whoſe good ſucceſs will, without doubt, bring with it the love and admiration of the Soldiers, ſo that it will be in his power either to take the Government upon himſelf, or to place it where himſelf thinks good. In which Caſe, if he take it not to himſelf, he will be thought a Fool; and if he do, he ſhall be ſure to have the Envy of his ſubordinate Commanders, who will look for a ſhare either in the preſent Government, or in the Succeſſion to it; for they will ſay, Has he obtain'd this Power by his own without our Danger, Valor, and Council?

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66130:57"/>his Children, his Officers would not ſuffer it, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending after his death to ſucceed him; nor would the Army conſent to it, becauſe he had ever declared to them againſt the Government of a Single Perſon.</p>

                  <p>VVE left at the Preparations on both ſides for War, which when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by my ſelf, I was mightily puzled to find out what poſſibility there was for the King to equal the Parliament in ſuch a courſe, and what hopes He had of Money, Men, Arms, Fortified Places, Shipping, Council, and Military Offices, ſufficient for ſuch an Enterprize againſt the Parliament, that had Men and Money as much at Command, as the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other Corporation Towns were able to furniſh, which was more than they needed. And for the Men they ſhould ſet forth for Soldiers, they were almoſt all of them ſpightfully bent againſt the King, and his whole Party, whom they took to be either Papiſts, or Flatterers of the King, or that had deſign'd to raiſe their Fortunes by the Plunder of the City, and other Corporation Towns; and though I believe not that they were more valiant than other Men, nor that they had ſo much Experience in the War, as to be accounted good Soldiers; yet they had that in them, which in time of Battle is more conducing to Victory than Valor, and Experience both together, and that was Spight.</p>
                  <p>And for Arms, they had in their hands the chief Magazines, the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> beſides moſt of the Powder and Shot that lay in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Towns, for the uſe of the Trained Bands.</p>
                  <p>Fortified places there were not many then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and moſt of them in the hands of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The King's Fleet was wholly in their Command, under the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> Counſellors they needed no more, than ſuch as were of their own Body, ſo that the King was every way inferior to them, except it were perhaps in Officers.</p>

                  <p>I cannot compare their chief Officers for the Parliament. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (after the Parliament had Voted the War) was made General of all their Forces, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whom, all other Commanders were to receive their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions.</p>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>What moved them to make the Earl of <hi>Eſsex</hi> General? And for what cauſe was the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſo diſpleaſed with the King, as to accept that Office?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not certainly know what to anſwer to either of thoſe Queſtions, but the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had been in the Wars abroad, and wanted neither Experience, Judgment nor Courage to perform ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; and beſides that, you have heard, (I believe) how great a Darling of the People his Father had been before him; and what Honour he gad gotten by the ſucceſs of his Enterprize upon <hi>Cales,</hi> and in ſome other Military Actions.</p>
                  <p>To which I may add, That this Earl himſelf was not held by the People to be ſo great a Favourite at Court, as that they might not truſt him with their Army againſt the King, and by this you may perhaps conjecture the cauſe for which the Parliament made choice of him for General.</p>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>But why did they think him diſcontented with the Court?</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>I know not that, nor indeed that he was ſo; he came to Court as other Noblemen did, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was to wait upon the King, but had no Office till a little before this time, to oblige him to be there continually; but I believe verily, that the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunateneſs of his Marriage, had ſo diſcountenanced his Converſation with Ladies, that the Court could not be his proper Element, unleſs he had had ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary favour there, to balance that calamity. For particular diſcontent from the King, or intention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for any ſuppoſed diſgrace, I think he had none; nor that he was any ways addicted to <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:66130:59"/>Doctrines, or other Phanatic Tenets in Church or State, ſaving only that he was carried away with the ſtream (in a manner) of the whole Nation, to think that <hi>England</hi> was not an abſolute, but a mixt Monarchy, not conſidering that the Supreme Power muſt always be abſolute, whether it be in the King, or in the Parliament.</p>

                  <p>Neither the King nor Parliament had much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at that time in their own hands, but were fain to rely upon the Benevolence of thoſe that took their parts, wherein (I confeſs) the Parliament had a mighty great advantage. Thoſe that helped the King in that kind, were only Lords and Gentlemen, which not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the proceedings of the Parliament, were willing to undertake the payment every one of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Horſe, which cannot be thought any very great aſſiſtance, the perſons that paid them being ſo few; for other Moneys that the King then had, I have not heard of any but what he borrow'd upon Jewels in the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> whereas the Parliament had a very plentiful Contribution, not only from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but generally from their Faction in all other places of <hi>England,</hi> upon certain Propoſitions, (publiſhed by the Lords and Commons in <hi>June,</hi> 1642. at which time they had newly Voted, That the King intended to make
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66130:59"/>War upon them) for bringing in of Money or Plate, to maintain Horſe and Horſe-men, and to buy Arms for the preſervation of the public Peace, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the King, and both Houſes of Parliament; for the Repaying of which Money and Plate, they were to have the <hi>Public Faith.</hi>

                  <p>The truth is, the Security was nothing worth, but ſerv'd well enough to gull thoſe ſeditious Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads that were more fond of change, than either of their peace or profit; having by this means gotten Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions from thoſe that were the well-affected to their Cauſe, they made uſe of it afterwards, to force the like Contribution from others; for in <hi>November</hi> following, they made an Ordinance for Aſſeſſing alſo of thoſe that had not contributed then, or had contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not proportionably to their Eſtates. And yet this was contrary to what the Parliament promiſed and declared in the Propoſitions themſelves; for they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the firſt Propoſition, <hi>That no man's Affection ſhould be meaſured by the proportion of his Offer, ſo that he expreſſed his good will to the Service in any proportion whatſoever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides this, in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> following, they made an Ordinance to Levy weekly a great Sum of Money upon every County, City, Town, Place, and Perſon of any Eſtate almoſt in <hi>England;</hi> which weekly Sum (as may appear by the Ordinance it ſelf, printed and publiſhed in <hi>March,</hi> 1642, by Order of both Houſes) comes to almoſt 33000 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>

                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> for the year. They had, beſides all this, the profits of the King's Lands and Woods, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was remaining unpaid of any Subſidy formerly granted Him, and the Tunnage and Poundage uſually received by the King, beſides the profit of the Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of great perſons, whom they pleas'd to Vote Delinquents, and the profits of the Biſhops Lands, which

                  <p>You have forgotten that I told you that the King Himſelf, by a Bill that He paſſed at the ſame time when He paſſed the Bill for the Execution of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> had given them Authority to hold the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they ſhould by conſent of both Houſes diſſolve themſelves: If therefore He had by any Proclamation or Meſſage to the Houſes diſſolv'd them, they would, to their former Defamations of His Majeſties actions, have added this, That He was a Breaker of His Word, and not only in Contempt of Him, have continued their Seſſion, but alſo have made advantage of it, to the increaſe and ſtrengthning of their own Party.</p>

                  <p>Would not the King's raiſing of an Army againſt them, be interpreted as a purpoſe to diſſolve them by force? And was it not as great a breach of promiſe to ſcatter them by force, as to diſſolve them by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Beſides I cannot conceive that the paſſing of that Act was otherwiſe intended than conditionally, ſo long as they ſhould not ordain any thing contrary to the Sovereign Right of the King, which condition they had already by many of their Ordinances broken; and, I think, that even by the Law of Equity, which is the unalterable Law of Nature, a man that has the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power cannot, if he would, give away the right of any thing which is neceſſary for him to retain for the good Government of his Subjects, unleſs he do it in expreſs words, ſaying, <hi>That he will have the Sovereign Power no longer;</hi> for the giving away that which by conſequence only draws the Sovereignty along with it, is not (I think) a giving away of the Sovereignty, but an error, ſuch as works nothing but an invalidity in the Grant it ſelf. And ſuch was the King's paſſing this Bill, for the continuing of the Parliament, as long as the Two Houſes pleas'd. But now that the War was reſolv'd on, on both ſides, what needed any more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute in writings?</p>

                  <p>I know not what need they had, but on both ſides they thought it needful to hinder one another as much as they could from levying of Soldiers, and therefore the King did ſet forth Declarations in Print, to make the people know that they ought not to obey the Officers of the new <hi>Militia</hi> ſet up by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament, and alſo to let them ſee the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of His own Commiſſions of Array; and the Parliament on their part did the like, to juſtifie to the people the ſaid Ordinance, and to make the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Array appear unlawful.</p>

                  <p>When the Parliament were Levying of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, was it not lawful for the King to Levy Soldiers, to defend Himſelf and His Right, though there had been
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66130:61"/>no other Title for it, but His own preſervation, and that the name of Commiſſion of Array had never been heard of?</p>

                  <p>For my part, I think there cannot be a better Title for War, than the defence of a Man's own Right, but the People at that time thought nothing lawful for the King to do, for which there was not ſome Statute made by Parliament. For the Lawyers, I mean the Judges of the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſome few others, though but Advocates, yet of great Reputation for their skill in the Common Laws and Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> had infected moſt of the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> with their Maxims and Caſes prejudg'd, which they call Precedents, and made them think ſo well of their own knowledge in the Law, that they were glad of this occaſion to ſhew it againſt the King, and thereby to gain a Reputation with the Parliament, of being good Patriots, and wiſe Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

                  <p>King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror had gotten into his hands by Victory, all the Lands in <hi>England,</hi> of which he diſpoſed ſome part, as Foreſts and Chaces for his own Recreation, and ſome part to Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that had aſſiſted him, or were to aſſiſt him in the Wars; upon which he laid a charge of ſervice in his Wars, ſome with more Men, and ſome with leſs, according to the Lands he had given them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, when the King ſent Men unto them with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to make uſe of their Service, they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to appear with Arms, and to accompany the King to the Wars, for a certain time at their own Charges, and ſuch were the Commiſſions by which this King did then make his Levies.</p>

                  <p>From <hi>York</hi> the King went to <hi>Hull,</hi> where was His Magazine of Arms for the Northern Parts of <hi>Erg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to try if they would admit Him; the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had made Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> Governor of the Town, who cauſed the Gates to be ſhut, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeating himſelf upon the walls, flatly denied Him entrance; for which the King cauſed him to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clam'd Traytor, and ſent a Meſſage to the Parliament, to know if they own'd the Actions?</p>

                  <p>Their pretence was this. That neither this, nor any other Town in <hi>England</hi> was otherwiſe the King's, than in Truſt for the People of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot ſee the force of this Argument: We repreſent the People: <hi>Ergo,</hi> all that the People has is ours.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66130:62"/>to all the Towns in <hi>England?</hi> When began this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be a Repreſentative of <hi>England?</hi> Was it <hi>November</hi> 3. 1640? Who was it the day before that had the Right to keep the King out of <hi>Hull,</hi> and poſſeſs it for themſelves? For there was then no Parliament, whoſe was <hi>Hull</hi> then?</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>I think it was the King's; not only becauſe it was called the King's Town upon <hi>Hull,</hi> but becauſe the King Himſelf did then and ever repreſent the Perſon of the People of <hi>England.</hi> If He did not, who then did, the Parliament having no Being?</p>

                  <p>They might perhaps ſay, the People had then no Repreſentative.</p>

                  <p>From thence He went to <hi>Shrewsbery,</hi> where He was quickly furniſhed; and appointing the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> to be General, He reſolv'd to march towards <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The King being in the contrary Army, and many times beating them from the Siege, I do not ſee how the right of War can juſtifie ſuch Impudence as that.

                  <p>In the end of this year, they ſolicited alſo the <hi>Scots</hi> to enter <hi>England</hi> with an Army, to ſuppreſs the power of the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> in the North, which was a plain Confeſſion, that the Parliament Forces were at this time inferior to the King's; and moſt men thought, that if the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> had then marched South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and joined his Forces with the King's, that moſt of the Members of Parliament would have fled out of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>In the beginning of 1643. the Parliament ſeeing the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s power in the North grown formidable, ſent to the <hi>Scots,</hi> to hire them to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of <hi>England;</hi> and (to complement them in the mean time) made a Covenant among themſelves, ſuch as the <hi>Scots</hi> before had made againſt Epiſcopacy, and demoliſhed Croſſes, and Church-windows (ſuch as had in them any Images of Saints) throughout all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo in the middle of the year, they made a Solemn League with the Nation, which was called, <hi>The Solemn League and Covenant.</hi>

                  <p>Are not the <hi>Scots</hi> as properly to be called Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, as the <hi>Iriſh?</hi> ſeeing then they perſecuted the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> even to death, for adviſing the King to make uſe of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces againſt the Parliament; with what face could they call in a <hi>Scotch</hi> Army againſt the King?</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>The King's Party might eaſily here have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd their deſign, to make themſelves abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Kingdom, and to dethrone the King.</p>
                  <p>Another great Impudence, or rather a Beſtial Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility it was of theirs, That they Voted the Queen a Traytor, for helping the King with ſome Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, from <hi>Holland.</hi>

                  <p>Was it poſſible that all this could be done, and Men not ſee that Papers and Declarations muſt be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs? And that nothing could ſatisfie them, but the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66130:65"/>Depoſing of the King, and ſetting up of themſelves in his place.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, very poſſible, for who was there of them, though knowing that the King had the Sovereign Power, that knew the Eſſential Rights of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? They dreamt of a mixt Power of the King and the Two Houſes, That it was a divided Power, in which there could be no Peace, was above their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, therefore they were always urging the King to Declarations, and Treaties, (for fear of ſubjecting themſelves to the King in an abſolute obedience) which increaſed the hope and courage of the Rebels, but did the King little good; for the People either underſtand not, or will not trouble themſelves with Controverſies in writing, but rather by his compliance by Meſſages, go away with an opinion, That the Parliament was likely to have the Victory in the War.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, ſeeing that the Penners and Contrivers of thoſe Papers, were formerly Members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of another mind, and now revolted from the Parliament, becauſe they could not bear that ſway in the Houſe which they expected men were apt to think, they believed not what they wrote.</p>
                  <p>As for Military Actions (to begin at the Head Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> took <hi>Brinningram,</hi> a Gariſon of the Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>July</hi> after, the King's Forces had a great Victory over the Parliaments near the <hi>Devizes</hi> on <hi>Roundway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down,</hi> where they took 2000 Priſoners, four Braſs Peeces of Ordnance, 28 Colours, and all their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. And ſhortly after <hi>Briſtol</hi> was ſurrendred to Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> for the King; and the King himſelf marching into the Weſt took from the Parliament many other conſiderable places.</p>
                  <p>But this good Fortune was not a little allay'd, by his beſieging of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> which, after it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to the laſt gaſp, was reliev'd by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:66130:65"/>whoſe Army was before greatly waſted, but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited with Train'd Bands, and Apprentices of <hi>London.</hi>

                  <p>It ſeems not only by this, but alſo by many Examples in Hiſtory, That there can hardly ariſe a long or dangerous Rebellion, that has not ſome ſuch overgrown City, with an Army or two in its belly, to foment it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay more, thoſe great Capital Cities, when Rebellion is upon pretence of Grievances, muſt needs be of the Rebel Party, becauſe the Grievances are for Taxes, to which Citizens, (that is Merchants, whoſe profeſſion is their private gain) are naturally mortal Enemies, their only glory being, to grow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively rich, by the wiſdom of buying and ſelling.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>But they are ſaid to be, of all Callings, the moſt beneficial to the Commonwealth, by ſetting the poorer ſort of people on work.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>That is to ſay, by making poor people ſell their Labour to them at their own prizes, ſo that poor people, for the moſt part, might get a better Living by working in <hi>Bridewell,</hi> than by ſpinning, weaving, and other ſuch labour as they can do, ſaving that by working ſlightly, they may help themſelves a little, to the diſgrace of our Manufacture. And as moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are the firſt Encouragers of Rebellion, preſuming in their ſtrength; ſo alſo are they, for the moſt part, the firſt that repent, deceiv'd by them that command their ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the War: Though the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> yet it was not to fly from, but to fight with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which preſently after he did at <hi>Newbery,</hi> where the Battel was bloody, and the King had not the worſt, unleſs <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> be put into the Scale, which the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had in his way a few days before ſurpriz'd.</p>
                  <p>But in the North and the Weſt the King had much the better of the Parliament; for in the North, at the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66130:66"/>beginning of the year, <hi>May</hi> 29. the Earls of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Cumberland</hi> defeated the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> (who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in thoſe parts for the Parliament) at <hi>Bramham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor,</hi> which made the Parliament to haſten the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>June</hi> following, the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> routed Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> (Son to the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>) upon <hi>Adderton-heath,</hi> and in purſuit of them to <hi>Bradford,</hi> took and kill'd 2000 Men, and the next day took the Town and 2000 Priſoners more, (Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf hardly eſcaping) with all their Arms and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and beſides this, made the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> quit <hi>Hallifax</hi> and <hi>Beverley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> reliev'd <hi>Newark,</hi> beſieg'd by Sir <hi>John Meldrum</hi> for the Parliament with 7000 men, whereof 1000 were ſlain, the reſt upon Articles departed, leaving behind them their Arms, Bag and Baggage.</p>
                  <p>To ballance in part this ſucceſs, the Earl of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> whoſe Lieutenant General was <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> got a Victory over the Royaliſts, near <hi>Horn-Caſtle,</hi> of which he ſlew 400, took 800 Priſoners, and 1000 Arms, and preſently after took and plunder'd the City of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Weſt, <hi>May</hi> 16. Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> at <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> had a Victory over the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians,</hi> wherein he took 1700 Priſoners, 13 Braſs Peeces of Ordnance, and all their Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, which was 70 Barrels of Powder, and their Magazine of their other Proviſions in the Town.</p>
                  <p>Again at <hi>Landſdown,</hi> between Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> and the <hi>Parliamentarians</hi> under Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was fought a fierce Battel, wherein the Victory was not very clear on either ſide, ſaving that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians</hi> might ſeem to have the better, becauſe preſently after Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> follow'd Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> to the <hi>Devizes</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> though to his coſt,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66130:66"/>for there he was overthrown, as I have already told you.</p>
                  <p>After this, the King in Perſon marched into the Weſt, and took <hi>Exeter, Dorcheſter, Barnſtable,</hi> and divers other places, and had he not at his Return beſieged <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and thereby giving the Parliament time for new Levies, 'twas thought by many he might have routed the Houſe of Commons. But the end of this year was more favourable to the Parliament; for in <hi>January</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> entered <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>March</hi> the firſt croſſed the <hi>Tyne;</hi> and whil'ſt the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was marching to them, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> gathered together a conſiderable Party in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcire,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> from <hi>Lyn</hi> advanced towards <hi>York;</hi> ſo that the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> having two Armies of Rebels behind him, and another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, was forced to retreat to <hi>York,</hi> which thoſe three Armies joyning preſently beſieged, and theſe are all the conſiderable Military Actions in the year 1643.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame year the Parliament cauſed to be made a new great Seal, the Lord Keeper had carried the former Seal to <hi>Oxford:</hi> Hereupon the King ſent a Meſſenger to the Judges at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to make uſe of it; this Meſſenger was taken, and condemned at a Council of War, and Hang'd for a Spy.</p>

                  <p>The ſame year, when certain Gentlemen at <hi>London</hi> received a Commiſſion of Array from the King, to Levy Men for his Service in that City, being diſcover'd, they were Condemn'd, and ſome of them Executed. This Caſe is not unlike the former.</p>

                  <p>Was not the making of a new great Seal a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof that the War was raiſed, not to remove evil Counſellors from the King, but to remove the King himſelf from the Government; what hope then could there be had in Meſſages and Treaties?</p>

                  <p>The Entrance of the <hi>Scots</hi> was a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected to the King, who was made to believe by continual Letters from His Commiſſioners in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> never intended any Invaſion. The Duke being then at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the King (aſſur'd that the <hi>Scots</hi> were now entered) ſent him Priſoner to <hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Cornwal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the year 1644. the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> being (as I told you) beſieged by the joint Forces of the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax;</hi> the King ſent Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> to relieve the Town, and as ſoon as he could, to give the Enemy Battle; Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> paſſing through <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and by the way having ſtorm'd the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Town of <hi>Bolton,</hi> and taken in <hi>Stock ford</hi> and <hi>Leverpool,</hi> came to <hi>York, July</hi> 1. and relieved it, the Enemy being riſen thence, to a place called <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton-moor,</hi> about four miles off, and there was fought that unfortunate Battel, that loſt the King, in a manner, all the North; Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> return'd by the way he came, and the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> and thence with ſome of His Officers over the Sea to <hi>Hamburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Honour of this Victory was attributed chiefly to <hi>Oliver Cromwel;</hi> (the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi>'s Lieutenant General:) the <hi>Parliamentarians</hi> return'd from the Field, to the Siege of <hi>York,</hi> which, not long after, upon honourable Articles was ſurrendred; not that they were favoured, but becauſe the Parliament could not employ much time, nor many men in the Siege.</p>

                  <p>It was ſo, but amends was made him for it within 5 or 6 weeks after; for Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> (after the loſs of his Army at <hi>Roundway-down</hi>) had another raiſed for him by the City of <hi>London,</hi> who, for the payment thereof, impoſed a weekly Tax of the value of one Meals meat upon every Citizen. This Army, with that of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> intended to beſiege <hi>Oxford,</hi> which the King underſtanding, ſent the Queen into the Weſt, and marched himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Worceſter.</hi> This made them to divide again, and the Earl to go into the Weſt, and <hi>Waller</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the King. By this means it ſo ſell out, that both their Armies were defeated; for the King turn'd upon <hi>Waller,</hi> routed him at <hi>Copredy-Bridge,</hi> took his Train of Artillery, and many Officers, and then preſently followed the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> into <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> where he had him at ſuch advantage, that the Earl himſelf was fain to eſcape in a ſmall Boat to <hi>Plymouth;</hi> his Horſe broke through the King's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by night, but the Infantry were all fore'd to lay down their Arms, and upon conditions never more to bear Arms againſt the King, were permitted to depart.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>October</hi> following, was fought a ſecond and ſharp Battel at <hi>Newbery;</hi> for this Infantry making no Conſcience of the Conditions made with the King, being now come towards <hi>London,</hi> as far as <hi>Baſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoke,</hi> had Arms put again into their hands; to whom ſome of the Trained Bands being added, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had ſuddenly ſo great an Army, that he attempted the King again at <hi>Newbery,</hi> and certainly had the better of the day, but the night parting them, had not a complete Victory. And it was obſerved here, that no part of the Earl's Army fought ſo keenly, as they who had laid down their Arms in <hi>Cornwal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:66130:68"/>
                  <p>Theſe were the moſt important Fights in the year 1644, and the King was yet (as both himſelf and others thought) in as good a condition as the Parliament, which deſpair'd of Victory by the Commanders then us'd; therefore they voted a new modelling of the Army, ſuſpecting the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> though I think wrongfully, to be too much a Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, for not having done ſo much as they look'd for in this ſecond Battel at <hi>Newbery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earls of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter</hi> perceiving what they went about, voluntarily laid down their Commiſſions; and the Houſe of Commons made an Ordinance, <hi>That no Member of either Houſe, ſhould enjoy any Office or Command Military or Civil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With which oblique blow they ſhook off thoſe that had hitherto ſerv'd them too well, and yet out of this Ordinance they excepted <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> in whoſe Conduct and Valour they had very great confidence, (which they would not have done, if they had known him as well then, as they did afterwards) and made him Lieutenant-General.</p>
                  <p>In the Commiſſion to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> there was a Clauſe for Preſervation of His Majeſty's Perſon, which in this new Commiſſion was left out, though the Parliament (as well as the General) were as yet <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>For my part, I doubt it not: For a Rightful King living, an uſurping Power can never be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſecured. In this ſame year the Parliament put to death Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> and his Son, for tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> about the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Hull.</hi> And Sir <hi>Alexander Carew,</hi> for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to deliver up <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where he was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66130:68"/>Governour for the Parliament. And the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for nothing but to pleaſe the <hi>Scots.</hi> For the General Article of going about to ſubvert the Fundamental Laws of the Land, was no Accuſation, but only ſoul words.</p>
                  <p>They then alſo voted down the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and ordered the uſe of a <hi>Directory,</hi> which had been newly compos'd by an Aſſembly of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>They were alſo then with much ado prevailed with for a Treaty with the King at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> where they remitted nothing of their former demands.</p>
                  <p>The King had alſo at this time a Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> conſiſting of ſuch diſcontented Members as had leſt the Houſes at <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> but ſew of them had changed their old principles, and therefore that Parliament was not much worth. Nay rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they endeavoured nothing but Meſſages and Treaties; that is to ſay, defeating the Soldiers hope of benefit by the War, they were thought by moſt men to do the King more hurt than good.</p>
                  <p>The year 1645, was to the King very unfortunate; for by the loſs of one great battel, he loſt all he had formerly gotten, and at length his life.</p>
                  <p>The new model'd Army, after conſultation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould lay Siege to <hi>Oxford,</hi> or march Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the relief of <hi>Taunton,</hi> (then beſieged by the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> and deſended by <hi>Blake,</hi> famous after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for his Actions at Sea) reſolv'd for <hi>Taunton,</hi> leaving <hi>Cromwel</hi> to attend the motions of the King, though not ſtrong enough to hinder him. The King upon this advantage drew his Forces and Artillery out of <hi>Oxford.</hi> This made the Parliament to call back their General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and order him to beſiege <hi>Oxford.</hi> The King in the mean time relieved <hi>Chester,</hi> which was beſieged by Sir <hi>VVilliam Brereton,</hi> and coming back, took <hi>Leiceſter</hi> by force, a place of great importance, and well provided of Artillery,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66130:69"/>and Proviſion, Upon this ſucceſs, it was generally thought that the King's party was the ſtronger. The King himſelf thought ſo, and the Parliament in a manner, confeſt the ſame, by commanding <hi>Fairfax</hi> to riſe from the Siege, and endeavour to give the King battel; for the Succeſſes of the King, and the treacherous diviſions growing now among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, had driven them to rely upon the fortune of one day, in which, at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> the King's Army was utterly overthrown, and no hope left him to raiſe another; therefore after the battel he went up and down, doing the Parliament here and there ſome ſhrewd turns, but never much increaſing his number.</p>

Then he deſired he might come to them in perſon; this alſo was denied.

                  <p>The Right was certainly in the King, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe was yet in no body, but contended for, as in a game at Cards, (without fighting both the years 1647. &amp; 1648.) between the Parliament and <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> Lieutenant General to Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax.</hi> You muſt know that when King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. aboliſhed the Pope's Authority here, and took upon him to be the Head of the Church, the Biſhops, as they could not reſiſt him, ſo neither were they diſcontented with it. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Pope before allowed not the Biſhops to claim Juriſdiction in their Dioceſſes, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that is, of Right immediately from God, but by the Gift and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope; now that the Pope was outed, they made no doubt but the divine Right was in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>After this, the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and divers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beyond Sea, having revolted from the <hi>Papacy,</hi> ſet up <hi>Presbyteries</hi> for the Government of their ſeveral Churches; and divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scholars that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, during the Perſecution of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were much taken with this Government; and at their return in the time of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ever ſince, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66130:71"/>to the great trouble of the Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſet up that Government here, wherein they might domineer, and applaud their own Wit and Learning. And theſe took upon them not only a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, but alſo a Divine Inſpiration; and having been connived at, and countenanced ſometimes in their frequent Preaching, they introduced many ſtrange and many pernicious Doctrines, out-doing the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as they pretended both of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from the former Divinity, or Church-Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, (for Religion is another thing) as much as <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> had receded from the Pope, and diſtracted their Auditors into a great number of Sects, as <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, Anabaptiſts, Independants, Fifth-Monarchy Men, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and divers others, all commonly called by the name of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> inſomuch as there was no ſo dangerous an Enemy to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as this Brood of their own hatching.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s beſt Cards, whereof he had a very great number in the Army, and ſome in the Houſe, whereof he himſelf was thought one, though he were nothing certain, but applying himſelf always to the Faction that was ſtrongeſt, was of a colour like it. There was in the Army a great number (if not moſt part) that aimed only at Rapine, and ſharing the Lands and Goods of their Enemies; and theſe alſo, upon the opinion they had of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Valor and Conduct, thought they could not any way better arrive at their Ends, than by adhering to him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, In the Parliament it ſelf, though not the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> part, yet a conſiderable number were <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now to put in doubts, and cauſe delay in the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Houſe; and ſometimes alſo by advantages of a thin Houſe, to carry a Vote in favour of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as they did upon the 26 of <hi>July;</hi> for whereas on the 4th of <hi>May</hi> precedent, the Parliament had Voted, <hi>That the</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of London <hi>ſhould be in the hands of a Committee of Citizens, whereof the Lord Mayor, for the time being ſhould be one.</hi>

                  <p>Shortly after the <hi>Independants</hi> chancing to be the <hi>major,</hi> made an Ordinance, whereby it was put into hands more favourable to the Army. The beſt Cards the Parliament had, were the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the perſon of the King. The General, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> was right <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> but in the hands of the Army, and the Army in the hands of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but which Party ſhould prevail, depending on playing of the Game. <hi>Cromwel</hi> proteſted ſtill Obedience and Fidelity to the Parliament, but meaning nothing leſs, bethought him, and reſolv'd on a way to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all that he ſhould do to the contrary upon the Army; therefore he and his Son-in-law, Commiſſary General <hi>Ireton,</hi> as good at contriving as himſelf, and at ſpeaking and writing better, contrive how to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny the Army againſt the Parliament. To this end they ſpread a whiſper through the Army, that the Parliament, now they had the King, intended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band them, to cheat them of their Arrears, and to ſend them into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be deſtroyed by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Army being herewith inrag'd, were taught by <hi>Ireton</hi> to crect a Council among themſelves of two Soldiers out of every Troop, and every Company to conſult for the good of the Army, and to aſſiſt at the Council of War, and to adviſe for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom. Theſe were called Adjuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſo that whatſoever <hi>Cromwel</hi> would have to be done, he needed nothing to make them do it, but ſecretly to put it into the head of theſe Adjutators; the effect of the firſt Conſultation, was to take the King from <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and to bring him to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                  <p>The General hereupon, by Letters to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, excuſes himſelf and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and the Body of the Army, as ignorant of the Fact; and that the King came away willingly with thoſe Soldiers that brought Him, aſſuring them withal, <hi>That the whole
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66130:72"/>Army intended nothing but Peace, nor oppoſed</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <hi>nor affected</hi> Independency, <hi>nor did hold any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious freedom in Religion.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe were the Articles that put them to their Trumps, and they anſwered none of them, but that of the Suſpenſion of the Eleven Members, which they ſaid they could not do by Law, till the particulars of the Charge were produced.</p>
                  <p>But this was ſoon anſwer'd, with their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi>

And now I am to tell you, that on <hi>July</hi> 26. the violence of certain Apprentices, and disbanded Soldiers, forced the Parliament to re-ſettle it as it was in the Citizens; and hereupon the two Speakers, and divers of the Members ran away to the Army where they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, and contented to ſit and Vote in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, in the nature of a Parliament; and out of theſe Citizens hands they would have the Militia taken away, and put again into thoſe hands out of which it was taken the 26th of <hi>July.</hi>

                  <p>At the ſame time they ſent a Letter to the Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> reproaching them with thoſe late Tumults, telling them, <hi>They were Enemies to the Peace, Treacherous to the Parliament, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nable to defend either the Parliament or themſelves, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have the City delivered into their hands, to which purpoſe</hi> (they ſaid) <hi>they were now coming to them.</hi>

                  <p>The Army being come to <hi>Hounſloe-heath,</hi> diſtant from <hi>London</hi> but ten Miles, the Court of Aldermen was called, to conſider what to do; the Captains and Soldiers of the City were willing, and well-provided to go forth, and give them Battel; but a Treacherous Officer, that had charge of a work on <hi>Southwark</hi> ſide, had let in within the Line a ſmall Party of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who marched as far as to the Gate of <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> and then the Court of Aldermen (their Hearts failing them) ſubmitted on theſe Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <p>I cannot judge of that: but to me it would have been ſtrange if: they had done otherwiſe; for I conſider the moſt part of rich Subjects, that have made themſelves ſo by Craft and Trade, as men that never look upon any thing but their preſent profit, and who to every thing not lying in that way are in a manner blind, being amaz'd at the very thought of Plundering: If they had underſtood what vertue

                  <p>His main end was to ſet himſelf in his place; the reſtoring of the King was but a reſerve againſt the Parliament, which being in his pocket, he had no more need of the King, who was now an Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him: To keep him in the Army was a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to let him fall into the hands of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had been a ſtop to his hopes, to murder him privately
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66130:75"/>(beſides the horrour of the act) now whilſt he was no more than Lieutenant General. would have made him odious, without farthering his deſign; there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better for his purpoſe, than to let him eſcape from <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>) where he was too near the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) whither he pleaſed beyond Sea: For though <hi>Cromwel</hi> had a great Party in the Parliament Houſes, whilſt they faw not his Ambition to be their Maſter, yet they would have been his Enemies as ſoon as that had appear'd. To make the King attempt an eſcape, ſome of thoſe that had him in Cuſtody, by <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on told him, that the Adjutators meant to murder him; and withal, cauſed a rumour of the ſame to be generally ſpread, to the end it might that way alſo come to the Kings Ear, as it did.</p>
                  <p>The King therefore in a dark and rainy night (his Guards being retir'd, as it was thought on purpoſe) left <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and went to the Sea-ſide, about <hi>Sonthampton,</hi> where a Veſſel had been beſpoken to tranſport him, but fail'd; ſo that the King was forced to truſt himſelf with Colonel <hi>Hammond,</hi> then Governour of the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> expecting perhaps ſome kindneſs from him for Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> ſake, Brother to the Colonel, and his Majeſties much-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd Chaplain; but it prov'd otherwiſe, for the Colonel ſent to his Maſters of the Parliament, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Orders concerning him. This going into the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> was not likely to be any part of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s Deſign, who neither knew whither, nor which way he would go, nor had <hi>Hammond</hi> known any more than other men, if the Ship had come to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place in due time.</p>

Laſt of all, <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf told them, it was now expected that the Parliament ſhould govern and defend the Kingdom, and not any longer let the people expect their ſafety from a man whoſe heart God had hardened; nor let thoſe that had ſo well defended the Parliament, be left afterward to the rage of an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable Enemy, leſt they ſeek their ſafety ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.

                  <p>And hereupon the Vote of Non-Addreſſes was made an Ordinance, which the Houſe would afterward have recalled, but were forc'd by <hi>Cromwel</hi> to keep their word.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> were diſpleas'd with it, partly becauſe their Brethren the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had loſt a great deal of their Power in <hi>England,</hi> and partly alſo, becauſe they had ſold the King into their hands.

                  <p>In the beginning of 1648. the Parliament gave Commiſſion to <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> (then made Chancellour of <hi>Oxford,</hi> together with ſome of the Doctors there, as good Divines as he) to purge the Univerſity; by vertue whereof they turn'd out all ſuch as were not of their Faction, and all ſuch as had approved the uſe of the Common Prayer-Book; as alſo divers ſcandalous Miniſters and Scholars (that is, ſuch as cuſtomarily and without need took the Name of God into their mouths, or uſed to ſpeak wantonly, or uſe the company of lewd Women) and for this laſt I cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So ſhall not I; for it is juſt ſuch another piece of Piety, as to turn Men out of an Hoſpital becauſe they are lame: Where can a man probably learn Godlineſs, and how to correct his Vices better, than in the Univerſities erected for that purpoſe?</p>

                  <p>It may be the Parliament thought otherwiſe; for I have often heard the Complaints of Parents, that their Children were debauched there to Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Wantonneſs, Gaming, and other Vices, conſequent to theſe: Nor is it a wonder among ſo many. Youths, if they did not corrupt one another
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66130:77"/>in deſpite of their Tutors, who oftentimes were little Elder than themſelves; And therefore (I think) the Parliament did not much reverence the Inſtitution of Univerſities, as to the bringing up of young men to Vertue, though many of them learn'd there to Preach, and became thereby capable of preferment and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and ſome others were ſent thither by their Parents, to ſave themſelves the trouble of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at home, during that time wherein Children are leaſt governable. Nor do I think the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment car'd more for the Clergy than other men did: But certainly an Univerſity is an Excellent Servant to the Clergy, and the Clergy if it be not carefully lookt too, (by their Diſſenticus Doctrines, and by the advantage to publiſh their Diſſentions) is no extraordinary means to divide a Kingdom into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Inſurrection, or rather Tumult, was of the Apprentices, on the 9th of <hi>April;</hi> but this was not upon the Kings Account, but aroſe from a cuſtomary Aſſembly of them for recreation in <hi>Moor-fulds,</hi> whence ſome zealous Officers of the Train'd-Bands would needs drive them away by force, but were themſelves routed with Stones, and had their Enſign taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Apprentices, which they carryed about in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66130:78"/>the Streets, and frighted the Lord Mayor into his Houſe, where they took a Gun, called a <hi>Drake,</hi> and then they ſet Guards at ſome of the Gates, and all the reſt of the day Childiſhly ſwagger'd up and down: but the next day the General himſelf marching into the City, quickly diſperſed them. This was but a ſmall buſineſs, but enough to let them ſee that the Parliament was ill-beloved of the people. Next, the <hi>Welch</hi> took Arms againſt them; there were three Colonels in <hi>Wales, Langhorn, Poyer,</hi> and <hi>Powel,</hi> who had formerly done the Parliament good Services, but now were commanded to disband, which they refus'd to do; and the better to ſtrengthen themſelves, declared for the King, and were about Eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time in <hi>Wales</hi> alſo was an another Inſurrection, headed by Sir <hi>Nicholas Keymiſh,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under Sir <hi>John Owen;</hi> ſo that now all <hi>Wales</hi> was in Rebellion againſt the Parliament: And yet all theſe were overcome in a Months time by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and his Officers, but not without ſtore of Blood-ſhed on both ſides.</p>

                  <p>'Tis true, but the City was never good at ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing; nor were they, or the <hi>Scots,</hi> principled to have a King over them, but under them. <hi>Fairfax</hi> matching with eight thouſand againſt the Royaliſts, routed a part of them at <hi>Maidstone;</hi> another part were taking in of places in <hi>Kent</hi> farther off, and the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> with the reſt came to <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> and then ſent to the City to get paſſage through it, to joyn with thoſe which were riſen in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> under Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle;</hi> which being denied, the greateſt part of his <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men deſerted him; with the reſt, not above five hundred, he croſſed the <hi>Thames</hi> unto the Iſle of <hi>Dogs,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Bow,</hi> and thence to <hi>Colcheſter.

                  <p>Upon the news of the defeat of the <hi>Scots,</hi> they were forced to yield; the Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi> was ſent Priſoner to <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> two Loyal and Gallant Perſons, were ſhot to Death.

                  <p>Meerly, as it is ſaid, for want of Conduct: The Army was led by Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who was then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet at liberty, when <hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle, where he was Priſoner was taken by the Parliament: He enterd <hi>England</hi> with Horſe and Foot 10000, to which came above 3000 Engliſh Royaliſts.

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:66130:79"/>marched out of <hi>Wales,</hi> with Horſe and Foot 11000, and near to <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> in leſs than two hours, defeated them; and the cauſe of it is ſaid to be that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was ſo ordered, as they could not all come to the Fight, nor relieve their Fellows: After the Defeat they had no way to fly but farther into <hi>England,</hi> ſo that in the purſuit they were almoſt all taken, and loſt all that an Army could loſe, for the few that got home, did not all bring home their Swords. Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> was taken, and not long after ſent to <hi>London,</hi> but <hi>Cromwel</hi> marched to <hi>Edenburrough,</hi> and there, by the help of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which was contrary to <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s, he made ſure not to be hindred in his Deſigns, the firſt whereof was to take away the King's life by the hand of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: whileſt theſe things paſſed in the North, the Parliament (<hi>Cromwel</hi> being away) came to it ſelf, and recalling their Vote of <hi>Non-Addreſſes,</hi> ſent to the King new Propoſitions, ſomewhat, but not much eaſier than the former, and upon the King's Anſwer to them, they ſent Commiſſioners to treat with him at <hi>Neaport</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where they ſo long dodged with him about Triſles, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was come to <hi>London</hi> before they had done, to the Kings deſtruction, for the Army was now wholly at the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who ſet the Adjutators on work to make a Remonſtrance to the Houſe of Commons; wherein they require:

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Conſtitution paſſed of a High Court of Juſtice; that is, of a certain number of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, of whom any twenty had power to try the King, and proceed to Sentence, according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Cauſe, and ſee it ſpeedily executed. The Commiſſioners met on Saturday; <hi>January</hi> 20. in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and the King was brought before them, ſitting in a Chair: He heard the Charge read, but denied to plead to it, either Guilty, or not Guilty, till he ſhould know by what lawful Authority he was brought thither: The Preſident told him, that the Parliament affirm'd their own Authority; and the King perſevered in his refuſal to plead: though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words paſſed between him and the Preſident; yet this is the ſum of all: on Monday, <hi>January</hi> 22. the Court met again, and the Sollicitor moved, that if the King perſiſted in denying the Authority of the Court, the Charge might be taken <hi>pro confeſſo;</hi> but the King ſtill denyed their Authority.</p>
                  <p>They met again, <hi>January</hi> 23. and then the Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor moved the Court for Judgment; whereupon the King was requir'd to give his Final Anſwer, which was again a denyal of their Authority.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They met again, <hi>January</hi> 27. where the King then deſir'd to be heard before the Lords and Commons in the <hi>Painted Chamber;</hi> and promiſing after that to abide the Judgment of the Court; the Commiſſioners retir'd for half an hour to conſider of it; and then returning, cauſed the King again to be brought to the Bar, and told him, that what he propos'd, was.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66130:81"/>but another denyal of the Courts Jutiſdiction; and that if he had no more to ſay, they would proceed to Judgment: Then the King anſwering, that he had no more to ſay, the Preſident began a long Speech, in juſtification of the Parliaments Proceedings, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Examples of many Kings kill'd or depos'd by wicked Parliaments, Ancient and Modern, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and other parts of the World: All which he endeavoured to juſtifie from this only Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that the People have the Supreme Power, and the Parliament is the People. This Speech ended, the Sentence of Death was read, and the ſame upon Tueſday after, <hi>January</hi> the 30. executed at the Gate of his own Palace of <hi>White-Hall.</hi> He that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in reading how villanouſly he was uſed by the Souldiers, between the Sentence and Execution, may go to the Chronicle it ſelf, in which he ſhall ſee what courage, patience, wiſdom, and goodneſs was in this Prince, whom in their Charge the Members of that wicked Parliament ſtyled Traytor, Tyrant, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</p>
                  <p>The King being dead, the ſame day they made an Act of Parliament, <hi>That whereas ſeveral pretences might be made to the Crown,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it is Enacted by this preſent Parliament, and Authority of the ſame, that no Perſon ſhall preſume to declare, proclaim, or publiſh, or any way promote</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>Son of</hi> Charles <hi>late King of</hi> England, <hi>commonly called Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>or any other Perſon, to be King of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>They had in their anger againſt the Lords for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declar'd the Supreme Power of the Nation to be in the Houſe of Commons; and now, on <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the fifth, they Vote the Houſe of Lords to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and dangerous. And thus the Kingdom was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66130:81"/>turn'd into a <hi>Democracy,</hi> or rather an <hi>Oligarchy;</hi> for preſently they made an Act, That none of thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who were ſecluded for oppoſing the Vote of Non-Addreſſes, ſhould ever be re-admitted: And theſe were commonly called the Secluded Members, and the reſt were by ſome ſtyled a Parliament, and by others a Rump.</p>
                  <p>I think you need not now have a Catalogue either of the Vices, or of the Crimes, or of the Pollies of the greateſt part of them that compoſed the Long-Parliament, than which greater cannot be in the world: What greater Vices than Irreligion, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, Avarice, and Cruelty, which have appeared ſo eminently in the actions of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Members, and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters? What greater Crimes than Blaſphemy, and killing Gods Anointed, which was done by the hands of the <hi>Indipendents,</hi> but by the folly and firſt Treaſon of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and ſold him to his Murderers? Nor was it a little folly in the Lords, not to ſee that by the taking away of the Kings Power, they loſt withall their own Priviledges; or to think themſelves either for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or judgment any way a conſiderable aſſiſtance to the Houſe of Commons: And for thoſe men who had skill in the Laws, it was no great ſign of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, not to perceive that the Laws of the Land were made by the King, to oblige his Subjects to Peace and Juſtice, and not to oblige himſelf that made them: Laſtly, and generally, all men are Fools which pull down any thing which does them good, before they have ſet up ſomething better in its place: He that would ſet up <hi>Democracy</hi> with an Army, ſhould have an Army to maintain it; but theſe men did it, when thoſe men had the Army that were reſolv'd to pull it down. To theſe follies, I might add the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of thoſe five men, which out of their reading of <hi>Tully, Seneca,</hi> and other <hi>Antimonarchicks,</hi> think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficient Politicks, and ſhew their diſcontents

                  <p>The firſt Act of the Rump, was the Excluſion of thoſe Members of the Houſe of Commons which had been formerly kept out by Violence, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66130:82"/>of an Ordinance for the King's Tryal; for theſe men had appear'd againſt the Ordinance of Non-Addreſſes, and therefore to be excluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might elſe be an Impediment to their future Deſigns.</p>

You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, think a man has need of nothing elſe, to know the duty he owes to his Governour, and what right he has to order him, but a good Natural Wit: But it is otherwiſe; for it is a Science, and built upon ſure and clear Principles, and to be learn'd by deep and careful ſtudy, or from Maſters that have deeply ſtudied it: And who was there in the Parliament, or in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that could find out thoſe evident Principles, and derive from thence the neceſſary Rules of Juſtice, and the neceſſary Connexion of Juſtice and Peace?

And thus ended the year 1648. and the Monthly Faſt, God having granted that which they faſted for, the death of the King, and the poſſeſſion of his Inheritance. By theſe their Proceedings, they had already loſt the hearts of the generality of the People, and had nothing to truſt to but the Army, which was not in their power, but in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s, who never fail'd, when there was occaſion, to put them upon all.

In the beginning of 1649. the <hi>Scots</hi> diſcontented with the proceedings of the Rump againſt the late King, began to levy Soldiers, in order to a new Invaſion of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, for want of timely reſiſtance from <hi>England,</hi> were grown terrible; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army at home, infected by the Adjutators, began to caſt about, how to ſhare the Land among the Godly, meaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſuch others as they pleas'd, who were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd <hi>Levellers:</hi> Alſo the Rump, for the preſent, were not very well provided of Money; and therefore the firſt thing they did, was the laying of a Tax upon the people, of ninety thouſand pound a Month, for the maintenance of the Army.</p>

To relieve <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Rump had reſolv'd to ſend eleven Regiments thither out of the Army here in <hi>England.</hi> This happened well for <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for the Levelling Soldiers, which were in every Regiment many, and in ſome the major part. finding that inſtead of dividing the Land at home, they were to venture their Lives in <hi>Ireland,</hi> flatly denied to go; and one Regiment having caſhier'd their Colonel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Salisbury,</hi> was marching to joyn with three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments more of the ſame reſolution; but both the General, and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> falling upon them at <hi>Burford,</hi> utterly defeated them, and ſoon after reduced the whole Army to their obedience.

                  <p>They had made themſelves Maſters already, both of the Laws, and Parliament. The Army being now obedient, the Rump ſent over thoſe eleven Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Command of Doctor <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Entituled, Governour of that Kingdom, the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> being ſtill General of all the Forces, both here and there.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs, now Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> was the Kings Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the Rebels had made a Confederacy among themſelves, and thoſe Confederates had made a kind of League with the Lieutenant, wherein they agreed upon liberty given them in the exerciſe of their Religion, to be faithful to, and aſſiſt the King. To theſe alſo were joyned

Theſe Parties not agreeing, and the Confederate Party having broken their Articles, the Lord Lieutenant ſeeing them ready to beſiege him in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and not able to defend it, to preſerve the place for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> ſurrenders it to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and came over to the King, at this time when he was carried from place to place by the Army. From <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he went over to the Prince, now King, reſiding then at <hi>Paris:</hi> But the Confederates affrighted with the news that the Rump was ſending over an Army thither, deſir'd the Prince, by Letters, to ſend back my Lord of <hi>Ormond,</hi> ingaging themſelves to ſubmit abſolutely to the Kings Authority, and to obey my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> as his Lieutenant: And thereupon he was ſent back. This was about a year before the going over of <hi>Cromwel;</hi> in which time, by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions in <hi>Ireland</hi> between the Confederate Party, and the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s Party, and diſcontents about Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, this otherwiſe ſufficient Power effected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and was at laſt defeated, <hi>Auguſt</hi> the ſecond, by a Salley out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which they were beſieging.

                  <p>In the beginning of the Year 1651.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66130:92"/>their own, not for the King's ſake: Their Loyalty was like that of Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> that kept the King out of <hi>Hull,</hi> and afterwards would have betrayed the ſame to the Marqueſs of <hi>New-caſtle.</hi> Theſe <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> therefore cannot be rightly called Loyal, but rather doubly perfidious; unleſs you think that as two Negatives make an Affirmative, ſo two Treaſons make Loyalty.</p>

                  <p>What need is there, when both Nations were heartily reſolved to fight, to ſtand ſo much upon this Complement of who ſhould begin?

                  <p>It is commonly ſo: but in this caſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> knowing the Dominion of the Narrow Seas to be a gallant Title, and envied by all the Nations that reach the Shore, and conſequently that they were likely to oppoſe it, did wiſely enough in making this point the ſtate of the Quarrel.</p>

                  <p>I believe he was a little Superſtitious in the Choice of <hi>September</hi> the third, becauſe it was lucky in 1650 and 1651, at <hi>Dunbar</hi> and <hi>VVorceſter,</hi> but he knew not how lucky the ſame would be to the whole Nation, in 1658. at <hi>VVhite-Hall.</hi>

                  <p>A third, That he ſhould have a Council of State of not above twenty one nor under thirteen, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Protectors Death this Council ſhould meet, and before they parted chuſe a new Protector.

                  <p>The Generals for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were <hi>Blake,</hi> and <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>Monk;</hi> and <hi>Van Trump</hi> for the <hi>Dutch;</hi> between whom was a Battel fought the ſecond of <hi>June</hi> (which was a Month before the beginning of this little Parliament) wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the Victory, and drove the Enemies into their Harbours, but with the loſs of General <hi>Dean,</hi> ſlain by a Cannon-ſhot. This Victory was great enough to make the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſend over Ambaſſadors into <hi>England</hi> in order to a Treaty. But in the mean time they prepared and put to Sea another Fleet, which likewiſe in the end of <hi>July</hi> was defeated by General <hi>Monk,</hi> who got now a greater Victory than before: And this made the <hi>Dutch</hi> deſcend ſo far, as to buy their Peace with the payment of the Charge of the War, and with the acknowledgment, among other Articles, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the right of the Flag. This Peace was concluded in <hi>March,</hi> being the end of this year, but not proclaimed till <hi>April;</hi> the Money it ſeems being not paid till them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> War being now ended, the Protector ſent his youngeſt Son, <hi>Henry,</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom alſo ſome time after he made Lieutenant there; and ſent <hi>Monk</hi> Lieutenant General into <hi>Scotland;</hi> to keep thoſe Nations in Obedience. Nothing elſe worth remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring was done this year at home, ſaving the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a Plot of Royaliſts (as was ſaid) upon the Life of the Protector, who all this while had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the King's Deſigns from a Traytor in his Court, who afterwards was taken in the manner, and kill'd.</p>

                  <p>He was the Son of a Collonel that was ſlain in the Wars on the late King's ſide: Beſides he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Employment from the King's loyal and loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects here, to convey to his Majeſty Money, as they from time to time ſhould ſend him: And to make this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf cauſed Money to be ſent him. The following year, 1654. had nothing of War, but
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66130:97"/>was ſpent in Civil Ordinances, in appointing of Judges, preventing of Plots (for Uſurpers are jealous) and in executing of the Kings Friends, and ſelling their Lands. The third of <hi>September,</hi> according to the Inſtrument, the Parliament met; in which there was no Houſe of Lords, and the Houſe of Commons was made as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly of Knights and Burgeſſes, but not as formerly two Burgeſſes of a Burrough, and two Knights for a County; for Burroughs for the moſt part had but one Burgeſs, and ſome Counties ſix or ſeven Knights; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there were twenty Members for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and as many for <hi>Ireland:</hi> So that now <hi>Cromwel</hi> had nothing to do, but to ſhew his Art of Government upon ſix Coach-Horſes newly preſented him, which being as rebellious as himſelf, threw him out of the Coach-Box, and had almoſt kill'd him.</p>

                  <p>Yes, eſpecially now that <hi>Cromwel</hi> in his Speech at their firſt meeting, had expreſly forbidden them to meddle with the Government of a ſingle Perſon and Parliament, or with the Militia, or with perpetuating of Parliaments, or taking away Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And he told them alſo, that every Member of the Houſe before they ſate, muſt take a Recognition of his Power in divers points; whereupon, of above 400 there appear'd not above 200 at firſt; though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſome relenting, there ſat about 300 again. Juſt at their ſitting down, he publiſhed ſome Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of his own, bearing date before their meeting, that they might ſee he took his own Acts to be as valid as theirs.

                  <p>But then they had never been ſuffered to ſit: <hi>Cromwel</hi> being informed of their ſtubborn proceedings, and out of hope of any Supply from them, diſſolv'd them.</p>
                  <p>All that paſſed beſides in this year, was the Exerciſe of the High-Court of Juſtice upon ſome Royaliſts for Plots.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1655. the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to the number of near 10000, landed in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> in hope of the plunder of the Gold and Silver, whereof they thought there was great abundance in the Town of <hi>Santo Domingo;</hi> but were well beaten by a few <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and with the loſs of near 1000 Men, went off to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed it.</p>
                  <p>This year alſo the Royal Party made another At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in the Weſt, and proclaimed there King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; but few joining with them, and ſome fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off, they were ſoon ſuppreſſed, and many of the principal perſons Executed.</p>

                  <p>In theſe many Inſurrections, the Royaliſts, tho they meant well, yet they did but diſ-ſervice to the King by their impatience.

                  <p>That was ſomewhat incertain: The Protector being fruſtrate of his hope of Money at <hi>Santo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,</hi> reſolv'd to take from the Royaliſts the tenth part yearly of their Eſtates: And to this end chiefly, he divided <hi>England</hi> into eleven Major-General-ſhips, with Commiſſion to every Major-General to make a Roll of the Names of all ſuſpected perſons of the King's party, and to receive the tenth part of their Eſtates within his Precinct: As alſo to take cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them not to act againſt the State, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66130:98"/>to reveal all Plots that ſhould come to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to make them engage the like for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: They had Commiſſion alſo to forbid Horſe-races, and concourſe of people, and to receive and account for this Decimation.</p>

                  <p>About two years before this there appear'd in <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s time a Propheteſs, much fam'd for her Dreams and Viſions, and hearkened to by many, whereof ſome were Eminent Officers, but ſhe and ſome of her Complices being impriſon'd, we heard no more of her.</p>

                  <p>It may be ſo. In the year 1657, the firſt thing the Parliament did was the drawing up a Petition to the Protector, to take upon him the Title of King. As of other Parliaments, ſo of this, the greateſt part had been kept out of the Houſe by force, or elſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had forborn to ſit, and became guilty of ſetting up this King <hi>Oliver,</hi> but thoſe few that ſat preſented their Petition to the Protector, <hi>April</hi> the 9th, in the Banquetting-houſe at <hi>Whitehall.</hi>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington,</hi> the Speaker, uſed the firſt Arguments, and the Protector deſired ſome time to ſeek God, the Buſineſs being weighty: The next day they ſent a Committee to him to receive his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which Anſwer being not very clear, they preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him again for a Reſolution, to which he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in a long Speech that ended in a peremptory Refuſal, and ſo retaining ſtill the Title of Protector, he took upon him the Government according to certain Articles contained in the ſaid Petition.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe he durſt not take it at that time, the Army being addicted to their great Officers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their great Officers many (hoping to ſucceed him, and the Succeſſion having been promiſed to Major General <hi>Lambert,</hi> would have mutined againſt him;) he was therefore forced to ſtay for a more propitious Conjuncture.</p>

                  <p>The moſt important of them were, firſt, That he would exerciſe the Office of chief Magiſtrate of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Title of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and govern the ſame according to the ſaid Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and advice; and that he would in his life time name his Succeſſor.</p>

                  <p>I believe the <hi>Scots,</hi> when they firſt Rebell'd, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of being Governed abſolutely as they were by <hi>Oliver Cromwel.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, That he ſhould call a Parliament eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry three years at fartheſt. Thirdly, That thoſe perſons which were legally choſen Members ſhould not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded without conſent of the Houſe. In allowing this Clauſe, the Protector obſerved not that the ſecluded Members of this ſame Parliament are thereby re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Fourthly, The Members were qualified. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Power of the other Houſe was defin'd. Sixthly, That no Law ſhould be made but by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Seventhly, That a conſtant yearly Revenue of a Million of pounds ſhould be ſetled for the maintenance of the Army and Navy, and 300000 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> for the ſupport of the Government; beſides other temporary ſupplies, as the Houſe of Commons ſhould think fit. Eighthly, That all the Officers of State ſhould be choſen by the Parliament. Ninthly, That the Protector ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Miniſtry. Laſtly, That he ſhould cauſe a profeſſion of Religion to be agreed on and publiſhed. There are divers others of leſs importance. Having ſigned the Articles, he was preſently with great Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies inſtalled a-new.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>But the Articles of this Petition were not all the ſame with thoſe of his former Inſtrument; for now there was to be another Houſe; and whereas before his Council was to name his Succeſſors, he had Power now to do it himſelf; ſo that he was an abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66130:100"/>and might leave the Succeſſion to his Son, If he would, and ſo ſucceſſively, or transfer it to whom he pleas'd. The Ceremony being ended, the Parliament adjourn'd to the 20th of <hi>January</hi> following, and then the other Houſe alſo ſate with their Fellows.</p>
                  <p>The Houſe of Commons being now full, took little notice of the other Houſe, wherein there were not of 60 perſons above nine Lords: but fell a queſtioning all that their Fellows had done during the time of their Secluſion; whence had follow'd the avoidance of the Power newly placed in the Protector. Therefore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Houſe, he made a Speech to them, ending in theſe words, <hi>By the living God I muſt and do diſſolve you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this year the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave the <hi>Spaniard</hi> another great Blow at <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> not much leſs than that they had given him the year before at <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the time of the diſſolution of this Parliament the Royaliſts had another Deſign againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, which was to make an Inſurrection in <hi>England,</hi> the King being then in <hi>Flanders</hi> ready to ſecond them from thence with an Army: But this alſo was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by Treachery, and came to nothing, but the ruin of thoſe that were ingaged in it, whereof many in the beginning of the next year were by a High Court of Juſtice impriſon'd, and ſome executed. This year alſo was Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> put out of all employment, a Man ſecond to none but <hi>Oliver</hi> in the favour of the Army: but becauſe he expected by that favour, or by promiſe from the Protector, to be his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in the Supreme Power, it would have been dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to let him have Command in the Army, the Protector having deſign'd his Succeſſor his Eldeſt Son <hi>Richard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1658. <hi>September</hi> the third, the Protector died at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> having ever ſince his laſt Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been perplexed with fear of being killed by ſome deſperate attempts of the Royaliſts.</p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:66130:100"/>
                  <p>Being importun'd in his ſickneſs by his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to name his Succeſſor, he nam'd his Son <hi>Richard;</hi> who incouraged thereunto, not by his own Ambition, but by <hi>Fleetwood, Desborough, Thurloe,</hi> and other of his Council, was content to take it upon him; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Addreſſes were made to him from the Armies, in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> His firſt buſineſs was, the chargeable and ſplendid Funeral of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Thus was <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> ſeated in the Imperial Throne of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Succeſſor to his Father, lifted up to it by the Officers of the Army then in Town, and congratulated by all the parts of the Army throughout the three Nations, ſcarce any Garriſon omitting their particular flattering Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to him.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>The Army was inconſtant, he himſelf irreſolute, and without any Millitary Glory; and though the two principal Officers had a near relation to him, yet neither of them, but <hi>Lambert,</hi> was the great Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the Army, and by courting <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to take upon him the Protectorſhip, and by tampering with the Soldiers, he had gotten again to be a Collonel; he and the reſt of the Officers had a Council at <hi>Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-Houſe</hi> (where <hi>Fleetwood</hi> dwelt) for the diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of <hi>Richard,</hi> though they had not yet conſidered how the Nations ſhould be govern'd afterwards. For from the beginning of the Rebellion the method of Ambition was conſtantly this, firſt to deſtroy, and then to conſider what they ſhould ſet up.</p>

                  <p>Could not the Protector, who kept his Court at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> diſcover what the buſineſs of the Officers was at <hi>Wallingford-Houſe,</hi> ſo near him?</p>

                  <p>Yes: He was by divers of his Friends inform'd of it, and counſell'd by ſome of them, who would have done it, to kill the chief of them, but he had not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

And to pleaſe the Soldiers, they Voted to take preſently into their conſideration the means of paying them their Arrears: But whilſt they where conſidering this, the Protector (according to the firſt of thoſe Acts) forbad the meeting of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers at <hi>Wallingford-Houſe.</hi> This made the Government, which by the diſagreement of the Protector and Army, was already looſe, to fall in pieces. For the Officers, from <hi>Wallingford-Houſe,</hi> with Soldiers enow, came to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and brought with them a Commiſſion ready drawn (giving power to <hi>Desborough</hi> to Diſſolve the Parliament) for the Protector to ſign, which alſo, his heart and his party failing him, he ſigned.

                  <p>Firſt, From 1640 to 1648. when the King was murthered, the Soveraignty was diſputed between King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and the Presbyterian Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2ly, From 1648 to 1653. the Power was in that part of the Parliament which voted the Tryal of the King, and declar'd themſelves, without King or Houſe of Lords, to have the Supreme Authority of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> For there were in the Long-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament two Factions, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent.</hi> The former whereof ſought only the ſubjection of the King, not his deſtruction: and this part is it which was called the <hi>Rump</hi> 3ly, From <hi>April</hi> the 20 to <hi>July</hi> the 4, the Supreme Power was in the Hands of a Council of State conſtituted by <hi>Cromwel.</hi> 4ly, From <hi>July</hi> the 4 to <hi>December</hi> the 12 of the ſame year it was in the Hands of Men called unto it by <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> whom he termed men of Fidelity and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and made them a Parliament, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in contempt of one of the Members, <hi>Barebone</hi>'s Parliament. 5ly, From <hi>December</hi> the 12, 1653, to <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> the 3. 1658, it was in the hands of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> with the Title of Protector. 6ly, From <hi>September</hi> 1658 to <hi>April</hi> the twenty fifth 1659. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Cromwel</hi> had it as Succeſſor to his Father. 7ly, From <hi>April</hi> the twenty fifth 1659. to <hi>May</hi> the ſeventh of the ſame year it was no where.

                  <p>Nor I.

                  <p>This was not <hi>Oliver</hi>'s method; for though this <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Victory had been as glorious as that of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> yet it was not the Victory that made <hi>Oliver</hi> General, but the reſignation of <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of it to <hi>Cromwel</hi> by the Parliament.</p>

                  <p>But <hi>Lambert</hi> thought ſo well of himſelf, as to expect it; therefore at his return to <hi>London,</hi> he and other Officers aſſembling at <hi>Wallingford-houſe,</hi> drew their Petition into form, and called it a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein the chief point was to have a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; with many other of leſs importance that were added: And this they repreſented to the Houſe <hi>October</hi> the 4th, by Major General <hi>Desborough.</hi> And this ſo far forth awed them, as to teach them ſo much good manners, as to promiſe to take it preſently into debate, which they did; and <hi>October</hi> the 12th, having recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Spirits, Voted, That the Commiſſions of <hi>Lambert, Desborough,</hi> and others of the Council at <hi>Wallingford-houſe,</hi> ſhould be void. <hi>Item,</hi> That the Army ſhould be governed by a Commiſſion to <hi>Fleet-wood, Monk, Haſlerig, Walton, Morley,</hi> and <hi>Overton,</hi> till <hi>Feb.</hi> the 12th following; and to make this good againſt the Force they expected from <hi>Lambert,</hi> they ordered <hi>Haſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:66130:103"/>and <hi>Morley</hi> to iſſue Warrants to ſuch Officers as they could truſt, to bring their Soldiers next Morning into <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which was done ſomewhat too late, for <hi>Lambert</hi> had firſt brought his Soldiers thither, and beſet the Houſe, and turn'd back the Speaker, which was then coming to it; but <hi>Haſlerig</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces marching about St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park wall, came into St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Church-yard, and ſo both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties looked all day one upon another like Enemies, but offered not to fight; whereby the Rump was put out of poſſeſſion of the Houſe, and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers continued their meeting as before, at <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford houſe;</hi> there they choſe from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with ſome few of the City, a Committee, which they called <hi>The Committee of Safety,</hi> whereof the chief were <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Vane,</hi> who, with the advice of a General Council of Officers, had Power to call Delinquents to Tryal, to ſuppreſs Rebellions, to treat with Foreign States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You ſee now the Rump cut off, and the Supreme Power (which is charged with <hi>Salus Populi</hi>) transferred to a Council of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and yet <hi>Lambert</hi> hopes for it at the end. But one of their Limitations was, That they ſhould within ſix Weeks preſent to the Army a new Model of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. If they had done ſo, do you think they would have preſer'd <hi>Lambert,</hi> or any other, to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority rather than themſelves?</p>

                  <p>I think not. When the Rump had put into Commiſſion (among a few others) for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Army, that is, for the Government of the three Nations, General <hi>Monk,</hi> already Commander in chief of the Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that had done much greater things in this War than <hi>Lambert,</hi> how durſt they leave him out of this Committee of Safety? or how could <hi>Lambert</hi> think that General <hi>Monk</hi> would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it and not endeavour to faſten the Rump again.</p>

                  <p>They thought not of him, his Gallantry had been ſhown on remote Stages, <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:66130:103"/>his Ambition had not appeared here in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention for the Government, but he had complied both with <hi>Richard</hi> and the <hi>Rump.</hi> After General <hi>Monk</hi> had ſignified by Letter his diſlike of the proceedings of <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Fellows, they were much ſurpriz'd, and began to think him more conſiderable than they had done, but it was too late.</p>

                  <p>The General knew very well his own and their Forces, both what they were then, and how they were to be augmented, and what generally City and Country wiſhed for, which was the Reſtitution of the King; which to bring about, there needed no more but to come with his Army (though not very great) to <hi>London,</hi> to the doing whereof there was no obſtacle but the Army with <hi>Lambert.</hi> What could he do in this Caſe? If he had declar'd preſently for the King, or for a free Parliament, all the Armies in <hi>England</hi> would have joyned againſt him, and, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Title of a Parliament, would have furniſhed themſelves with Money.

                     </gap>neral <hi>Monk,</hi> after he had thus quarrelled by his Letter with the Council of Officers, he ſecur'd firſt thoſe Officers of his own Army which were <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and therefore not to be truſted, and put others into their places; then drawing his Forces together, march'd to <hi>Berwick.</hi> Being there he indicted a Convention of the <hi>Scots,</hi> of whom he deſired, That they would take order for the ſecurity of the Nation in his abſence and raiſe ſome maintenance for his Army in their march. The Convention promis'd for the ſecurity of the Nation, their beſt endeavour, and rais'd him a ſum of money not great, but enough for his purpoſe, excuſing themſelves upon their preſent wants. On the other ſide, the Committee of Safety, with the greateſt and beſt part of their Army, ſent <hi>Lambert</hi> to oppoſe him; but at the ſame time, by divers Meſſages and Mediators, urged him to a Treaty,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66130:104"/>which he conſented to, and ſent 3 Officers to <hi>London</hi> to treat with as many of theirs. Theſe ſix ſuddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, without power from the General, upon theſe Articles, That the King be excluded, a free State ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Miniſtry and Univerſities encouraged, with divers which the General liked not, and impriſoned one of his Commiſſioners for exceeding his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereupon another Treaty was agreed on, of five to five. But whilſt theſe Treaties were in hand, <hi>Haſlerig,</hi> a Member of the Rump, ſeized on <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and the Soldiers ſent by the Committee of Safety to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, inſtead of that entred into the Town, and joyned with <hi>Haſlerig.</hi> Secondly, the City renewed their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults for a free Parliament. Thirdly, the Lord <hi>Fair fax,</hi> a Member alſo of the Rump, and greatly favoured in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> was raiſing Forces there behind <hi>Lambert;</hi> who being now between two Armies, his Enemies, would gladly have fought the General. Fourthly, there came news that <hi>Devon-ſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwal</hi> were liſting of Soldiers. Laſtly, <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army wanting Money, and ſure they ſhould not be furniſhed from the Council of Officers, which had neither Authority nor Strength to levy money, grew diſcontented and for their Free-Quarter were odious to the Northern Countries.</p>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>I wonder why the <hi>Scots</hi> were ſo ready to furniſh General <hi>Monk</hi> with money, for they were no Friends to the Rump.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>I know not; but I believe the <hi>Scots</hi> would have parted with a greater Sum, rather than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould not have gone together by the Ears among themſelves. The Council of Officers being now beſet with ſo many Enemies, produced ſpeedily their Model of Government, which was to have a free Parliament, which ſhould meet <hi>December</hi> 15, but with ſuch Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of no King, no Houſe of Lords, as made the City more angry than before. To ſend Soldiers into the Weſt, to ſuppreſs thoſe that were riſing there they durſt not, for fear of the City; nor could they raiſe
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:66130:104"/>any other, for want of money; there remained nothing but to break, and quitting <hi>Wallingford-houſe,</hi> to ſhift for themſelves. This coming to the knowledge of their Army in the North, they deſerted <hi>Lambert,</hi> and the Rumpers, <hi>December</hi> 26, re-poſſeſſed the Houſe.</p>

                  <p>Seeing the Rump was now reſeated, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pretended by General <hi>Monk</hi> for his marching to <hi>London,</hi> was at an end.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>The Rump, though ſeated, was not well ſetled, but (in the midſt of ſo many Tumults for a free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) had as much need of the General's coming up now, as before. He therefore ſent them word, that becauſe he thought them not yet ſecure enough, he would come up to <hi>London</hi> with his Army; which they not only accepted of, but entreated him ſo to do, and voted him for his ſervice 1000 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> a year.</p>
                  <p>The General marching towards <hi>London,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try every where Petition'd him for a free Parliament. The Rump, to make room in <hi>London</hi> for his Army, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodg'd their own. The General, for all that, had not let fall a word in all this time, that could be taken for a Declaration of his Final Deſign.</p>

                  <p>How did the Rump revenge themſelves on <hi>Lambert?</hi>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>They never troubled him; nor do I know any cauſe of their ſo gentle dealing with him. But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Lambert</hi> was the ableſt of any Officer they had to do them ſervice, when they ſhould have means and need to imploy him. After the General was come to <hi>London,</hi> the Rump ſent to the City for their part of a Tax of 100000 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> a month for ſix months, according to an Act which the Rump had made formerly before their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin by the Committee of Safety. But the City, who were averſe to the Rump, and keen upon a free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could not be brought to give their money to their Enemies, and to purpoſes repugnant to their own; whereupon the Rump ſent Order to the General to break down the City Gates, and their Portcullices, and to impriſon certain obſtinate Citizens: This he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and it was the laſt ſervice he did them.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:66130:105"/>
                  <p>About this time the Commiſſion, by which General <hi>Monk</hi> with others had the Government of the Army put into their hands by the Rump, before the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Council of Officers, came to expire, which the preſent Rump renewed.</p>

                  <p>He was thereby the ſixth part of the General of the whole Forces of the Common-wealth; if I had been as the Rump, he ſhould have been ſole General. In ſuch caſes as this, there cannot be a greater Vice than pinching: Ambition ſhould be liberal.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>After the pulling down of the City Gates, the General ſent a Letter to the Rump, to let them know that this ſervice was much againſt his Nature; and to put them in mind, how well the City had ſerv'd the Parliament in the whole War.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but for the City the Parliament could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have made the War, nor the Rump ever have murdered the King.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>The Rump conſidered not the Merit of the City, nor the good nature of the General, they were buſie, they were giving out Commiſſions, making of Acts for Abjuration of the King and his Line, and for the Ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The General alſo deſir'd to hear a Conference between ſome of the Rump, and ſome of the ſecluded Members, concerning the Juſtice of their Secluſion, and of the hurt that could follow upon their re-admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and it was granted. After long Conference, the General finding the Rumps pretences unreaſonable and ambitious, declar'd himſelf with the City for a free Parliament, and came to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with the ſecluded Members, (whom he had appointed to meet and ſtay for him at <hi>Whitehall</hi>) and re-placed them in the Houſe among the Rumpers; ſo that now the ſame Cattel that were in the Houſe of Commons in 1640.

I have ſeen in this Revolution a circular motion of the Soveraign Power, through two Uſurpers, from the late King, to this his Son; for (leaving out the power of the Council of Officers, which was but temporary, and no otherwiſe owned by them, but in truſt) it moved from King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, to the Long-Parliament, from thence to the Rump, from the Rump to <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and then back again from <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> to the Rump, thence to the Long-Parliament, and thence to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, where long may it remain.</p>
