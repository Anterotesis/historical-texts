            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SEeing it hath pleaſed God out of his gracious will and pleaſure, to cauſe me to caſt my Eye upon this Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> my native Country, (and your three Kingdomes;) and viewing there, to behold the ſad and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table condition, that now, and for many years paſt, it hath been intangled in; which as Reaſon and Conſcience together per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades me, is occaſioned chiefly for want of its ancient and ever cuſtomed way of Government, (to wir) a King and Parliament, which hath been unſetled altogether amongſt us, ever ſince the unhappy death of your Majeſties late father our King; by reaſon whereof, our ancient and accuſtomed whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws both of Church and State, are moſt ſtrangely torn and maſſacred; and all through the ſelf-ſeeking ends of ſome certain perſons, which at preſent I judge not fit herein to be communicated, who having gotten the power of the ſword in their hands, thought for ever to rule and reign over their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers; (I think in ſpight of God or man:) But of late ſome of thoſe (I hope I may truly bleſs the name of the Lord for it,) who were the chief Rulers of thoſe unhappy Differences between our King, and his three poor diſtracted Kingdomes, are taken out of this World; inſomuch, that the Power of thoſe remaining, is much weakened; But yet they will (I perceive) ſeek to tread in the felf ſame ſteps of them that have gone before them, as ſeeking only to ſet up their own Intereſt,

although to the utter ruine of the Nation. Studying how of littleneſs to become great, hating the name of a King, but would joyfully imbrace the power thereof, (yea, I may ſay, they ſeek far more Power, than ever our late King did take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him,) and all this done under the zealous pretence of Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Religion; the form or manner whereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by their tollerating and ſetting up of ſtrange Sects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I queſtion not but your Majeſty is very well knowing of the Power, which for ſome few years paſt, I have had in governing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army here in <hi>Scotland;</hi> which Power, when I had once obtained, I did reſolve, as much as in me lay, to keep, until a fit time and opportunity ſhould offer it ſelf, that I might imploy it for the glory of God, and the good of your Majeſty, whoſe faithful Subject I humbly acknowledge my ſelf to be. Now ſo it is, may it pleaſe your Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I plainly ſeeing, and with a ſad heart beholding the threatning hand of the Lords ſevere Judgements ſtretched forth againſt theſe three Kingdoms, which forthwith muſt, and will inevitably fall heavy upon us, (for ought as can be imagined, to the utter ruin both of King and Subjects) unleſs ſuddenly prevented by our humble ſubmiſſion to the Lord, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Repentance of our former miſcarriages. May it alſo pleaſe your Majeſty to give me leave to acquaint you, that I humbly conceive, I had never a better opportunity of doing my Country ſervice, (in freeing them from their <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, as I may term it,) and in reſtoring the Crown to the right owner thereof; which if poſſible to be done, ſhall be done with as much care, ſafety, and diligence, as God ſhall enable me, and that with as little wrong as may be either to King or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; which work when it is perfected, I hope will tend to the ſettlement of our ancient Proteſtant Religion: In tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all which Premiſes, I moſt humbly beg that high favour of your Majeſty, that you will be graciouſly pleaſed, to permit me to make theſe Propoſals following. Firſt, whether your Majeſty will be pleaſed, to accept of the real endeavours of me your unworthy Subject and Servant to be imployed in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57434:3"/>
a means in helping your Majeſty to a quiet and ſafe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of three Kingdoms; which have (with violence) been ſo long time withheld from you? If yea, Then, Will your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty be pleaſed, to conſent to a Treaty to be had between your Majeſty, and a free Parliament, which ſhall be lawfully E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and Choſen by the Country, whoſe care I hope will be for the chooſing of ſuch honeſt, godly, and religious men, as had no hand in the death of our late King, or ſince his death, have (by any unlawful means whatſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) enjoyed any of his Lands, Tenements, or Rents, or the Lands, Tenements, and Rents, of the late Deans and Chapters, or any of your late ſequeſtred Subjects, or which ſince his death have appeared violent in their acting againſt Kingſhip, and conſequently againſt your Majeſty, our lawful King: Not in the leaſt that I have any malice or evil will againſt ſuch perſons, but for that my Conſcience tells me, that ſo long, as ſelf-intereſſed perſons are ſuffered to ſit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, there is little good to be expected, either for King or Kingdome; for it is a hard thing for men to act againſt their own ſelves, to the loſs of their Lands and Livings; which they ſuppoſe they have ſo honeſtly gained. If your Majeſty will be pleaſed to conſent to ſuch a Treaty, and that thereupon it may be agreed upon, that your Majeſty ſhall be reſtored to your three Kingdoms; which I queſtion not, but will be the event of ſuch a Treaty: Then I humbly beg, that your Maj. would be pleaſed to think fit to declare what mercy and pitty, you are pleaſed ſhall be ſhewn to all thoſe that have been the chief of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, (whoſe blood in ſeverity of juſtice, might deſervedly be ſpilt,) upon their humble ſubmiſſion to your Majeſty, and their promiſe of future obedience; for I hope you will judge, that the onely way to joyn the hearts of the People of your three Kingdoms, to pray for your happy ſucceſs in all things; and not only ſo, but it will undoubtedly encourage them all to venter their Lives againſt all your oppoſers, if any ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt: and alſo that your Majeſty would be pleaſed, to declare out of your gracious goodneſs, what ſatisfaction ſhall be made to the poor Common Souldiery throughout your three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, who have been forced to take up Arms, although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Majeſty, for meer neceſſity to keep them and their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57434:4"/>
Families from ſtarving, who indeed are much behind in their pay; which will be utterly loſt and undone, unleſs your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty take compaſſion upon them; which if you are pleaſed ſo to do, I queſtion not but you will find as much humility and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from them, as can be expected; and for the future it will ingage them to be as ready to ſerve your Majeſty, as they were to ſerve your enemies for the time paſt: And moreover, I conceive it will be a great incouragment to them, to joyn with me in this deſign. I ſhall trouble your Majeſty with little more at preſent; But to let you know, that my hopes are, that you would be pleaſed, to have that confidence in me, as not to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit any rumours or reports, that may ſeemingly contradict what I have herein propoſed; for as for that, I would have your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be confident, that I ſhall not value neither the ill will, or yet look upon the favour of any, who ſhall yet appear in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to a thing that I have ſo really purpoſed, ſo long as God and my Conſcience perſwades me, that in ſo doing I ſhall accompliſh a good Work both for his glory, and my Countries good: and yet I think fit to carry as fair a correſpondency as I can, with thoſe that have taken upon them the Authority in <hi>England:</hi> To that end, I have thoughts of going to <hi>London</hi> very ſuddenly, that I may ſee their actings, and order things there ſomewhat for my advantage; I humbly beg your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſpeedy Anſwer touching theſe Propoſals: So with all ſubmiſſiveneſs, I crave your Majeſties favour, in giving me leave to ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

               <p n="1">1. To the firſt, you are pleaſed to intimate the joy of the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers that they ſee us ſtand to our Declaration, but I believe, that this violent interruption <hi>of the Parliament was the greateſt</hi> courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to gratefie that <hi>Family and Intereſt</hi> that could be imagined in the World, <hi>(and I could wiſh it were not deſigned).</hi> I ſhould be very ſad to ſtrengthen the hands of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> but let me aſſure you, this ariſeth from the ſlanders and calumnies which men caſt upon us in <hi>England,</hi> as if <hi>we that aſſert the Authority of thoſe that brought the late King to the Block, are for introducing that Family,</hi> which I take <hi>God to witneſs, we in our very thoughts abhor, and ſhall ſpend our blood in oppoſition to any Single perſon whatſoe ver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You are pleaſed to compare our preſent differences to that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> with the two Tribes of <hi>Reuben, Gad,</hi> and halfe the Tribe of <hi>Manaſſes)</hi> and I earneſtly pray that there may be the ſame iſſue, for if they will reſtore <hi>theſe perſons</hi> to their <hi>lawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which have been eſtabliſhed by many ſucceſſes,</hi> and for the difference of which they ſo lately hazarded to blood <hi>we ſhall quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſit down and wait upon the Providences of God in our places and Stations,</hi> and to this end we have ſent Commiſſioners into <hi>England</hi> men faithfull and approved. What you are pleaſed to inſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my ſatisfaction in the year 1653. When this Parliament was interrupted formerly, I ſhall anſwer you to that, it was never in my Conſcience to go out of Gods way under the pretence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods work, and you know the variety of times doth much vary the nature of affaires, and what might then patiently be ſubmitted unto, we being engaged with a forraign Enemy in a bloody War,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57434:10"/>
cannot be drawn into a preſident at this time; after our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and aſſurance of Loyalty and Conſtancy; you may be pleaſed to remember <hi>that the conſequence of the former Interruptions was the Introduction of a ſingle perſon, and a manifeſt breach of all our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and engagements,</hi> ſo that if God bleſſed me with ſucceſs, then I do much more through mercy expect it now, when I put all to hazzard for the Glory of God and the good of his people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I do acknowledge that the Army hath been in the hand of God and inſtruments of good to theſe Nations, yet if they ſhall apoſtate from the Cauſe of God and his people in expoſing them to Arbitrary Power, and the wills of men, in taking upon them to Abolliſh Lawes, raiſe money without conſent of the people, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Miniſtery and property, and force Parliaments, I cannot but witneſs againſt ſuch proceedings as unwarrantable not ſuited to any rule either from God or man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>I have taken care by Garriſons in this Country, and aſſurance from the whole body of the Nation, that they will not own the intereſt of</hi> Charles Stewart., and that they will preſerve the peace of the Commonwealth in obedience to the parliament; So that if that part of the Army in <hi>England</hi> will ſet up a diſtinct intereſt in the Nation, in deſerting that Cauſe that hath been ſo precious to us, and coſt ſo much blood and treaſure for to eſtabliſh their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and greatneſs.

by divers of my friends and relations, purporting the recalling the Members ſecluded 1648. as the beſt expedient for eſtabliſhing theſe Nations upon a foundation of laſting peace. I have taken the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from my relation to ſome of you as allyed, and my affectionate reſpects to all of you as dear Friends and Countrey-men, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your conſideration my preſent apprehenſions of the ſtate of Affairs here, in order to all our better ſatisfactions; wherein I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave your leave of freedom without prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before theſe unhappy Wars the Government of theſe Nations was Monarchical in Church and State: theſe wars have given birth and growth to ſeveral Intereſts both in Church and State hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not known; though now upon many accounts very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the</hi> Presbyterian, Independent, Anabaptiſt <hi>and</hi> Sectaries <hi>of all ſorts as to Eccleſiaſticks; and the Purchaſers of the Kings, Queens, Princes, Biſhops, Deans and Chapters, and all other forfeited Eſtates; and all thoſe engaged in theſe Wars againſt the King as to civils. Theſe Intereſts again are ſo interwoven by Purchaſes and intermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and thereby forfeited; as I think upon rational grounds it may be taken for granted;</hi> That no Government can be either good, peaceful or laſting to theſe Nations, that doth not rationally include and comprehend the ſecurity and preſervrtion of all the foreſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts both Civil and Spiritual; I mean ſo far as by the Word of God they are warranted to be protected and preſerved. If this be ſo, Then that Government under which we formerly were both in State and Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Monarchy cannot poſſibly be admitted for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in theſe Nations, becauſe its ſupport is taken away, and becauſe its excluſive of all the former Intereſts both Civil and Spiritual, all of them being incompatible with Monarchical Vniformity in Church and State thus expired. <hi>That</hi> Government then that is moſt able to comprehend and protect all Intereſts as aforeſaid muſt needs be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to me it's no ſmall doubt, if upon the Premiſes to admit of the Members ſecluded 1648. were not to obſtruct our peace and continue our War, rather than eſtabliſh the one, and end the other; in that very many of thoſe Members aſſert the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Intereſt, together with the abolition of all Laws made ſince
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57434:12"/>
their ſecluſion; Which I fear upon accompt of ſelf-preſervation both of Life and Eſtate as well as Spiritual Liberty, will immediatly involve all theſe Nations in moſt horrid and bloody War afreſh; <hi>the very apprehenſions whereof, I confeſs, I do infinitely dread,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the dangerous conſequence thereof to your prudent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the rather, ſeeing the Army alſo will never endure it.</p>
               <p>Having thus briefly laid before you the preſent condition of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, let me now intreat you to conſider whither it were not better to deſiſt from that Paper, and ſubmit to the proceedings of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> who have reſolved to fill up their Houſe, determin their ſitting, and prepare a way for future ſucceſſions of Parliament; by which means being full, and thereby comprehending the whole Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of theſe Nations, they may through God's Mercy, and all our patiences, eſtabliſh ſuch a Government in the <hi>way of a Common-wealth,</hi> as may be comprehenſive of all intereſts both Spirituall and Civil, to the glory of God, and the weale and peace of the whole. But if by your impatiencies they be obſtructed, <hi>our peace will be ſo much the longer a ſtranger to us;</hi> and we thereby a prey to our ſelves, and all forreign Enemies.

                  <salute>Dear Brethen and Fellow Souldiers,</salute>

               <p>WE moſt heartily wiſh Grace and Truth to be multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, through the knowledge of God, and of Jeſus our Lord; And alſo we deſire the God and Father of all Grace, to add to your Faith, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; &amp; to Vertue, Knowledg; and to Knowledge, Temperance; and to Temperance, Godlineſs; and to Godlineſs, Brotherly Kindneſs; and to Brotherly Kindneſs, Charity.</p>
               <p>Dear Brethren, We cannot but be deeply affected and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our own ſpirits, to conſider of your diſſatisfaction with us upon miſtaken grounds. You have known us this many years to be your faithful Brethren, that durſt do nothing that is ſinful; And we may affirm with plainneſs, honeſty and ſimplicity of heart, we have done nothing in the late Revolution, but that which the Providence of the moſt wiſe God prepared to our

hands, and led us unto, without ſo much as one half hours time to deſign or reſolve to take that courſe we were neceſſitated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; Since which moſt of ſuch perſons that were not clear in the preſent and ſudden Action, have made their acknowledment of their full ſatisfaction, and we are mutually reconciled, and they are received and tendered by us as affectionate Brethren: And for a more full Narrative of the providential Grounds, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Steps that led us to that Work, yet (with aking hearts) and as an Anſwer to your Queries, ſigned in your name by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Clerk,</hi> Secretary, bearing date the 22. inſtant, We refer you to a Book, Intituled, <hi>The Armies Plea,</hi> and alſo, <hi>The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Declaration,</hi> relation thereunto being had, we hope will give you ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Loving Brethren, What have we done that you are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? we are not conſcious that any thing is acted by us upon the publick Theater, but that which we judge is acceptable to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And what we have done hath proceeded from uprightneſs of heart, and for the glory of God, the good of his Intreſt, Cauſe, and People in theſe Nations: Nothing leſs than theſe worthy ends could have cauſed us to adventure our <hi>All,</hi> that is dear to us for your and their ſakes; And after ſuch a hazard, our Brethren to look ſhy upon us, yea ſuch, with whom we have lived, and converſed together, prayed, fought, and jeoparded our lives to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and witneſſes together of the glory of the moſt high God. in the high places of the field; Yea, we that are of one Society, of one Family and Houſhold, that none hitherto (through the grace of God could diſ-unite us) now to be at a diſtance with us, is the greateſt wound to us, which is unexpreſſable: If it had been from our Enemies, we could have born it; Oh but, they are the wounds of the houſe of our Friends. And all this ariſing without dealing brotherly with us, and without ſo much as ſending to know the providential Grounds that led us to theſe Undertakings; And likewiſe your and our unhappineſs hath been poſſibly by miſ-informations received by thoſe who have correſponded with the principal occaſioners of this Breach; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are cenſured by you, we ſhall, we hope, carry Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly and Brotherly towards you, and exerciſe our ſelves in the Doctrine of our Saviour, <hi>If any be overtaken in a fault, reſtore</hi>

                  <hi>ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, knowing alſo, we are ſubject to like temptations:</hi> And we ought to pitty and pray for one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and forgive one another, <hi>even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven us;</hi> We hope the fear of God will guide you, ſo that you may do nothing to grieve Him and his little Flock, and rejoyce the common Enemy abroad and at home, nor give them advantages to make a prey of theſe poor Nations: What can you propound to your ſelves? If you are for good things, ſo are we; if for a Free-State and Common-wealth, ſo are we; if againſt a Single Perſon, ſo are we; if for Reformation, ſo are we; if for Godlineſs, and the Nations to be exalted in Righteouſneſs, ſo are we; Why do we differ in the form and way to it?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you our moſt hearty wiſhes and prayers, That Grace, and Truth, and Peace alſo might be multiplied unto you: And that to your Faith, and your Vertue, and your Knowledge, and your Temperance, and your Godlineſs, and your brotherly Kindneſs, and your Charity, might be added, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Meekneſs, and Humility, and Self-denial. Great are the thoughts of our hearts, for the diviſions in <hi>Reuben,</hi> and we are (as you expreſs it) deeply affected and afflicted in our own ſpirits, when we conſider what cauſe we have to be diſſatisfied with you, our dear Brethren; you, with whom we have lived and converſed together; with whom we have prayed and fought and jeoparded our lives together; with whom we have taken ſweet Counſel, and walked together in the Houſe of God as Friends: But we cannot conceal from you that our Affection
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57434:15"/>
and Affliction of ſpirit is much increaſed by the Letter you ſent us by Captain <hi>Deane,</hi> and by the Books you referred us to in that Letter. We had before ſome ſmall (indeed our onely) hopes that there might be ſome miſtake between us; but alas! We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but now think (ſince we find you have no more to ſay for your ſelves) that Our fears were but too true &amp; the Cauſes of our Diſſatisfaction at your preſent actings but too juſt: We ſhall deal with you with that plainneſs and freedom, and ſincerity that becometh Brethren, for ſo we think it becometh us, <hi>To fulfil all Righteouſneſs:</hi> And ſo we think it expedient both for you and us, that We may the ſooner come to a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of another.</p>
               <p>We could not be ſatisfied that there was any ſuch need of more General Officers (the firſt occaſion of this unhappy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) as that the Parliament ſhould be preſſed to it ſo unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, and ſo juſt a jealouſie created in them that there was a Deſign to ſet up a Single Perſon (of which they had but ſo late, and ſo ſad experience) and we could not but think it ſufficient for the ſecurity of the good Intereſt, that the Army was united under one head, the Parliament.</p>
               <p>We were leſs ſatisfied, that after you declared your Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Acquieſcence in the Votes of the Houſe, you ſhould endeavour by a new way to wreſt the Power out of their own hands, and to proſecute the ſame Deſigne; This making the Army a Corporation in a manner Independent from the Civil Power, and creating to it an Intereſt, diſtinct from that of the Peoples, by whom they hitherto have, and ſtill muſt live, and for whom they are by their Engagements and Duties bound to dye: and that after you knew the Parliament had in effect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved your Petition, you ſhould ſtill endeavour to get more hands to it, which neither the Parliament, not we our ſelves could look upon any otherwiſe, then as a deſign to force the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to grant what they had already in effect diſapproved, if not to do that which you ſay was done, at leſs then half an hours warning.</p>
               <p>But then that after the ſad experience of ſo many confuſions &amp; toſſings, which theſe poor Nations had already felt by ſuch act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as theſe, after the unhappy (&amp; ſince acknowledged unlawful) former interruption of that (by your ſelves called) <hi>famous long</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:57434:16"/>
                  <hi>Parliament,</hi> after the Confuſions and Diſtractions of that <hi>little one</hi> of your own, and not of the Peoples chooſing; after the occaſion by them given to ſome of ſetting up, and the neceſſity impoſed on us of accepting a Single Perſon, contrary to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Engagements, and to our Intereſts; after our late renewed Engagement, and our ſolemn and ſerious expreſſions of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, That you ſhould ſo ſoon return to your former ſin, and for the apparent intereſt of nine or ten Perſons (who how pretious ſoever, yet cannot be worth the blood that may be ſhed in this quarrel) to put a new force upon the Parliament, and to deſtroy all Lawful Authority in the three Nations, and to put them out of hopes of ever having any for the future, but what ſhall be at your diſpoſals; and to do theſe things in the Name of the whole Army, thereby uſurping a Power over your Brethren, to which you have no right, and involving us in the ſame guilt with yours in the ſame actings, againſt which we are bound to proteſt before God and man: This is that which lieth the ſoreſt upon our Spirits; This is that which wounds us deepeſt.</p>
               <p>This is that which muſt of neceſſity make the three Nations ſlaves to the Army the Armies of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſlaves to that of <hi>England,</hi> and that of <hi>England</hi> to nine or ten Perſons, and perhaps in ſhort time thoſe nine or ten, to one ſingle One. The beſt effect it can have muſt be that which you ſo much complain of in the <hi>Armies Plea,</hi> page 25.</p>
               <p>That all the pious and good People of this Nation ſhall not enjoy a peaceable and quiet life in all Godlineſs and Hodeſty, but onely ſome part of them.</p>
               <p>We cannot but in the Name of the Lord tell you, that theſe Actings make us ſtink in the noſtrils of the good People, and cauſe the Name of God to be evil ſpoken of, and his Enemies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice.</p>
               <p>And yet you ſay, Behold, what we have done? and tell us in many, but very general terms, what good things you are for: We likewiſe are for good things as well as you; We are for a Free-State and Commonwealth as well as you; We are againſt a ſingle Perſon as well as you; We are for Reformation as well as yon: We are as well as you for Godlineſs and the Nations to be exalted in Righteouſneſs; if ſo be that you be indeed for theſe things which you pretend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that we differ not in the end as well as in the way to it!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57434:16"/>
But how can you be for good things, as long as you do that which is Evil? How can you be for a Free State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, if for the Intereſt of nine or ten Perſons you diſſolve Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments? To what purpoſe is it to be againſt a ſingle Perſon, if you be for nine or ten; or for Reformation, if you return ſo ſoon to former ſins? Or, how can Godlineſs or Righteouſneſs be exalted, by violent and unwarrantable means?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> Our daily prayer to God is, That we may not be neceſſitated to War with you; but if we be, we muſt tell you that we do not precipitate our ſelves, or run raſhly or inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately into it; We have had time, ſadly and ſeriouſly to conſider the whole Matter, and we muſt deal plainly with you, and tell you, that what you pretend, you had not half an hours time to deliberate about, We have expected from you ſome weeks; We could not but take notice that the occaſion both of Calling and interrupting this Parliament, was, the making of General Officers.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received a Letter from your Lordſhip, and the reſt of the Common-Council, of the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and do humbly thank you for that great eſteem which you are pleaſed to put upon our poor Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the Parliaments Army under my Command, far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending our Merits and Services.

               <p>As your prudent Counſels and couragious Actings, were the great means under God of reſtoring this Parliament to its juſt and lawful Authority, ſo of the ſafety and welfare of the Nations, for which I do for my Self and the reſt of the Officers here, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn my very hearty thanks, and we ſhall have ever cauſe to bleſs the Lord for this great mercy, in putting into your hearts ſuch righteous and honourable Reſolutions, to appear at ſuch a time, when our Liberties and Properties, and all that is dear unto us, even the Ordinances of our bleſſed Saviour, were in ſuch hazard.</p>

Indeed, it was much in our hopes, that ſuch a glorious City, that had redeemed themſelves from ſlavery at the price of ſo much blood and treaſure, and had been the great Inſtruments in the hand of God, for the carrying on the Work of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bringing three Nations out of the Captivity of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Arbitrary Government, could ever conſent to ſuch ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and unjuſt proceedings. As we do acknowledge your great activity in promoting thoſe great Ends which we lately repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, ſo we do heartily thank you for the honour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, which you have been pleaſed in this your Letter to give to the Parliaments Army here; for our ſelves, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to ſeek (we bleſs the Lord) in all this Affair, but to endeavour the ſafety and Settlement of theſe Nations in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and of the famous City in particular.</p>
               <p>We received your encloſed Declaration, and do chearfully joyn with you therein. And I do promiſe you for the Army under my Command, that they are reſolved (by the aſſiſtance of God) to ſtand by and maintain this preſent Parliament, as it ſate on <hi>October</hi> 11. from whom we received our Commiſſions; and do hope, that you that have been ſo eminently Inſtrumental in their reſtoring, will heartily concur with us therein; and ſhall to the utmoſt of our power defend the freedom of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Parliaments, and the Liberties Spiritual and Civil of the People in theſe Nations, and ſhall encourage in our Stations, the Godly and Learned Miniſters, and ſhall continue faithful in this Good Cauſe, that the Nations may be ſtabliſhed in a Free Common-wealth, and the Army kept in due obedience to the Civil Authority.</p>

               <p>I Received yours of the 22<hi>d.</hi> inſtant, and deſire to return to our good God hearty thanks, that he hath been pleaſed to own and appear for his People in ſuch glorious inſtances of Mercy and Deliverance. I bleſs the Lord, I never doubted of his preſence and ſucceſs in this undertaking, being ſo righteous a Cauſe; and had long ſince put it to Gods deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but upon advertiſements from Friends in <hi>England,</hi> That if I could continue here without engaging till the firſt of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> the work would be done without blood. I cannot but admire upon what Intelligence you ſhould be perſwaded of a ſecond Treaty: Indeed <hi>I</hi> was inforced to make uſe of ſuch an Overture, to remove the Commiſſioners from <hi>London,</hi> whom I cannot but blame for receding from their Inſtructions; but I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57434:20"/>
hope they will give you a ſatisfactory account of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Yet I acknowledge that I could not but reſent their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, having ſecured one of them for betraying the private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; of which I doubt not but you have been fully infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>My laſt Anſwer to the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> who ſent ſeveral Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to invite me to a ſecond Treaty, was, That I could not treat without authority from the Commiſſioners for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Army, and to that end deſired a Paſs for the ſame Meſſengers to go to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to receive their Commands and Inſtructions; who was returned back with this Anſwer from <hi>Lambert</hi> and the Council of Officers, That they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto: and ſince that, I have not heard from them.</p>
               <p>I have your Army (I bleſs God) upon the River <hi>Tweed,</hi> within three hours ready to be drawn together, and they are very chearful and unanimous, willing to endure any hardſhip for your Service.</p>
               <p>The laſt night Capt. <hi>Campbelt</hi> came expreſs from <hi>Ireland,</hi> giving a full account of their affection to the Parliament, and of the late Tranſactions there; That they had ſeized <hi>Dublin</hi> Caſtle, and ſecured <hi>Jones</hi> and others, with a Declaration to ſtand by and own your Authority: for which (on this inſtant) we kept a day of Thanſgiving. They writ alſo to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade in <hi>England,</hi> which I diſpatched to them. Six <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> gives me an Account, that all the Forces and Garriſons in <hi>Ireland</hi> had Declared for you.</p>
               <p>This is ſuch a mercy, that I hope the Lord will make us ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, and careful to improve. They required my opinion as to managing of the Affairs of the Army, which in ſuch an urgent neceſſity I preſumed to give. I have diſpoſed of moſt of the vacant Commands in <hi>Scotland</hi> to very honeſt men, who are ready to dye for your Service, or to disband at your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And before your Letter came to hand, I had diſpoſed of Col. <hi>Saunders</hi> and Major <hi>Bartons</hi> Commands the Lord <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Forces preſſing upon me. I could not leave my vacant Places unſupplied; but I know that (this Work proſpering) you will have opportunity enough to gratifie them: Capt. <hi>Izods</hi> place is reſerved for him according to your pleaſure. I humbly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57434:20"/>
thank the Members of the Council for that Great Honour that they were pleaſed to conferr upon me, and hope you never ſhall find but ſuch an abſolute obedience from me to your Commands, that I ſhall be more ready to return that Commiſſion then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. I believe that you never doubted of my perſevering in thoſe good Principles I declared for, and that I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably (if the Lord had pleaſed to frown upon us) have ſuffered in this moſt Righteous undertaking. I have made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to March, but am unwilling to hazzard your Juſtice and Authority upon a Fight, when it may be done with more ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I ſhall attend your further Command, and deſire the Lord to bleſs your Forces and Counſels, and to reſtore you in your juſt Authority; which is both the Prayer and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of</p>

               <head>THE Lord Generall Monck HIS SPEECH Delivered by him in the PARLIAMENT On Munday, Feb. 6. 1659.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Mr. <hi>Speaker;</hi>
                  </salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AMongſt the many mercies of God to theſe poor Nations, your peaceable Reſtauration is not the leaſt: it is his work alone,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57434:24"/>
and to him belongs the glory of it: and I eſteem it as a great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his goodneſs to me, that he was pleaſed to make me amongſt many worthier in your ſervice, ſome way inſtrumental in it. I did nothing but my duty, and do not deſerve to receive ſo great honour and reſpect as you are pleaſed to give me at this time, and place; which I ſhall ever acknowledge as an high mark of your favour to me. Sir, I ſhall not now trouble you with large Narratives, onely give me leave to acquaint you, that as I marcht from <hi>Scotland</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I obſerved the people in moſt Counties in great and earneſt Expectations of Settlement; and they made ſeverall Applications to me, with numerous ſubſcriptions: the chiefeſt Heads of their deſires, were, for a free and full Parliament, and that you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine your ſitting; A Goſpel Miniſtry, Incouragement of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Univerſities, And for admittance of the Members ſecluded before 1648. without any previous Oath or Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>To which I commonly anſwered, <hi>That you are now in a free Parliament;</hi> and if there be any force remaining upon you, I would endeavour to remove it; and that you had voted to fill up your Houſe, and then you would be a full Parliament alſo; and that you had already determined your ſitting: and for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, their Maintenance, the Laws and Univerſities, you had large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in your laſt Declaration; and I was confident you would adhere to it: but as for thoſe Gentlemen ſecluded in the year 1648.</p>
               <p>I told them you had given Judgment in it; and all people ought to acquieſce in that Judgment: but to admit any Members to ſit in Parliament without a previous Oath or Engagement to ſecure the Government in being, it was never yet done in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although I ſaid it not then, I muſt ſay with pardon to you, That the leſs Oaths and Engagements are impoſed, (with reſpect had to the ſecurity of the Common Cauſe) your Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement will be the ſooner attained to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57434:24"/>
I am the more particular in theſe matters, to let you ſee how gratefull your preſent Conſultations about theſe things, will be to the people.</p>
               <p>I know all the ſober Gentry will heartily cloſe with you, if they may be tenderly and gently uſed; and I am ſure you will ſo uſe them, as knowing it to be our common Concern, to expatiate, and not narrow our intereſt; and to be carefull neither the <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> nor <hi>Phanatique party</hi> have yet a ſhare in your Civil or Military Power; of the laſt of whoſe impatience to Government, you have had ſo ſevere experience.</p>
               <p>I ſhould ſay ſomething of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scoland:</hi> Indeed <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is in an ill condition, and made worſe by your ſudden In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, which pretended the paſſing an Act for the ſettlement of the Eſtates of Adventures and Souldiers there, which I heard you intended to have done in a few days; and I preſume it will be quickly done, being ſo neceſſary at this time; when the wants of the Common-wealth call for ſupplyes, and people will unwillingly pay Taxes for thoſe Eſtates of which they have no legal aſſurance.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you how much your favour was abuſed in the Nomination of your Officers of your Army there; their Malice hath been ſufficiently manifeſted: I dare affirm that thoſe now that have declared for you, will continue faithfull, and thereby evince that as well there, as here, it is the ſober intereſt that muſt eſtabliſh your Dominion.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Scotland,</hi> I muſt ſay the people of that Nation deſerve much to be cheriſhed; and I believe your late Declaration will much glad their ſpirits; for nothing was more dreadfull to them, then a fear to be over-run with Phanatique Notions.</p>
               <p>I humbly recommend them to your Affection and Eſteem, and deſire the intended Act of Union may be proſecuted, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57434:25"/>
their Takes made proportionable to thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> for which I am engaged by promiſe to be an humble Suitor to you.</p>
               <p>And truly, Sir, I muſt ask leave to entreat you to make a ſpeedy proviſion for their Civil Government, of which they have been deſtitute near a year, to the ruine of many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: and except Commiſſioners for management of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Judges to ſit in Courts of Judicature, be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily appointed, that Coutry will be very miſerable.</p>
               <p>I directed Mr. <hi>Gumble</hi> lately to preſent to you ſome Names, both of Commiſſioners and Judges: but by reaſon of your great Affairs, he was not required to deliver them in writing to you; but I now humbly preſent them to your Conſideration.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57434:26"/>
of the Gates and Portculliſes, becauſe it will in all likelihood exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the City; and I have good ground of hopes from them that they will levie the Aſſeſs; They deſiring onely firſt to meet in Common-council, which they intend to do to morrow morning. It ſeems probable to me, that they will yield obedience to your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and be brought to a friendly compliance with You; for which reaſon I have ſuſpended the execution of Your commands touching the Gates and Portculliſes, till I know Your further pleaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which I deſire I may by this Bearer: I ſhall onely deſire that (ſo Your commands may be anſwered with due obedience) ſuch tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be uſed towards them, as may gain their affections: They deſired the Reſtauration of thoſe Members of their Common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil that are ſecured; which deſires of theirs I ſhall only commend to Your grave conſideration, to do therein as You ſhall think moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; and, in attendance upon Your further commands, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</p>

                  <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>VVE cannot but with thankfulneſs acknowledge the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful goodneſs of <hi>God</hi> to You, in Your return to the diſcharge of Your remaining Truſt; and Your Forces under our commands (after ſome difficulties) in bringing of Us by a tedious March in ſuch ſafety to this place, to wait upon You in aſſerting the Freedoms of our Native Countrey: and being here (as we have to our utmoſt Hazard and Power been inſtrumental in your return) ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57434:27"/>
we ſhall be ſtill ready to purſue your Commands ſo far as poſſibly we may.</p>
               <p>To evidence which, we have obſerved and executed your late Orders in relation to the Chains, Poſts, and Gates of the City: which was ſome hing grievous to us, and to the Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers under out Commands; and that becauſe we do not remember any ſuch thing that was acted upon this City in all theſe Wars; and we fear that many ſober people are much grieved at it &amp; apprehend farther force to be offered to them, while they ſeem principally to deſire the ſpeedy filling up of the Houſe, which you have declared for, as well as we have expreſs'd our juſt deſires of: and are apt to doubt, left what we have done may be ſo far from anſwering the expected end, as that it may encreaſe the diſcompoſure of mens ſpirits in the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon this occaſion, it comes freſh into our minds, that when by the treachery of ſome Officers of the Army you were interrupted: we declared to the world,</hi> That the ground of our undertaking was not only your return to your Truſt, but alſo the Vindication of the Liberties of the People, and the preſervation of the Right of our Countrey, the protection and encouragement of the godly and faithfull therein, as the eſtabliſhment of the Peace of theſe Nations. Which declarations ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e before the Lord, Angels, and men, in the day of our extremity, we (as we expect the bleſſing of the Lord upon our future undertakings) cannot but ſtill own, and ſtand by.</p>
               <p>We find that the aſſerting of the juſt Liberties of the people, is that which the generality of the Nation is much in expectation of; and that many ſober people (together with our ſelves) are under fears, left this great price that God hath put into your and our hands, (as your Servants) ſhould not be improved, but that we ſhall run in confuſion again.</p>
               <p>Therefore we humbly crave leave to preſent before you ſome grounds of our fears: we are affraid that the late wonderfull and unparallell'd deliverance, is not ſo publickly and ſolemnly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as it might be, that the Lord (who wrought ſo ſtupendiouſly) may have the glory of all: we are troubled that ſome as yet do ſit in the Houſe, who are impeached of Treaſon: we cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that divers Members of your Houſe, (who contrary to their truſt, acted in that Illegal and Tirannical Committee of Safety)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57434:28"/>
are not actually diſabled from ſitting there: <hi>Notwithſtanding Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> Lambert <hi>hath onely the Vote of</hi> Indemnity <hi>to ſecure him from as high Crimes as have been Committed in this Nation, and is not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to your Orders, yet he ſeemeth to be winked at.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We underſtand that Sir. <hi>Henry Vane</hi> upon bare pretence is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtay about the City, to the great diſſatisfaction of your beſt Friends; that there are dangerous Conſultations, and that of thoſe who had a chief hand in your late Interruption, and the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding of the whole Nations, contrary to our expectation.</p>
               <p>We find continued in the Army ſome perſons of dangerous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſuch who were active enough in the late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Though we are far from wiſhing the ruine of any, yet we could deſire that your ſignal Indulgence to late Notorious Offenders, did meet with that Candid Reception from them, as to be ſo much the more ingenuous in their profeſſed. Repentance: but we obſerve that many of them do ſeek to juſtifie themſelves, and are not without their Agents in print to palliate their foul Enormities; which maketh us yet to ſuſpect that we are in ſome danger of returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the late diſtempers that you and the Nation are but newly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from.</p>
               <p>We are not ignorant, that there are thoſe who lately ſtruck at the Root of <hi>Engliſh Parliaments</hi> in practice and Deſign, thereby have inflamed the Nation, and given great advantage to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy,</hi> yet they are not without a ſtrange confidence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate men into a belief, that they are not only Perſons againſt the one, and for the other.</p>
               <p>With grief of heart we do remember and would lament over the too palpable breach of Engagements in this Nation; Therefore we ſhould think it a duty rather to mourn over the ſame, then <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote any new Oath to be taken at this time:</hi> Yet we perceive that there is a deſign to provoke the Parliament to enforce an Oath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nation, and to take notice, that amongſt others there are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57434:28"/>
ſome who are moſt forward to promote the ſaid deſign, who have made the leaſt (if any) conſcience in keeping Engagements already taken.</p>
               <p>Here we muſt not ſilence our deep reſentment of a bold Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of dangerous conſequence, which was lately preſented to you, the conſequence whereof (if you ſhould anſwer their deſires) would be to exclude many of the moſt conſcientious and ſober ſort of men from ſerving under you in Civil and Military imployments, who have and would prove themſelves moſt faithfull, and a doore would be opened in deſign to retrive the Intereſt of thoſe who have (by the juſt hand of our gracious God) made themſelves ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently obnoxious.</p>
               <p>Moreover (which is not the leaſt part of the venome of that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition) we clearly ſee the ſame ſpirit which of late would have pull'd away the by-you-declared-juſt maintenance from Miniſters, would now provoke you by an Oath to endanger the forcing away of many of the moſt godly from their maintenance.</p>
               <p>In urging our fears from the premiſes that concerns ſome of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent principles from us, we would not be thought to (as we do not) deſign any thing that may incurre the cenſure of unjuſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidity.</p>
               <p>We freely profeſs our deſires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that tenderneſs of conſcience may have its full juſt liberty, but we cannot in judgement account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that tenderneſs of conſcience which will not ſcruple at treachery it ſelf, or any unrighteouſneſs to carrey on corrupt deſignes.</p>
               <p>Having preſented you with our fears, we ſhall adde our Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that by the help of God we ſhall ſtand by you in the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of what we have declared for; And therefore do make this humble requeſt to you: we could deſire, that whilſt you ſit, your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours may be to manifeſt your affectionate deſires for the publick good of theſe Nations; Our further deſire is, that thoſe Regiments underyour conſideration (whoſe Officers are not) may be ſpedily paſs'd.</p>
               <p>And in regard we find that the grand cauſe of the preſent heats and diſſatisfactions in the Nation is, becauſe they are not fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Parliament, and ſeeing no other probable Expedient
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57434:29"/>
whereby to keep the Nation in peace, then by filling up your Number; we muſt therefore make this our main deſire, upon which we cannot but inſiſt, that you would proceed to iſſue forth Writts in order to Elections: for the better effecting whereof we entreat, that you would conclude upon due and full Qualifications, <hi>that not only thoſe who have been actually in Arms againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may be excluded, but alſo ſuch who in the late Wars betwixt King and Parliament, have declared their diſ-affection to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi> And becauſe the diſtracted condition of this Nation is at this hour ſo evident and preſſing, we are conſtrained <hi>for the juſt maintenance of your Authority,</hi> and the ſatisfaction of all true Engliſh men, earneſtly to deſire, that all the Writs may be iſſued forth by Friday next, returnable at the uſuall and legall time; For we think it convenient to acquaint you, that to pacific the minds of this great City, in the proſecution of your late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the chief of us did give an aſſurance thereof.</p>
               <p>And we muſt not forget to remember you, that the time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens wherein you have declared your intended Diſſolution; which the people and our ſelves deſire you would be punctual in.</p>
               <p>Hereby the Suſpition of your Perpetuation will be taken away, and the people will have aſſurance that they ſhall have a <hi>Succeſſion of Parliaments of their own Election; which is the undoubted Right of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have promiſed and declared no leſs:</hi> both the people and your Armies do live in the hope and expectation of it.</p>
               <p>That we may the better wait for your full and free Concurrence to theſe juſt deſires on the Nations behalf: upon Mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have thought it our duty as to continue the uſual Guards for the ſafety of your fitting, ſo for the preſent to draw the reſt of the Forces under Command into the City, that we may have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunity to compofe ſpirits and beget a good underſtanding in that great City, formerly renowned for their <hi>reſolute adhering to Parliamentary Authority,</hi> and we hope that the ſame ſpirit will be found ſtill to breath amongſt the beſt, moſt conſiderable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed perſons there.</p>
               <p>

This Action of ours, as we hope it will receive your favourable interpretation, ſo we do believe it will (through the bleſſing of God) be of good uſe for the preſent peace, and future ſettlement of theſe Nations.</p>

                  <p>IT appears unto me, by what I have heard from you and the whole Nation, that the Peace and happy Settlement of theſe bleeding Nations, next under God, lyeth in your hands.</p>
                  <p>And when I conſider that <hi>Wiſdom, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Self denial,</hi> which I have reaſon to be confident, lodgeth in you, <hi>and how great a ſhare of the Nations ſufferings will fall upon you, in caſe the</hi> Lord <hi>deny us now a</hi> Settlement, I am in very good hopes there will be found in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57434:31"/>
you all, ſuch melting bowels towards theſe poor Nations, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, that yon will become <hi>healers</hi> and <hi>makers</hi> up of all its woful <hi>breaches. And that ſuch an opportunity may clearly appear to be in your hands, I thought good to aſſure you, and that in the preſence of God, that I have nothing before my eyes but Gods glory, and the ſettlement of theſe Nations, upon Common-wealth Foundations.</hi> In purſuit whereof I ſhall think nothing to dear; And for my own particular I ſhall throw my ſelf down at your <hi>feet, to be any thing or nothing in order to theſe great Ends.</hi> As to the way of future Settlement, far be it from me to impoſe any thing, I deſire you may be in perfect Freedom; Onely give me leave to mind you, <hi>That the old Foundations are by Gods Providence ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that in the eye of Reaſon, they cannot be reſtored, but upon the ruines of the People of theſe Nations, that have engaged for their Rights in defence of the Parliament, and the great and main ends of the Covenant for uaiting and making the Lords name One in the three Nations: And alſo the Liberty of the Peoples Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in Parliament will be certainly loſt,</hi> For if the People finde, that after ſo long and bloody a war, againſt the King for break ng in upon their L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>berties, yet at laſt he muſt be taken in again, it will be out of queſtion, and is moſt man feſt, he may for the future govern by his will, diſpoſe of Parliaments, and Parliament-Men as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and yet the people will never more riſe for their aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>And as to the intereſts of this famous City (which hath been in all ages the Bulwork of Parliaments, and unto whom I am for their great affection ſo deeply engaged) <hi>Certainly it muſt lie in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; That</hi> Government <hi>onely,</hi> being capable to make them (through the Lords bleſſing) the <hi>Metropolis</hi> and <hi>Bank</hi> of Trade for all Chriſtendom, whereunto God and Nature hath fitted them above all others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And as to a Government in the Church, the want whereof hath been no ſmall cauſe of theſe Nations diſtractions; It is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,</hi> that if it be <hi>Monarchicall</hi> in the State, the Church muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and <hi>Prelacy</hi> muſt be brought in, which theſe Nations I know cannot bear, and againſt which they have ſo ſolemnly Sworn.</p>
                  <p>And indeed moderate not rigid <hi>Presbyterian Government,</hi> with a ſufficient Liberty for <hi>Conſciences</hi> truly tender, appears at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be the moſt indifferent and acceptable <hi>way</hi> to the Churches <hi>Settlement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57434:31"/>
The main thing that ſeems to lye in the way, is the intereſt of the <hi>Lords,</hi> even of thoſe <hi>Lords</hi> who have ſhewed themſelves noble indeed, <hi>by joyning with the people; and in defence of thoſe juſt rights, have adventured their deareſt blood and large Eſtates.</hi> To that I ſhall onely ſay, that though the ſtate of theſe Nations be ſuch, <hi>as cannot bear their ſitting in a diſtinct Houſe,</hi> yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the wiſdom of Parliament will find out ſuch <hi>Hereditary</hi> marks of honour for them, as may make them more noble in after ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> upon the whole matter the beſt reſult that I can make at preſent for the peace of theſe Nations will be in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that you forthwith ſit together in Parliament: In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To the ſetling the conduct of Armies of the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that manner, as they may be ſerviceable to the peace and ſafty of them, and not to its own and the Nations ruine, by Faction and Diviſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the providing ſufficient Maintenance for them; That is for the Forces by Land, and for the Navy by Sea, and all their Arrears of both, and other contingencies of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To the appointing a Council of State with Authority to ſettle the Civil Government and Judicatories in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to take care for the iſſuing forthe Writs, for the ſummoning of a <hi>Parliament</hi> of theſe three Nations united, to meet at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the 20. day of <hi>April</hi> next, <hi>with ſuch qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as may ſecure the Publick Cauſe we are all ingaged in,</hi> and according to ſuch Diſtributions as were uſed in the year, 1654. Which <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſo called, may meet and act in freedom, for the more full eſtabliſhing of this Common-Wealth, <hi>without a King, ſingle Perſon, or Houſe of Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. To a Legal Diſſolution of this <hi>Parliament</hi> to make way for <hi>ſucceſſion of Parliaments,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in order to theſe good ends, the Guards will not onely willingly admit you, but faithfully both my ſelf, and every the Officers under my command, and (I believe) the O ficers and Souldiers of the three Nations <hi>will ſpend their blood for you and ſucceſſive Parliaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57434:32"/>
If your <hi>Conjunction</hi> be directed to this end, you may part ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably, having made a fair ſtep to the ſettlement of theſe Nations, by making <hi>a way for ſucceſſive Parliaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I muſt needs ſay, that if any different Councels ſhould be taken (which I have no reaſon to fear:) theſe Nations would preſently be thrown back into force and violence, and all hopes of this much deſired eſtabliſhment buried in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the Lord in his great mercy I hope will prevent. And ſo God ſpeed you well together, and unite your hearts for the preſervation of Peace and ſettlement of theſe Nations to his own Glory and yours, and all our Comforts.</p>

               <p>WE cannot but with thankfulneſſe acknowledge the wonderful Goodneſſe of God to you in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Diſcharge of your remaining Truſt; to our ſelves, and your Forces under our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, (after ſome difficulties) in bringing of us, by a tedious March, in ſuch ſafty to this place, to wait upon you in aſſerting the freedoms of our native Country: and being here (as wee have to our utmoſt hazard and power been inſtrumental in your Return, ſo) we ſhall be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ready to purſue your Commands ſo far as poſſibly we may. To evidence which, we have obſerved and executed your late Orders in relation to the Chains, Poſts,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57434:33"/>
and Gates of the City, which was ſomething grievous to Us, and to the Officers and Souldiers under our Commands; and that becauſe we do not remember any ſuch thing was acted upon this City in all theſe wars; and we fear that many ſober people are much grieved at it, and apprehend further force to be offered to them, while they ſeem principally to deſire the ſpeedy filling up of the Houſe, which you have declared for, aſwell as we have expreſt our juſt deſires of, and are apt to doubt, leſt, what we have done may be ſo far from anſwering the expected end, as that it may increaſe the diſcompoſure of mens ſpirits in the Nation. Upon this occaſion, it comes freſh into our minds, that when by the trechery of ſome Officers of the Army you were interrupted, we declared to the world That <hi>the ground of our undertaking was not onely your return to your Truſt,</hi> but alſo, <hi>the Vindication of the Liberties of the people, and the Preſervation of the Rights of our Country, and protection and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the godly and faithful therein, as the establiſhment of the peace of theſe Nations.</hi> Which Declarations made before the Lord, Angels and Men, in the day of our extreamity, we (as we expect the bleſſing of the Lord upon our future underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) cannot but ſtill own, and ſtand by.</p>
               <p>We find that the aſſerting of the juſt Liberties of the People, is that which the generality of the Nation is much in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of; and that many ſober people (together with our ſelves) are under fears leſt this great price that God hath put into your and our hands, (as your Servants) ſhould not be improved, but that we ſhall run in Confuſion again. Therefore we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave leave to preſent before you ſome grounds of our fears: We are afraid that the late wonderful and unparalel'd Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is not ſo publickly and ſolemnly acknowledged as it might be, that the Lord (who wrought ſo ſtupendiouſly) may have the Glory of all: We are troubled that ſome as yet do ſit in the Houſe, who are impeached of Treaſon: We cannot but obſerve that divers Members of your Houſe, (who contrary to their Truſt, acted in that illegal and Tyrannical Committee of Safety) are not actually diſabled from ſitting there: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Colonel <hi>Lambert</hi> hath onely the Vote of Indemnity to ſecure him from as high Crimes as have been committed in this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57434:33"/>
Nation, and is not obedient to your Orders, yet he ſeemeth to be winked at. We underſtand that Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> upon bare pretence is permitted to ſtay about the City, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction of your beſt Friends; That there are dangerous Conſultations, and that of thoſe who had a chief hand in your late Interruption, and the hazarding of the whole Nations, contrary to our expectation. We find continued in the Army ſome Perſons of dangerous Principles, and ſuch who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive enough in the late Defection. Though we are far from wiſhing the ruine of any, yet we could deſire that your ſignal indulgence to late notorious Offenders, did meet with that candid reception from them, as to be ſo much the more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous in their profeſſed repentance: But we obſerve that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them do ſeek to juſtifie themſelves, and are not without their Agents in print to palliate their ſoul Enormities; which maketh us yet to ſuſpect that we are in ſome danger of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the late diſtempers that You and the Nation are but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered from.</p>
               <p>We are not ignorant, that there are thoſe who lately ſtruck at the Root of <hi>Engliſh Parliaments</hi> in Practice and Deſign, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have inflamed the Nation, and given great advantage to the Common Enemy, yet they are not without a ſtrange confidence to precipitate men into a belief, that they are the onely Perſons againſt the one, and for the other. With grief of heart we do remember and would lament over the too palpable Breach of Engagements in this Nation; Therefore we ſhould think it a duty rather to mourn over the ſame, then to promote any new Oath to be taken at this time. Yet we perceive that there is a deſigne to provoke the Parliament to enforce an Oath upon the <hi>Nation,</hi> and do take notice, that amongſt others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are ſome who are moſt forward to promote the ſaid defigne, who have made the leaſt (if any) Conſcience in keeping Engagements already taken. Here we muſt not ſilence our firſt reſentment of a bold Petition, and of dangerous conſequence, which was lately preſented to you, the conſequence whereof (if you ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their deſires) would be to exclude many of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious and ſober ſort of men from ſerving under you in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Military Imployments, who have and will prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57434:34"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt of thoſe who have (by the juſt Hand of our Gracious God) made themſelves to apparently obnoxious. Moreover (which is not the leaſt part of the venome of that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition) we clearly ſee the ſame ſpirit, which of late would have pull'd away the by you declared juſt Maintenance from Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, would now provoke you by an Oath to endanger the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing away of many of the moſt Godly from their Maintenance. In urging our fears from the premiſes that concerns ſome of different Principles from us, we would not be thought to (as we do not) deſign any thing that may incur the cenſure of unjuſt rigidity. We freely profeſſe our deſires, that tendern<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſe of Conſcience may have its full juſt liberty, but we cannot in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment count that tenderneſſe of Conſcience which will not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at treachery it ſelf, or any unrighteouſneſſe to carry on cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt deſignes.</p>
               <p>Having preſented You with our fears, we ſhall adde our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, That by the help of God we ſhall ſtand by you in the purſuance of what we have declared for: And therefore do make this humble requeſt to You. We could deſire, That whilſt you ſit, your utmoſt endeavours may be to manifeſt your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate deſires for the Publick Good of theſe Nations; Our further deſires is, That thoſe Regiments under your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (whoſe Officers who are not) may be ſpeedily paſſed. And in regard we find that the Grand Cauſe of the preſent Heats and Diſ-ſatisfactions in the Nation is, becauſe they are not fully Repreſented in Parliament, and ſeeing no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable expedient whereby to keep the Nation in peace, then by filling up your number; We muſt therefore make this our main deſire, upon which we cannot but inſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion is at this hour ſo evident and preſſing, we are conſtrained for the juſt mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

of your Authority and the ſatisfaction of all true Engliſh-Men, earneſtly to deſire, That all the Writs may be iſſued forth by <hi>Friday</hi> next, returnable at the uſual and legal time, For we think it convenient to acquaint you, that to pacific the minds of this great City, in the proſecution of your late Commands, the Chief of Us did give an aſſurance thereof.</p>
               <p>And we muſt not forget to rememeber you, that the time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens wherein you have Declared your intended Diſſolution, which the people and our ſelves deſire you would be punctual in. Hereby the Suſpition of your perpetuation will be taken away, and the People will have aſſurance that they ſhall have a Succeſſion of Parliaments of their own Election; which is the undoubted Right of the Engliſh Nation: you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and Declared no leſſe: Both the People and your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies do live in the hope and expectation of it. That we may the better wait for your full and free concurrence to theſe juſt Deſires on the Nations behalf, upon Mature Deliberation, we have thought it our duty as to continue the uſual Guards for the ſafety of your ſitting, ſo for the preſent to draw the reſt of the Forces under our Command into the City, that we may have the better opportunity to compoſe Spirits, and beget a good underſtanding in that great City, formerly renowned for their reſolute adhering to the Parliamentary Authority, and we hope that the ſame Spirit will be found ſtill to breath amongſt the beſt, moſt conſiderable and and intereſſed Perſons there. This Action of ours, as we hope it will receive your favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpretation, ſo we do believe it will (through the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God) be of good uſe for the preſent Peace, acd future ſettlement of theſe Nations.
