            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ A Prayer to be uſed on <hi>Wedneſday November</hi> 13.</head>
            <head type="sub">In the Office appointed for that Day, immediately after the Prayer for the High Court of Parliament (which is to be read during their Seſſion:) and next before the Prayer of Saint Chryſoſtom, both in the Morning, and Evening Service.</head>
            <head>By the Kings ſpecial Command.</head>
            <p>ALmighty God, who haſt in part diſcovered the deſigns, and diſappointed the attempts of thoſe Popiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, who under the pretence of Religion, and thy Sacred Name, have conſpired our deſtruction; labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the moſt unjuſtifiable methods of Murders, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the Aſſaſſination of His Majeſties Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to introduce the tyranny of a foreign power, and the abomination of ſuperſtitious worſhip; and thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the ſouls and bodies of thy ſervants, and to extinguiſh the light of thy Goſpel amongſt us and our poſterity: We yield thee praiſe and thankſgiving for this thy mercy to us; imploring thy grace and favour in the farther diſcovery of theſe depths of Satan, this myſtery of iniquity. Send forth thy light and thy truth, and let them preſerve us. Give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and defence to our Sovereign Lord the King, bind up his ſoul in the bundle of life, and let no weapon form'd againſt him proſper; Clothe all his enemies with ſhame; but upon Himſelf and His Poſterity let His Crown ever flouriſh. To this end, knit together the hearts of all this People, as the heart of one man, in the defence of their King, their Laws, and their Religion. Teach them to ſee in this their day, the things belonging to their peace, before they are hid from their Eyes; Remove from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the Accurſed thing, thoſe perſonal, and thoſe publick guilts, whoſe cry is gone up to heaven, and calls aloud for thy vengeance; And being by true repentance reconcil'd to thee our God, let us by Chriſtian Love and Charity be united to one another: That walking in the paths of thy holy Law which thou haſt given us, its Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing may be continued to us; and we thy people and ſheep of thy paſture may give thee thanks for ever, and ſhew forth thy praiſe from generation to generation. Hear us, O God, for thy mercies ſake, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>
