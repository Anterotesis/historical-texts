         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If such a one may be admitted to speake for himselfe in

then give me leave a little now once at last I
humbly beseech you, and regard my words so far forth
as charitie and truth may bind you thereunto.</p>
            <p>It is so well knowne to many in this City of <hi>London,</hi>
both how my adversary, before named, hath dealt and
proceeded against me from his first beginning to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
as also how I have dealt with him, and what my
minde concerning Religion, that if I should set downe
any thing that were untrue, either in one respect or other,
I should be soone taxt for the same. Not onely by mine
enemies (who having done so already without cause, will
doe it againe quickly when there is cause) but by others
also which know me and understand truly how things
are. And so I shall give all men just occasion to reject me,
and to account me a false deceitfull man; which yet I
am sure I have not done, and which is more, I shall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
my conscience toward God, and provoke him to
displeasure against me, unto whom now, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

complaint vnto him, as a childe to a most gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

whatsoever I here write, though it be but little in
comparison to that which hath been said, sworne, and
published against me, yet as prizing a good conscience
farre above either liberty of my body, or favour of the

did I leave it for any such end, nor to live or have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
maintenance thenceforth for such a thing, as they my
accusers by their cunning Article and deceitfull testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
would make the Court and the world beleeve; but I
betooke my selfe to another kinde of trade or worke, as
low and servile as it, touching the conveyance of water
in pipes that I made of earth, which I had used seven or
eight yeares before, and had now necessary occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
me to follow altogether, by reason of a worke I
had to do for the serving of the City of <hi>Westminster</hi> with
water, and not utterly leaving or forsaking the other, as
they depose, but made use thereof also as need required
in things concerning this, which I have followed with
much labour and paines night and day, as well for the
maintenance of my selfe, my wife, and children, as for
the good and benefit of others; as all or most of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and sundry other Gentlemen
and Inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for whom I have done the same kinde of worke,
will testifie for me, and wherein I should at this present
time also be imployed for the supply of my own, and my
wife and childrens present wants, and for the good of
the Common-wealth, if I were not (through the envy
of my for-mentioned enemies, &amp; pleasure of the Court)
restrained by imprisonment; for God doth know, that as
I hold it to be a more blessed thing to give, then it is to
receive,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> as Christ hath said, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth, so I doe
desire in my heart to give and doe service in that kinde to
others,<note place="margin">Acts 20.</note> rather then to receive of any.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97442:5"/>Neither have I ever in my life taken upon me, or any
way assumed to my selfe, the office, name, or place of a
teacher, or instructer over any people in any private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
or meeting whatsoever, nor have so much as to
imitate Ministers or teachers in any manner of forme, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
expounding, or interpreting, or to be as a chiefe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or to have proselites or followers, or a company, as
they my accusers charge me, but doe utterly dislike all
such bold presumptuous practices, and have opposed and
reproved them, as some that know me well, and things
that I have writ, can witnesse.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse, this I confesse, that not onely for five or
six yeares past, but for these five or six and thirty yeares,
since the time that it pleased God of his gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to call me from the pleasures of the sinnes of my
youth to seeke him, I have given my minde with earnest
desire of my heart and prayer unto God, to reade, heare,
and understand the word of God, to the end, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the truth and way of life conteined in the same,
I might walke therein all the dayes of my life, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God and my owne comfort and salvation. For
I remembred that Christ commanded to <hi>search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5. 39.</note>
and foretelling of the abomination of desolation
that was to come,<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 5.</note> warneth his people, that <hi>who so readeth,
should understand:</hi> and how he doth pronounce them
blessed, that reade and heare the words of his prophecy,
and keepe those things which he hath spoken, because the
time of his comming is at hand:<note place="margin">Revel. 1. 3.</note> and as God vouchsafed
to shew his grace and mercies unto me, and give me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in the same his truth and way of life, so I
have endeavoured to impart that which I understood,
with admonition to my wife and children, neighbour
and friend, desiring in my heart, and praying unto God
in secret, that he would vouchsafe the same grace unto
them. This I confesse, I have done, though in great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and so, as holding it alwayes a speciall poynt of
wisdome, to be more ready in this respect to receive, then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97442:6"/>
to give, to heare, then to speake; and I confesse, I have
not been in all this time of thirty-five yeares so conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and sociable with the prophane multitude of the
world, as I have been with the sober and well disposed,
the wise in heart. I have desired to converse with such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
above all other wheresoever I have come to talke
and confer together of the word of God, which wee have
either heard or read, or had in our hearts and memories,
edifying one another in the faith &amp; hope of eternall life.
This on the first day of the weeke, and so daily as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
might permit, I confesse, I have done in societie
with such persons; remembring the charge given by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<hi>Paul</hi> to every Christian, saying, <hi>Take heed brethren,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>least
there be in any of you an evill heart of unbeliefe in departing
from the living God, but exhort one another daily while it is
called to day, least any of you be hardened through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of sinne.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 24. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Let us consider one another
to provoke unto love and to good workes, not forsaking the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
of our selves together as the manner of some is, but
exhorting one another, and so much the more as yee see the
day approaching.</hi> All which I suppose the meanest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
of the lowest degree or place that is, may doe, and that
it concerneth him as much as it doth any other, though
never so great.</p>
                  <p>If in this I have offended against the law of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> I have offended it, I confesse, but I doe sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
nay, I verily beleeve there is no law in this Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Kingdome, now at this time, forbidding these things.
In the times of Papistry, it was not held lawfull for the
Scriptures to be in the English Language, nor for the lay
people to reade the same. But thankes be to God, it is not
so now, those dayes of desolation are shortned in this
Realme; according to the word of Christ as he foretold,
saying. <hi>But for the elect sake those dayes shall be shortned.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 22.</note>
The Scriptures wherein the light of the truth and way of
salvation is conteined and held forth, which by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
and his Church hath beene so long obscured, are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97442:6"/>
by the Lawes and Authoritie of this Land translated into
our owne native tongue, and by the same Authoritie, all
men young and old, have free libertie to reade and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same, to talke and conferre thereof one neighbour
with another; and as the men of <hi>Berea</hi> after they had
heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach, did search the Scriptures daily; so may
we doe after we have heard; and as <hi>Timothy</hi> did know
the Scriptures of a childe, which were able to make him
wise unto salvation, so may wee even of children know
the Scriptures. Therefore we are greatly bound to be
thankfull unto God for this inestimable treasure, and for
those his servants, who have beene the meanes of this so
great good unto us. And God forbid, that ever the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
or Law of this Christian Kingdome should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
the same againe.</p>
                  <p>So that whereas <hi>Steven Denison</hi> and his witnesses doe
charge me that I have oftentimes taken upon me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
sundry places of Scripture, as a teacher or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
to many persons, &amp;c. They charge me very falsly,
for I never did otherwise then as one Christian neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
or friend may and ought to doe to and with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(so far forth as God hath given him grace and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding)
as I have sayd.</p>
                  <p>But because it will be conceived, that all this that hath
been said and done against me, was not for nothing, I must
therefore request the favour and patience of the Reader,
to give me leave to relate the beginning and ground of
all, which was this;</p>
                  <p>First, it is true, I confesse, I did and doe still hold as a
maine truth of the Gospel of Christ (contrary, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denison)</hi> that repentance doth necessarily
goe before remission of sinnes, and so before justifying
faith also, as well as before justification or remission; and
this, I confesse, I have endeavoured to maintaine against
some that have held the contrary. Which thing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison</hi>
having heard of, he tooke upon him with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
in his Pulpits to oppose the same, calling it a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97442:7"/>
damnable errour, a familisticall poynt of doctrine, and
that none but familists held it, and naming me often by
name and by trade, as if I were the Author thereof, and
charged me also with many other things very false, vilde,
and wicked. And this was before he began his suite in
Court against me, and not at all knowing me, or having
once ever spoken with me, but being onely informed and
set on by his two first witnesses <hi>Thomson</hi> and <hi>Rogers,</hi> as
<hi>Thomson</hi> afterward acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>These two <hi>Thomson</hi> and <hi>Rogers,</hi> are men that I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
acquainted or conversant with, either in one kinde or
other; neither have I ever been in their company, but
by their owne occasion or procurement, or some of their
owne or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denisons</hi> sociates, and alwayes with some
others with them, and under pretence of refuting the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
poynt of repentance before justifying faith,
which I held, or, (after M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Denison</hi> had begun so in his
Pulpits) under colour of friendship, as seeming to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to know my minde in matters of Religion more
fully, to the end they might informe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>D.</hi> thereof right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and so stay his proceedings in his Pulpits; for this
<hi>Thomson</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi> were his speciall devotaries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with him.</p>
                  <p>I say under these forementioned pretences, they procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me into their company three or foure times, which I
for my part never sought. And when I was in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
they or some of their fellowes spake as much or
more then I, and especially M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robrowgh,</hi> who for most
part of the times was one with them; and the speech was
not in any manner of teaching or expounding as a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
or instructer for my part especially, but in the way
of reasoning and answering to their questions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and the chiefe matter was concerning repentance,
which I hold for a principle of truth, is and must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
justifying faith; I say not all kinde of faith, but justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
onely. We must repent, that is to say, returne from
the pleasures of our vaine and evill wayes, and sinnes, to a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97442:7"/>
true and deepe sorrow and mourning for the same, and in
humblenesse and contrition of heart confesse them unto
God, and like the Publican, standing a far off, as not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
(because of our sinnes and vildnesse) to looke up to
heaven, but smiting our brest as truly confounded, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire God to be mercifull to us sinners.<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<note place="margin">Mark, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note>
being a principle of Christ, and part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
doe I hold, is and must be before justifying faith; as
these Scriptures doe declare, <hi>Matth. 4. 17. Mar. 1. 15.
Luk. 24. 47. Act. 2. 38. Act. 3. 19. Act. 5. 31. Act. 13.
23, 24 Act. 19. 4. Luk</hi> 18. 13, 14. Which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browgh</hi>
being their chiefe disputer, denied, and opposed
as a damnable errour; denied, I say, repentance to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
justifying faith, but acknowledging it to be before
justification and remission of sinnes; for he maketh repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and sanctification (meaning a holy and new life)
to be both one, and will have them to fall in and come
betweene justifying faith and justification, as in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
which he before in his deposition mentioneth, passed
betweene him and me, is to be seene; as if justifying faith
could be one moment of time, without or before justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or remission of sinnes, which are in effect both one;
for, to have ones sinnes forgiven, is to be justified from
them, and so of necessitie it will follow, that if repentance
be before remission of sinnes and justification, it must be
before justifying faith, because where remission of sinnes
is not, there can be no justifying faith.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon it is that the said <hi>Thomson</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi> doe
depose that I have often times taken upon me to expound
sundry places of Scripture, and to instruct many persons
in their presence and hearing, and therefore they name
no time, place, part of Scripture, poynt of doctrine, nor
person to be present besides themselves, least their cunning
equivocations should be discovered, but since the 20 of
<hi>December</hi> 1623: they are very carefull to have set down,
because they would not have King <hi>Iames</hi> his pardon by
any means to relieve me against their wicked conspiracy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97442:8"/>And <hi>Henry Robrowgh,</hi> he sayth not that I have often
times taken upon me to expound sundry places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to instruct many persons in his presence and
hearing, &amp;c. Which he might have deposed as safely as
they, having all one and the same ground, hereby seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have some more honesty in him. But that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
my selfe to be a man able, and sets downe the reason
thereof to be, because I have opposed some Ministers in
disputation, naming himselfe onely, and the writing that
passed betweene him and me, for proofe thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
as it is well knowne, he was the man that desired it,
and promised faire and friendly proceeding, though he
now hath shewed himselfe otherwise; and mentioning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
my printed bookes, as in his deposition, for further
ground. As if a man may not reason, or dispute with a
Minister, nor speake or write of Religion, or of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but he therein taketh upon him as a teacher or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer,
and professeth himselfe to be a man able; for this
is the thing <hi>Robrowgh</hi> drives at, as well as <hi>Thomson</hi> and
<hi>Rogers,</hi> to prove against me to the Court; which for my
part, I never did professe, nor take upon me, although I
know a man may through the grace and gift of God, be
in some measure able, that dareth presume to take the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
name, or profession of a Teacher or Instructer upon
him. And such gifts of God, as to prophecy, if in a man
of the lowest degree, place, or calling in the Church of
God, Shepheard, Clown, Carpenter, or other, ought not
to be dispised or envied at for his low estate, or meannesse
of his person sake. Nay, a greater Messenger of God then
ever M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robrowgh</hi> was or will be, sayd once of some that
for the same causes were so envied, and complained of;
<hi>I would that not onely they, but the whole host of Israel did
prophecy.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth without excepting the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
artificer, <hi>Desire the best gifts, and chiefly that yee may
prophecy.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robrowgh</hi> forgets that they were but envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
scorners, though Scribes and Pharises, who once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such tearmes, so slighted and dispised the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97442:8"/>
his works and words. So that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>R.</hi> comes nothing
short of <hi>Thomson</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi> in false witnes-bearing and
scorning; I will not equall him with the old Scribes and
Pharises, because of the honour and grace of him whom
they so dispised.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Nicholson,</hi> the other witnesse, a man that I was
never in any sort conversant with, nor have had one halfe
houres time of speech with in my life, whose testimony
therefore is altogether as he hath heard and beleeveth,
and so, what he hath heard and beleeveth, he presumeth
to sweare; what those new or strange poynts of doctrine
are, in his deposition, he nameth not, nor any one of
those sundry persons that I should expound the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
unto, whom he calls my proselites and followers,
and me their Teacher in matter of doctrine. But howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
though his deposition be but upon hearesay onely,
and as he verily beleeveth, yet the Court hath so credited
his testimony, that the most of the words and matters of
this first accusation in the sentence, are his words, and
grounded chiefly upon his deposition; and so he is and
will be found a false witnesse like the rest, and the Count,
I suppose, cannot be excused, but I referre all to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Reader to judge how rightly I have been
dealt withall by my accusers and the Court.</p>
                  <p>But now let me yet give the Reader a little further to
understand, That before M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denison</hi> began his suite in
Court against me, after he had begun to revile me in his
Pulpits, and I having used all meanes both by writing
and friends of his and my own to speake with him, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
him rightly of things concerning my selfe and my
minde in matters of Religion, before some men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that they might heare and discerne truly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and so pacifie him, and stay his violent course, and
could by no meanes obtaine either the one or the other,
but that he still persisted both at <hi>Cree-Church</hi> and great
<hi>Allhallowes</hi> for neere halfe a yeare together, reviling me
by name in most bitter manner, calling me Viper, Serpent,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97442:9"/>
Heretique, Familist, and many other vile reproachfull
and scandalous names, unseemly to be spoken, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be uttered by a Minister in a Pulpit, and charging
me with many very false and wicked things, and saying
to the people, This is one <hi>Etherington</hi> a Box-maker, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be dead or alive with God or the devill, I cannot
tell, I know him not if I meet him in my dish, &amp;c. And
utterly refusing still to be spoken with, gave out in his
Pulpit, as a flat deniall, saying, <hi>Must I speake with every
Heretique before I may reprove him openly; nay, it hath been
told me by them of the houshold of Cloe, and I beleeve it to be
true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I being much urged and provoked by reason of
some that began to conceive and say, If things were not
so, and that I were not such a one as he had charged me
to be, I would complaine. Hereupon, I confesse, I did
complaine by Petition to Doctor <hi>Martin,</hi> who was then
Chancellor (for so I was advised) certifying him how
matters had passed, and requesting that he would send for
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denison,</hi> and examine the reason of his so strange and
unlawfull proceedings, and to stay the same, and appoint
that the things of difference in opinion, or howsoever,
might be heard before some Ministers, if he thought fit;
to which he answered, You have brought me here a
strange Petition, I know M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denison</hi> to be a very honest
man, I know not you, I will not send for him <hi>Dic ecclesia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then as thinking it but my dutie to seeke to the Rulers
of the people, whose office is to defend the innocent, and
to rebuke the offenders, and as hoping still things would
be heard, examined, and ended in peace. I did complaine
to the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to the same effect, who granted
my Petition, and sent for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denison,</hi> who at the time
appointed came, bringing with him his friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browgh,</hi>
to assist him; And so the Bishop having questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
some thing about the matter, and a little blaming
him, spake when to have another time of hearing, which
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denison</hi> presently opposed, saying, I meant to have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97442:9"/>
had him into the high Commission Court, if he had not
prevented me, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Martin</hi> being also there present, and
speaking to his purpose, as his speciall friend, furthering
his motion, the Bishop answered, you may then doe so
yet; which when I perceived, and that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>D.</hi> had such
a friend of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Martin,</hi> I did with as much speed as I could
Petition to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> certifying him
also how things had passed, and requesting that he would
be pleased to send for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>D.</hi> and appoint that the matter
might be heard &amp; ended without suite of Law, if it might
be. To which he answered, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>D.</hi> had been with
him the day before, and shewed him a scrowle of strange
things against me, and so contradictory one to another,
as never was knowne to be in any Heretique whatsoever,
and that he thought it not possible therefore they could
be all true, yet told me that he had Letters missive gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, but willed me to be at the Court the next thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and he would order that I should cleere my selfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my owne conscience upon my oath; which
accordingly was done; whereat M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>D.</hi> murmured, and
said, My Lord, I have witnesses that will sweare against
him; to which the Bishop answered, Peradventure you
may have two or three evill persons that will sweare and
cause a man that is innocent to be condemned, he shall
cleere himselfe upon his oath. And so I did according to
the order, give into the Register Office full answers upon
oath to all <hi>Steven Denisons</hi> Articles, which are to be seen.
This being done, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Denison</hi> perceiving that I was
to be cleered thereupon, and seeing that matters would
then fall foule with him, and having no way to heale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but by wounding and suppressing me, moved to the
Court, vehemently affirming that I was a Familist, and
would forsweare and deny all things in publique which I
held and did in private, saying I have twenty witnesses
that will sweare against him. Whereupon D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>M.</hi> stood
up, and spake so to the furthering of his motion, as that
the Archbishop was turned against me; way was given
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97442:10"/>
him, the order of my clearing upon my oath was crossed,
my answers to his articles rejected, and never might come
to the view or hearing of the Court. And so his Witnesses
being all of them either those his associates and devota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which first set him on, as aforesaid, or such as he had
in his Pulpit (three or foure dayes before he was to goe
before the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>) charged to assist him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Whosoever hath any thing against <hi>Iohn Ethering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
let him come to my Chamber to morrow by eight a
clock; As yee love the Ministers of God, now stand for
them, for they goe about to silence all the good Ministers
in the Citie, such as by this meanes, and by his diligent
search and inquiry through the Citie, partly by faire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
partly by threatnings, had gathered together
to conspire against me; laying also plots to get me into
their company, that so they might finde occasion, and get
matter whereof to accuse me; these came readily together
with him to the Court, to take their oathes against me.</p>
                  <p>Then upon Motion and Petition of complaint, which

his Pulpits, the Court did order that I should bring in
my Articles against him, and I should be heard. Which
to the end things should be the more cleared, I did; but
the day that he was to make his appearance unto them,
Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> with another speech which he then made,
caused my Articles to be rejected, and this order also, as
the former, to be crossed, so that I might not proceed in
Court against him, till his suite against me were ended.</p>

ensuing, the Court for a yeare or thereabout ceasing,
and I supposing that he my adversary (as being by this
time in conscience rebuked, had let fall his suite, and I
not willing of my selfe, to stirre the matter up againe,
partly, because of the great charge, and for that I saw he
was, by reason of his great friends in Court, too strong

I neglected it, he prevented me, the matter was ordered
to sentence before I knew or thought it was once againe
called upon; after which, though in all humblenesse, I
moved and requested severall times for a defence, I could
not have it granted, Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> his voice, which so

that aside, have shewed themselves very willing men,
as before to the first Article, so here to the second, to
witnesse any thing against me, though never so falsly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomson</hi> saith, he conceiveth and holdeth it to be so by

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rogers</hi> saith, he knoweth it to be so by reason of some

                  <p>
                     <hi>George Dunne</hi> saith, he knoweth it to be so, by reason
he hath often conversed with me, &amp;c. yet nameth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that he hath heard me say or knowne me practice
or doe in all this his said time of twenty yeares, tending
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97442:11"/>
to that purpose or any other. As it the Court would trust
to their understandings of the discipline &amp; government,
and to their judgements and conceivings of my opinions,
and not heare the opinions, nor a word or practise men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and so passe sentence; for who can know a mans
affections, but by his words or deeds?</p>
                  <p>First, for <hi>Dunne,</hi> I will excuse him in this, that he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
neither word nor deed, because the truth is, he never
conversed with me in his life, nor I with him, neither had
I ever any kinde of dealing with him in my life, except
onely that about nineteene or twenty yeares agoe, my
wife having sore eyes, he came (by whose meanes I know
not) and laid something to them, for which I payed him.
So that <hi>Dunne</hi> could not well name any thing upon the
ground of often conversing with me, yet he is a false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
neverthelesse, and a foresworne man every way to
his owne knowledge; first in this, That he upon his oath
saith, he well knoweth that which he knows he knoweth
not, and sets downe that for his reason and ground, upon
oath also, which he knowes is false.</p>
                  <p>There are other matters wherein <hi>George Dunne</hi> hath
upon his oath also testified falsly, which because they are
not taken for proofe of any thing conteined in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
I passe them over untill some further occasion.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>Thomson</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi> they might have named
what the opinions had beene, for they heard me main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them, they say. It seemeth they meane by opinions,
those before mentioned against <hi>Robrowgh</hi> and <hi>Denison,</hi>
which <hi>Rogers</hi> calleth the received judgement of the said
Church, as holding their doctrine to be the discipline and
government of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for such a devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
conceit have they of these two men, and some other of
their straine, as if the Church of <hi>England,</hi> doctrine, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
discipline, and all matters else thereof did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in them; for it is to be noted, that these words, <hi>Now

any of their testimonies. But I leave the testimonies of

these men to the consideration of the understanding Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to judge how good and sufficient they are, and how

                  <p>To the first concerning private Assemblies, What M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>R.</hi> knowes by report, that he may safely depose and say,
So God helpe him, I refer to the Reader to consider.
But where he sayth, <hi>And also by his printed booke against
Separatists, &amp;c.</hi> I confesse, I wrote such a booke, which
being allowed, was published in the yeare 1610. where in
<hi>Pag.</hi> 82. these words are, <hi>Caesar may command a place for
the publique, so he forbid none in private;</hi> yet neverthelesse,
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robrowgh</hi> hath shewed himselfe a very evill minded
man in two respects; first, in that he leaveth out the words
and matters going before and following after in the said
booke, which would have cleared my meaning more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and taketh onely those words as may most seeme to
make for his purpose. And secondly in this, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
my words are, <hi>Caesar may command a place for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
so he forbid none in private;</hi> he gives it into the Court
upon his oath, <hi>Caesar may command a place in publique, &amp;c.</hi>
leaving out two of my words, and putting in one of his
owne in stead of them, to alter the scope and intent of
those few words which he doth take, to make them serve
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97442:13"/>
his turne against me, for who knoweth not, that the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out or changing one word for another in a sentence,
doth oftentimes alter the intent and scope thereof; as to
build a house in a Citie, and to build a house for a Citie,
are two differing things; the King may build a house in
the Citie of <hi>London</hi> for his owne use, but if the King, say
I, build this house for the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> all men will
understand, he meaneth for the Cities use: againe, the
King may command a place in publique, for himselfe to
come and worship God therein; but to command a place
for the publique, is for the people also publiquely: So
whereas I say, <hi>Caesar may command a place for the publique,</hi>
my meaning is, that the King may lawfully with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
from God, and warrant from his word, command
a place and places for the publique worship of God, to
all his Subjects, in and throughout all parts of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
which if the King may, and that my words doe
intend and expresse so much, (as I thinke no man that is
wise and conscionable will deny) then all the Kings sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are bound to obey the King, and come to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
worship of God in those publique places; and as it
is for place, so it is for time, and other such like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
(as in the 83. <hi>Pag.</hi> of the said booke against Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
is also set downe) alwayes provided (as it must
be understood) that it be the true worship of God that is
commanded, and not any idolatry or heathenish super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition;
as is now in the Church of Rome commanded
and practised: these things being so, then I reason thus,
further; If <hi>Caesar,</hi> or our King, Law and Authoritie, may
command a place and places, times, &amp;c. for the publique
worship of God, that is to say, for the assembling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the people of God, to prayer, preaching, reading
and hearing of the word of God, the administration and
participation of the Sacraments, praising and giving
thankes unto God for all his benefits, &amp;c. and that all
true Christian Subjects are bound to obey the King, Law,
and Authoritie, and come to the publique worship of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97442:13"/>
God in those publique places, times, &amp;c. then no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
subject may separate or schisme therefrom, nor make
any private assemblies, speake, practise or doe any thing
in opposition or contradictory thereunto; Nay, but on
the contrary, every Christian subject, young and old, is
bound to be thankfull unto God day and night, that hath
vouchsafed to dispose the hearts of Kings, Princes and
Authoritie of that Nation whereof he is a member and a
subject, to set their helping hands to build the walls of
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to cast out the abominations of the Heathen,
and of Antichrist, and restore the morning and evening
sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, (as in the former time
and in the dayes of old) which the Kings, Princes, and
Authority of this our Nation have in some good measure
done, to the great benefit of the same, thankes be unto
God therefore. So that taking my words right as they
are, <hi>Caesar may command a place for the publique,</hi> and this
will be the true and necessary consequence of them; and
then these words, <hi>so he forbid none in private,</hi> will receive
of all charitable minded Christians, a more favourable
construction, then to tend to the maintaining of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
assemblies of Familists, Separatists, or other Sectraies;
but onely to preserve the libertie that every Christian
hath, to worship God, to pray unto him, and doe him
service, at all times and in all places, every where, even in
our secret chambers with humble and contrite hearts,
lifting up pure hands, as the Scriptures speake, <hi>Ioh 4. 23.
Mat. 6. 6. 1 Thes. 5. 17, 18. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 8. and as it is in
<hi>Psal.</hi> 111. 1. How false and deceitfull therefore <hi>Henry
Robrowgh</hi> hath here sworne and dealt, I refer to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different discreet Reader to consider.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, in that the chargeth me to agree with the
Familists in the perfect puritie of the soule, after regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and onely upon the report of one <hi>Iesop,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
saith: I refer also this to the wise to consider, how
safely he may depose the same of me upon the report of
another, whereas for my part, whatsoever <hi>Iesop</hi> hath said
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97442:14"/>
or holdeth, I never held any such thing, but doe hold the
soule of the holiest man living to be impure; and although
as <hi>Paul</hi> faith of himselfe, a regenerate Christian doth in
his minde serve the law of God, yet neverthelesse through
the law and strength of his corrupt members, he even his
soule is led captive to the law of sinne, and of death, and
so is a captive to sinne, but not a servant. Neither did I
ever agree with the Familists, or any other such like blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
sect, in any of their tenents and opinions, but
have opposed and disproved them, according to my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
as in the aforesaid booke against Anabaptists is to
be seene, and as some can testifie, so that herein also
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robrowgh</hi> is a false witnesse; how rightly I have been

the same to one <hi>Salomon Seabright,</hi> being of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and one that knew me, to bring it to passe, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and promising that if they might speake with me,
and should finde things to be otherwise then they had
conceived, they would enforme M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denison</hi> thereof,
and cause him to cease his course and proceedings against
me. Whereupon I did consent to speake with them, so
that they would appoint the time and place, for I suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
it to be a plot layd between M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denison</hi> and them,
to get matter against mee, either to prove a conventicle
or otherwise to entrap me in my words, being forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by one that knew some of their secrets, that such a
thing was plotted and intended by them, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
so proved; So the place being at the said <hi>Salomon
Seabrights</hi> neere Algate, I met them there at the time they
appointed, where in the hearing of sundry persons, they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97442:15"/>
moved many questions unto me, concerning repentance
and faith, the Church, and other things, to which I did
answer them according as I did understand and beleeve.</p>
                  <p>As touching the Church, they asked mee, what I held
the true Church of Christ to be; To this I answered and
told them plainly, that I held the true Church of Christ
to be and consist of the true regenerate servants and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, sanctified in heart by faith in Christ Jesus,
lively stones, built upon the rock Jesus Christ, the chiefe
corner stone,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18. 1 Pet. 2. 4. 5.</note> according to the words of Christ, and as
S. <hi>Peter</hi> describeth it, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the <hi>body and
spouse of Christ, the pillar and ground of truth;</hi> according
also as it is conteined in the Creed, <hi>I beleeve in the holy
Ghost, the holy Catholique Church, the communion of
Saints, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then they asked me of the outward state of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> if all in generall were the same true Church
of Christ, or of it; to which I answered, nay, I could not
say so; Then if any whole Parish that I knew were, to
which I also answered, nay, I knew no such Parish that I
could so conclude of all, God knoweth who are his:
Then lastly, if I did not hold some private company with
my selfe to be the same true Church of Christ; to which
I answered also and told them, nay, but that all of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and callings in the whole Kingdome, whose hearts
were sanctified by faith in Christ Jesus, were the true
Church of Christ here of <hi>England:</hi> and that if I, or they
that asked those questions, or the rest there present, were
so sanctified in heart, then were wee of the same true
Church of Christ, else not, and that there was never any
Church, generally considered as it was outward and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the eye of man, but some, yea many times the most
part, and of the greatest of them in most eminent place in
the Church, as well as of the lowest and meanest, have
been unfaithfull, ungodly, unholy, and so, not of the
Church, though they were in it: And I told them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that I held the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it was by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97442:16"/>
of Princes and by Law established, to be the best
reformed, so generally considered, this day in the world,
and that I did beleeve God had a speciall respect unto it
above any one Nation or Kingdome whatsoever; and that
he had many faithfull servants, sonnes, and daughters
therein, and much people to save, for whose sakes the rest
doe fare well, and are the more happy.</p>
                  <p>These were my answers to their questions, touching
the Church, or to this very effect, as some that were there
present and heard me, as well as they, can testifie. It seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that upon my answer to their question of the outward
state of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if all in generall were the
true Church of Christ, or of it, because I said, nay I could
not say so, therefore they presume to sweare, that I held
and published, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it is now by
Law established, is no true Church of Christ, as if I would
have some other outward forme established, to make a
true Church, or that none could be in the outward state
of the Church, and partake with it in the outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the ministry, preaching, administring, hearing;
receiving, but regenerate persons onely, all which was
far from my thought; So that in this also as well as the
former, they are very false witnesses.</p>
                  <p>And concerning <hi>Robrowghs</hi> testimony, who deposeth
that because I say the true Church doth consist of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
therefore I teach and maintaine that the church
of <hi>England</hi> as it is now by Law established, is not a true
Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>My answer is, that if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robrowgh</hi> can, and when he
shall prove that the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it is now by
Law established, is not part of the holy Catholike Church
of Christ, whereof all are Saints, then will I grant his
testimony to be true; in the meane time, he is a false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser,
and one that doth deny the Church of <hi>England</hi>
now by Law established, to be part of the true holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Church of Christ, of the Communion of Saints;
proving himselfe guiltie of that whereof he chargeth me.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97442:16"/>
It would small avayle the Church of <hi>England</hi> to have the
name of a true Church, and not to be of the holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church, which the Creed and the Scriptures doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
unto us, and require us to beleeve and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for Christs true Church, his body, his spouse, &amp;c.
for although all be not Saints that are in the Church, as
touching the outward estate and societie thereof, yet as
touching the true spirituall communion, all are Saints
that are of it, and are one body and one bread, being all
made partakers of that one bread Christ Jesus, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by one Spirit into one body,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 17. &amp; 12. 12, 13.</note> and made to drinke
into one Spirit, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> declareth, according as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<hi>Iohn</hi> testifying against some Antichrists of his time;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>They
went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been
of us, they would no doubt have continued with us, but they
went out that they might manifest that they were not all of
us:</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> againe; But <hi>Christ the sonne over his owne
house,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>whose house are wee, if wee hold fast the confidence, and
the rejoycing of the hope firme unto the end.</hi> So that they
onely which are truly faithfull, and hold fast the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
&amp;c. are the true Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robrowgh</hi> doth or will deny himselfe to be one
of these, I dare then deny him to be one of Christ true
Church, notwithstanding he hath the office of a Curate
in the outward state thereof.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, whereas I stand charged in the sentence
to have said, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth false

a woman greatly devoted to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Denison,</hi> and an asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate

                  <p>The words of <hi>Tomson, Rogers,</hi> and <hi>Susan Price,</hi> which
are the words contained in the Sentence, I never spake
in my life, much lesse maintained or published as they
depose, nor yet the words of <hi>Henry Robrough,</hi> but I doe
hold the Sabbath to be in force according as I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
manifest, and that the first day of the weeke is to
be observed.</p>
                  <p>And as touching <hi>Worcester</hi> and his testimony, for him
he is a man that I was never conversant with, onely I
have beene in his company two or three times, and the
last time was as he saith, and at the house of one Master
<hi>Pike</hi> in East-cheape, where hee the said <hi>Worcester</hi> with
some other of Master <hi>Denisons</hi> favorites, had occasioned
me to meet them, under pretence of friendship also, and
of making peace, but being indeed another traine to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
me. This <hi>Worcester</hi> with some of his sociates then
present, were very importunate with me to reason with
them concerning repentance, and the Sabbath, which
I refused to doe, being forewarned of their conspiracy,
and that this <hi>Worcester</hi> with others of them, had given
out threatning words, tending to the taking away of
my life, one saying it is pitie that he liveth, hee deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to be burned, another, I will never leave him till
I make him fry, and others to the like effect, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I held it not a thing fitting to make a controversie
of this matter of the Sabbath, which they most desired
to have me speake of with them, neither did I ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with any man about it, untill Master <hi>Denison</hi> had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97442:18"/>
begun to revile me in his Pulpits, and charging me false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in many things concerning it, nor had I then, but
that I was drawn to it once through faire pretences also,
with one Master <hi>Cleaver,</hi> at which time we seemed to
part friends, and not so disagreeing as there need to be
any enmity between us for the difference. So that I only
told <hi>Worcester</hi> and the other with him, my mind in few
words, but not in way of maintaining as he deposeth,
for the words, it is like I did say thus or to this effect,
that if the fourth Commandement, as it did concerne
the outward bodily rest of the seventh day, be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(as I thinke all the Christian Churches in the world
doe hold it is) then there is no Commandement in the
word of God requiring the same outward bodily rest
upon any other day instead thereof: and this I say still,
yet not denying the observation of the first day of the
weeke, as I shall declare, so that thus farre I deny not
<hi>Worcesters</hi> testimony, though otherwise, and in other
matters he is false like the rest.</p>
                  <p>But whence these two sworne brethren <hi>Thomson</hi> and
<hi>Rogers</hi> (whose testimonies: because they so well agree,
are so oft the words of the Sentence) <hi>Susan Price</hi> and
<hi>Henry Robrough,</hi> have had the words they depose, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, neither doe themselves declare, nor mention
any time, place, or person to be present, when I should
publish, and maintaine them as they speake, and I am
sure I never said to any man living, that the Sabbath
was of no force, but doe hold that it is in force, and
the Commandement also according to the spirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
therof; I meane by Sabbath the true and perfect
rest of God, which hee did rest the seventh day, having
finished all his workes, therefore called his rest, as hee
saith, <hi>If they shall enter into my rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that it is here entred into of us, and kept not
through the Law, by doing any kind of worke or works
therein contained, but through the promise, eventhe
the Gospell of Jesus Christ by beleeving, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
saith; <hi>For wee which have beleeved doe enter into rest,</hi> as h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

said, <hi>as I have sworns in my wrath, if they shall enter into my
rest, although</hi> (saith he) <hi>the workes were finished from the
foundation of the world, for hee spake in a certaine place of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh Day from
all his workes;</hi> and in this place againe, <hi>If they shall enter
into my rest, Heb.</hi> 4. Where the Apostle declareth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the rest of God, which hee is said to rest the
seventh day, and this in <hi>David,</hi> which the faithfull
doe enter into, is all one and the same rest, and that it
is preached unto us in the Gospell, as it was to the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
in <hi>Davids</hi> time, and in the wildernesse; And the
reason why they that fell in the Wildernesse entred not
in; was their hardnesse of heart and unbeleefe, as in the
15. ver. of the 3. chap. and the 2. ver. of the 4. chap. He
declareth and saith further, <hi>That they that are so entred

                        </gap>ve ceased from their owne workes, as God did from his;</hi> that
is, from seeking their owne pleasures, and speaking
their owne words, from all their corrupt carnall and
sinfull pleasures and delights of the world, wherein
their soule as well as their bodie and members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
had walked; (the whole man being corrupted through
the fall) and which are therefore called their owne
workes and their owne pleasures, and their delight is
now in the Lord, and in his holy and heavenly wayes,
seeking his face continually, &amp; honouring him, &amp;c. as the
Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith; And they that are so entred here by
faith and keepe the Lords holy Sabbath, will the Lord
cause to ride upon the high places of the earth, and will
feed them with the heritage of <hi>Iacob</hi> their father, for the
mouth of the Lord hath spoken it,<note place="margin">Esay 58.</note> which heritage of
of <hi>Iacob</hi> is the everlasting Kingdom, the heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Citty promised which all the holy Fathers loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for and is to be manifested and fully accomplished,
when Christ shall come in his glory, and all things shall
be restored according to the Prophets. And so I hold
the Sabbath spirituall, and eternall to be in force, and
that the outward rest of man and beast commanded the
Jewes on the seaventh day was but a shaddow thereof
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97442:19"/>
and is now ceased to Christians; So that as wee are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
bound to Circumcision, nor other ceremonies of the
Law, which is manifest by <hi>Acts 15. Gal.</hi> 4. and other
places of Scripture, neither are we to the strict obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of any litterall Sabbaths of yeeres, times, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths,
or dayes, as the Jewes were by the Law, but are
free as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayth <hi>Let no man judge you in meates or
in drinkes, or in respect of an holy day or of the new Moone, or of
the Sabbath day, which are a shaddow of the things to come, but
the body is Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> And he said to them of <hi>Galatia,</hi> who
were by false Teachers brought to an extreame in that
kind more then the Law it selfe,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> (ever intended) <hi>Ye
observe dayes, and moneths, and times, and yeares, I am afraid
of you, &amp;c.</hi> in both which places, the Apostle speaketh
of the seventh day Sabbath, and concludeth of it as of
the rest, In <hi>Gal.</hi> he beginneth with it before the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sabbathes, as besides which before the monthly
there is not another to be rekoned, and in <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> He ends
with it, in reckoning next after the new Moones or
monthly Sabbathes, except which after the monethly
there is not another to be named, and counteth it with
the rest a shadow of things to come.</p>
                  <p>And this, no doubt was the reason why the Apostles
and Christian Churches to this day, have left it with the
rest of the signes and shadowes of the law, as holding
that Christians are free, as touching their consciences in
all such respects.</p>
                  <p>If this be true, that the litterall rest of the seventh
day commanded in the Law be a shadow, as by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
words, is most cleere and past all contradiction,
then the first day of the weeke used in the Apostles times,
and ever since in the Christian Churches, for the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
together of the people of God to breaking of bread
and prayer, and preaching, and hearing the word of God,
for exhortation, spirituall communion, edification and
comfort one another, praysing the Lord, &amp;c. Was taken
up freely, and is a free observation, and not by force of
any commandement of the Law or of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:97442:19"/>And this doth the Apostle further declare in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.
where he plainely sheweth, as he doth also in <hi>Colo.</hi> 2. the

of meates, and of esteeming and not esteeming one
day above another. So that although Christians be now
free in these things, as touching the conscience, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Law, and are not bound, yet, they not only
may observe a day to the Lord for the ends before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and forbeare therein their common worldly
affaires, but ought, it so being ordained and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the state and Church wherein they live, and so
farre wee are bound by the command of the word of
God, in all good and lawfull things to obey; And some
day or time is needfull, and the more time the bett<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r,
and hee that makes the most use of the same time to the
same ends doth the best; and the first day of the weeke
may very well be the day, rather then any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was for some reasons, no doubt, taken up, and
used for those ends in the Apostles times, whither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they might be more free therein in respect of the
Jewes, then on the Sabbath day, or for what reason else,
it is not written, being not so needfull to be knowne.
And so in respect of this spirituall use and end, it hath
beene and is appointed and imployed unto, it may be
called a Sabbath day, though not by force of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
                  <p>But whosoever shall lay such a burthen upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of Christian touching the day, as Master <hi>Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and some others have done, charging the people upon
heavy curses and condemnation to doe, and not to doe
such, and such kind of things as they prescribe, These
things.</p>
                  <p>Which although you may lawfully leave them undone

this day on paine of condemnation, and whosoever
doth not constionably, so observe the day cannot be a
true Christian; wherewith they have so inthralled the
minds of many people, some of tender consciences zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
affected towards God, and have brought them to
such distraction and unquietnesse of spirit, by reason
they are not nor can be satisfied in every particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what they are so bound to doe, and what not to doe
upon that day, when to begin and when to end, that
there is more talke and questioning among them, and
and more resorting to Ministers for satisfaction about
the same, then about any matter of religion whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine (I say) is very unsound, and just like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which the false Apostles and Teachers taught and
charged them of <hi>Antioch</hi> and them of <hi>Galatia</hi> touching
Circumcision and the Sabbath of the Law, which was
very erroneous, even in the time of the Law; and a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, which they nor their fathers
were able to beare, for such doctrine had beene
taught the Jewes by such Pharisees and false Teachers, a
long time before <hi>Peters</hi> dayes, and is by the Church, in
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. and by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. condemned for
false and very erroneous doctrine, and to be a dangerous
step of falling from Christ, for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Gentiles which had not that Law of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
and the Sabbaths, &amp;c. might have the truth and
effect thereof in their hearts, and be a Iew inwardly in
the spirit though not outwardly in the flesh, so that
there was never such a necessity as those false Teachers
taught, and most part of the Jewes conceived, nay, they
ought to have knowne, that although themselves that
had the Law, (to whom especially it was given) were
bound to observe it to the utter-most of their power,
yet if they fayled in any part (as all did in many)
and so in all parts, they might be saved another way,
through the grace and mercy of God in the Gospell,
and that of this there was alwayes a necessitie, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97442:20"/>
without the same no man could be saved; and that a
Gentile having the same grace, should be saved, though
he were ignorant of the Law; for this is the effect which
was signified by those signes and shadowes which are
now (as it was a law to the Iewes) ceased to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>My Answer and Defence.</head>
                  <p>To the first, concerning private Conventicles and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of Religion by the Lawes of this Realme prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
my answer is. It is a false accusation, I never kept
any such, nor have done otherwise then I have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in my Defence to their first Article, as one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
neighbour or friend, may and ought to doe to and
with another, which I am out of all doubt, the lawes
of this Realme doe not forbid, neither I hope ever
will.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, whereas they say that I take upon me
to be a chiefe speaker or expounder of the Scriptures,
and to have many adherents, disciples and followers, &amp;c.
My answer is, They charge me in this also very falsely, I
am so farre from taking upon me such things as that I
doe reject, the very thought thereof in my selfe, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and have opposed and reproved such as have so done
and beene so affected, as some can witnesse, although I
confesse I have beene free, and alwayes ready to speake
to my neighbour and friend, and children, &amp;c. whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I have knowne and understood of the word, and
wayes of God, as I have beene also to heare and recite,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97442:22"/>
and so I hope I shall continue to doe, as time and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
shall serve, so long as I live.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in that they charge me to give many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
contrary to the received opinions taught in
the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chiefe besides those before mentioned of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
&amp;c. (which I confesse are contrary to M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ster <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisons</hi>
and <hi>Robroughs</hi> doctrine) being (as it seemeth)
this contained in the Sentence, <hi>That outward Ordination
of a Minister, doth not make a true Minister,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 70 &amp; 71.</note> Deposed by
<hi>Henry Robiough</hi> from the foresaid booke against Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.
To which I answer and confesse, that the words
are in the place of the booke, and I am not afraid to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
them to be truth agreeing with the Scriptures, and
with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as I meant
them, I doe not say that out ward Ordination of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
doth not make a lawfull Minister outwardly, nay, I
acknowledge it doth. So as that hee may lawfully Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
and people may lawfully receive the word and
Sacraments with him, according to the 26. and 36. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and as it was in the
Apostles times, and in the Church of the Iewes, with
Christs approbation. But this, I say, that outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
doth not make a true and faithfull Minister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
in Gods accounts he may be a deceiver, a false
Prophet, an Antichrist, notwithstanding which they
that are true in Gods account, called and sanctified of
him by a more speciall, heavenly, inward calling may
not, for they are built upon the Rocke, the gates of hell
shall not prevaile against them. Otherwise, if outward
Ordination of a Minister did make a true Minister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in Gods account, then all they of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> must needs be true Ministers, for they have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ordination, as they have also outward Baptisme,
and such as wee doe not hold needfull to be cast off, (if
any come out from them) and receive another outward
Ordination and Baptisme before they may administer,
or be received for true Ministers or true Christians, (as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97442:22"/>
the Anabaptists opinions is, So that of necessity there
must be some more excellent thing or things besides
outward Ordination and outward Baptisme to make a
true Minister and a true Christian in Gods account.</p>
                  <p>Neither were the words spoken or given in a private
Conventicle to adherents or disciples of mine, as my
doctrine to them, as my answers seeme to depose, or at
least as the Register set it downe and is in the Sentence,
But they were written in defence of the calling of the
Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Baptisme here administred against the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
and Anabaptists, who denyed the same, and was
published in print with licence of the Bishop of <hi>London.</hi>
being first viewed over by himselfe and by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Master <hi>Crashaw,</hi> then Minister of White-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
who did also approve of the same, and suscribe to
them, which is well knowne to be true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And this deponent</hi> Henry Robrough <hi>chargeth me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
saying,</hi> That hee knoweth the Articulate <hi>Etherington</hi>
doth teach and maintaine opinions which doe derogate from the
Iurisdiction of Bishops, because he interpreteth that place of
Scripture, Math 18. Tell the Church to be understood of the
little ones borne of God, as in his booke against Separatists, page
74.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, That if Master <hi>Robrough</hi> can, and
when he shall infallibly prove as he doth here in effect
sweare, that Bishops are not not can be of the little
ones, borne of God, spoken of in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. then will I
grant his deposition to be true, in the meane time hee
proveth himselfe a false accuser, and one that denieth
Bishops to be of the holy Catholicke Church of Christ,
which I doe not. For although it be true that the little
ones borne of God, the lively stones built on the head
corner-stone Iesus Christ, be the true Church of
Christ, against which the gates of hell shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
and to which Christ hath given the keyes of the
Kingdome of heaven, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. and <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. and
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and other Scriptures is evident. And that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97442:23"/>
the places and Iurisdictions of Bishops be now great,
and great and high places be dangerous and slippery
places, as the Scriptures speake, and experience (lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table)
hath a long time and often proved, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I undoubtedly beleeve, that Bishops have been,
or may, and shall be found to be of the little ones
borne of God, and so of Christ true Church, against
which the gates of hell shall not prevayle, &amp;c. When
many a one of as low a place in the Church as Master
<hi>Robrough</hi> shall come short of being of that number. For
I know that he that is greatest may be as the least, and he
that is chiefe, as him that serveth, according to the
word and commandement of Christ, And it greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
every such one so to be, and to beare with his
weake Christian brother, and not to constraine him
with any kind of violence, either in words or deeds, to
doe things against his conscience, which he is not, nor
can yet be perswaded of, though otherwise lawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
whatsoever is not of faith is sinne. That so ruling
in wisedome, and judging alwayes righteous judgement,
instructing with truth in the spirit of meekenesse and
love, shewing mercy with good works of charity, hee
may receive double honour of his Christian brethren,
and so continuing, be found one of those of whom
Christ sayeth, <hi>Blessed is that Servant whom his Lord when he
commeth shall find so doing.</hi> But otherwise, if any one so
intrusted in place of authority, shall begin to smite his
fellowes, to eate and drinke with the drunken, &amp;c. the
same servants Lord will come in a day that hee is not
aware of, &amp;c. and will hew him in peeces, and give him
his portion with hyporites.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Iohn Okey,</hi> the man that vowed hee would not
leave me till he made me fry, to this of the fourth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
he deposeth saying,</p>
                  <p>That he knoweth that the said <hi>Etherington</hi> held, that hee
was as <hi>Elias,</hi> left alone, and that he knew none to be of the visible
Church of God but himselfe.</p>
                  <p>These are <hi>Okeys</hi> words as they stand in the deposition,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97442:23"/>
which in the Briefe that was read to the Court, are alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and set downe thus.</p>
                  <p>That within the time articulate the said <hi>Etherington,</hi> hath
affirmed, that he was as <hi>Elyas,</hi> left alone, and that he knew none
of the visible Church of God but himselfe.</p>
                  <p>And to this deposition of <hi>Okeys</hi> is also added another
of <hi>Henry Robroughs,</hi> his words as they stand in the briefe
which was read to the Court are these.</p>
                  <p>That the Author of the Epistle to the Church of Rome viz.
<hi>Iohn Etherington</hi> affirmeth, that he knoweth no man in the
flesh that holdeth with him, That the said <hi>Etherington</hi> is the
Author of the book intituled The Epistle to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
looke page 9.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>My Answer and Defence.</head>
                  <p>First, for the words of <hi>Okey,</hi> they are a very false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
in both places. I never held, neither affirmed,
nor thought any such thing of my selfe, but doe hold it
a vile and wicked thing for any man so to thinke, much
more to affirme to himselfe or of any other. How <hi>Okey</hi>
knoweth that I held this of my selfe, which he deposeth
in the first place, or who heard me affirme so of my selfe,
in the second place he mentioneth not. And for him, he
is a man that I never had any acquaintance or dealing
with, neither have I beene in his company, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
one halfe houre together in my life, nor have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
two words with him these twenty yeares at least,
but onely, about three or foure yeares agoe, I having
heard that he had threatned me, spake to him at a Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers
stall in Cheape-side, who heard what I said unto
him.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, for <hi>Robroughs</hi> testimony, as touching an
Epistleto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I confesse I have seen &amp; read
such a Booke, which was published in the yeare 1588.
when I was not eighteene yeares of age, and therefore
farre unable to write such a book, as I am still, I confesse;
<hi>So</hi> that <hi>I</hi> could not possible be the Author thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:97442:24"/>
                     <hi>And whereas</hi> Robrough <hi>directeth to the ninth page
of the said booke for proofe of his deposition, where
the Author having described to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>the
true Church of God and her true children, sayth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
being (as it seemeth) then in</hi> Rome. And yet thou
sayest, let me see her, Behold be that writeth testifieth before the
Throne of God and all his holy Angels, that hee knoweth no one
this day after the flesh, that taketh part with him; what then
shall I say, I am left alone? God forbid, for I see and heare with
the eares and eyes of my soule, the groanes, the chaynes and teares
of seven thousand, whose obedience is greater then mine, and of
which number I am the least and as a poore and miserable, and
borne out of time, am not worthy to be one of them, and this is she
who once <hi>Balam</hi> walkes in thy streets, and all the earth was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with her beauty, &amp;c. <hi>And a little before in the same
page of the booke he sayeth,</hi> Whose modest countenance, whose
chast and comely steps walke in our streets, &amp;c. <hi>meaning here in</hi>
England, <hi>himselfe being an English man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Henry Robrough</hi> doth here also declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be a very evill minded man in severall respects.
First, in that hee altereth the Authors words, where he
sayeth, <hi>That he knoweth no one this day after the flesh that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
part with him,</hi> and sets it downe, that hee knoweth
no man in the flesh that holdeth with him, as if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
meant and affirmed, that there was no man living of
his opinion, so altering not onely his words, but his
very intent and meaning to another purpose, for so it is
set downe in the Briefe that was read to the Court, that
<hi>I</hi> affirmed that there was no man of my opinion but my
selfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that hee leaveth the words going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and comming after, which doe plainely shew, that
he speaketh not of his opinion, but of his sorrow and
teares of repentance, and therefore sayeth, that he saw
and heard with the eares &amp; eyes of his soule, the groans,
the chaines, and teares of seven thousand, whose obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was greater then his, and judges himselfe not
worthy to be one of them, so that although at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97442:24"/>
he knew no one after the flesh, yet he saw thousands
after the spirit with the eyes of his mind, whom hee
preferreth before himselfe.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, in that the said <hi>Robrough</hi> deposeth and
would prove by the said page of the said booke, that I
am the Author thereof, that so by making himselfe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
false witnesse with <hi>Okey,</hi> he might accomplish <hi>Okeys</hi>
vow against me, that hee would never leave me till hee
made me frie; For <hi>Okey</hi> deposeth as it seemeth from
the same page of the said book, (judging also me to be the
Author) that I affirmed that I was as <hi>Elyas</hi> left alone.
Whereupon the voyce of one Bishop in the passing sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
against me, was that I should goe the same way to
heaven that <hi>Elyas</hi> went, through fire, though he thought
(he said I should never come there as <hi>Elias</hi> did) whereas
the Author doth not say hee was as <hi>Elyas</hi> left alone, but
what then shall I say, I am left alone? <hi>God forbid,</hi> which
is the cleane contrary; and therefore these two evill men
(as before with the rest of their fellowes) so here from
the fountaine and evill treasure of their hearts, they
have brought forth their evill and bitter fruit, which
any judicious Christian may perceive.</p>
                  <p>And whereas I am charged to have used many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
speeches of the Ministers of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> which though they be not set downe in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
yet they are in their testimonies, the speeches are

                  <p>I would it were not true, that there is a generation
of Pharisees among the Ministers, as well as among the
people, and although it be not an usuall thing with me
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97442:25"/>
so to speake of any Minister by name, yet I might well
say it of these two, which this woman nameth for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
and doe them no wrong at all, and no doubt
they have more fellowes, else were the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
the rarest Church that ever was in the world.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, whereas they charge me that I have by

to be Schismaticks, and Separatists, and caused them or

                  <head>My Answer and Defence is.</head>
                  <p>This is a very false accusation, not withstanding their
mouthes be all open to witnesse it.</p>
                  <p>First, for my selfe it is well knowne in all places
where I have lived, what my behaviour hath beene,
For so it is, that since the beginning of the yeare 1588.
now above these forty yeares, I have lived in or nere
unto the Citty of <hi>London,</hi> and untill now, that Master
<hi>Denison</hi> and his Sociats had thus prosecuted against me.
I was never presented, nor once complained of, for any
neglect or ill carriage towards the Church of <hi>Englands</hi>
either in one respect or other; and that I have frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the publike Assemblies and Sacraments, for neere
twenty yeares last past before my imprisonment, <hi>I</hi> have
sufficient Certificate and testimony, for proofe of the
same, which I had ready to shew to the Court, if my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
had beene admitted; and I never was in any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Assembly in my life, where I have either received
the Sacrament my selfe, nor seene it done by others; So
that for mine owne part, I am neither Schismaticke
nor Separatist. And for others, I know there is not a
man living that can truely say, much lesse depose, that
I have drawne, or caused any one to Schisme or Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not to refuse to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate,
either in Prayers, Preaching, or Sacraments,
nay, I am sure, that neither Master <hi>Denison,</hi> nor all the
enemies else I have in the world, are able to bring forth
one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:97442:25"/>But on the Contrary there be sundry can witnesse that
I have beene a meanes of the withdrawing and disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some, from Schisme, Separation, Anabaptisme, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milisme,
and other corrupt opinions and unlawfull
practises, so that their testimonies to these things also,
are all likewise false.</p>
                  <p>This hath beene the passage and proceeding of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
and cause against me, these be the things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the sentence, and these be the testimonies that are
for proofe of them, for which, and whereupon I was
censured by the high Commission Court on the last day
of <hi>November</hi> 1626. not having any defence, nor being
heard what I could say for my selfe.</p>
                  <p>The sentence or judgement of the Court is this, I was
fined five hundred pounds to the King, to pay cost of
suit, I was committed to the new prison there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
during the pleasure of the Court, and injoyned to
make a publike recantation in such words as should be set
downe by the Court.</p>
                  <p>And although Master <hi>Denison</hi> had prevailed thus farre,
and that I was layed up in prison, yet was he not herewith
satisfied, but in the beginning of <hi>Hillary</hi> terme next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
he moved and requested to the Arch-bishop and
the Court, that he might preach at <hi>Pauls</hi> crosse the
last Sunday in the said Terme, and that I should bee
brought to stand there before him during his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
which his request as unreasonable and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
as it was, (by Sir <hi>Henry Martins</hi> meanes) was soone
granted him. And I was by a Pursuivant and a keeper, the
same day, brought to stand there before him, in the view
of the people, and being come to the place, they having
a Paper contayning the chiefe things of the sentence,
Written with large Letters, which I taking in my
hand, protested against unto the people, as falsly charg'd
upon me, and falsly, by false witnesses, deposed against
me. But they, the Pursuivant and keeper laying hold of
my armes, took the Paper from me, and pinned it on my
brest, and so held me till I intreated them to let my armes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97442:26"/>
loose, and promised that I would not remove it, that so he
my adversary and prosecutor might make open shew of
me the person whom he had so long hunted for, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me now under his clawes, might prey on me at his
pleasure, and make knowne to all men, that what he had
done before in his Pulpits, without &amp; against all Law and
Christianity, he could doe now boldly with authority.
And how maliciously, contemptuously, and falsly, he
there spake and dealt, (reviling me by the names of) this
seducer, this Woolfe <hi>Iohn Etherington,</hi> that stands heere
before you, this Varlet, Hereticke, Faruilist, with sundry
other vile, false, and evill speeches which he there uttered
of me, many that then heard him can witnesse.</p>
                  <p>And so, I having stood there before him about the space
of three houres, he took forth a Paper wherein the words
for my recantation (which the Court had ordered) were
Written, and began to read them, saying; <hi>Whereas I
Iohn Etherington stand by the depositions of sundry witneses ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially
convicted before the Kings Majesties Commissioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for causes Ecclesiasticall,</hi> for that since the 20 of <hi>December</hi>
1623, <hi>I have maintained &amp;c.</hi> (The words following
being all the matters contayned in the sentence which
they would have had me to acknowledge as justly proved
and so condemne my selfe, and justifie all their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.)
So hee having read a part twice over, called upon
me twice to say after him, which I refused to doe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my selfe to be cleere, as I have before declared, onely
I answered and testified to the people, that the witnesses
were false witnesses, and their testimonies false, and that
he had delivered many lyes and false things of me, and so
I was taken away from the Crosse to the prison againe.</p>
                  <p>And yet, further, for after all this, he got lycence to
publish a Booke of that Sermon in Print, partly refined
of some of the palpable untruths, and bitter reviling
speeches he then uttered, and partly filled with more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and falshood, by which, in the most disgracefullest
manner, as (I thinke) ever was knowne. He hath devised
to defame me, my name, and posterity for ever, if it be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97442:26"/>
possible for the spirit of wickednesse by evill inventions
and lyes to doe it.</p>
                  <p>And except Christ had foretold, that men should
not onely revile and persecute his servants, but that they
would falsly say all manner of evill against them for his
name sake, all manner of evill, nothing excepted, that
the evill heart of man can invent, I should never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
that there had beene or would be such manner of
evill things invented, spoken, and practised, published,
and beleeved, against any one, as hath beene, all fasly
(God knoweth) against me, the most unworthy to be so
blessed, and to have such cause of rejoycing, as Christ te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
and promiseth to such, though for the present as
touching the body and outward name and estate: I with
my wife and children doe suffer and undergoe distresses,
scandals, defamations, and reproaches of the world.</p>
                  <p>In all which, how unchristian-like, and unnaturally I
have beene delt withall, by this <hi>Steven Denison,</hi> how evill,
false, and dishonest his witnesses have manifested them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be in their practises and depositions, And how
rightly and upon what just grounds the Court hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
judged, imprisoned, appoynted, and given way
for all these things to passe and be done against me, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
to the judicious understanding Christian Reader,
of what estate or calling soever, to weigh and consider.</p>
                  <p>I doe confesse, that after Master <hi>Denison</hi> had done his
pleasure against me at the Crosse, I having complayned
of the great wrong I had sustained by him &amp; his witnesses,
first by a letter that I wrote to the Bishop, then of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
now of <hi>Winchester;</hi> whom I made bold to acquaint
with the matter, by reason I had beene with him some
few dayes before this unexpected sentence was passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, to speake with him about the conveyance of
water to his house of <hi>Akeland</hi> in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi>
and was by his apoyntment to come to him againe to
speake further of the same; but being now prevented by
imprisonment, I wrote, giving him to understand the
cause therof, (for he was not at the Court when I was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97442:27"/>
And requesting his favourable helpe to relieve me,
who hereupon with the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> tooke the
matter into their consideration, &amp; began to commiserate
my case, so that when my Petitions of complaint came
to the Court, they were willing to have them read, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for me to the Arch-bishop that things should be yet
further examined according to my request. Whereupon the
matter was referred unto them, and I acknowledge they
took pains therein, &amp; were very willing to relieve me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that I was wronged, &amp; as they found the falshood
of the accusations, and of the depositions of the witnesses
caused the Register to write them downe. But <hi>Denison</hi> my
adversary, accuser, and prosecuter, being there present
at my elbow, when things were now examining, and
knowing that my cleering would discover his unjust and
evill dealing, moved the Bishops with another poynt,
not in the sentence, concerning Baptisme, which I could
not deny; but indeavored to maintaine for a truth, and
they much apposed me in, and alledged the words of the
Booke of Common prayer, that God had sanctified the
flood Jordan and all other waters, to the mysticall wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of sin, and said unto me, as thou dost convey
water in thy Pipes, so is grace conveyed in the act of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and so it was by Circumcision <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Doctor <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>
he being by, withstood me also in that I said, and
affirmed withall, as touching the Lords Supper, that the
very flesh of Christ was eaten with our teeth, which I
could not but say was grosse Popery, so upon these occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Bishops displeasures were kindled against me,
things were left without any further examining, and I was
sent again to prison wherewith straighter usage then I had
before, I have now endured above these twenty months,
and he my accuser was now further allowed to publish
what he listed against me, not onely in Print, but in his
Pulpits also, as hee still doth, his Booke hee presenteth to
the King, and made suite as I heere, to have me put to
death, for it was my blood he thirsted after, as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Bookes doe prove, the cause you have seene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:97442:27"/>Otherwise if this point of Baptisme, which he (as it
seemeth) knew, would moove the Bishops against me, had
not beene by him forced unto them, I had no doubt been
cleered by them. Therefore, because Inow suffer for it
as well as for any things else, I will declare my minde
therein more fully.</p>
                  <p>The point or tenent is this: That outward Baptisme
doth neither conferre nor confirme grace to the heart of
any man no more than Circumcision did; in the aforesaid
booke against Anabaptists, page 61. Which I doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and justifie to bee true, in defense of the Baptisme
and doctrine of the Church of England against Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
Arminians and Papists; against Anabaptists who
held that all such as they Baptised with outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
were thereby confirmed to bee true Christians,
inwardly in the sight of God; against Arminians and
Papists, who hold that outward Baptisme doth conferre
grace to the heart, and maketh a Christian inwardly;
From which doctrine of each, falling away after regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the estate of salvation to everlasting condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
doth necessarily follow, free will; and other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and unsound points of doctrine, which they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
hold and teach; contrary to the doctrine of the
Church of England, (which are also disproved in the
same Book against Anabaptists; the Book being viewed
over by the Bishop of London, and by himselfe allowed
as is aforesaid; I doe acknowledge as I also believe, that
outward Baptisme is a visible signe or outward signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the new birth from above, and of that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
wherein wee are said to bee buried with Christ and
risen with him, and to put him on, and which saveth;
and that it doth signifie and set forth the same unto us;
and I doe believe also that it is a seale or token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
which God hath made with the faithfull and their
seed, as Circumcision in the flesh was to faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi>
and his seed, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 8. 11. and <hi>Rom. 4. 11. Not
all that came of Abraham after the flesh, nor all that were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
or that are now Baptised in the flesh, but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> God said
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97442:28"/>
to Abraham,</hi> In Isaac <hi>shall thy seed be called</hi> (that is, as Saint
Paul saith) <hi>they which are the Children of the flesh, these are not
the Children of God, but the Children of the promise are counted for
the Seed,</hi> Rom. 9. 78. <hi>they that are Circumcised in heart, and
are of the same faith, As</hi> Rom. 4. 16. <hi>for that is the sure seak of
the covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on our parts wee doe thereby give our names to
Christ and Covenant with God to bee his people, and to
serve him; and so it giveth us the name and state of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
outwardly, as circumcision on the flesh did the name
and state of a Jew outwardly; It doth no more give or
conferre grace to the heart to make a Christian inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then circumcision in the flesh did to make a Jew or a
Christian inwardly; for, to be a Jew inwardly, and to be
a Christian inwardly is all one in truth; as also to bee
circumcised in heart, and to bee baptized in heart is all
one in trueth, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> declareth; <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 11. 12.
and so it followeth, <hi>that Circumcision in the flesh, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
in the flesh are both one in signification and operation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore if these things bee so, and that hee is not a
Jew which is one outwardly; nor that circumcision
which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew which is
one inwardly, and Circumcision is that of the heart in
the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but
of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, then,</p>
                  <p>Neither Circumcision in the flesh nor Baptisme in the
flesh doth give or conferre or worke grace in the heart, to
make a Jew or a Christian inwardly; neither are they or
either of them any part of the new birth, from above, or
of that Baptisme wherein wee are said to put on Christ,
and to bee buried with him, and which saveth, as Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> also confirmeth saying; <hi>The like figure whereunto, even
Baptisme, doth also now save us; not the putting away of the filth
of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, by the
Resurrection of Iesus Christ. 1. Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>Otherwise if either Circumcision or Baptisme on the
flesh did conferre grace to the heart, then all are thereby
set in the state of salvation; and so the errour of falling
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97442:28"/>
away, which the Anabaptists, Arminians and Papists
hold, will necessarily follow; because it is evident that
all are not saved, that have beene circumcised or baptized
in the flesh; or, if either of them were a part of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
then no one could be saved without the one or the
other, because every part of regeneration is of necessitie
to salvation.</p>
                  <p>But it is certaine, that many are saved which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
circumcised nor baptized in the flesh, as (besides all
those faithfull that lived before either Circumcision or
Baptisme on the flesh was instituted) all the holy women
of the Jewes; That every part of regeneration is of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
to salvation the Lord Jesus hath irrevocably conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
saying; <hi>Except a man be borne of Water and of the Spirit,
he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God; Iohn</hi> 3. both the
parts of this new birth are of necessity to salvation.</p>
                  <p>These words, except a man bee borne, doe stand as
firme for the first part (of Water) as for the second part,
of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And under the name man, every child of man, born of
flesh young and old, male and female, are comprehended,
so that whosoever dyeth without the first part of this
birth, the Baptisme of water here meant, shall as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be excluded from entring into the Kingdome of God,
as he that dyeth without the second part, the Baptisme
of the spirit; That the first part of this birth from above
is something called in Scripture by the name of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
besides that which is called the Baptisme of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, is out of question (I thinke) to all. Outward
baptisme it cannot be, for the reasons before mentioned,
because one may be saved that is never baptized therwith,
as hath been proved; Then without all doubt it must bee
some speciall necessarie principle of Christ called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
by the name of Baptisme, and signified also by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Baptisme, because it is layd downe in the first place
as a necessarie part of the new birth, and first plantation
of a Christian.</p>
                  <p>And there is no principle of Christ so speciall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97442:29"/>
called by the name of Baptisme, and signified by
outward Baptisme, that is required to the first planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Christian (besides the Baptisme of the Holy
Ghost) but onely repentance; That repentance is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
principle of Christ is evident by <hi>Marke 1. 1. 2. 3.
4 Luk. 24. 47. Act. 20. 21. Heb.</hi> 6. 1. That it is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
is also evident by Christs owne testimony in <hi>Luke</hi>
13. where hee urgeth it with the same words of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
saying, <hi>Except yee repent, yee shall all likewise perish; Vers</hi> 3.
That it is called by the name of Baptisme, and signified by
outward Baptisme, is manifest by <hi>Mat. 3. 11. Mar. 1.
1. 2. 3. 4. Luke. 3. 3 Act. 10. 37. Act. 13. 24. Act.</hi> 19. 4.
And that it is required in the first place to the first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a Christian is also manifest by sundry Scriptures
where the Holy Ghost saith, <hi>Repent and believe the Gospell,
Repent that your sinnes may be blotted out; Repent and be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
every one of you, in the Name of Iesus Christ for the remission
of sinnes; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Mar. 1.
15. Act. 3. 19. Act.</hi> 2. 38.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the first part of regeneration is the Baptisme
of repentance, even the same which <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Minister and patterne thereof preached in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> wherewith hee made ready a
people prepared for the Lord, as it was prophesyed of
him <hi>Esay</hi> 43.<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 8.</note> And is a turning and dissolving of the heart,
which naturally through sin, is hard and stony, to water
as it were, to flesh, as the Scriptures speake, even to weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and mourning and humble confession of sinnes unto
God, as Christ himselfe expresseth it in a Parable saying:
<hi>Wee have lamented unto you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>and yee have not wept,</hi> and is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the speciall power and working of the Holy Ghost, and is of the Gospell, and not of the Law.</p>
                  <p>The second part of this birth from above is that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of Christ which <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> also spake of to his
disciples, whom he had prepared by the Baptisme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
saying,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 11. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>I indeed Baptise you, with Water to repentance;
but he that commeth after me is mightier then I, hee shall Baptise
you with the Holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> as if hee had said, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97442:29"/>
through the power and Spirit of God preaching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you repentance, have prepared you ready for the
Lord. I have brought you into the travell of the birth, to
weepe and mourne for your finnes, the first laver of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
But Christ which cometh after me, he is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
then I, he by a more excellent gift of the Spirit (as
it were with fire) will purge and sanctifie your hearts by
faith and so justifie you from all your finnes, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
you that labour and are heavy loaden and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
in you the new birth, comfort you that mourne,
bind up your broken hearts, and speake peace to your
soules: For although repentance be a part of the Gospell
in a generall confideration, the first principle, and of the
purchase of Christ, as it is manifest by <hi>Luke 24. 47. 48.
Act. 20. 20. 21. Heb.</hi> 6. 1. &amp;c. yet the Word preaching
peace by Iesus Christ the glad tidings of remission of sins
to the repentant is the Gospell, and so called in a speciall
distinct manner from repentance, and the preaching and
the enjoyment thereof by faith is a more excellent thing
then the ministery and enjoyment of repentance. And in
this regard hee that is the least messenger of the latter, is
greater then hee that is the greatest messenger of the first.
as Christ himselfe testifieth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 11.</p>
                  <p>This is it which the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> prophecied of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concerning Christ, saying, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord
God is upon me,</hi>

                  <p>This is that word preaching peace by Iesus Christ
which is said to begin to be preached after the Baptisme

preached before this time even in all ages from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 23. 24.</note>
but because no one did receive it or had it so
preached unto him in such a speciall peculiar manner, but
such a one as was first prepared by repentance, therefore
it is said to begin to be preached after.</p>
                  <p>And because it was now to bee done in a more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97442:30"/>
and larger manner then ever it was before. Therefore
was <hi>Iohn</hi> sent before the face of the Lord in the power
and spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> to prepare his way before him.</p>
                  <p>This is it which Christ sent <hi>Iohn</hi> word of saying, <hi>Goe tell
Iohn,</hi>

                     <hi>and the poor have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
preached unto them,</hi> as much as to say, the humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant
sinners, the poore and contrite in heart, they
have the glad tidings of peace and remission of sinnes
preached unto them, and ministred unto their soules ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the prophecie of <hi>Esay,</hi> and they receive the
same, or believed it with joy and peace in their heats,
for this preaching implieth such a believing or receiving.
And so doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> interpret the words of <hi>Iohn</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Baptisme of Christ in <hi>Act.</hi> 19. where he saith
<hi>Iohn verily Baptized with the Baptisme of Repentance,</hi> saying
unto the people, <hi>that they should believe in him which should
come after him,</hi> that is in Christ Iesus, <hi>Iohns</hi> words beeing,
<hi>He shall Baptise you with the Holy Ghost &amp; with fire.</hi> So that, as,
to bee Baptized with the Baptisme of Repentance, is to
repent, to weepe and mourne for our sinnes, washing
them as it were in  this first laver: So, <hi>to bee Baptixed with
the Holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> is to believe in Christ, to bee
justified and purged from our sinnes by faith in him.</p>
                  <p>These are the true parts of regeneration, the special and

                  <p>This al the elect of God that ever were, now are or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shalbe, have had, have &amp; must have, yea the youngest
child dying in the birth or the womb, if not in outward

no one child of man begotten of flesh can be saved, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he be begotten from above, of water and of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and so changed or renewed from the polluted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled
estate of nature, which we all had and received
originally in the very conception, into the estate of grace
and love with God in Christ.</p>
                  <p>And God may worke this change, this new birth, or
rebegetting, in the wombe if it pleaseth him, as he did
in <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> or at the time of outward baptisme,
if he so please, or before it, as he did in <hi>Abraham</hi> before
circumcision in the flesh, and as in the Apostles times he
did to some, or after it, as he had done formerly after cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
and now most usually doth, since all are so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
baptized in their young estate. For we may not
limit God, neither hath he tyed himselfe to any time
or estate of nature in us, nor to any one outward action
performed by man unto us, although he hath ordained
sundry excellent, holy out ward meanes whereby he
doth direct and lead us, (as it were by the hand) to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97442:31"/>
things that are spirituall and indeed necessary, which we
are bound to imbrace with much thankfulnesse to God,
and to use with reverence, and not to despise the least of
them, nor in any part wilfully neglect them, in paine of
Gods high displeasure.</p>
                  <p>But the death and resurrection of Christ, the sacrifice of
his body and blood, the value, vertue, price, and purchase
thereof, he hath tyed himselfe unto, so as that without
it, and some powerfull administration the same to the
soule of man, there is no salvation, as Christ pronounceth
saying, <hi>Except yee eate the flesh of the Son of man and drinke his
blood, yee have no life in you, Iohn</hi> 6. 53.</p>
                  <p>The Sacraments of Baptisme and the Lords Supper,
have both respect unto this. Baptisme to the new birth,
wherein weare set in the estate of life thereby; the Lord:
Supper to the continuall Commmunion which every
one that is once made alive by it, hath therein to eternall
life, and so the flesh of Christ <hi>Is meat indeed, and his
blod is drinke indeed,</hi> to them, according to the word of
Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 54. 55.</p>
                  <p>Not as if any man did or could eat the very flesh or
drinke his blood carnally, as Doctor <hi>Cosins</hi> affirmed; not
that the bread of the Sacrament or the wine is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the flesh or blood of Christ, either before we receive
them, or after, &amp; so conveied into us as some would make
us beleev; nor any other kind of way is the flesh or blood
of Christ conveied, or infused into our bodies or sonles, to
set us in the estate of life, or to continue us in the same;
nay, then how could they that were before Christ came
in the flesh be saved? for the same necessity of eating his
flesh and drinking his blood, was to them then, even
from the first fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as is now to us; but it is the
grace purchased thereby, which we doe receive in our
hearts by faith, and which by his mediation is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
with us. For as the Law (which is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

ascend up where he was before? It is the spirit that quickneth, the
flesh profiteth nothing; the words that I speake unto you, they
are spirit and they are life; Iohn</hi> 6. 62. 63. Neither doe we
by the acts of eating the bread or drinking the wine of
the Sacrament, eate or drinke the grace of God purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the body and blood of Christ, neither is grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
or any way secretly conveied to our hearts in
the bread or wine, or by them, nor by any thing inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
unto it selfe; but it is conferred to the heart of man
by the Spirit of God, through the word of his promise,
therefore called the word of his grace.</p>
                  <p>And the instrument, hand or mouth wherewith wee
doe receive the same, is faith in the heart, caused also
therein by the operation of the same spirit,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 3.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,
for the habit and estate of eternall life,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 12.</note> and the
promise of raysing up at the last day; which Christ doth
certifie to those that eate his flesh and drinke his blood,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 54.</note>
doth he assure to them that beleeve in him;<note place="margin">Ver. 35. 40: and 47.</note> so that to
beleeve in Christ, is to eate his flesh and drinke his blood,
according to his meaning; and therefore a sinner is
sometimes said, to be justified by grace, sometimes by
the blood of Christ, sometimes by faith, because in the
act of our justification, all these doe concur, and are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the grace of God the Father, being the prime and
chiefe cause therof; the body and blood of Christ the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
principal or mediate cause, &amp; faith the instrumentall
and inferiour cause; and the justified are said also to live,
and to be saved by the grace of God, by the flesh, and
blood, and life of Christ, and by faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in this consideration, (because Christ is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97442:32"/>
mediator and reconciler between God and man) doth
he so often speake of himselfe, and say,</hi> My Father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
you the true bread from heaven; the bread of God is he which
commeth downe from heaven, and giveth life unto the world, I am
the bread of life; this is the bread of life which commeth down from
heaven, that a man may eate thereof and not dye; I am the living
bread which came down from heaven; if any man eate of this bread,
he shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh,
which I will give for the life of the world; except yee eate the flesh
of the Son of man and drinke his blood, yee have no life in you:
who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life,
and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and my blood is drinke indeed; he that eateth my flesh and
drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him; as the living
Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth
me,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 32. 33. 35. 48. 51. 53. 55. 56. 57. 58. &amp;c.</note> even he shall live by me. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And in this manner spake he afterwards of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Supper, which hee left and commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Church to bee done to shew forth his death, untill
his second comming; saying of the Bread, <hi>Take <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the Blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes Matth.</hi> 26. 26. 27. 28. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
saith of the same Sacrament; <hi>The cup of blessing which
wee blesse is it not the communion of the Blood of Christ? and the
Bread which wee breake is it not the communion of the Body
of Christ? for wee being many are one Bread, for wee are all
pertakers of that one bread, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 16. 17. as if he
should say is not this the spirituall intent and true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or signification thereof? doth it not shew forth and
give us to understand the Communion that is betweene
Christ and his Church and every member of it? how hee
hath purchased it and life, and eternall salvation for it,
with his owne Body and Blood, and that although the
members thereof bee many, yet they being by faith made
partakers of him, the true and living Bread, are all in a
spirituall manner, one body with him, and one bread,
and doe live by him.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>The like whereof hee had said before to the same</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
<hi>of the forefathers:</hi> Moreover, brethren I would
not that yee should bee ignorant, how that all our fathers were
under the cloud, and all passed through the Sea, and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea, and did all eate
the same spirituall meate, and did all drinke the same spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
drinke, for they dranke of that spirituall Rocke which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, and that Rocke was Christ, 1. Cor. 10. 1. 2.
3. 4.</p>
                  <p>So that all the holy fathers, not onely they that had
passed through the Sea with <hi>Moses,</hi> whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth
here instance for proofe, but all that were before them
and after them to his dayes, were baptized with the same
spirituall Baptisme, wherewith hee himselfe and all the
faithfull to this day have beene and are Baptized, and
did all eate the same spirituall meat, and drinke the
same spirituall drinke, as wee now doe; having all the
same benefit of Christ and of the Sacrifice of his Body
and Blood, as wee now have, and are all of him and one
body with us, and wee with them, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manifesteth saying; <hi>For as the body is one and hath many
members, and all the members of this one body being many, are one
body; so also is Christ; For by one spirit are we all Baptized into
one body, whether we be Iewes or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
free, and have beene all made drinke into one spirit.</hi> 1. Cor. 12
12. 13.</p>
                  <p>For although Christ dyed but once in the latter time,
and in one place of the world, yet his death was as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayleable with God, (with whom all things to come and
past, are present) before his comming in the flesh, and
death as since; and as effectuall to his elect of all nations,
in all times, and in all places, then, as now; for there is
but one way of salvation in him, and by him, unto all,
in all times, and in all places, though it be not declared
in a like manner and measure to all, in all times, and in all
places.</p>
                  <p>These things I doe beleeve to be true, for which, if I
