            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>FIrst, and aboue all things, we are to consider what is aboue all things to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; then for the excellencie of the goodnes in it selfe; and last, for the good that from it wee receiue: for in the instinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wee haue planted in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues an insatiable desire of knowledge, whereby we finde in our selues, somewhat more then our selues, leading vs to a longing after somewhat aboue our selues, which if by a light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning our mindes we be led out of the darkenes of our blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded sence of nature, to the cleare

beholding of the glorious brightnes of Gods graces, wee shall see that in him onely and altogether, is the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and incomprehensible greatnes of all perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and knowledge of all perfection; and that so much neerer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth our nature vnto the diuine: as by the light of grace wee feele in our selues, an apprehension or participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those graces, that es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially doe onely dwell, and are inheritant in the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

vs humbly lift vp the eyes of our hearts to the beholding of those thinges, that in the excellent great workmanship of the same, wee may finde that there is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greatnes, then wee can euer finde againe.

               <p>Looke vp the heauens, they are the works of his hands: look downe to the earth, it is the worke of his word: beholde the Seas how they are obedient to his will: now to beholde in the Sunne the light of the daye, the Moone and the Starres; as it were the lampes of the night; yet these so keepe their courses in a continuall order, that one is not hurtfull to another, but all and euery one in their seruice to man, performe their dueties to their Creator: Doth not the consideration of these obiectes to our eyes, strike an impression in our hearts of an admirable

Again, to behold the thicke cloudes, whereby the Sun is obscured, the boisterous &amp; tempestious windes, wherby the highest Caedars are shaken, and the terrible lightning and thunders, that amaze the hearts of the beholders: are not these great proofes of a great power?

               <p>Againe, consider withall, the greatnesse of his glorie, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of his greatnesse, that his Angelles tremble at his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
<pb facs="tcp:16992:22"/>
if hee touch the hilles they shall smoake, and the Mountaines shall melt at his presence, and no man can see him and liue: so greate is his Brightnesse, as no eye can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde: so pure his essence, as exceedes the sence of nature: so deepe his wisdome, as is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable in reason: &amp; so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit his perfection, as surpasseth the power of consideration: and therefore let vs consider, that in regarde of that Almightie power, in his greatnesse the greatest: yea, and all power without him is so greate a smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as nothing can be lesse.</p>
               <p>Againe, let vs in admiration of his greatnes, and knowledge of
<pb facs="tcp:16992:22"/>
his goodnes, consider whom we are to thinke on, how we are to thinke of him, what we are to thinke of our selues without him, and what we are onely in him: For the first, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are to thinke on, is the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Maiestie of all powers, the biginner of all times, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all thinges, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of al natures, the disposer of al properties, the life of all beings, and the endles glory of al graces: absolute in his power, resolute in his will, incomparable in his wisdome, and admirable in his worke: thus I saye, let vs consider whome wee are to thinke of, not a Creature but a Creator: not a King, but a
<pb facs="tcp:16992:23"/>
King of Kinges; not a power, but a power of powers; and not an Angell but GOD: now howe shall wee thinke of him? with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and remember the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mathew, Chapter 10. verse 28. <hi>Feare not him that can destroy the bodie, but feare him that can destroye both body and soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore when wee fall into sinne, let vs feare the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his wrath, and the greate power in his furie: for though hee fedde Elias in the Wildernesse by the Rauens, and preserued Daniel in the Den from the Lyons, made the Dogges licke the sores of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,
<pb facs="tcp:16992:23"/>
and made the Sunne to stay his course at the prayer of Iosuah, yet, with the wicked he maketh his Creature in the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of his wrath, tooke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther course, for the Lyons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured the false Prophets: The Beares came out of the wood to destroy the children that mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prophet: the dogs fed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Iesabell, and the darkenesse blinded the Sodomites, till fire came downe from Heauen to consume them.</p>
               <p>Consider therfore (I say) whom wee are to thinke on? in one word which concludeth all that can be spoken, God &amp; not man: for in God is all greatnesse, without whome the greatest of
<pb facs="tcp:16992:24"/>
all powers, is but the power of all smallnesse: but since so great is his greatnesse euerie way, as is no way to be comprehended, let vs onely know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his infinitenes therin to be such, as we must humbly leaue to admiration, and say with the Prophet Dauid, Psalme. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT is a position infallible, that of goodnes can come nothing but good: God then being the onely &amp; euer true and pure es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of al goodnes, of him what can be spoken but all good? is it not written, that whatsoeuer he created, hee sawe that it was good? and hauing made man to his owne Image, the best good, how did he shew to him his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding goodnes, in giuing him dominion ouer al his good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? onely the Tree of life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which though in it selfe it was good, yet in that he knew it was not good for man to meddle with, hee forbad
<pb facs="tcp:16992:26"/>
him to taste of the fruite therof; &amp; this good warning his good God gaue him, that there might nothing but good come to him: but we may well say there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good but God; it is the worde of truth spoken by the Lord of life. Our Sauiour Iesus Christ, when the Pharises cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him <hi>good Maister,</hi> his answer was, <hi>why call you me good? there is none good but God:</hi> And if the only begotten Son of God wold not be called good, how can this title of good, be properly giuen to any of his creatures? though it pleased him to say that he sawe euery thing was good that hee created, yet it was good onely respectiuely as it came from his
<pb facs="tcp:16992:27"/>
goodnes, and onely effectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as might serue to his glory: for though the spirite of man by the grace of the holy Ghost doe participate with the great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, which from his goodnes proceeding, cannot be but good; yet onely and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God doth abide and dwell that pure essence &amp; Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall goodnes, which may onely make him be iustly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called good.</p>
               <p>Now all goodnes being in him and of him, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is or may be in any part thought, or called good, must be onely in respect of God, the onely giuer of the same: and whatsoeuer good we receiue, is
<pb facs="tcp:16992:27"/>
things good, &amp; all the good that he created for the good vse of man, that good knowledge, knowledge of goodnes, and goodnes of knowledge, the perfection whereof is onely in himselfe, and the participation wherof shold be in none but the Image of himselfe: this Image did hee chuse to make in man, and this good onely to bestowe vpon man: now howsoeuer the Deuill by corruption of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, hath drawen away the hearts of those outward men which retaine in their soules small or no parte of the Image of God, vnto the delight of euill, yet those men that are touched with the least parte
<pb facs="tcp:16992:28"/>
of Gods grace, haue not onely a hatefull loathing of the nature of euill, but a longing desire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good, and a delight in the good of the desire of that good that they long after: Man being therefore by the goodnes of God elected for his best crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his best seruant and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heire with his onely beloued Sonne in his heauenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: hee hath also elected him to that knowledge of God, that by the good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may breede in him the greefe of sinne, vnto which by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he is a subiect, and a neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied desire to enioye the good that by faith he is assured to come vnto: now as he hath
<pb facs="tcp:16992:28"/>
elected man onely, and aboue all his creatures to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good, which he did as it were chuse out of all his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, to bestow onely vpon man, so did he withall giue him knowledge how to come to the possession of that good, to which onely he is elected: Oh how infinit a goodnes is this in God towards vs, in this gratious benefit of our election! oh what heart can (without the rauishing ioy of the soule) think vpon this goodnes of God towards man, that (as I aforesaid) hauing cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen him for his best creature, his best seruant and coheire, with his bestand onely beloued Son, he did not only inspire his
<pb facs="tcp:16992:29"/>
soule with an especiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge aboue all other creatures, but with this knowledge of good, a knowledge likewise of a direct way to come vnto it; which waie is not to be sought in a strange country, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints or Angells, but euen here at home, and in his holy word, and that waie to be onely founde, by the faith of that grace, that in the good creatures of God doth onely worke to his glorie: in somme, when hee himselfe is both the waie to life, and the life of the faithfull. What an excellent comfort is this in one worde, one truth, and one Christe; to seeke and finde the waie to our
<pb facs="tcp:16992:29"/>
is from the aboundance of his mercie, and for the which wee are bounde in all humilitie to giue him glory: let vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all goodnes to be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him, and himselfe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Essence of the same: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with thankefulness the good that vnworthylye wee receiue from him.</p>
               <p>First let vs thinke on the goodnes of God, in out ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that being the worst matter to worke vpon, hee would show the best of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in framing a substance to the Image of himselfe: can there be any thing so good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man as to be made the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God? and when in the
<pb facs="tcp:16992:30"/>
righteousness of the soule, which is the best goodnes in man, wee be most like vnto God? what glory are we to giue vnto him, who ingrafteth in our hearts such a loue vnto righteousnes, and such a righteous loue vnto his grace, as that by the vertue thereof we become as it were members of his sacred body, &amp; branches of the Tree of life: Consider I say thus, first the goodnes of God in our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the slime of the earth, the worst matter in the world to worke vpon, to be the best and fairest of his works in the world: and all earthly things to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but their time, in the course of their liues, man onely
<pb facs="tcp:16992:30"/>
in his grace to liue for euer: in himselfe, he is onely all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and from whome onely being onely good, we receiue this first good of our election: how great a proofe of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious essence of the goodnesse in God is this? that not by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of Angelles, nor the merrite of any power of nature, this free election of man aboue all creatures, &amp; vnder him to be Lord ouer them, fell vnto vs by the onely gratious working of his holy wil to his onely infinite glory &amp; our vnspeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: Now let vs againe consider a further goodnes, that from his grace we receiue in our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not onely to be made the best

best of his creatures, but to serue him with such loue that wee maic liue with him in glory: he hath not onely chosen vs for his best creatures, but also for his best seruants; yea his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sonnes, and not onely sonnes, but coheires with his blessed Sonne in the heauenly kingdome: he hath chosen vs before the worlde, to preserue vs in the worlde, and to take vs out of the worlde to eternall ioyes aboue the worlde: Oh what tongue can expresse the greatnes of this his goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, besides the infinite comforts, graces and blessings, that euer in this life he besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vpon vs? hee created all things
<pb facs="tcp:16992:31"/>
could giue him nothng to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade or allure him to make vs to his Image, being created: we were so poore, that wee had nothing but what he gaue vs, &amp; therfore could giue him nothing for our creation: when hee had giuen vs dominion ouer his creatures, what could wee giue him but what was his owne, and whereof he had no neede, but might commaunde at his will? naie more, what did man giue him but vnthankfulnesse in being disobedient to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement? and lastly being fallen through sinne, so farre from the state of grace that there was no meanes but the death of his dearest Sonne
<pb facs="tcp:16992:32"/>
and our Sauiour, for our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: what could wee giue him hauing nothing? and if we had had al the worlde it was but his owne, and as nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence this admirable point of his goodnes in our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Consider then for our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection we could giue him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and therefore it was only of his grace: for our creation we had nothing to giue him, for we had nothing but what he gaue vs: for our redemtion the least drop of the pretious Bloud of his deere beloued Sonne, was more worth then the whole worlde: Oh then thinke wee coulde giue him nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of so greate a loue as to
<pb facs="tcp:16992:32"/>
dye for vs: with the grace of his holy spirite hee doth sanctifie vs, and who can thinke or dare presume to buy that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious blessing of him, shall with Symon Magus perish in the horror of such a sinne, the least sparke of his grace, being more worth then the whole worlde; and the worlde all his, and man but a creature in the worlde. Againe, for our iustification, his onely righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse in his life and death, his patience, and his Passion, is the onely substance of our iustification: for as wee are iustified by faith in his Bloud, an effect of grace in the inspiration of his

holy spirite: so is that pretious Bloud of his, the glorious ground of our beleife, whereby onely wee are iustified: our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection then from grace, our creation in grace, our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by grace, out sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by grace, our iustification by grace, and our glorification by grace: what hath the world, or man, if he had the whole worlde to purchase the least parte of the glory that the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goodnesse of God hath in his mercie ordained and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the good of man?</p>
               <p>Let then no man be so blinde or blinded with the mist of arrogancie, as to runne into merite in himselfe, or to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle

Oh let vs a little consider, how many are the sundry, yea and infinite varieties of God, that by the goodnes of our election wee receiue from the mercie of the Almightie: first to be created to his owne Image, to be inspired with a Diuine knowledge aboue all his creatures, to haue domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer so many creatures, to be feareles of damnation by the assurance of our election to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, to vse the things of the world, as if wee had them not, to accompt the worlde with all the pompe and pride thereof, but as vanitie, to haue a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of sinne, and a loue to vertue, to be furnished of what

               <p>IN the mercy of God, finding so great a measure of his grace as in the bountie of his goodnes deserueth no little glory, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but with admiration speake of that grace, that through his loue made him haue such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vnto man, as to elect him to his loue, to frame him to his image, to inspire him with his spirit, to instruct him in his word, to defend him with his power, to preserue him in his mercie: to dye for him in his
<pb facs="tcp:16992:58"/>
loue, and to receiue him to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: all these and what euer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good wee receiue, either through the loue or mercye of God, are free guifts of his grace, and not for any merrit in man, How can this beame of glorious brightnes bee beheld with the cies of humilitie, but that the soule wold be rauished with the contemplation therof? and say with the <hi>Psalmist, Psalme.</hi> 103. <hi>verse.</hi> 8. <hi>Gratious is the Lord, and mercifull, long suffering, and of great goodnesse.</hi> Furthermore, of so great effect in the working of comfort in the hearts of the faithfull, is this vertue of grace in God, that wee finde the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apostles in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
<pb facs="tcp:16992:58"/>
commonlye to begin with this word <hi>Grace: Grace, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and peace from our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ:</hi> As if from grace came mercie, and from mercie peace. Oh consider the works of grace, our election out of a speciall fauour: our creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of a gratious wisdome: our vocation out of a gratious kindenes: our sanctification out of a gratious holines: our iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication out of a gratious merit: our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of a gratious loue, &amp; our glorification out of a gratious mercy.

a salutation was deliuered to the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell <hi>Gabriell, Haile Mary full of grace, God is with thee.</hi> So that if God be with any soule, it is full of grace, &amp; where the fulnes of grace is, there is surely God: but as it is written of Christ Iesus, <hi>Psalme.</hi> 45. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. That hee was annointed with the Oyle of <hi>Grace</hi> aboue his fellowes, So may wee well say of the Grace of God, it is so excellent in working to the Glorie of God, that as it is infinite in goodnes, so must it haue the same measure in glorie, I say, to be glorified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things.

               <p>Let vs then consider not only the vertue, goodnesse and glory of grace, but with all, the height and glorie therof; which being only in Iesus Christ our onely Lord and Sauiour, let vs in him onely beholde the summe and substance, the beautie &amp; bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the goodnesse and glorie thereof, &amp; forsaking our selues in the shame of our sinnes, only flie to his mercie for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte of those blessings, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
