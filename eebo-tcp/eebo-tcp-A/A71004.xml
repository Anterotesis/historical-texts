            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A true Relation of the
ſad Paſſages, between the two
Armies in the Weſt.</head>
                  <p>WHile the Lord Generall was quartered at <hi>Liſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thell</hi>
in <hi>Cornwell,</hi> He drew out his Army ſeverall
times, attempting to give the Enemy battle, but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
refuſed, (So imbelbick have they alwayes been, and
would never fight but upon great advantage) only they
had dayly Skirmiſhes by parties, about paſſages, which
the Enemy laboured to take, to hinder all Proviſions, for
Horſe and Foot, from coming to His Excellencyes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
In all which Skirmiſhes the Enemy had the worſe;
till the Enemy at laſt grew numerous, and by advantage
of incloſiers, which was with ſto<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e walles, the Enemyes
Foot got very neer His Excellencyes quarters, which was
great annoyance, and kept them to continuall duty, nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſitated
them to a narrower compaſſe, and hindred provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
every way: So that on Friday the 30. of Auguſt, His
Excellency drew his Carriages to <hi>Foy;</hi> It being conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Counſell of Warre, that His Excellency, and the
Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> ſhould go by Sea to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and that the
Horſe ſhould break their way through the <hi>Kings</hi> quarters:
Leaving all the Foot under the Command of Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51210:3"/>
                     <hi>Skippon:</hi> The Lords, (God be praiſed) came ſafe
to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and the Horſe ſafely paſt through the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Army, with loſſe to the Enemy, more then to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The <hi>Plimouth</hi> Regiment of Horſe only ſtayed
with the Foot, who were reſolved to live and dye with
them: Theſe Horſe with all the Foot, ſtood upon their
Guard, in hope ſome relief might come, or at leaſt to
make their own conditions.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy having felt the Animoſity of our Horſe,
in breaking through their Army, had little heart to purſue
them; but preſently withall their force, fell on our Foot,
on every ſide, ſuppoſing them to be all at their mercy, but
reſolved to ſhew them no mercy at all, but to have ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them up wholly: For by a Counſell of War they
had reſolved, to put every man to the Sword, and give
quarter to none: This was on Friday, the King was in
Perſon in the Army; Then to put a quick diſpatch in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
of their cruell reſolutions, they fell with all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
on our Foot, and at the firſt aſſault having taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
30. they put them to the Sword, who aſking quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they anſwered, God damme, not a man of you ſhall
have quarter.</p>
                  <p>This inhumanity of theirs, increaſed reſolution and
courage in our men, who reſolved to ſet their lives at a
high rate, beyond what the Enemy durſt bid, as indeed
they did, for after Major Generall <hi>Skippon</hi> had made a
ſhort Speech to the Army, they threw up their Hats and
gave a great ſhout, reſolving unanimouſly to fight it out
to the laſt man, and to ask no quarter, and upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
approach, they gave them many fiery Salutations,
which much amazed the Enemy, for by their great and
ſmall ſhot, ſent with reſolved courage, there fell of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
at leaſt ſix for one, inſomuch that the enemy made a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51210:3"/>
ſtand, and drew back, changing their reſolutions of giving
no quarter: and offered quarter, which that Gallant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
Major Generall <hi>Skippon</hi> refuſed, except he might
have Honourable conditions: at laſt it was graunted that
he ſhould draw his own conditions, which he did, but
not granted; yet after ſome debate, there was a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and this was on Sunday, the firſt of September.
The Treators, for the Enemy was Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Forth,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Digby.</hi> For Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Skippon,</hi> was Colonell <hi>Wichcot,</hi> Colonell <hi>Barkley,</hi>
and Colonell <hi>Butler.</hi> That night they agreed to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
which here I have ſet down Verbatim, that the
world may ſee their incongruent performance, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations

                                 <hi>FIrſt,</hi> It is agreed, That all the Officers and Souldiers, as
well of Horſe and Foot, under the Command of the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> being at the time of the concluſion of this Treaty, on the
Weſt-ſide of the River <hi>Foy,</hi> ſhall to morrow, being the Second

and that in their march they touch not at any Garriſon.</p>
                              <p>Fourthly, it is agreed, that in caſe they ſhall march from

According to theſe Articles, The Artillery, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
Ammunition, Armes, &amp;c. Were delivered into the
Kings poſſeſſion: But how contrary to theſe Articles,
they dealt with us, theſe following Teſtimonies do
teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>SIr, I have writ twice to you before, but have not
received on line from you; which makes me
thinke my Letters have miſcarryed; what our Straits
were, and have been, I formerly writ in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of our ſtraits: After the Lord Generall was
gone by Sea to Plimouth, and our Horſe made their
way through the Kings Army (of which I aſſure my ſelf
you have heard) the enemy made violent aſſaults againſt
us, greedily thirſting after our blood, as the ravening
Beaſts after their prey; intending not to leave one of us
alive: But God hath in mercy preſerved us, and did
wonderfully uphold the courage of our Souldiers, who
were reſolute and valiant, reſolving either to die like
men, or to come off with honour; inſomuch, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome ſhowers of great and ſmall ſhot, the heat of the
raging enemy was well cooled, and they willing to be
ſhut of us, upon reaſonable termes; rather then to buy
our blood at ſo dear a rate; and were willing to accept of
a Treaty: And after ſome time ſpent about the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
on Sunday night the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> we were all
agreed, and were to march away with a ſafe Convoy the
next day, with our Colours, and Drums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but with
no Arms, except Officers: But then came our miſery;
For when we had laid down our Arms, and came to
march through the enemies Army, we were inhumanely
delt with; abuſed, reviled, ſcorned, torne, kickt, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged,
and many ſtript of all they had; quite contrary to
the Articles: For preſently, even in the preſence of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51210:5"/>
King, and of their Generall, they took away our cloakes,
coats, and hats, calumniating us by reproachfull words,
and threates, if we would not deſert the Parliament, and
turn to the King; And after a day or two march, they
Stript many of our Officers to their ſhirts, taking away
their Boots, Shooes, Hoſe, &amp;c. notwithſtanding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Generall <hi>Skippon</hi> ſtoutly urged the Condition ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
times, and with much wiſdom behaved himſelf:

our Regiment out of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> amongſt which
I was one. We oftentimes skirmiſhed with the Enemie, and had
ever the better, which preſaged a Victorie to us (as I conceived)
if we would fight. The firſt time, our <hi>Plimouth</hi> Horſe (being but a
handfull) charged a vaſt body of the Enemies horſe, and put them
all to flight: I cannot deſcribe in writing, what I ſaw that day
act<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d: I was my ſelfe preſent in that Charge; It was wonderfull
to ſee the couragious hearts of our men, and the baſeneſſe of the
Enemie. This was the firſt skirmiſh of note; the reſt I omit. The
next of any note, was the day my Lord Generall began to draw
from <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iſtithiel</hi> towards <hi>Foy:</hi> At that time both Horſe and Foot
skirmiſhed, but eſpecially the Foot; That day, in the morning, we
beat the Enemie back, for divers fields; took three Foot Colours,
and one Horſe Colour, and divers priſoners and men of note: I that
day got the Princes Colours in the field: The whole body of the
Enemies horſe and foot, ſtood amazed at our Footmens reſolution.
All that day we skirmiſhed very hot, and the Enemie ſtuck very
cloſe on every ſide, plying us continually with ſhot. The night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
on, the Enemie drew into divers bodies of Horſe and Foot;
but eſpecially towards our Right and Left Wing, two vaſt bodies of
Horſe appeared, their Foot concealing themſelves as well as they
could; yet we plainly perceived, their intention was, that night to
fall on, or to give us a great Alarme; which they did to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
The next night, my Lord Generall, and the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> and
Sir <hi>John Merrick</hi> took boat for <hi>Plimouth:</hi> and, as it fell out, it was
well they went, (I meane the Lord Generall, and Lord <hi>Roberts</hi>)
for without all queſtion the Enemie would have killed them. On
Sunday we had a Parley, and it ended the ſame night: the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
agreed upon, I believe you have heard: but how they were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated,
I am ſure you cannot know, except you had ſeen it. Sir, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, no tongue can expreſſe the barbarous uſage of our men by
the Enemie: They ſtripped many hundreds ſtark naked, wounded
many, and pillaged moſt of their money, coats and hats. This was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51210:6"/>
on the Munday, Septemb. 2. They made us, after we had laid down
our armes, to ma<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch through the Kings Army, where the Souldiers
came upon us in moſt barbarous manner, moyling our men in the
dirt, and kicking them, pulling all from them, doublets, hoſe, and
ſhirts, leaving many ſtark naked. When we came from the Kings
Army to <hi>Liſtithiel,</hi> the poore Souldiers were aſſaulted with more
crueltie by the Towns-men and women of <hi>Liſtithiel,</hi> who ſtripped
many men ſtark naked, not leaving them any thing to cover their
nakedneſſe: And I ſaw them ſtrip a woman of our partie, to her
ſmock; ſhe had lyen in but three dayes before: they took her by
the haire of her head, and threw her into the River, and there had
almoſt drowned her: the woman dyed within twelve houres after.
Divers other women and men were ſerved in the like nature.
Alſo, upon <hi>Liſtithiel</hi> Bridge, there met three brethren, two were
on the Kings partie, and one for the Parliament; The two laid hold
on the other brothers throat; one of them would have killed him;
but the other was more mercifull: yet they ſtripped him, and beat
him, and ſwore, If ever they caught him againe, they would kill
him. It is not five ſheets of paper will contain the Stories and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies
of this kinde. They ſo courſed and hurried our Souldiers,
that many fell down under their mercileſſe hands; others, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
thirſt, were forced to drink water, worſe then runs in the
channels in London ſtreets.</p>
                  <p>After we were paſt <hi>Liſtithiel,</hi> we marched ſomething quietly, till
night; and then we were ſet upon as we marched, and divers of
our Captaines were ſtripped at that time, to the great terror of the
Common Souldiers. We marched about ſeven miles from <hi>Liſtithiel</hi>
on Munday: that night we lay in the fields neere to a ſpring, which
was ſome refreſhing, having no other proviſion. This night they
ſtole away divers of our horſes; my horſe was ſtollen that night,
and I was forct to foot it to <hi>Southampton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On Tueſday morning we marched towards <hi>Horſebridge:</hi> when
we came within two miles of the Bridge, on the Down, we were
ſtayed: they told us, we muſt not march, till further order from
the King; which much amazed us: Sir <hi>John Browne</hi> commanded
the Convoy; and Generall Major <hi>Skippon</hi> urged the Articles to
him, and preſſed the unjuſtneſſe of the action, in ſtaying us: but
within the ſpace of an houre, news came, we might march; We
with much. willingneſſe advanced; and having gone about two
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51210:6"/>
miles farther, we were ſtoped again for the ſpace of an hour, by
Generall <hi>Goring;</hi> yet we marched that night to <hi>Bren-farr,</hi> where
we ſcarce had the benefit of water; we lay in the open fields that
night alſo, it being a bitter Rainy night.</p>
                  <p>On Wedneſday morning, we advanced toward <hi>Ockhampton,</hi>
which Town we deſired to have to quarter in; when we came
within a mile of the Town, news came to us, We muſt advance no
further, the Kings Force being before us in the Town: this cauſed
no ſmall trouble; you might read diſcontent in every mans face, and
hunger in all: this being the third day they had marched without
victual's The Major Generall freely ſpake his minde to the Convoy,
intreating for us with threats, rather then flatteries; and deſiring to
have quarter in the Town, at laſt it was granted, and into the Town
we came: they quartered in the Town, and we quartered in the
Town; but they ſtopt all manner of Proviſions from our men:
the Souldiers lay this night in the field, but they lay neer the Town;
where you might have heard, the ſaddeſt moans, and direfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
for Bread, that ever ear heard. That night a Penny Loaf
would have been ſold for half a Crown, and many thanks beſides:
I my ſelf offered twelve pence for three ounces of Bread, at laſt I
got about three ounces for ſix pence: I ſee ſome of the Souldiers
pay ſix pence for a peece of poor Cheeſe, not weighing three
ounces; and many of them pay the ſame rate for that proportion.</p>
                  <p>On the Thurſday, we marcht from <hi>Ockhampton,</hi> forth of <hi>London</hi>
Road, that we might avoid the Kings forces, which alwayes lay in
our way, on purpoſe to eat up our Proviſions from us: we came
that night to a little Village; where we had ſome accommodation for
our ſelves and Souldiers: the next morning we advanced towards
<hi>Teverton,</hi> where we intended to quarter, and our Souldiers were
exceeding willing to go thither, expecting good quarter there; but
when we came within three miles of the Town, news came, we
muſt not come neer it, for the Kings forces were there, which
made us betake our ſelves to a little Village, two miles on our l<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ft
hand; when we came to the Village, the Kings forces were there
alſo, which conſtrained our poor, wearied, and hungry Souldiers,
to lie in the hungry fields. In the next morning, we were to march
towards <hi>Collington;</hi> in the way, ſome of our Souldiers miſtook
their way, and went a mile from the Army: many of which, were
moſt miſerably wounded; ſome were killed within a little of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton:</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51210:7"/>
and divers men we never ſee ſince, and many that eſcaped,
came to us all blood, and wounded. After this we were pritty well
rid of our enemies, and our poor ſtarved men began to gather
courage. In all this trouble, I obſerved Major Generall <hi>Skippon</hi>
in his carriage: but never did I ſee any man ſo patient, ſo humble,
and ſo truly wiſe, and valiant in all his actions, as he: his Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Colonell was ſtripped to his ſhirt, by a Sergeant Major of the
Kings. I bleſſe God, though I loſt all my Clothes, and other things,
which my man had in his cuſtody; yet my ſelf was untouched:
I brought off my Piſtols and my Sword; it was Gods great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to me, for there was much inquiry after me: they asked of
my own Souldiers, which is <hi>E. H.</hi> they fearing ſome evill, would
not tell them. I thank God, I reſcued ſome of our men out of the
Enemies hands: for they took me to be one of the Kings ſide. I
give thanks to God for all. Sir, I beſeech you take not his for a
