            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Your black-lead is to draw over that againe which you drew before in Char-coal,<note place="margin">Black-lead.</note> because this will not wipe out under your hands when you come to draw it with your pen; and if you shall draw it with your pen before this, you Charcoal would furry your pen that you could not write with it, and besides you cannot so well mend your faults with a pen as with a black-lead, for what you doe with your pen you cannot alter, but wherein you erre with your black-lead, you mend it with your pen.</p>
               <p>The pen is the finisher of your work, with which you must be most exact, knowing<note place="margin">Pen.</note> it is unalterable, therefore you must be sure your worke is right before you draw it with your pen.</p>

               <p>When you can do these, practise to draw Pots, Bals, Candlesticks, Pillars, a Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with a leafe, &amp;c. but be sure you be perfect in the out-stroake, before you goe to draw the shadows within.</p>

               <head>Generall Rules for the Practise of Drawing.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HAving your charcoal neatly sharpned, you must at the first in drawing of a face, lightly draw the out-stroak, or circumference of the face Iust according to the bignes of your pattern, making it to stand fore-right, or to turn upvvards or dovvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards according to your patterne, then make some little touches vvhere the features as the Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Chinne, should be placed, not drawing them exactly at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and having thus exactly pointed out the places where the features should bee: begin to draw them more exactly, and so proceed, till the face be finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then make the hair, beard, and other things about it; In making of a side face you need not at first exactly draw the nose, mouth and chin that stand in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most line, but onely make it at first but a bare circumference, turning this way, or that way, according as the pattern doth, and then make the mouth, nose and chin to come out afterwards, in the right places and Iust proportion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Circles, Squares and Triangles that are made in the Print, about a face, are to guide your apprehensions the more readily to the framing of one, that being as it were led by a line, you may the more easily know where abouts to place the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as eyes, nose, mouth, &amp;c. which when you are able to doe without them; these are of no use at all, but onely to guide you at the first to the placing of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In the third place you must be sure to place the musles in their right and proper places; by the musles I meane all the shadows that are caused by some dents, or swellings in the face, and be able to find out the reason of every musle, that so you may proceed to work with the more Iudgement; you shall perceive the musles most in an old and withered face, and you must first draw the principall of them, and then you may the more easily draw the lesser within; you must be very exact in the right placing of them, or else you spoyle your draft be it never so good.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Observe to make the shadows rightly, and be sure not to make them to darke, where they should be faint, for if you doe you can never recover it to make it light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the whole face will be mar'd, and appear unhandsome; the shadows are generally fainter and lighter in a faire face then in a swarthy complexion: when you have finisht your draft, you will do very well to give here and there some hard touches with your pen where the shadows are darkest, which will adde a great life and grace to your drawing.</p>
               <p>When you have finisht the face, then come to the ears and haire, wherein you must observe this rule, having drawne the out-line of it, you must first draw the principal Curles, or master-strokes in the haire, which will guide you with ease to doe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> curls which have their dependance on them; always make your curle to bend, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> exactly according to the patterne, that they may lye loose and safte, and not look as if they were stiffe, stubborne and unplyable: When you have drawne the curls rightly you must in the last place strike in the loose haires which hang carelesly out of the curls.</p>
               <p>When you can draw a face (which is the principall thing in the Art) then goe to hands and arms, legs and feet, and so to full bodies of men and women, which are the most difficult things, which if you can attaine to performe, with a well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, proceed to draw it more perfectly, and make the bending of the Ioynts, the rist-bone, and other principal things, somewhat exactly. And lastly goe over it again, and draw every small bending or swelling of the fingers, and make the nails, knuckles and veins, so many of them as appear, and every thing else that you can discerne. Observe this rule in all your drawings, that before you come to draw your draft with Black-lead, or other thing, you must blow off the loose dust of the coal off from your drawing, or faintly to whiske over your drawing with a fether, that so you may leave it faint, so that you must but Iust perceive your stroakes, and by this means you will the better see how to draw it againe with your black-lead, otherwise you would not be able to discern your stroaks.</p>
               <p>For the proportions of a hand, you have it sufficiently set downe in the print, by lines and figures, which shews the equalities of proportion in a hand, and how many equall measures there are in it, which you should endeavour to be acquainted with, that so you might know when a hand is well proportioned, with Iust and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall distances; but I would you should take notice of this rule, or exception, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the hand turns one way or other, the proportions must be shortned, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they appear to the eye, as you shall see in the fore-shortning of the hand in the print; so much as the hand turns away from our sight, so much it looses of its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proportion, and is made to shorten unto that proportion that the eye Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it, nay sometimes a whole finger, sometimes two or three, or more, is lost to our sight, by the turning of the hand another way from us, and so they must be holy left out, and not made. For feet there is not so much difficulty in the making of them, as in hands; and in drawing of them, you must proceed to the same way that was shewed for the making of hands. When you can draw hands and feet pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well, then goe to arms and legs, wherein is little difficulty; when you can draw the hands and feet, afterwards proceed to whole bodies.</p>

               <p n="1">1 First, you must draw the outmost lines of your garments lightly, and in this you must be very carefull, for the whole grace of a picture lies in the outmost draft, and not in the curious work within. Now that you might performe this exactly, you must suite your garments to the body, and make them bend with the body, and not to make them strait there where the body should bend; if you would rightly fit the garments to the body, you must observe which part of the body bends in or out, that the garment may answer to the body upon the least turning one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the garment may turne with it; you must also observe where the body should come if it were naked, and there draw your garments in the right place, making it bend according as the Ioynts and limbs of the body should bend: Excellent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe make the body appeare plainly thorow the garments, especially where the garment lyes close and flat upon the body, and indeed where ever the body bends in or sticks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2 You must begin at the upper part of the garment, and so draw down that part of the garment on both sides that lies closest upon the body, before you draw the loose part that flies off from the body, for if you draw the loose part of the garment first, before you have finisht that part that lies next upon the limbs and parts of the body, you will be soon out, and be apt to place the body crooked and awry; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many workmen draw the naked first, and afterwards put on their garments; for by that means they can better see to place the garments rightly, so as to hang even upon the body, and by this means you will be sure to place the body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>When you would use your colour, take of it as much as you can well spread about the sides of a shell, somewhat thin, and not on heaps, and so temper it finely with your gum as before.</p>
               <p>To avoid the cracking of your colour, and flying from the shell, to which some colours are subIect; take a little fine pouder of white Sugar-candy, and with it and a little faire water temper the colour over againe with your finger till the candy be dissolved.</p>
