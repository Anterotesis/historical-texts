            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This prudent Prince (I say) looking deliberately into the Wounds those Statutes had given, to the honor and happiness of the Kingdom, and to that ancient and most venerable part of the Common Law, (which preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Subjects persons from Imprisonment) and the very many Kings Reigns and Ages, (without any the least interruption) which that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and famous Liberty, had prosperously continued, and (as it were) repenting of the making of the said bitter Statute, of the twenty fifth year of his own Raign, and he and his Parliament, finding the mischievous inconveniences and dishonor, that it had put upon the people, and resolving, to file those Shakles, from off the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects feet, and to reinvest them into the Liberty and freedome of their persons, from imprisonment, according to the common Law of the Land, by that gracious healing Statute, made in the two and fortieth year
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31394:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Reign of the same King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. those two Raizor metled cutting rigorous Laws were (as to such Imprisonment as aforesaid) by the opinion of many, and by the general construction of Law, and the true intendment hereof) Repealed, which declared, that the Great Charter should be holden, and kept in all points; and (if any Statute be made to the contrary) that it should be holden for none, which said last mentioned Statute, was (according to common construction) intended fully to restore the brightness and luster, of the ancient Common Law, and to support and maintain the strength and vigor of that Standard, of Law and Justice (the Great Charter) which not only asserts His Majesties just Rights and Prerogative Royal, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends and preserves the Freedom and just Liberties of the people, which (as the same Author in his Preface to his second Institute) tells us, hath been confirmed, by two and thirty Acts of Parliament, and not only so, but (by the Statute of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the First) the same is to be taken, as the Common Law. But the seting up, and creation of the great numbers of Offices and Officers, and the herds of persons, which those most severe Laws <hi>Westminster</hi> the Second, and the Statute of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third) had most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously preferred, almost in every City, Town, and Village of the Kingdome, had so fix'd, fastned, and rivited such Multitudes of persons (many of them of very great and eminent quality and interest) in places of great and tempting gain, which had made so deep an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, upon the minds of that prevalent and powerful part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (who had thereby plentifully enricht themselves) that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the said Statute, of the two and foroftieth <hi>Edw.</hi> the Third, so intentionally composed as aforesaid, for the manumitting of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> (as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from the thraldome of a Prison, as otherwise to preserve their Liberty) they went on to Imprison the Bodies of the Subject, which hath ever since been practised, not only (by vertue of those two Laws, <hi>Westminster</hi> the Second, and the twenty fifth of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Third) but that of <hi>Acton Burnell,</hi> and the Statute <hi>de mercato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> touching Arrests upon Statutes, Staple, and Merchant, and by other Laws built upon them, which (contrary to the antient Common Law, (as is very plain) doth continue the invassilation of Imprisonment against, and upon, all the free born Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> except the Lords, and they themselves (in some case) as the Law by some is holden to be) are not exempted neither: for if a Nobleman be Outlawed (as it is holden) he may be arrested and Imprisoned, and (until the Outlawry be reverst, is not only incapable to sit in the House

of Peers, but all his personal Estate is forfeited, and his Lands in the same condition, with any other Subject. So that it is indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably clear, how great an Intrenchment the Imprisonment of Mens persons, is, upon the honor of the antient Common Law, of which, as the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Coke</hi> saith, the Great Charter, is but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory, and as a late Writer, (from good authority) tells us, did not grant any thing <hi>de Novo,</hi> but that thereby our antient Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, were only repeated and confirmed, and indeed all those our Ancestors maintai<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

So that there wants nothing to make it fully demonstrable, that by our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors magnanimity, and resolved courage, (in maintaining the antient Common Law) they and their Posterity were not only establisht in their just Rights, but were preserved from such Imprisonment for Debt or Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages (or any thing thereunto relating) two hundred and fourteen years after the Norman Conquest, which now is inflicted, upon many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of His Majesties Good, Loyal, and Faithful Subjects, to the utter ruine of them, their Families, and Relations, whilst those (who have lined their Iron Consciences, with nothing but their profit, and their Chests throughout, with the Wealth of the Kingdome, (which they have gotten by the late unhappy differences and troubles) smile to see those, who have sacrificed their Bloods, nay themselves, and theirs, in and to His Majesties faithful Services) <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> up (by many of them) in disconsolate and loathsome Prisons, and thereby made useless nothings, to the World and themselves. Whereas, (if we cast our eyes back, into the Reigns of the Saxon Kings, we shall find, that (those Martial, Wise, and Wary Princes) King <hi>Ina,</hi> King <hi>Echelston,</hi> and after them, all the Saxon Kings, (according to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent British Laws) were so very tender of the Imprisonment of Mens persons, that they did not punish their very Bond-Men with it. And King <hi>Alfrede,</hi> displaced and Imprisoned one of his Judges, for daring so to do, and (when the Government devolved, and came to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans) William</hi> the Conqueror, <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the First, took such exact care to preserve this liberty, un-infringed, that (in their Reigns) not any person was Imprisoned, (although for mortal crime

it self) unless he were first attainted, upon the Verdict of twelve Men. And (additional to all this) many ages after the Conquest (by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Common Law) the Writ <hi>de Odio &amp; Atia,</hi> was given to a Man that was Imprisoned, although for an hainous Crime, (for the death, of a Man) yet the Law (in that golden age) in favor, and out of an high esteem it had of the Liberty of a Man, and that his Body should not be detained in Prison, until the Justices in Eyre should come) he might sue out this Writ, directed to the Sheriff; and although the offence (for which he was committed) was not baylable by Law) yet the ancient Common Law, did so highly hate and abominate, the long Imprisonments of Men, that it gave him this Writ for his relief, which appears by <hi>Bracton,</hi> in his third Book, <hi>fol.</hi> 121. and by <hi>Fleta,</hi> in his first Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. And with whom also <hi>Glanvell</hi> agreeth, in his forteenth Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. And the <hi>Myrror of Iustice</hi> (a Book of great Antiquity and Estimation in the Law, as well as the Books before cited) <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. complains of the Imprisonment of Mens Persons, as an abuse, although it had been for breaking of a Goal. Now, for that it is clear as the light, how highly valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and dearly precious, the Liberties of Mens persons were (by the Common Law of the Land) it is (in most humble and submissive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) proposed, that (as well for the general good of all His Majesties Subjects, as for Prisoners) the antient Common Law may be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that great Liberty of the Freedome of all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> from Imprisonment (for Debt or Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages) may (by the Grace and Favor of His Majesty, and of both His Honorable Houses of Parliament) be again retreived, and brought back with Honor, to the people of this Kingdome; and that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient forms and ways for recovery of Debts, may be (as for several hundred of years it was) by Original Writ, <hi>distress infinite, Fieri fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias,</hi> and <hi>Levari facias</hi>; and as (by the ancient Common Law) it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued (with great and happy peace and tranquillity) for such great length of time as aforesaid. And certainly great reason it is, that it should be so, all Debts and Damages being to be properly had out of the Estate of the Debtor, and not his Person. It is said, by the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Coke,</hi> in his third Report, <hi>fol.</hi> 11, 12. that the Common Law hath, and had its foundation laid and built, upon the true grounds of Reason, and that being granted, (as of necessity it must) then it will consequentially follow, that it were an Act of as much Honor, as Justice, to restore to the people of <hi>England,</hi> the possession of the Inheritance and birth rights, which they all have in, and to

the ancient Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and of which they have so long and unhappily been diseised, who indeed have too long already groaned under the very miserable alteration thereof, by such the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment of Men as aforesaid. And indeed, the very large, vast, and sufficiently known great Prudence, truly wise Apprehensions, and Princely compassion of His late Majesty, (of ever precious and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious memory (now in Heaven) towards his Subjects) were such, that it is eminently known, (that had not the unhappy eruption, of the late Civil War, prevented it) the bent of his full resolutions were, to have intimated his recommends to the Parliament, for the discharge of all Prisoners for Debt or Damages, and the absolute taking away of all Arrests and Outlawries, upon some reasonable compensation, to be made for the emoluments that thereby came to his Crown, which was then hoped would have gone under no great difficulty, to have been done, and is now (with as great facility and ease, (as is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) by the Wisdome of the Parliament) to receive a full and perfect consummation; and as his said late Royal Majesty was pleased to say, (in the Court of the Highest Injustice, the Christian World ever knew) that he thought he understood the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> as well as any Gentleman of his Kingdome, (whose profession it was not) so (by this intentional Act of his (had it succeeded) he had made it fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident, to all his people, that (by restoring the antient known Law of the Land herein) to its pristine and original just strength, and vertue) he would thereby, as well have compelled their ignorance to understand, with how great and profound knowledge, (in the very antient Laws of the Kingdome, as the more modern) he was largely and plentifully furnisht, as by his un-enthrawling, new and fresh enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising his Subjects herein, and by calling them, (and his and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws) out of the dark Caves and Dens of Prisons, (where for so great length of time) they had lain Sepulchred together. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is a Solicisme, that may be justly thought on, that the Law which is so kind and merciful to my Horse, as to take provisional care for a Replevin to inlarge him,, and yet that I my self, should be reteined in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>durance, under a perishing condition, nay and without as much as any difinitive time (by Law) set for my releasement, and for years, that may tell steps, to the last stand of my life, there to melt and burn out my time, by a kind of every days death. And I can (in no sort) doubt, but that Wise and Prudent Men, will seriously, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately perpend and consider (as elsewhere I have said) that this is the case of almost every English Subject, for (let him be crammed with

never so much Wealth, (yet he knows not, (nor is it possible for him to know or foresee) how soon he may be in a Prison himself, or if not himself, yet his Widdow, Child, or Children, near and dear Relations, Kinred, or intimate Friends. And notwithstanding all this, if it shall be thought too great a boone, that all Imprisonments for Debt or Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, should (now and for ever hereafter) be taken totally away, and the blessed antient Laws of <hi>England,</hi> be thereby fully and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily restored, to all persons in general (as is hoped and desired it may be) it is then humbly recommended, to a serious and deliberate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, that (taking into due consideration, the late direful miseries, which (like raging and tempestuous Waves) have (one in the neck of another) rowl'd in upon those that are now in Prison, and their Estates, by the several great and calamitous Judgments of the late Civil War, Plague, Fire, and Dutch War) if it may not come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a just and conscientious commiseration, to free and discharge all such as are now Prisoners, in the several Prisons of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> from their Imprisonments; and yet notwithstanding (such their discharge) that their Creditors may have their just and antient Remedies, such as by the antient Common Law, they might have had, for recovery of their Debts, out of such Prisoners real and personal Estates, by such way and means, as the same antient Law prescribes, and as (herein before is set forth and declared; which most modest Proposal, being only on the behalf of such, as are now Prisoners; and being not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as a standing Act to continue, and discharge Prisoners in future) is hoped, will find a gentle and smooth passage, to its desired end. But if this must be also thought an Act of Grace, too large, yet certainly it cannot be apprehended, less than a perfectly honest, and truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious offer (in lieu of their being dischardged from their Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) to be ready and willing to part with all their Estates, both real and personal, for the satisfaction of all their Creditors; and not only to submit themselves, but any Witness or Witnesses, to be examined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, for the true discovery thereof, and that (for such only) as are now Prisoners, and no other as aforesaid, which if it be not) an equal, purely fair, and just proposal) I leave any impartial and unbyast person to judge. For the perfecting of which, a Bill, preparatory to an Act of Parliament is drawn, and humbly desired (by many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Prisoners that the same may pass, or some such other, (for their Relief and Releasement, as to the Wisdome of the Parliament, shall seem more apposite and convenient.

               <p>To these Heads of a Bill, perhaps there may be several Objections: As first, That (in what is here proposed for a Bill) there is no provision, that (in case the Prisoner hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to have an Estate after he is discharged) that such Estate shall be Subject to his Debts.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="response">
               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>To which is answered, That the Prisoner (parting with all his Estate voluntarily, it will seem very severe, that he should not be capable of a Legacy, or other Gift from any Friend and Relation, but that it must (of necessity be (upon the matter) devised or given to his Cerditors. Or that he, (who by remaining in prison) could never (in the least) have advantaged his Creditors, yet (being discharged and at liberty) all his labours should be exposed to his Creditors mercy.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="objection">
               <head>Objection.</head>
               <p>Secondly, (And which is a very great objection) That by the heads of this Bill (although Mortgages are to be paid first) yet Judgements, Statutes, and Recognizances are thereby but in the same degree with Bonds, and to be paid equally, although the Law gives them a priority in payment.</p>

               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>To which it is answered, That (in this case) if a Judgement, Statute or Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, should (according to the rule of Law) be paid before Bonds, then (as this Case is) there cannot be (as it may fall out) a proportionable Divident of the Estate, nor indeed any Divident at all; for one Judgement, Statute or Recognizance may swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up the whole Estate; besides, it is plain, that (by the Statute made against Bankrupts) Judgements, Statutes, and Recognizances, are equally, and proportionably paid with Bonds, and no otherwise; so that (in that case) they are (<hi>in pari gradu</hi>) with Bonds and o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her Debts; and may much rather so be in this case than in the Statute of Banckrupt, especially considering, that this is not a standing Act, but for the discharge of such only, as are now in Prison, begotten out of the several fatal accidents which have happened in this age more than in any former; by means whereof, many thousands (more then formerly) are now clasp'd, and shut up in prisons.</p>

               <p>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Proviso, that the Prisoners shall have a twentieth part of his Estate, for his present maintainance, may seem unequal, in regard (as hath been urged) That then a Tradesman (or any other in credit) may get twenty thousand pounds into his hands, and then go into a Prison, and be sure of One thousand pounds. Next, That (in regard his whole Estate will not pay his debts, without abatement) it is not reasonable that he should have a twentieth part.</p>

               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>To which it is answered, That if there shall be any one such person as would, or could designedly, (to gain 1000 l.) get twenty thousand pounds into his hands, the which (upon a due and deliberate consideration of the thing) is not easily to be imagined, ever will or can be done) yet the villany of one Man (it is hoped) shall not be put into the Ballance, with the good of many hundreds. Next (it's true) it may seem hard that the Prisoner should have any thing out of his Estate, when all will not pay his debts; and it is equally as hard, and harder, that (after he hath spontaneousl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That if due consideration be had of this intended Act or (if not of this) if care be taken for passing such another Act, as may effectually operate to the same purpose, it will be found to be a great good, and weighty work, although some persons (of whom better things might justly be expected) little regard or consider it; for it is of such consequence, to relieve the oppressed, to study, and effect such works of Piety and Charity, as concerns all the Prisoners and Prisons of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> that it will (as is hoped) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve some of the <hi>oleum &amp; opera,</hi> of every good Patriot that loves his Countrey to whom it is seriously recommended, by this (or some such other Act) to perfect a work (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with difficulty and pains) so incumbent upon all person of spacious and publick Souls; especialy weighing, that not any former age hath left a trace, or memory, suitable to the great variety of sufferings as in this.</p>
