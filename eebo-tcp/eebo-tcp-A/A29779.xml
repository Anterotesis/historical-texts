            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reader may be pleased to observe, that most of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sheets were written in the Late Reign, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be published: But the Author, who had promised to make a Sacrifice of Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> yearly, did not think there lay any great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon him, to sacrifice himself, and an Honest Bookseller, to the indignation of Mr. <hi>Hills</hi> of Pious Memory. He has been since prevailed upon, at the intreaty of some Friends, to alter the Dialogue where he saw convenient, and so to Print it: For doing which, he has not the vanity to imagine the Reader will thank him, because it comes out so very unseasonably; only he presumes Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> and Mr. <hi>T-ns-n</hi> will be sensible of the kindness, since it may help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive a certain remarkable <hi>Poem,</hi> which might otherwise have been forgotten.</p>

            <head>Preface to Mr. Bays.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Make bold to dedicate the following Dialogue to your self; for who can pretend a better right to the entertainment, than he that has furnish'd out the better part of it at his own expence? They are your own Arguments, only for the present occasion untagg'd, and divested of their dearly beloved Rhime, and you are too much a Gentleman I know, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to quarrel with me for so doing: You that have so often disguised the thoughts of other Authors, by altering the property, and putting them into Metre, cannot in Honour or Iustice quarrel with your humble Servant, for taking the liberty to turn some of your own Poetry into Prose. The truth on't is, such pretty reasonings, for their own safety, ought no more to visit the World out of the Livery of Verse, than a Bully of <hi>Alsatia</hi> to walk the Streets on any other day but a <hi>Sunday;</hi> 'tis a Garb that becomes them so extreamly well, that methinks 'tis as much pity they should ever be forced to part with it, as for an Actress that becomes her Play-house Habit, and Charms half the Town by Candle-light, to be surprized in her ordinary Dress, <hi>dans une brillante assemblée.</hi> And so far, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> all the World is obliged to justifie you; I don't mean for changing your Religion, but for defending it with the most plausible arms, that can be employed in its Service. You know the Criticks of all Ages have fallen very severely upon <hi>Lucan,</hi> for treating a true History in Verse, and if that reason hold, I think your Divines ought, every Mother's Son of them, to be condemned, for treating a Poetical Subject (as I look upon the whole body of your <hi>Italian</hi> Theology to be) in Prose. And now, Worthy Sir, to perform my promise to the World, which every honest man is bound to do, I here Sacrifice your <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Panther</hi> once more, to the memory of Mr. <hi>Quarles,</hi> and <hi>John Bunyan;</hi> which Oblation, I hope, will become the more pleasing and acceptable, through the merits and intercession of Mr. <hi>Sh-dw-ll,</hi> Mr. <hi>S-ttle,</hi> Mr. <hi>N-rris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cr-ch,</hi> Mr. <hi>D-rfy,</hi> Dr. <hi>Beest-n,</hi> and all the rest of your fellow Poets in <hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must confess, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that some years ago, I little imagined that I should ever have the opportunity of contesting with you upon this score; if your Christian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury could have settled long in any communion, I durst have sworn the Established Church could have made the justest pretensions to you; and as long as so good a pledge as the <hi>Religio Laici</hi> continued in our hands, I flatter'd my self, that you durst no more revolt to the other Party, than a King of <hi>England</hi> durst make a descent into <hi>France,</hi> that had pawn'd his Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to the Society at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this it seems is an Age of Miracles. Who could expect to see the difference made up between the <hi>Observator,</hi> and the late <hi>Occurrencer?</hi> Or that those two everlasting Adversaries, who one would have thought, like two Parallel lines, if they had been drawn out till Doomsday, could never have met, should lay aside old
<pb facs="tcp:65199:3"/>
grudges, and write for a Toleration? Who could imagine that the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> who had hitherto oppos'd the Iust Rights of Princes, would on the sudden offer Incense to the Dispensing Power, and pimp to the Prerogative? Or while so many Refugees came daily over to us from <hi>France,</hi> that your Party could have the assurance here to disown the Spirit of Persecution. Who could ever hope, till the re-converted Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi> showed them the way, that the <hi>Jews</hi> wou'd take up the Cudgels for Transubstantiation, or that those nice humoursome Gentlemen, that all along expected to find their <hi>Messias</hi> under a Royal Character, wou'd now be content to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him disguised in a Wafer? Who could believe, till the Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi> had satisfied the World as to that particular, that a Corporal Presence was a received principle of all the Reformed Churches? This policy, I must needs say it, was refined enough, and I suppose, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> your Church-men borrowed it of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who love dearly to sit idle at home, and fight out their battels by Foreigners. When you had once proved that the <hi>Jews</hi> and Protestants belonged to your Communion, there was no question to be made, but that the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> must fall in of course to uphold your Universality, just as whole Provinces and Towns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> used to drop into <hi>Lovis le Grand</hi>'s Chamber of Dependancies. Lastly, to compleat our astonishment (for the greatest Prodigy is still behind) what mortal Man in the three Kingdoms, could Dream that Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> the Poet, would renounce the Devil and all his Works, would condescend to think of saving his precious Soul, and espouse the Catholick Cause, that he had so often ridicul'd and banter'd upon the Theatre? Far be it from me, my most noble Play-wright, to speak this with a design to blame you, for justifying your Church in Verse; for, as you may well remember, I have commended you for using that conduct. No, no, honest Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> like <hi>Tullie</hi>'s Fiddler, that defined the Soul to be Harmony, so you in like manner, when you wrote the <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Panther, ab arte tua non recessisti,</hi> you never flinch'd from your old Profession; and let the ill-natured World say what it will, I am still ready to maintain, that your above-mentioned immortal piece of Controversie, is but the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part to your Essay upon Dramatick Poetry.</p>
            <p>Indeed, as Sir <hi>Roger L'Estrange</hi> in his History of the late times, has judiciously observed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Part 3.</hi>
               </note> that Murder is of no Religion: so I was in good hopes that false dealing and dissimulation were of no Religion; but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle experience in the World, and the first year of the late Reign sufficiently convinced me of the contrary. We were from all quarters arraign'd for mis-representing your Church, when no body, as I know of, was guilty of that Crime, but only your selves. To say the truth, Popery is like some sort of Painting, which is to be view'd at a convenient distance, and by an ill light, for otherwise the courseness of the colours will appear too visible; and upon that score, it must be acknowledg'd your Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaires lay under a temptation to palliate some of the grosser Doctrines; but I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether that way of proceeding did not do you a more sensible disadvantage than you were aware of. Your Predecessors, I am sure, though they lay under the same inconveniences, managed the cause with more sincerity, they argued like Gentlemen of Honour, and maintained all the controverted points as long as they were tenable: at last when they were beaten out of the field, they entrenched themselves behind an Ecclesiastical Mud-wall of Fathers and Councils, and contented themselves, as well
<pb facs="tcp:65199:3"/>
as they could, with the Churches Infallibility. They had the charity to believe, that most of their Adversaries could write, and read, that some of them had travelled abroad, and now and then for curiosity peeped into a Popish Chappel, and therefore thought it an ill advised policy to deny those practises that were too notorious to be disowned, but generously endeavoured to defend them. Whereas the modern <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mics,</hi> as if they had fallen amongst a Herd of meer <hi>Indians,</hi> that had never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with the rest of mankind, were for putting the most intollerable shams in the World. Your Religion was unpalatable enough of all Conscience, before these Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pioneers undertook the handling of it, but their awkward management made it a thousand times worse than ever. Transubstantiation of it self, the Lord knows, is a very mortifying, Self denying Doctrine; but two <hi>Czars,</hi> and two Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations are one too many for a Town, or a Church; and to oblige us to renounce our reason and senses, almost in every other Doctrine, as well as that, was an insupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able presumption. We were told, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you never made any formal addresses to the Saints, to the utter confusion of the Breviaries, and the Missal; and if they had told us at the same time, that the Fanatics never made any formal addresses to K. <hi>James</hi> for his charitable Indulgence, we could not tell how to help our selves; we were informed that the Deposing Doctrine was no principle of your Church, to the everlasting shame of the <hi>La<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eran</hi> Council; that only a civil respect was paid to Images and Reliques, that cutting of Throats for the score of Religion was a great sin, that the Scripture was no Dumb letter, no Weathercock, nor Nose of Wax as was formerly given out, with abundance more of such pretty Tenets, for which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an honest Heretic has had his Tabernacle carbonadoed beyond Sea. A certain worthy Author, supposed to be <hi>Georgius Barzon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hist. Pap. l. 4.</hi>
               </note> the titular Bishop of <hi>Waradin,</hi> in a Treatise which he dedicated to the Emperour some twelve years ago, tells him, that he was no longer oblig'd to tolerate the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> because tho he had sworn to make no invasions upon the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession; yet he was at large now whether he would observe his Oath or no; since the <hi>Protestants</hi> had departed in several particulars (which he there mentions) from that Confession. After this followed, as all the world knows, one of the bloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Scenes that ever that Country saw; which whether it were owing to this Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries Sophistry I cannot tell, but any one may see he was a well-wisher to the design. Now if we, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> had been so malicious as to have trumped the same Card upon your Priests, writ a Letter to the Pope, and told him, <hi>Worthy Sir, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as certain persons, here in the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>who pretend themselves to be true Catholics, have shamefully denied and misrepresented most of the established Doctrines of your Church; have discarded your deposing power; and made you dwindle from the Universal Bishop into the</hi> Western <hi>Patriarch: nay and to do greater affronts to your unerring Person, have acquainted all His Majesty's Subjects, that you eat and drink just for all the world like other men, and keep a Close Stool too for your private occasions, nothing of which we could have believed before: This is to acquaint your Infallibility with their Names and Offences, that you may reduce them to their duty in time, for we are afraid, if they continue still to make the same advances into He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, as they began, that they'l every man of them turn Protestants, before

the year's ended, and so become chargeable to the Parishes, where they live.</hi> Had we done this, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> as you know we had reason enough to do it, I dare not take upon me to conjecture, what had been the event; whether immuring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four Walls, or a Pilgrimage to <hi>Lapland,</hi> or their Ecclesiastical Livery pull'd over their Ears, but certain I am, that he had disown'd them for his Sons, as hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a former Pope disowned a certain <hi>French</hi> Bishop, that was sent to him in his Military Habit.</p>
            <p>As I was a saying before, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> your Predecessors managed the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie much more like Gentlemen, than those that pretended to manage it after them in the late Reign. If they palmed any spurious Fathers upon us, it is to be considered, that such artifices were the ancient laudable practice of their Church, witness <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s Charter, and the forgery of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons; that they found them ready cut and dried to their hands, and so drew them out of the Papal Armory, to support a declining cause, that could not otherwise subsist; and how far this poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is allowable in a state of war, I leave it for the Casuists to judge. After all. Forgery it self, as odious and despicable as it looks, is not in my opinion half so black a crime, as down-right lying, as you know, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> counterfeiting another mans hand is nothing near so bad, as denying his own: There is some art and dexterity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the one, but there is nothing but barefaced impudence, or cowardise in the other. He that puts false Dice upon me at play, will be reckned (as the world goes now adays) an expert Gamester, and I only to be blamed, that would suffer my self to be so imposed upon; but he that shall tell me Seven and Four is not Eleven, or that a Deuce is a Cinque, is to be used after another manner. Therefore I could methinks willingly excuse your Ancestors, who conjured up some supposititious Authors to defend the principles of their Church, (because it had been our fault, if we had not discoverd the trick) but I shall never forgive those everlasting Blockheads, that disowned most of the Doctrines of their Religion, all the while they were a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them within doors. If it had been my fortune, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to have been in company with the Author of the <hi>Nubes Testium,</hi> or the <hi>Speculum Ecclesiasticum,</hi> I promise you, upon the word of a Young Author, that hopes to flourish in this wicked World, I had not fallen into the least passion or fury, but only offered them a little sober advice: <hi>Pray good Gentlemen, don't squander away the poor Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church after so profuse a manner; take some mercy of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and don't set them all upon one single throw; consider how many hundred years they have been a gathering for you, use your Fathers frugal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and discreetly, do you think their keeping has cost the Pope nothing all this while? Let St.</hi> Ierome <hi>and St.</hi> Austin <hi>come on to day, and bring St.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, <hi>and honest St.</hi> Bernard, <hi>into the Field to morrow. Take a Friends Counsel, Gentlemen, and never hazard all upon one chance: Alas! He that throws away his Fathers extravagantly, was never at the pains of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting them himself; as we say, that Aldermans Son that makes Ducks and Drakes with his money, never knew the trouble of getting it; and therefore, good Gentlemen, pray don't make Ducks and Drakes with your Fathers.</hi> This is all, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I assure you, that I should have said to them, but if I had met with the Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> or any of the Misrepresenters that Copied from him, I don't know how far my resentments might have carried me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65199:4"/>We have all the reason in the World, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to thank our Stars, that your Divines in the late Reign proved as feeble Statesmen, as they were Disputers. Had a wise able Cabal, men of foresight and conduct, been to manage so golden an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, perhaps we might have had as much reason then to curse the dexterity of their Policies, as we have now to congratulate their Blunders. Infallibility was the word in the Church, as Arbitrary Power was in the State, and by the sound of these two Almighty Words, you thought to Proselyte the whole Nation, but experience has since convinc'd you, how little they signified. Of a Iesuit, before we came to make trial of him, we had as terrible an Idea, as the <hi>Romans</hi> had of Elephants in their War with <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> we forgave them for being so tamely vanquish'd in the age before, and charitably ascribed it to the restraint they lay under in former Reigns, but when they had the Government to support them, besides the goodness of their Cause, we expected nothing less than miraculous performances. They were pleased, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to disappoint our expectations in that case, as well as several others, till at last they grew so very contemptible, that even one of our Protestant Footmen took a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Society, and held his Nose to Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s <hi>Preservative,</hi> just as the <hi>Americans,</hi> to try the immortality of their new Invaders, took a straggling <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and dipt his Head under water. We expected you would have performed your promises, in relation to the Established Religion, not so much for the principles of your Church (for those we knew very well) as for your hon<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur and interest, and yet even there you thought fit to disappoint us. What need I say more? There was nothing in the whole riddle of the late Reign, that did not fail our expectations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Irish</hi> that came over, and the <hi>Dissenters;</hi> the last promised to Sacrifice their Lives and Fortunes, as the former, without question, promised to fight: But as we all imagined, neither of them kept their word, and therein they answered our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Certainly, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> no men in the World ever miscarried so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in all their projects as your <hi>Priests</hi> did, they acted the Counter-part to <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>'s Story, came from a School to a Kingdom; and like him too, at last, were thrown from a Kingdom to a School. They took care, we thank them, to break the Neck of their Religion before they withdrew, and left us of the Reformation to interr her, and we shall take care, like the young Gentleman that buried his penurious Father, to lay so heavy a Tomb-stone upon her, that she shall never rise in judgment against us.</p>
            <p>There's a remarkable passage, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> in your Tragedy of <hi>Don Sebastian,</hi> about Clergymen, which I shall make bold to transcribe.
<q>
                  <l>
                     <note place="margin">p. 24.</note>For Churchmen, tho they itch to govern all,</l>
                  <l>Are silly, woful, awkard Politicians;</l>
                  <l>They make lame mischief, tho they mean it well.</l>
                  <l>Their Interest is not finely drawn and hid,</l>
                  <l>But seams are coursly bungled up, and seen.</l>
               </q>
Whether you had an eye upon your own Church-men, when you wrote these lines, does not signify a farthing, but for your comfort, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> the Character suits them as exactly, as if they had sate for their Pictures. To give your old Enemies, the Dissenters Liberty of Conscience, after you had so unmercifully harrast them before, was so palpable a Sham, that without dispute they understood it well enough, and
<pb facs="tcp:65199:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tho for their present case they accepted of it, they were not such errant fools to imagine, that because Fanaticism brought in Popery, therefore Popery would out of complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance bring in Fanaticism. To publish King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Papers that were pretended to be found in his Closet, was another lamentable miscarriage, for what could create a greater aversion to your Church, than to let people know, that it tolerated a man to live in a contrary Perswasion, notwithstanding he was otherwise obliged by every thing that was sacred here upon Earth, and that it countenanced the blackest Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie. I dare not take upon me to conjecture, whether those Papers were spurious or no, but by making them publick, I am sure King <hi>Charles</hi> secured as many to the Established Church, as he did by passing the Test; and if I had been one of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet-Council, I am sure I had sooner consented to let the Bible walk abroad in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> than to Print them. To ride the late Unhappy Monarch after that unsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rate as your Priesthood did, to make the best of Friends, and the justest Master, a Prince that had every thing that was Generous and Heroick in his Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to feel the Pulse of his meanest Officers about the Penal Laws, to make him Sacrifice his Promise so solemnly plighted to his people; what was it but to let the Subject see beforehand, how triumphantly you wou'd domineer over him, if you had once got the ascendant? Tho you had Adulterated all the Ecclesiastical Writers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and the Creation, we could have pardoned you, but for debauching a Prince that was so dear and tender to us, and who's only fault was to take you for Oracles, we shall never forgive you. To ridicule us for holding <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> a Doctrine, which you ought for your own sakes, to have been encouraged, and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, was so gross a piece of Stupidity, that a <hi>Laplander</hi> one would have thought, could never have been capable of; and if we have not lived up to the height of that principle, you are, to my knowledge, the unfittest men in the World to make the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. To make Transubstantiation stand upon as good a bottom as the Trinity, and pretend that we had as great reason to believe one as the other, what other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences could it naturally produce, but that both Doctrines were to be equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. And indeed, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I am apt to believe, from the conduct and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of your Priests, that since they could not introduce their Religion amongst us, they thought it the best expedient to set up Atheism. For as St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> in his Treatise <hi>Contra Vigilantium,</hi> has somewhere observed (and why may not I, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> palm a Father up<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n you, as well as your party has palmed a thousand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us?) A Papist and an Atheist differ like a jealous man, and a Cuckold, like Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman and Mayor; a little time makes one the other. Sow Atheism in one Age, and it will infallibly produce Popery in the next; for Popery begets Atheism, and Atheism begets Popery, just as Peace and Poverty beget one another in the Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack. The World is a very melancholly place, with<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut the diversion of one Religion or another; Statesmen or Poets, would in a short time trump up some new way of Worship, to amuse the people, and after their recovery out of Atheism, Popery, as the grossest Religion, would soonest take with Mankind, just as when one comes out of a dark Cave, or a Dungeon, the grossest objects first employ the eye-sight So that in my opinion, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> your Canon-Law ought as well to have taken care, that a <hi>Sceptick</hi> and a true <hi>Catholick</hi> should never Marry, for fear of committing Incest, as it has already provided, that those that have stood God-father, and God-mother
<pb facs="tcp:65199:5"/>
at a Baptism should not joyn, to the tune of <hi>for better for worse,</hi> for fear of violating the rules of a spiritual Consanguinity. If you say, this is uncharitably urged upon you, I cannot tell how to help it, for if we do not run out into the rankest infidelity, we are not to thank your Church for hindring us.</p>
            <p>But now to come more closely to you, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I should never have taken this second occasion of reviving your old Transgressions, but that you have lately given us the justest provocations in the world to attaque you. You tell us in your Preface to Don <hi>Sebastian, That if ever a man has reason to set a value upon himself, 'tis when his ungenerous Enemies are taking the advantage of the Times upon him, to ruine him in his reputation.</hi> Now what reputation you have to lose is a mysterie to me, or any one else that knows you; that little you had, has been lost and forfeited many years ago. The <hi>City and Country Mouse</hi> ruined the reputation of the Divine, as the <hi>Rehearsal</hi> ruined the reputation of the Poet; so that upon this score, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> whatever Adversaries shall fall upon you for the future, you may as well comfort your self, that you have no reputation to lose to them, as many a poor Prisoner in <hi>Ludgate</hi> blesses his condition that he has no money to part with to the present Government. You have indeed forefaulted your Lawrel, and Historians place; that's all the advantage the times have taken on you, and you may well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the mercifulness of the Government, that it has not punished your <hi>Panther</hi> ribbaldry, and desertion, (for I will not call it Apostasie in a Poet) with a severer mortification. If you are weary of living without an employment (as I see very little probability you have of regaining that you have lost) I de e'en counsel you to go over to <hi>Spain,</hi> to get an office in the Inquisition; for, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> if you make no more conscience of killing men elsewhere, than you do on the <hi>Theatre,</hi> you are the fittest person in <hi>Europe</hi> for it. But prithee why so severe always upon the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Mr. <hi>Bays</hi>? What have they merited to pull down your indignation? I thought that ridiculing the men of that Character upon the Stage, was by this time a T<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

But you I find, still continue your old humour, which we are to date from the year of <hi>Hegira</hi> the loss of <hi>Eaton,</hi> or since Orders were refused you: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hangs out either Black or Green Colours, is presently your prize, and you would by your good will be as mortifying a vexation to the whole Tribe, as an unbeget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting year, a concatenation of Breifs, or a voracious Visiter: So that I am of opinion you had much better to have written in your Title page,

<pb facs="tcp:65199:6"/>
very hard with you: From your usage of the Churchmen they know how your fancy falls and rises, as exactly, as we know how the air is disposed, from the mounting and sinking of the Quicksilver in a Weatherglass. If you were to write a thousand new Plays, and to change your Religion as often, no question, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> but the last would still be the best; and therefore the Town will no more believe you for the future, when you commend your Plays, than a jealous Citizen when he commends his Wife. You say, you are growing old, and therefore assume to your self the right of talking; if we are to guess at your age only by that, why then, for any thing I know to the contrary, you may live as long as <hi>Me huselah,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bays;</hi> for ever since I have heard of your name, you have assumed the same liberty. To be plain with you, honest Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you acquired your self a reputation by your Poetry, and you have lost it by your Poetry; as a certain nameless Author about Town, who has exactly calculated the fall of Antichrist, got a name by a <hi>Somnium Navale,</hi> and parted with it, in a <hi>Somnium Theologicum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> if you please to give me leave, I'le make bold to examine two or three points, relating to your Religion, in this place, because the rules of Dialogue, you know, tye up a mans hands from making any continued Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>I shall begin then with your Infallibility, because if that were evidently proved, it would soon put an end to the Dispute; and here I cannot but observe what perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties your Doctors are in, to adjust this affair. They prove the infallibility of the Scripture, by the infallibility of the Church; and the infallibility of the Church, by the infallibility of the Scripture. After the same manner, as Sir <hi>Roger</hi> tells us in his above-mentioned History, the evidence of the late Popish Plot, were at a loss, whether to bring Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s murder to the Plot, or the Plot to the murder; but at last so managed the matter, as to make the murder prove the Plot, and the Plot the murder. But to be serious with you, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> where is this infallibility of your Church to be found at last? Why say you, and most of your Divines that live on this side the <hi>Alps,</hi> in Pope and Council; as for a Council, there's none sitting at present, or if there were, I hate as mortally to look after Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a Crowd, as to carry a Letter to Mr. such-a-one living in <hi>London,</hi> without naming the Street and Sign: Neither this, or that Bishop, and so on of the rest, make any pretensions to it; and tho no individual man in the Assembly claims any right to the Title, yet we must in complement to you, believe that the Body shares it among them; but for my part I can as little endure to hear of Accumulative Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, as of Accumulative Treason. 'Tis very true there's a promise made somewhere in Scripture, to preside over Two or Three that meet upon a Religious Score, but the condition of the Obligation is, <hi>Si in nomine meo convenerint,</hi> which I presume those people can never pretend to have fulfilled, that can decree Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith with a <hi>Non Obstante,</hi> to a Primitive Institution. The <hi>Italians,</hi> that we have reason to suppose, understand the question in hand better than any of their Neighbours, by having the Infallibility reside amonst them for so long a time, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly dislike this opinion of the <hi>Tramontani,</hi> and make a Council as unnecessary a thing to the Pope, as the Parliaments in <hi>France</hi> are to their All-Mighty Monarch. I am so far of their Opinion as to believe, that if such a thing as Infallibility is
<pb facs="tcp:65199:6"/>
any where to be found, it must be lodged in one single person, and therefore I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved for trying the experiment, to go and give him a visit at <hi>Rome;</hi> and here I see as little signs of Infallibillity, as in any Princes Court in <hi>Christendom,</hi> unless the errours and irreligion of the place, be an argument that he dwells amongst them, as we observe in <hi>England,</hi> that people generally talk most Treason near the King's Palace. Sometimes, indeed, I see a Grave Old Gentleman, who as they tell me, assumes this venerable title, carried in procession up and down the City, when he saves the poor ignorant people (as the old <hi>Romans</hi> did their Gladiators) by holding down a finger and a thumb; and this is, unless I am mistaken, <hi>Soloecismum manu facere,</hi> even according to the letter. Sometimes I see him, as on a <hi>Maunday Thursday,</hi> with abundance of solemnity, and Christian compassion, deliver three parts of the Globe into the hands of old Satan, by which tenure I suppose, he holds his Spiritual Iurisdiction, and his Mannor of the Vatican; as a certain family in <hi>Buckingham-shire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us, held their Lands of the King, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to furnish his Royal Bed with fresh straw, whenever he came in progress to that side of the Country. If I inquire into the History of Infallibility, they inform me here, that it was very ignorant, and very obstinate under the late Pontificate, and that the Man of Sin did not understand the Language of the Beast. If I trace it farther, I find that in the Reign of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth, or rather <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> it was seated (as the <hi>French</hi> call it) <hi>en quenouille,</hi> that in former times it has suffered an Interregnum for forty years, that it has fornicated, blasphem'd, offer'd Sacrifices to Idols, deny'd the Immortality of the Soul, committed Incest, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Magick, tolerated Sodomy, dispens'd with Murder, and occasion'd most of the Wars and Desolation, that have plagued this part of the World for the ten last Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies. To recount all the Impieties that his story stands charged with, were as end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a piece of trouble, as to reckon up all the Treasons and Rebellions since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; and I believe, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you'll find it as difficult a matter, in the end, to reconcile what has been mentioned to the Infallible Character he sustains, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile his two incompatible Titles, <hi>Rex Regum,</hi> and <hi>Servus Servorum,</hi> to one another. One that has either read or heard of these passages, wou'd be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that as the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion is only a continuation of Paganism, so that <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>'s History is but the second part to <hi>Suetonius</hi>'s Lives of the Caesars; so I find, I must e'en quit my Lodgings, and leave <hi>Roma la Santa,</hi> if I have a design to see Infallibility.
<q>
                  <l>Migrandum est mihi longius, vel illi.</l>
               </q>
When I have removed out of the City, I may, perhaps, be so happy as to meet the long expected Object; for as the same Poet observes,
<q>
                  <l>Vicinus Novio, vel inquilinus</l>
                  <l>Sit, quisquis Novium videre non vult.</l>
               </q>
The <hi>English</hi> of which, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> is this: He that has a mind never to trouble his Eye-sight with Infallibillity, must take himself a House in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the nearer the Vatican, or St. <hi>Peters,</hi> so much the better. Two Texts in the Bible (a Book which he very scurvily requited afterwards) <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> and <hi>Pasce Oves meas,</hi> first acquired him this Reputation, in a dull, barbarous unthinking Age, and that soon brought along with it the Temporal Power which he now possesses; but it's no
<pb facs="tcp:65199:7"/>
easie matter to determine, whether he most scandalously behaves himself on his Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or Spiritual Administration, for he lets his Subjects, amidst all their plenty, starve in the most fruitful Country in the World, and suffers them too, for all his pretences to an Unerring Spirit, to be over-run with the grossest Ignorance and Superstition. If a <hi>Socrates,</hi> or a <hi>Plato,</hi> or a Race of honest Heathens of the same stamp had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided in the Chair, I question whether the Christian Religion had received so much injury as it did, from the conduct of the Popes, unless they had expressed as great a passi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n for the Welfare of the Church, as they have done all along for the raising of their Nephews; and then, perhaps, most of th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se shameful miscarriages had been prevented. I can't tell, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> whether he's sensible of the kindness, but I am sure your Infallibility is obliged for that little Christianity and Learning which is remaining in his Territories, to the Reformation, or <hi>Luther</hi>'s defection (as you call it) as a Learned Traveller has observed that the preservation of <hi>Spain,</hi> in this Age, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely owing to the happy revolt, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made from it, in the last.

To conclude then this troublesome tedious discourse about your pious Pastor's Infallibility, if ever, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you alarm me with it any more, I must return you the very same an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that a certain Gentleman gave Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> about his Narrative, and tell you plainly, I believe just as much, and not a syllable more, than he believes of it himself.</p>
            <p>I come now, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to consider in the next place, the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of your Church, which, all of your Pamphleteers take for granted, belongs to you, and in commendation of which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they employ all their little stock of Eloquence, when the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the Reformation has somewhat discompos'd them. When I first read <hi>Caranza,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Summa Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliorum.</hi>
               </note> and some others of your Authors of the same strain, I was afraid they'd have carried their Religion an Age or two above the Incarnation, as well as their predecessors in Chronology, the old <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Priests, made themselves some thousands years older than the Creation. They tell us, that <hi>Anacletus,</hi> the third Pope after St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Decreed, That all difficult questions should receive their final determination from the Apostolic Chair. That <hi>Alexander,</hi> his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate successor, recommended Holy Water to the Church. That <hi>Anicetus</hi> commanded the Priests to shave their Heads in fashion of a circle, for a certain grave reason, which will serve them for changing their Shirts once a Week, as well. That Pope <hi>Fabian</hi> pass'd an Order, that Bishops should carefully observe to renew the Chrism once a year in their Churches. I need not give my self the trouble to pursue these puny Historians any farther, because these instances, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> may serve to give you a taste of the rest; only from this blind account of the Primitive times, a man would be tempted to think, that for the three first Centuries, after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Christianity in <hi>Rome,</hi> they had no such thing as a Distinction of time; as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, that for a hundred and twenty years, <hi>ab Urbe Condita,</hi> they had no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of hours. Now, supposing all that I have mentioned out of the Decretal were true (as I am sure 'tis every syllable an Imposture) I can only say this, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65199:7"/>
that the Mystery of Iniquity began to operate very early amongst you, and that your Church might with a great deal of justice, use the famous <hi>Quartilla</hi>'s saying in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius, Junonem iratam habeam, si me unquam meminero fuisse Virginem.</hi> But for your comfort and satisfaction, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> we are able to prove that she was not debauch'd so soon as you pretend, but continued in her state of Maiden-hood a good considerable time after, tho we expect you'll no more thank us for such a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, than a she-Cut-purse at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> that hopes to save a hanging by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a big belly, wou'd thank a Iury of Midwives for bringing her in not with Child. Alas! St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successors in those days, had other business on their hands than to amuse their Flock with such idle impertinencies, and you might as soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me, that a man of tolerable sense, would send to consult with his Peruke-maker about the newest fashion, just an hour before his Execution, as that your Bishops wou'd entertain their people in these trifles, these No-parts of Christianity, when they were to prepare them for Persecution and Martyrdom. No, no, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> your <hi>Roman</hi> Religion was no more perfected in one day, than the City was built in one day, 'twas the labour of several Ages to bring it to its present splendor and condition; and part of it, like our St. <hi>Pauls</hi> here in the City, was finished and adorned, before so much as the foundation of the other end was laid. And thus you know, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> in the business of Tragedy and Comedy, <hi>Thespis</hi> began it in a Cart, <hi>AEschylus</hi> not long after introduced it upon the Stage, and in succeeding Ages, when the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was wholly employed in cultivating the Theatre, it received the additional beauty of Chorus's, Scenes, Machines, and other decorations. After all, if your Party cannot be perswaded to drop their pretensions to Antiquity, but they must needs continue their claim still, I'd e'en advise them to make the most of the plea as they can; they may give out that those two noble Philosophers, I mean <hi>Zeno,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd local motion, and <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that held Snow to be black, were Members of your Church, and stiff asserters of Transubstantiation: Their principles, all the world knows, have nothing in them that contradicts a Sense-renouncing Doctrine, and, I am sure, they may be urged upon us, with greater show of probability than either a St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> or a St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have I cannot tell how, run my self into a longer Preface, by far, than I at first designed; whether it is your example, Mr <hi>Bays,</hi> that has betrayed me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this extravagance, or whether my matter flowed upon me so abundantly, that it was impossible to check the tide, I know not; but I shall make bold to tell you in your own words, that when I address my self to you in a discourse of this nature again, <hi>whatever fault I commit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Preface to</hi> Don Sebastian.</note> 
               <hi>you may rest assured, it shall not be that of too much length.</hi> I have only a word or two to say to the Devotion, and Canonization of your Church, and then I have done. A man has all the reason in the world to entertain but ordinary thoughts of your way of worship when he finds <hi>à la veue,</hi> that your Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was altogether fitted to the Ceremonies, and not the Ceremonies to the Devotion. Thus for instance, a show of Candles made a pretty figure in the Church, they helped to set off the Pictures, and the rich habit of the Priests, and for that reason principally they were introduced: But after they had continued some years in the Church, it was thought expedient to assign a better reason for them, so some body stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb facs="tcp:65199:8"/>
upon <hi>Ego sum Lux Mundi,</hi> and from that time Candles dated themselves <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> Thus likewise the Elevation of the Host was set up, not for any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion or necessity, for every body knows that Transubstantiation was a hundred years old before it was decreed; but Holy Church was resolved to bring in that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, whether a pretence cou'd be offer'd for it or no: At last, a Monk proved it out of <hi>Psal. 72. v. 16.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eckius de Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi> Missel p. <hi>42.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>There shall be a handful of Corn in the Earth upon the top of the Mountain.</hi> A man sees nothing like Elevation in our <hi>English</hi> Version, but for your comfort, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> the word <hi>Elevabitur</hi> is to be found in the <hi>Latin</hi> Translation, and then the handful of Corn was immediately turned into a Wafer, and the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was to pass current for the Priests Head. Whether or no these reasons were thought of, at the same moment as these Ceremonies commenc'd in the Church, or afterwards, as I imagine they were, is no great matter; for any one may see from the absurdity of them, that the reason was rather made for the Ceremony, than the Ceremony for the reason; so that I cannot but apply an ingenious passage in <hi>Monsieur Vaugelas,</hi> with a little alteration of the words, upon this occasion. <hi>Ce'st faire comme à la feste des Saturnales, ou les Serviteurs estoient servis par leur maistres, la devotion estant comme la maistresse, &amp; les Ceremonies comme les Serviteurs.</hi> And the truth on't is, nothing else cou'd be expected, when the Monks were the only Masters of the Ecclesiastick Ceremonies, and brought in their adulterated Ore to the Papal Mint, to receive there a Canonical Stamp. They li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ease, and fed high, and mistook every Hypocondriac fit for a Revelation; they had too much ignorance and stupidity to assimilate (as the Physicians term it) their Devotion, and therefore it broke out into Watchings, Dreams, Silences, Hours, Altars, Images, Murmurings, Rosaries, Unctions, Ashes, Palms, Beads, Crosses, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Holy Water, and such Scorbutick humours. In the Addresses which you pay to the Saints (which is indeed the principal Devotion of your Church) a man would find himself extreamly mistaken, if he expects to meet with any thing that is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and solid: For admitting that that kind of Worship were allowable, yet the choice that you make of your Saints for some little resemblance or jingling of his name, is so very ridiculous, that it can admit of no defence. And this has been curiously observed by <hi>Monsieur Menage,</hi> the <hi>Hesychius</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who upon the word <hi>Acariastre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Les Origines de la Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue Francoise,</hi> p. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> has remark'd that for the Conformity it bears to the name of <hi>Acarius,</hi> therefore they made their recourse to that Saint for the cure of this Malady. <hi>Ainsi on est</hi> (says he) <hi>s'est addressé à Saint Mathurin pour les fous, qu 'on appelle en Italien</hi> Matti; <hi>à Saint Eutrope pour les hydropiques; à Saint Auertin pour les Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigineux, qu'on appelloit autrefois Auertineux; à Saint Mammard pour les maux de Mammelles; à Saint Main pour les rongnes des mains; à Saint Genou pour la goutte; à Saint Aignan pour la taigne; à St. Clair pour le mal des yeux; à St. Ouen pour la surdité; a Saint Fenin, qui est comme les paysans de Normandie appellent Saint Felix, pour ceuz qui sont tombez en chartre, ils appellent fenez; à Saint Atourny, c'est Saint Saturnin, pour ceux a qui la teste tourne. Par cette mesme raison on a eu recours pour les choses égarées, qu'on appelle</hi> épaves, <hi>a Saint Antoine de Padoue.</hi> I need
<pb facs="tcp:65199:8"/>
not Translate this passage into English, because most of the jests will be lost in the Translation, but for the satisfaction of the English Reader, he's to imagin that the Saint is only chosen for the conformity of the name, as if our Sales-men here in the City should choose St. <hi>Francis de Sales</hi> for their protector, and the Merchant-Adventurers should pitch upon St. <hi>Bonaventure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I am discoursing of the Saints, I have oftentimes admired that since you leave most of your Cities under their protection, you never paid that complement to them, which the Old <hi>Romans</hi> used to pay to their Tutelar Gods; I mean, that when you sit down before the siege of any place, you have not the good breeding to invite the Saint, to whose care the Town is committed, to a better station, and beg his pardon for disturbing him in his quarters. I wonder (I say) Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that such a thing was never practised, both because there's a great appearance of civility in it, and because, as it has happened, the whole Form transcribed out of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Pontifical, is still to be found in <hi>Macrobius;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Saturn. l. 3. c: 9.</hi>
               </note> and you know a <hi>Pagan</hi> Ceremony, if your Infallibility pleases, is as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily changed into a Christian Rite, as <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s <hi>Pantheon</hi> was turned from a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all the Gods, into a Church of all the Saints.</p>
            <p>And this has led me to consider the merits of your Canonization, which needs no formal conviction, being one of the absurdest impostures, that the world ever knew. 'Tis an unaccountable thing how most of your Saints got into Heaven, and, to make them amends, when they are there, they are as unaccountably worshipped. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if preferring a person to the Almanack, signified only this, That on St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic</hi>'s day it would be convenient to let Blood, and cut Corns; on St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s day to geld Hogs, or drench Horses; on St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s day to raise Melons, and sow Cucumbers; that St. <hi>Xavier</hi> should preside over such a Fair, or such a Market, it were no very great matter; we should never grudge them so small a courtesie; but when we see a Divine Adoration entailed upon them, immediately after their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment to the Calendar, we are naturally led to enquire, whether they deserved so great an honour, and whether the person that advanced them to it, had the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make the promotion. Some of them I am sure, as St. <hi>Dominic</hi> for instance, were sad gloomy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wretches here upon earth; and unless the place has mightily alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for the better, a man of sense would have very little temptation upon him to wish himself in the company. After all, I am afraid they have no more right to the place they possess, than the Pope had to give it, for I never read that St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> left the power of making Gods <hi>en appanage,</hi> or by way of Portion to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor. As he is Pope, he has no more title to Canonize, than my Lord Mayor has to confer the honour of Knighthood; and therefore, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I would advise you for the sake of your Brother Poets, to take the matter into your own hands, for ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, I am sure, the Poets only pretended to bestow such favours, and what may serve to bring them into play again, they can Canonize a great deal cheaper than the Pope. <hi>Horace,</hi> you know, is very positive to the point, <hi>Musa vetat mori, Coelo Musa beat,</hi> part of which Ode I will translate, and so take my leave of you.

               <p>WELL Gentlemen, I find you are punctual to the Assignation, and now if you please, we'll fall to the business in hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more Preface, or Ceremony. You know I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make you acquainted in the first place with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which obliged me to leave the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and afterwards to give you the reasons why I setled in the <hi>Romish</hi> Communion. This method I design to follow, because it will give us a full view of all the Controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Points between both Parties; but I must make bold to ask you one Civil Question or two, before-hand, since it is so material to our present affair; and that is, whether you have seen a famous Poem of mine, called <hi>The Hind and Panther?</hi>

               <p>Seen it, Mr. <hi>Bays!</hi> Why, I can stir no where but it pursues me; it haunts me worse than a Pewter-Button'd-Serjeant does a decayed Cit: Sometimes I meet it in a Band-Box when my Landress brings home my Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, sometimes whether I will or no, it lights my Pipe in a Coffee-House; sometimes it surprizes me in a Trunk-makers Shop, and sometimes it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshes my memory for me on the backside of a <hi>Chancery-Lane</hi> Parcel —For your Comfort Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I have not only seen it as you may perceive, but have read it too, and can quote it as freely upon occasion, as a frugal Tradesman can quote that Noble Treatise, called <hi>The Worth of a Penny,</hi> to his Extravagant Prentice that revels in Cock<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then take it from me, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> you have read the most Exalted, the most Sublime Piece of Poetry, that was ever extant in the Universe. It contains, without vanity I may say it, all the Arguments that can be proposed in behalf of the Unerring Guide the <hi>Churches Infallibility, Transubstantiation, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and the like: So that if this were not an age wherein people were resolved never to trust their Faith out of the company of their Reason, I should not question to reduce half the Kingdom in due time, only by the Sweetness and Majesty of my Verse. But pray, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> do me the favour to tell me what the sinful world has said to this Noble Off-spring of mine.</p>

               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Troth Mr <hi>Bays</hi> the sinful world, as you call it, is very much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about the point, and who can help it? Some persons allow it as little quarter as the <hi>Inquisition</hi> does a Tract of <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divinity; and others again

speak as favourably of the Author, as the Dissenters do of the late Immortal Pacqueteer. Some say you chose a Religion, tho it were none of the best, only to confront the World that you had one, like the Young Prince in the <hi>Rehearsal,</hi> who was glad to own the Fisherman for his Father, rather than lye under the scandal of having none at all. Some commend your policy for treating your subject in Rime, because, as they pretend, the Polemic is no more obliged to answer for the Paralogisms of the Poet, than the New-made Lord is concerned to pay the debts of the private Gentleman. Lastly, the more Censorious sort question the sincerity of your Conversion, and are apt to believe, that although you have drawn your Pen in the Churches quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, you'd scarce be allow'd the humble favour to stand Godfather for a Bell, and promise in the Bells name, that it shall scatter Tempests, disperse Evil Spirits, and disarm Thunder and Lightning; for like malicious persons as they are, they observe that you have made the <hi>Panther</hi> in that noble Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sode of the <hi>Swallow,</hi> tell a better and more pertinent story, than even your Catholic <hi>Hind.</hi> In fine, since you'l have all out together, they say if your own Party ever comes to tell Noses, that they must be forced to serve you, and the rest of the New Converts, as the Turkish Janizaries do their other Foot-Battalia's, place you in the Front, and encompass you round, because you have got such a damnable trick of running away from your Colours, that you are not to be trusted in the Rear.</p>

               <p>Faith little <hi>Bays,</hi> to deal freely with you, I have the same indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thoughts of the Poetry as I have of the Subject, and cou'd never have imagin'd, but for the clear conviction you have given me in the matter, that the <hi>Hind</hi> had obliged her Converts to part with their Wit, as well as their Reason. I am afraid she has served your Muse, as they serve Jesuits in <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and so disabled her, that you'l scarce be able to dribble so much as one single Madrigal for any of your New Friends in the Almanac. Besides, to pursue my quarrel a little farther, I am angry that a <hi>Dramatist</hi> should either trouble himself or others with matters of Controversie. For tho I confess it seems somewhat generous in a Poet, to defend that Religion which was first introduced by Poets, or Men poetically given, yet still the Character is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural: Something must of necessity drop from him, that is not suitable to the gravity of his Undertaking, and for all his Conduct, his Muse and his Devotion will no more keep together, than the Young Lady, and the Pious Grandmother at a <hi>Smithfield</hi> Show. You may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> how the famed <note n="*" place="margin">Mrs. <hi>Behns Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi> Printed by <hi>Ios. Hindmarsh.</hi>

                  <hi>Astrea,</hi> once in her Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, unluckily lighted upon such a Sacred Subject, and in a strange fit of Piety, must needs attempt a Paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer. But alas poor Gentlewoman! She had scarce travell'd half way, when <hi>Cupid</hi> served her as the Cut-Purse did the Old Justice in <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew</hi>-Fair, tickled her with a Straw in her Ear, and then she could not budge one foot further, till she had humbly requested her Maker to grant her a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Act of Toleration for a little Harmless Love, otherwise called Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—Thus you see, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that in my Opinion, a Poet is none of the

fittest persons in the World to write a System of Divinity, or to deal in Controversie.</p>

               <p>For your comfort, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I am not of my friends opinion here, but think you have very honestly discharged the duty of a Poet, which obliges him to preserve and maintain his Character still to the last. You know what our great Master <hi>Horace</hi> says to this point, <hi>Servetur ad imum qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ab incepto processerit</hi>; and I am sure you have kept close to the Text.

But this is not all, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you had it seems a design in your old age to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice your reputation, and how cou'd you do it more honestly than the same way you got it, that is, in Rhime; or sacrifice it in better company, than when you parted with your Senses, Reason, and Conscience all together?</p>

Just as you know Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> the <hi>Venio sicut Fur</hi> is a very pat and agreeable thought on the Dial at <hi>Newgate,</hi> but wou'd lose very much of its poignancy, if it were removed to the Pillar in <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi>

               <p>Not I by my troth Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> for I believe it's less difficult by far to assign the true motive of your going over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to assign any good Reason for your leaving the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Since you'l needs put your friends to the trouble of guessing for you, considering you are a Poet and all that, I am apt to believe you'l make your first attacque upon our Translation of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> because the <hi>Panther</hi> never set you on work to rectifie 'em. As I knew a trusty Glasier the last Summer, who because he was not employ'd to mend the Church-windows, took pet, and went to a meeting.</p>

               <p>Upon Honour Mr. <hi>Eugenius</hi> that was not the case, tho since you have refreshed my memory as to this point, I must freely own before you both, that I was always extreamly scandalized at your allowing of <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternholds</hi> Poetry to be Sung in your Churches.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>God so Mr. <hi>Bays!</hi> Was your Brother <hi>Hopkins</hi> so great an Eye-sore to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Not so great an Eye-sore by the half, as he has been an Ear-sore to me, for I thank my Stars Mr. <hi>Crites</hi> I never mortify'd my self with reading a Syllable of him in my Life time. As the peevish old huncks in the <hi>silent Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> hir'd him a House as far from the rattling of Coaches as he cou'd meet with, so I have done the same in relation to a Church, and you might as soon wheedle <hi>Ben Iohnson</hi>'s <hi>Morose</hi> if he were alive again into the Wits Coffee-House, as perswade me now into any of your Churches. You cannot imagine how strangely I have found my self discomposed, when I have passed by any of those places where the Congregation has been bellowing out the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65199:12"/>
so that of late years I run away as naturally from that unsanctified thing called a Clark of Parish, as an <hi>Irishman</hi> from a her'd of Prentices, or the rest of my own Profession from a Lampooned Courtier, or a bilked Bookseller. <hi>En verite</hi> Mr. <hi>Crites</hi> if I have the wind of him I can smell his <hi>ekes</hi> and <hi>ayes</hi> and his other expletives about him half the length of <hi>Cheapside.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>And that's much the same distance (as I take it) that they say Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> cou'd smell out a Heretic.

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>The truth on't is Gentlemen my talent lyes a little that way; but as I was saying before, there's a certain business in the Churches about Town, which I extreamly fancy, and that is, the setting up Organs to drown the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable harshness of the noise; which peice of policy I suppose they have borrowed from the old <hi>Israelites,</hi> who were use to beat Kettle Drums all the while they Sacrificed their Children to <hi>Molok,</hi> in order to stifle their cryes.</p>

               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Faith little <hi>Bays</hi> I cou'd scarce have believed you had the Heart to treat any of your own Tribe with so much severity. If you allow no other quarter to your Brother-trespassers in Rime, what mercy can a trader in prose expect from your hands. But prithee Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> why did you never own this grievance in public, that the state might have found some way or other to redress it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Tho I have frequently done it in a Coffee-House as here before you Gentlemen, yet I was always unwilling to charge the <hi>Panther</hi> with these Translators in Print: Because, do you mind me Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> it wou'd look a little ill and all that, for a Poet to do such a thing: People wou'd be apt to think he did it for his own interest, and to get himself employ'd by the next Convocation. Just so, as Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, the Apostles never recommended the worshipping of Saints in their Writings; but left it in trusty hands to be communicated four or five Ages after, for fear the Heathens might take occasion to reproach these self-denying Gentlemen for establishing their own adoration. I know, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> a person of your Judgment can never relish such insipid stuff as we have been discoursing of; pray tell me then what possible defence can be made for your Church, or how it can be stiled pure and primitive, which is so corrupt in her Poetry, and allows such a vile translation of the Psalms in her publick Devotions. She has longed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Ash-Wednesday</hi> any time this hundred years to have the primitive discipline of Pennance restored, and may long as many years, for all I know to the contrary, to have her Poetry reformed.</p>

               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>You have chose a very ill person, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to satisfie your Conscience in this point, for I believe any of your new Friends the Dissenters can better inform you how these aforesaid Psalms stole into the Church than my self. Perhaps they were allow'd for the good of the Lungs of the body politic, or else to reduce some of our people who had been used <hi>a ouvrir la bouche</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and cou'd not subsist without it here in <hi>England</hi>; the Magistrates at that time
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65199:12"/>
were willing to connive at 'em, as some of your former Popes complyed with Images, Incense, Holy-Water, Tonsure, and other Ceremonies of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> extraction, to bring over the Heathens with greater ease into the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an communion. But after all, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> rather than this matter shall hinder any Proselytes from coming to the Panthers Church we'll freely part with 'em.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Part with 'em, Mr. <hi>Crites</hi>? That's a good jest I'gad. Your people I am sure will sooner part with their <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> than lose an inch of their birth-right in <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold.</hi> Part with 'em, Mr. <hi>Crites</hi>? Why you shall as soon perswade me that the <hi>Spanish</hi> King will part with his Whiskers, dry 'em to powder, and then send 'em in his Royal Snuff-Box for a present to the <hi>West-India</hi> Company at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> as that the good people of <hi>England</hi> will ever consent to part with the Psalms.</p>

               <p>Nay have a care what you do, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> for if you pursue this Matter too far, you'l ee'n oblige me against my inclination to consider the Poetry of your own Church, and unless I am mightily mistaken, a man that has any leisure or appetite to mortifie himself that way, may find as Incorrect Language, as Unwarrantable Expressions, and as barbarous a Spirit in your Hymns and Services, as ever the never-to-be-forgotten <hi>Wisdom</hi> was guilty of; with this only difference, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that whereas our old fashioned, Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were honestly content to palm a few ancient words upon us, and no more, the Authors of your Offices have made bold to advance a step or two beyond 'em, even into the Territories of Blasphemy. What think you Sir of the <hi>Iure Matris Impera Filio?</hi> and all those admirable Complements to St. <hi>Ioseph,</hi> St. <hi>Ioachim,</hi> St. <hi>Wilgefortis,</hi> the three Kings of <hi>Colen,</hi> the eleven thousand <hi>Ursulins,</hi> &amp;c. which I would now offer to your pious consideration, but that a Friend of yours designs to publish 'em in a Set Treatise, which intends to visit the Press very speedily. Or Lastly, tell me whether <hi>Tom. Sternhold,</hi> or any of his Fellows ever Burlesqued the <hi>Psalter</hi> and the <hi>Te Deum</hi> with that freedom as a Cardinal of your own Church, and one of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses of the <hi>Roman</hi> Almanac, I mean St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> has done? When you have reflected upon all this, and are able to justifie it, we'll give you free leave to make what sport you please with any of the Above-mentioned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, but till that time we desire you to be civil to 'em.

The finest Metaphor certainly this, as ever enter'd into any Poets <hi>Pia Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> I have abundance more of such witty hints up and down in my Poem, which I cou'd recount to you, but these may suffice at present, only for your diversion I'le acquaint you with a little conversation, which I lately had on this subject at a place of publick meeting — I cou'd with some patience (said I) hear an <hi>Italian</hi> or a <hi>Spaniard</hi> condemn the Church, for enjoyning a Chastity which is hardly practicable under the influences of a warmer Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; but here in <hi>England</hi> where a Feeble Sun, a Phlegmatick Air, and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar stiffness that accompanies our tempers, do all contribute to make the performance more easie: Here (I say) where little or nothing of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Heroe is required to disarm a few sickly inclinations, no excuse is to be admitted; — But before I proceed any farther in this Argument, pray Gentlemen give me your Opinion of it, for methinks now it was a pretty sort of a thought to make the Sun, Moon and Stars throw the blame from themselves, and lay it all upon the poor Clergymen.</p>

               <p>Faith, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> this is as refined a piece of Policy, as I ever heard of in my life.</p>

               <p>You say true, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> 'tis <hi>Machiavel</hi> all over, for you may swear, a man in such a case will use the same discretion in choosing his Objections, as they say <hi>Robin Hood</hi> used in choosing his men, such as he can easily Cuff and Master when he pleases: And now, because you are both my singular good Friends, I'le whisper to you who it is, that first introduced this Policy into a Conference — 'Tis a certain Old Gentleman of the <hi>Savoy</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that has a very ill hand at Spelling <hi>English,</hi> and his Christen'd Name is the same with a certain Saints, who has had for several years a great influence upon <hi>Advent-Sunday.</hi>

               <p>Thank you for this secret, Mr: <hi>Bays,</hi> I know the Gentleman as well as if you had named him outright, 'tis the very same man that said Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the Third was so hard a name to remember; but now I think on't, you had always a very good hand at penning a Whisper.</p>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Sir (continued I) if, as you alledge, it is downright madness, and all that, to restrain our Appetites by a Vow, which we are not capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming without a supernatural assistance; I desire to know whether the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment be general, and if not, why it should be made criminal in one case, and not in another. Suppose a man of a long continuance in debauchery should at last reform, and to prevent the return of his irregularities, should oblige himself by a solemn vow to a stricter conduct for the time to come, no one, I believe, wou'd blame his resolutions, or charge him, with the guilt of a virtual perjury; and yet let me tell you, Gentlemen, Temperance is no more a Virtue of our own manufacture than Chastity, nay, perhaps, as times go, much the severer confinement of the two, as having more avenues to guard, and more manly temptations to resist. To secure one's chastity little more is necessary than to leave off a correspondence with the other Sex, which to a wise man is no greater a punishment, than it would be to a Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Parson to be forbid seeing the <hi>Cheats</hi> and the <hi>Committee,</hi> or for my Lord Mayor and Aldermen to be interdicted the sight of the <hi>London</hi> Cuckolds. If you never see the Enemy, you lye under no danger of being beaten from your post, and a farther conversation will discover so many little vanities and impertinencies, as will serve to improve the disgust, and confirm the former resolution But then the other virtue is not to be maintained at so cheap a rate, to preserve it, you must suspect your nearest acquaintance, nay your very self, you must guard it from the attacques of friends as well as of the visits of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; you must lose a thousand happy moments that men of wit enjoy when they sacrifice it to their mirth and pleasure. In fine, like a Frontier Kingdom, it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65199:14"/>
ought to be very well mann'd and garrison'd, or else 'tis every minute in danger of being invaded, and taken.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Very Rhetorically Harangu'd upon my word, Mr. <hi>Bays.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Besides I would willingly be informed, how it comes possible for people to pass the most sanguine, and rebellious part of their lives (as they generally do at the Universities) without a comfortable importance to relieve their necessities, and yet not be able to master a few weak decaying inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; can we bear the toyl of the day when the Sun scorches, and the heats are unruly, and shall we complain of the coolness of the Evening, and call for Umbrella's at Midnight? Can we withstand the Enemy when his assaults are vigorous, and when he has all the advantages imaginable over us; and shall we make a tame dishonourable submission to him, when his ammunition is spent, and he's just upon the point of crying quarter? But the mystérie is easie enough to be unfolded, for Celibacy is not so miserable a state as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are apt to imagine; a man may subsist many a fair day without a Spouse to support him, till the Living is provided, and then 'tis as impossible for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative thing to be without one, as without his <hi>German</hi> system, and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> Concordance; then, and only then, his former stock of Grace leaves him in the lurch, and abandons him to a dismal multitude of temptations, from which it seems a warm Bedfellow can only secure him. However to do him justice, 'tis not so much the mans own inclination to marry, as his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Patron's Royal will and pleasure it should be so, who awakens his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence to the tune of <hi>either take this bad Halfcrown Sir, for all it's clipt within the brim, and so forth, or else not a word of the fifty pieces.</hi> In fine, after the Reformation-manner of distributing Preferments, the Spouse and the Parsonage go together just like Virtue and Reward, or in Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s language, Knighthood and the Service of Ladies. After this I proceeded to shew the many inconveniences of Matrimony in a Spiritual Life; that if the Levite chanced to have his Table overstocked with Olive-branches (which was the case of most of 'em) it wou'd oblige him to too servile a dependance upon the Srate, that he must sacrifice the dignity of his character to get bread for his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, put on the Grazier to bolster up the Vicar, as in country Villages you know, 'tis an usual thing to tack the sorry Tradesman to the Ale-draper; that if his <hi>Abigail</hi> chanced to be deformed, it would encline him to preach of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but Hell and Reprobation; but if she was handsome, it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tincture all his Sermons, more or less with a touch of <hi>Mahumetanism,</hi> and so make him a fitter Paraphrast for the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> than the <hi>New-Testament.</hi> And then I concluded all with a very merry piece of drollery, I vow to gad, upon a <hi>West</hi>-country Parson, who having the good fortune to light upon a goodly Heritage, and a more goodly Spouse, cou'd not be prevailed upon for Love nor Mony, (nay tho 'twas a Funeral Sermon 'twas all a case) to take a Text any where in the Bible but out of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> till two years at least were passed over his head, by which time his Conjugal Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection were somewhat abated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65199:14"/>Thus Gentlemen I have acquainted you with that discourse, which I made in the place above-mentioned upon the occasion of Celibacy, 'tis the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of what Father <hi>Cressy,</hi> and a more modern Author have advanced for the Cause, and unless I am extreamly mistaken, it has suffered nothing under my management.</p>

               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Faith, Little <hi>Bays,</hi> you have been very severe upon the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> for their Marrying, but I don't wonder at it, for to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you never gave Matrimony a good word in your Life, but thought it too barbarous and heathenish a confinement, even for the Laity. Priest-craft was one of the civilest Nicknames you ever gave it, tho between Friends Celibacy deserves that title much better: But so familiar a thing is it for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets to rail at Marriage, that methinks they ought as much to be forgiven for it, as a Country Curate for railing at a healthful season, or a City Merchant at the <hi>French</hi> Privateers.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>As my Friend very well observes, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you Poets ought in conscience to be excused for being witty now and then upon those that are got into the <hi>Oval</hi> of Matrimony: for either you are plagued with an odd sort of <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> creatures at home (which they say is your own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> as well as Mr. <hi>Sh-dw-lls</hi>) and then you have all the reason in the World to vent your indignation upon that settlement called a Wife: Or else, you are humbly content to pick a little natural Philosophy out of some <hi>Fleet-street</hi> Strowler, that won't consent under the last Half-Crown to qualifie you for writing a luscious Love-Scene, and taking a dose of <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Pills. Let the case be what it will, the unconscionable Wife, or the more unconscionable Whore will infallibly excuse you, and the rest of your Brethren the Poets for passing a little unmannerly language upon Matrimony. However Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> I dare lay one single wager with you, that altho you are of a Church, where Marriage passes muster for a Sacrament conferring Grace, that you are not of that opinion: But that as <hi>Aristotle</hi> is deservedly blamed for setting up ten predicaments when two might have served the turn; so likewise that Holy Church was very much in the wrong for quartering seven Sacraments upon the Gospel, when the number might have been reduced to a less, and Matrimony might very well be reckon'd as a melancholly appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix to the Sacrament of Pennance.</p>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Mr. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> don't fancy that I entertain any such loose extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant opinions as those are, I'm no such prosane person, not I, l'gad.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Before we examine this matter any farther, I must humbly request one favour of you Mr. <hi>Bays.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart Sir, command me in what you please.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Why you know, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> it has been very usual of late, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, when they have a mind to batter and demolish any pretended grievance, to lay aside the merits of the cause, and judge the equity of it by its original.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Very right Sir, for thus you know we banter your Reformation with a story or two of <hi>Ann Bolein,</hi> and King <hi>Harry</hi>'s Cod-piece; and thus my Brother <hi>Bays</hi> of everlasting memory, when he took the Test into his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65199:15"/>
consideration, thought he effectually ridicul'd it, by tracing it to its Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in <hi>Aldersgate-street,</hi> and laying it at the door of that Man-Midwife of the Popish Plot, the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> — But pray Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> why did you give your self the trouble to beg so small a favour as this, when you might have commanded it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Because I am not so very well perswaded of the honesty of such a proceeding; but if it be so very fair and lawful, as you pretend, I wou'd advise you then, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> when you next summon a National Synod of our Rivers, to set the <hi>Severn</hi> in the Speakers Chair, and not the <hi>Thames</hi>; for he by vertue of his original, as springing our of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Mountains, ought certainly to have the priviledge of sitting above the <hi>Thames,</hi> that has the misfortune to be born in a Valley — But now to the first institutor of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy.</p>
               <p>I am as loth, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to show my little reading out of Fathers and Councils, as a City Alderman is of showing his Young Wife at the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house or at the <hi>Mall</hi>; not that I am afraid of being plundered of what I have, but methinks convincing a Poet out of Fathers and Councils looks as awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly as if a man should think to quicken a lazy Water-man with a <hi>Greek</hi> Verse or two out of <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Argonautics; but because we cannot possibly avoid it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we'll be unmannerly that way as seldom as we can.</p>
               <p>The first Pope then that ever recommended it with any effectual vigour to the World, was that <hi>Euroelydon</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, alias called <hi>Hildebrand</hi>; and indeed he deserves to go under more Names than one, that had a greater share of wickedness in his temper, than one wou'd have thought any one single mans nature had been capable of. But because it is a good secure way to rail with Insallibility on ones side, as a late wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman has expressed himself, let us hear his character from the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Council of <hi>Brixia</hi>; He was then in the judgment of that numerous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, a superstitious observer of Dreams and Prodigies, a Magician, a Negromancer, a Monster given up to all the excesses of Pride and Cruelty, and finally one (for the best jest he was ever guilty of is still behind) one that by the assistance of the Devil, had aspir'd to the Apostolical Chair.</p>
               <p>I had often heard, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Factions had a great influence in the Conclave, and pretended now and then as an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity served to a disposal <hi>della Spirito Santo,</hi> but never imagined that the old Gentleman in black had any vote amongst the Gentlemen of the Purple, till this lucky passage convinc'd me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my word, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> I won't stay a minute longer with you, if you make any more such reflections upon the Sacred election —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>This was likewise the same person, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that so solemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered that unfortunate Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and all the Bishops that received investiture from him, into the hands of the Devil, for no other reason in the World but only justifying the Imperial Prerogative against the Papal usurpations; and lastly, to compleat his character, he that branded the Married Clergy by the scandalous name of <hi>Nicolaitans.</hi> What were the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65199:15"/>
blessed effects of that forced Chastity, which was so vigorously enjoyn'd under this Pontificate, a man may easily learn out of <hi>Aventinus, Sigebertus,</hi> and the other Historians of that barbarous age, and they they were as followeth: The Bishops were continually quarrelling with the Priests, the Priests (not to be behind hand with 'em) were continually reproaching the Bishops, and the Laics very devoutly fell foul upon both. They trod the Sacrament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot that had been consecrated by the married Priests, they burnt their Tithes, they sanctified the Altars which had been profaned by 'em, with Holy Water. Above all, there sprung up a goodly harvest of Fornication, Incest, Murder, and Adultery; and yet all this while, unless his Infallibility was notoriously belyed, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> kept a more than ordinary correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with his dearly beloved <hi>Mathildis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are some other remarkable frolics to be found in the life of this Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical <hi>Leviathan,</hi> as his drinking a health to the Devil, his throwing a Consecrated Hostie into the fire for not resolving him a certain question which he put to it, that I purposely omit, as things that are rather fit for the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a Scavenger, than the consideration of an Historian.</p>
               <p>Let us now come over into <hi>England,</hi> to see how matters succeeded here: Much about the time that <hi>Hildebrand</hi> was so busie to promote this affair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Alpes, Anselm</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> advanced it at home, and by vertue of his Archiepiscapal authority, deprived all the Married Priests throughout the Kingdom of their Ecclesiastical promotions. There had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the time of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> (when the Benedictine Order, what by their pretended Miracles, and what by the outward austerity of their Lives, spread apace) several efforts been used by <hi>Odo,</hi> and <hi>Dunstan,</hi> by <hi>Ethelwold</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Oswald</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> in the year 963 to eject the Married Priests out of Colleges and Churches, and substitute Regulars in their room; But however as this was not put in Execution in all places, so likewise the seculars were not constrained to leave their Wives and preferments but only at their own discretion. But <hi>Anselm</hi> copying from the furious <hi>Hildebrand</hi> proceeded farther in the matter, for he not only compelled 'em to part with their Wives, (which unchristian rigour the <hi>Saxon</hi> Bigotts in all their zeal never practised) but also, what was the more mortifying case of the two, forced 'em to part with their preferments. We are now at leisure to observe the consequences of this worthy Institution. As it happen'd Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> upon our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the Exportation of unwrought Wools, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately set up several new Manufactures of their own: So here when the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous were forbidden to have any more commerce with the Women, as necessity you know forces people upon desperate attempts, they began to Trade amongst themselves. In short this <hi>Italian</hi> Decree of Celibacy introduced the <hi>Italian</hi> sin of Sodomy, which occasioned so many horrid complaints, that <hi>Anselm</hi> found himself obliged to Convene another Council at <hi>London</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where very severe Laws were enacted against it. The punishment (as <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> tells us) was Excommunication <hi>ipso facto,</hi> not be got off but by Absolution from a Bishop only, and that not to be procured at an easier rate than a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65199:16"/>
swinging Pennance: But the Monks shortly after taking occasion to acquaint the Arch-bishop with the fatal inconveniences that in all probability wou'd ensue upon the Publishing of this Decree, in asmuch as it wou'd lay open and discover to all the World a Sin, that was scarce known or heard off before out of a Cloyster, he was Piously prevail'd upon to call it in. Thus you see Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> that in those Conscientious times it was thought better so permit People the liberty of Incest, Sodomy, Adultery, and Fornication, or at least, to leave 'em under an unavoidable necessity of committing such Brutalities, than repeal the unsanctify'd Canon which occasioned them.</p>
               <p>What were the first Motives which influenced the <hi>Western</hi> Patriarchs to abridge their Clergy of that liberty which the Apostles left 'em in, is not difficult to Conjecture. 'Tis certain they can make no pretences of Antiquity, or Tradition for it: For if St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s word may be taken, all the Apostles except St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were Married; and when the famous Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie of the Celebration of <hi>Easter</hi> was so warmly disputed between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Churches, <hi>Polycrates</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> alledges the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of seven of his Progenitors, who had successively governed that See, to justifie his own practice. Were the Primitive Christians then of the first and purest Ages, uncapable of living up to that height of self-denyal and Austerity, which the worst men recommended, and the worst times cou'd practice? Or did the Christian Church require as long a time to arrive to the height of Spiritual perfection, as it had to ascend to its temporal greatness? Were their Appetites more ungovernable in the ten first Centuries, or did the succeeding Ages light upon more effectual restringents to subdue 'em? Yes certainly Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> they did. For as I take it, the sanctifying Miracles of Whip cord were not so Universally acknowledged then as afterwards, nor St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s receit for an erection by running into a heap of Snow so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made use of; and then the virtue of a long Pilgrimage, the carrying about one this Saints Thumb, and that Saints set of Teeth, the Praying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such an Image or such an Altar, but above all, the recommending ones self to the Virgin <hi>Marys</hi> protection, were not things of so universal practice and approbation in the earlier times. And perhaps after all, the gift of continence was not to be bestow'd upon the Church Militant, till the sacrifice of the Mass was born, that only an immaculate Priesthood might be concerned with that immaculate Sacrifice, or till the Popes had planted Heaven with store enough of Submediators, to implore a sufficient stock of Grace for their Friends here upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Indeed Pope <hi>Siricius</hi> towards the end of the Fourth Century in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Clergy, quotes this sorry place out of Scripture to fright 'em from their Wives, <hi>Si secundum Carnem vixeritis moriemini,</hi> to which citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we'l only oppose another Text of the same Apostle, <hi>melius est nubere quam uri,</hi> and so we'l leave him. However by this single passage, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you may perceive with what eagerness and fury your infallible Guide snaps at any solitary Text in the Bible which he thinks will countenance any of his innovations, or make for his purpose. A Puny Courtier never waited with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65199:16"/>
half that impatience for a gracious nod, or a merciful wink from a rising Favourite, as infallibility it self waited here for one lonely unguarded place in the <hi>New-Testament</hi> to back his Cause; I don't question but the Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man turned over the whole Book from <hi>Genesis</hi> to the <hi>Revelations</hi> with as much concern, as ever you did, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to find out Nick-names for your <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> and <hi>Achitophel.</hi> But what advantage has he done his cause by producing this Text? Why none at all, but the greatest disservice imaginable. <hi>Si se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Carnem Vixeritis moriemini?</hi> Why it destroys Celibacy, and Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the heir apparent of Celibacy, to all intents and purposes; and I don't at all question, but that the <hi>unerring Intelligencer</hi> if he had slept a little, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted his <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illow, wou'd have been of another opinion next Morning, but it seems he was fully resolved to shew his infallibility one way or another, and he has done it with a witness, for he's most infallibly in the wrong.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> (and I hope you have good nature enough to forgive me this small digression) I make this observation, that Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> successor can steer his Ecclesiastical Mackarel-boat with a side wind, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serve, from any part of the Bible, whether Canonical or Uncanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal 'tis all a case. A little Scripture at <hi>Rome,</hi> I dare engage, will go farther than Copper mony in <hi>Ireland</hi>; 'tis not at present the commodity of the place, and I am very well satisfied that a man with a foot or two of Scripture, nay rather than fail, with an ell of <hi>Tobit,</hi> and the <hi>Maccabees</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for we ought in Conscience to make allowances for Apocryphal ground) to purchase a dozen of the best Acres in the <hi>Vatican</hi> planted with the most Apostolical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And this is a mysterie which I cannot comprehend. For if the notion of Infallibility will solve all the Phaenomena's of your Religion, why for God's sake do you take sanctuary in the Bible, and if the Bible is necessary to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port your pretentions, why do you so shamefully discard and abandon it, when it has done your business. This way of proceeding is so very brutal and ungenerous, that it puts me in mind of a late Monarch, that was brought to his Throne, and settled in it by a certain well-meaning Church, and when he thought he had no farther occasion for her, very decently laid her aside for all her former services. As the case stands at present, your <hi>Savoy</hi>-Divines are as glad to be own'd by a Friend in the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> as a needy Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier is of being own'd by a City security; but I profess I don't see the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of such a Conduct. What other people may think I don't know, but I had much rather take the invocation of Saints upon honest Infallibilities word for it, than with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deduce it from that passage of <hi>Iob, And he shall pray for thee.</hi> And a thousand times sooner take the Half-communion upon the same credit, than pretend to justifie it as Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> has done, out of <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> 'Tis the most unaccountable nonsense in my opinion that a man can be capable of, to subpoena half a score witnesses to appear for him at <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall, that when they are examined tell a clean contrary story, and so ruine his Cause; and this, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I take to be the case of your own Polemics, they freely upon all occasions (as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from their late Pamphlets) endeavour to prove all their Tenets out of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65199:17"/>
the Bible, yet they manage the matter so indiscreetly that every Tradesman can charge 'em with false inferences, and indeed after all their attempts, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pen-men will scarce be perswaded to serve an apprenticeship to the modern trade of misrepresenting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now I cou'd acquaint 'em, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain method that shall preserve their reputation in all companies, let 'em pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Miracles among the <hi>Indians,</hi> to Antiquity among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Life among the <hi>Ranters,</hi> to Unity among the <hi>Independants,</hi> to Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Good Works among the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> to Decency of Worship among the <hi>Adamites,</hi> to Learning among the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and to the Merits of their Faith among the <hi>Socinians:</hi> Let e'm quote Scripture before <hi>Physitians,</hi> quote the Fathers before Ladies, talk of Councils before Souldiers, and conjure up the Trinity before those that don't believe Transubstantion: Let 'em pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Austerity of Living among the <hi>Beaux</hi> of the Town, to Universality among the <hi>Muggletonians,</hi> and (what must be carefully observed) to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only among the Courtiers, for they are a sort of people, that because they have no leisure to examine any Religion, take it all upon trust. But among the established Churchmen, I wou'd have 'em pretend to nothing at all, but their two undeniable Talents <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Impudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to our business again, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> — the true reason of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Celibacy upon the Clergy, was at first an ungovernable zeal, void of Conduct and Charity, a peremptory Spirit of Pride, and above all, a wild notion of attaining to an imaginary kind of perfection, which is only to be found among the people of Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s creation. This, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> is the true state of the business. For tho Pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> as I told you before, was so unadvised as to endeavour to prove Celibacy out of the Bible, yet others that managed the Cause with more discretion, found it was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that kind of protection, and therefore instead of so many Texts to defend it, gave it a guard <hi>du corps</hi> of certain well-bred handsome Gentlemen, which in the language of that age they called Conveniences: However <hi>Paphnutius</hi> stifled the motion at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the Synod of <hi>Gangra</hi> passed an Anathema upon all those, that refused to receive the Communion from a married Priest. What gives me a farther prejudice to the matter in dispute, is the persons who first of all recommended it to the World. They were such that in heat of persecution had retired into the Woods to preserve themselves from the fury of their Enemies, where they had lived under a great deal of austerity and mortification, and indeed the places whither they fled for shelter, afforded no very agreeable accommodations. Now these Gentlemen, when the storm was over, and the Church enjoy'd a little Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine, were for continuing that Ascetic sort of life, which they first practised amongst the Caves and Deserts; and tho they had lived so long out of the world, wou'd very discreetly impose Laws upon those, who had always li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it.</p>
               <p>From what has been said Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> upon this score, I wou'd not have you conclude that I am an Enemy to Celibacy, no one I am sure has more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughts of that easie unincumbred state than my self; yet for all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65199:17"/>
that, I am of opinion, it ought not to be forced upon a whole body of men without any distinction, but that every man should be left to his own discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to chuse that way of life, which seems most agreeable to his own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the sacredness of his character. Four or five hundred old men they are conven'd in a Council with those formal solemnities which such great assemblies generally make use of, have in my judgment no more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to prescribe a Continence (which they themselves are past a capacity of losing) to those of more youthful appetites, than the good people that live under the Line have to command us in the North to go naked: The only revenge which the younger Clergy cou'd return, wou'd be to condemn the use of Spectacles in a full Convention for unchristian and Heretical, to order that whosoever cou'd not read a <hi>Geneva</hi>-Bible at two yards distance and vault over a five-barr'd Gate, should forfeit his Mitre, and that no one should presume to take Holy Orders, who would not oblige himself by a vow never to be guilty of wearing a Beard, and who would not renounce both Gout and Palsie, as heartily as he did the Devil and all his Works at his Baptism. Should such Decrees as these pass for the mortification of the Right Reverend Fathers, I suppose they would be only taken for things of raillery and diversion; and yet, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> Celibacy is as much a jest upon humane nature, (taking it in the gross) as what I have just now mentioned. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in my heart, that when they proceeded so far to refine the Priesthood, as to think it possible for all of 'em to live without the other Sex, that they had not likewise obliged 'em to go to Stool but once a quarter, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely at twelve a Clock, and to subsist after the Spiritual manner of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Knights Errant,</hi> that never, as we read of, debased themselves with brutal eating and drinking. As our Pulses, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> wou'd not cease beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, altho the whole College of Physitians in a <hi>Warwick-Lane</hi> Meeting should think it fit to lay an interdict upon 'em, so I don't question but Nature will continue still to work after her usual manner, tho all the Councils in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom should lay all their heads together to muzzle her: And I fancy it is but small comfort to one of your fat overgrown Friars when he finds he has a huge stock of Love upon his hands, to imagine to dispossess himself of it all, by reading over Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi>'s Canon against Sacerdotal erections. Indeed if I might have had my will, Celibacy should have waited at least another age before it had been publickly enjoyned. After Transubstantiation had been made a matter of my Faith, I would then have freely consented to have Celibacy established; for certainly, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I cou'd never think any thing too difficult for that Priest to perform, that cou'd make his God at a minutes warning.</p>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Now I hope, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> tho you deny me a share in the other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, you'l allow me to have a stock of patience sufficient to furnish all the married men and Chymists in the Nation at my own cost and Charges, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I am sure I cou'd never have heard out this tedious harangue of yours, which is full as troublesome as an <hi>Irish</hi> Genealogy, or to hear one of the City Aldermen tell all the traverses of his Fortune from his Leathern Breeches
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65199:18"/>
down to his Scarlet Gown. — Nay I knew very well before hand what entertainment a Discourse of Chastity must expect to find among you pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Protestants; but if you have any more to say upon this occasion, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> pray let me have it, for I promise you my attention.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Thus, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> your Celibacy, which Presumption, and Pride, and some few Specious Pretences first introduced into the World, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon certain Secular Considerations espoused by the Popes, till it was at last brought to that perfection in which we now see it. Your <hi>Western</hi> Patriarchs, in order to erect that Temporal Monarchy, after which they so zealously aspired, found it requisite to make the Clergy as much depending upon their See as was possible, and likewise to disengage 'em from leaving any natural pledges to the respective Governments where they lived. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by virtue of a blind obedience which had for some time been paid to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, and if that fail'd to produce the effect, by virtue of a little thundring language, which at that age was as terrible to Kings, as the Twelve-penny-Act is now to the Vintners, they made a shift to wrest the right of Investitures out of the hands of Princes, to put themselves in capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of gratifying their trusty Agents abroad, and for the same reasons of State, they forbid the Ecclesiastics all the World over to Marry, lest when they should have occasion to use their assistance against their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Princes, the squauling and cryes of their Children should stifle the voice of his <hi>Roman Molocship.</hi> Had your Priesthood, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Marriage to have been a Sacrament that brought Grace along with it, you may conclude from their taking away the Cup, and several other retrenchments, that it had been a favour to be allowed only to the choicer sort of the Laity, and that they themselves had been so far from denying Matrimony to their own Tribe, that I don't question but they would have pleaded some Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Tradition or other, nay interpreted the Scripture so far to their own advantage, as to make it allow 'em the priviledge of Poligamy, in order to secure themselves of as great a stock of Grace as was possible to be had.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>So, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> you have made a very pretty edifying discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this business, but as I informed you before, I was not insensible what usage such a mortifying doctrine as Celibacy must of necessity meet amongst the Sons of the Reformation. You that have destroy'd Religious houses, and to justifie the Sacriledge, have always laughed at the austerites which are practised in a recluse life, are too far engaged to your dearly-beloved plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, to entertain a principle that so severely contradicts the dictates of flesh and blood.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugenius.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> now you have gone a little too far in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for we Gentlemen of the Schism (as your party is pleased by way of raillery to call us) are not so averse to a Monastic life as you imagine: For my own particular, I wish with all my heart, that all the Brain-sick States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, all the besotted Lovers, and all the melancholly Zealots, all the fine-dressing Fops, all the doting kind Keepers, all the enthusiastick Poets, and all the superannuated Whores, with the mighty multitudes of raving Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,

and litigious Attorneys, that are to be found in the Kingdom of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick upon Tweed,</hi> were shut up within the four Walls of some capacious Monastery.—Now for your diversion, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> if you please to afford me a hearing, I'll repeat you a certain Ode in <hi>Horace,</hi> done by a certain friend of mine, which may serve to convince you, that we are not such enemies to Nunneries and all that, as you have hitherto believed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>An Ode in <hi>Horace,</hi> Mr. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that has any thing to do with Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries? Why 'tis impossible, and you are certainly mistaken.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>You'll correct your opinion, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> as soon as you have heard it: 'Tis a Translation of <hi>Uxor pauperis Ibyci tandem Nequitiae pone modum tuae</hi>; only somewhat new-modelled, and adapted to the present times. You must know it was calculated for the meridian of the Dutchess of <hi>Cl—land,</hi> but may indifferently serve any super-annuated Court-Whore in <hi>Christendom</hi>— But pray listen.

               <p>Faith Little <hi>Bays</hi> I am not willing at present to determine the bounds of the Churches power, 'tis as invidious a Case as to make me assign the priviledges of the House of Commons, which you know encrease every Session; a Man will be apt to speak either too little, or too much in relation to such an affair. However I think the Church had done very discreetly, if when she bound over her Sons to the observation of Celibacy, she had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd 'em a dose or two of <hi>Camphire</hi> every morning instead of so many Prayers and Ave-Maries, and commanded 'em to be let Blood every other day, that so he might have prevented all the scandalous consequences of a forced Chastity.</p>
               <p>But I find that as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he abridged his People the pleasure of Drinking, to make 'em amends, gratifyed the other appetite by allowing Women in abundance; so likewise a certain Church in the World Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> by placing no very great penalties on Fornication, when she repealed the remedy for it, and by allowing the Concubine to supply the place of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded Spouse, has made Celibacy not so very uneasy a state, as People are apt at first sight to imagine. And this consideration is sufficient to perswade me, that Conscience and Devotion had no hand at all in the promoting of Celibacy, let the Divine Law sink or swim 'tis not a Farthing matter with you, so long as the Papal Decrees are observ'd, where smaller trespasses are severely punished, and notorious Sins meet with Toleration; as they say in the Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Feathers sink, and Iron swims. All the World knows how remarkably <hi>Costerus</hi> and several other of your Divines have refined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point, and 'tis observable in your Canon Law, that so many Acts of Fornication, are required to make the Indictment large enough to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a poor Sinner, that they'l excuse not only the immortal <hi>Theodora</hi>'s and <hi>Marozia</hi>'s of former Ages, and the <hi>Donna Olympia's</hi> of this, but perhaps
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65199:19"/>
all the She-traders since the times of <hi>Rahab,</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> Daughters. A Woman had need now a days (if the Doctrine of your Church be true) to live as long as one of the Patriarchs Wives before the Flood, to have time enough to work out the painful and laborious Character of a Whore. But we, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> dare not play such tricks with Religion, dubb Vices by the Name of Virtues, or (what is full as bad) keep a disputable Virtue at the expence of keeping at the same time an unquestionable Sin; whatever interest or advantage may suggest, we dare not make such large purliews for outlying Consciences, not we, Mr. <hi>Bays.</hi>

               <p>As my friend very well observes, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> we don't think it worth the while to maintain a controverted virtue at the expence of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an uncontroverted Sin, while you of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have never a Virtue to boast of, that is not attended with some Crimnal Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Thus you maintain your pretended Chastity at the expence of allowing publick Fornication, your obedience to your Patriarch at the expence of Sacrificing your obedience to your natural Prince, your Monast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic Poverty at the expence of Perjury and Hypocrisie; your Unity at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of an Unchristian Inquisition, the Grandeur of your Worship at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Idolatry, your pretension to Miracles and Antiquity, at the expence of Lying and Forgery, your Charity at the expence of Superstition; and lastly, the Devotion of your People at the expence of Ignorance, and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Sacriledge of taking away their Bibles.</p>

               <p>Nay, sometimes, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> matters go worse with you; as for example, when you perswade People to the utter undoing of their Families, to leave all they have, to a lazy Herd of Spiritual Gluttons, for the saying of their Souls; when you perswade young Virgins in defiance of their Parents, to run into a Nunnery for the obtaining of Heaven; when you perswade Wives to leave their Husbands, Husbands to leave their Wives, Kings to oppress their Subjects, Subjects to depose their Kings for the remission of their sins; this is, unless I am mistaken, making one sin compound and attone for another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like a decay'd Tradesman that borrows Money in one place, and contracts a fresh Debt, to pay off one of a longer standing.</p>

               <p>It were an infinite trouble to reckon up all the Sects and Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions into which the Protestant Religion is split, a man had better run the Gantlet through a Genealogy Chapter in the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> or (what is worse) read over one of <hi>Ch-sw-lls</hi> Weekly Papers, that is stuff'd with the Names of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords, than be bound to number them. And yet they all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be in the right, Quote Scripture to support their Cause, and damn one another as heartily as ever Interloper did the <hi>East-India</hi> Company. Out of this passage <hi>Let every thing be done decently and in order,</hi> the Established Church has rais'd the whole frame of her Hierarchy, her Ceremonies, and her Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as you know in the late blessed times the Fanatics out of <hi>Curse ye Meroz,</hi> rais'd several Regiments of Horse and Foot for the Service of the good Old Cause. On the other hand, because it is elsewhere written, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Devotion is to be perform'd <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> those <hi>Adamites</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, your Dissenting Brethren, have stript her stark naked, and divested her of all those deceent ceremonies that she used in the Purest and most Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times.</p>

               <p>I wont mention ten thousand other particulars wherein you differ, for what I have already taken notice of, is sufficient for my purpose. Now what relief is there to be had in this critical affair, how shall the differences be made up between you? Or how shall a man be satisfied which Party is in the right, and which in the wrong? All of them have Texts of Scripture to alledge for themselves, as well as you of the Established Church, and if you lead 'em a dance amongst the Fathers, and appeal to their decision of the matter, why they'll tell you, they mind what the Fathers say no more than the Bullies of the other end of the Town mind one of my Lord Mayors Proclamations for living soberly, and keeping the Sabbath: Alas those Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Gentlemen of the three first Centuries knew little or nothing of the power of the Gospel; one honest <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Weaver wou'd make no more difficulty of bantering a full dozen of 'em if he met 'em in his way, than one of your <hi>Iniskilling</hi> men does of routing a whole Regiment of <hi>Irish</hi>: Poor blind Prelates, they had no more interest in Christ, than the <hi>Laplanders</hi> have in the <hi>Guinea</hi> Company; and as for the hidden mysteries of Grace, they are as unfit to be consulted, as a Physician in a case of Conscience, or one of the Judges of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> about the Longitude of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Thus you see, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> to what a pretty condition you have brought your selves; you first of all began the trade of garbling Fathers and Counils, and reserving what made for your own interest and advantage; and your Brethren since have totally rejected 'em, or if they vouchsafe now and then to cite 'em in the Margin, (which let me tell you, is as extraordinary a condescension, as it is for a new-rais'd Courtier to look upon a poor Country relation) 'tis
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65199:20"/>
to make out some such knotty businesses as these, that Temperance is the mother of all Virtues, and Drunkenness one of the greatest sins in the World. In such an intricate point as this, perhaps St. <hi>Austin</hi> may have the favour done him to be sent for, as I knew one of the Herd that quoted this quibble out of him, <hi>Mane is Gods Adverb, and the Devils Verb</hi>; and another that proved the Suns dancing upon <hi>Easter</hi> morning out of that remarkable passage in St. <hi>Chrysostom, Semel-in anno ridet Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not to be tedious upon this occasion, your divisions are chiefly owing to the want of an Infallible guide, that should determine all controverted cases, and to your leaving every man to the liberty of interpreting Scripture by his own fantastic imagination, or by the light of that farthing candle within him, the private Spirit.</p>

               <p>I must confess, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you have now touch'd me in a very tender place, for there's no man breathing that more passionately bewails the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Church than my self: However, it has a very ill grace methinks in the mouth of a <hi>Romanist</hi> to charge us with such an unhappiness, since in the first place you have as many Divisions among your selves as we have, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the pretences you make to an infallible judge; and secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are only to thank your cursed missionaires for introducing and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting 'em, as is notorious to all the VVorld.</p>
               <p>You want to have your memory refreshed I suppose, with the noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that engaged one of your orders for half an Age at least about the length of their Cowls, which was managed with as much heat and vigour, as if the fate of the Christian Religion had wholly depended upon it: With the everlasting quarrels between the <hi>Franciscans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> about the <hi>Virgin Mary's</hi> immaculate Conception, which none of your Unerring guides have thought fit yet to determine, for fear of disgruntling one of those power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fraternites: with the late disagreements between the <hi>Molinists,</hi> and <hi>Iansenists,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> Oracle Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th was pleas'd to tell 'em, <hi>Pray Gentlemen go home in peace, and let me perswade you to let this matter fall, for I never studied the point, and am no Divine</hi>; and lastly with the modern rise and growth of Quietism, that was Educated and refined even in the Vatican Palace, under the favour and protection of Infallibility it self; and tho it was lately fulminated, still makes a considerable Party all over <hi>Italy.</hi> I won't trouble my self with the endless Wars of the Schoolmen, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with the Skirmishes that happen'd between the Disciples of <hi>Scaramouchi Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Harsequin Scotus,</hi> two learned Theologues that made use of a Heathen's help to cultivate Christianity, and Ploughed the barren Fields of their Controversies with an Ox and Ass, that is with an <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These instances may serve to convince you, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> and particularly that last of the Quietists, that for all the noise your Infallible Judge makes here among us, the <hi>Tramontani</hi> with his Spiritual Thunder, and pretended Vicarship, of what little use he is with his own Domesticks, who converse with him, and see him daily, since under his own Nose so Pestilent a Heresie could arise as to Alarm the whole Papacy. I am sure as many divisions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65199:21"/>
the first Planted Churches, as do ours of the Reformation at present, when the World was furnished with at least a dozen Infallibilities, and I don't question but that the same Spirit of Discord wou'd still continue to plague us, tho twelve hundred Infallibillities were Quarter'd all over the Globe, to keep their Masters Peace.</p>
               <p>As for what you object to us in the next place, the libetty which some fantastical People among us use, interpreting the Scripture, we are not at all accountable for it, since if they pleas'd to take better advice, and manage themselves with more modesty, they would seldom make use of the private Talent, but suffer themselves to be determined by the Councils and Fathers of the three first unquestionable Ages, as the Establish'd Church has done.</p>
               <p>We have indeed rejected (what you call garbling) many spurious Works, that passed a great while under the protection of some great Names, and this I am sure without any injury, or disrespect to the Authors themselves; as you know, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> a man may have a great esteem for your friend <hi>Virgil,</hi> without believing him to be the Writer of the <hi>AEtna,</hi> and the <hi>Priapeia,</hi> and will preserve a respect for the old Testament, tho he cannot perswade himself that Bell and the Dragon has any relation to the Canon. Now tho I must freely grant you, that some seeming inconveniencies may ensue upon the promiscuous use of the Bible, especially when it falls into dishonest hands, yet we don't think the abuse capable of justifying that Sacrilegious Rapine of taking it away, any more than the Civil Government is obliged to lock up all Provisions, and Prohibit VVine, to secure People from falling into Fevers, and other Distempers.</p>

               <p>Now I chance to meet with him once more in my Dish, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to tell you two or three Stories of him, which may serve to show you how well he deserves the Glorious Title he assumes.</p>
               <p>You are to understand, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in their fourth Session, left the reforming of the vulgar Translation (about which several complaints were made) to the Pope's care, and Decreed that the Latin Version being thus amended, should be received for Authentick in all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, Expositions and Sermons, so that it should not be lawful for any Person afterward, upon any pretence whatever, to reject it: Thus it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed those Learned Divines at <hi>Trent,</hi> to Christen this <hi>Hans en Kelder.</hi> Now <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> was the man that first took this work into his Pious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (for as it happen'd, his Predecessors either neglected, or forgot to put the above-mention'd Decree of the Council in execution) and prefixed a specious Bull before it, to acquaint the World, that having Revised it with all the exactness imaginable, and Printed it at the Vatican, it was now to be received without contradiction all the World over. But oh the Fates! Not long after, <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. found fault even with this Translation, though it was Ratify'd by his Predecessors Apostolical Authority, and a good swinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anathema into the bargain, expung'd whole Words and Sentences, restor'd several Lections very different from <hi>Sixtus</hi>'s Edition; nay, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting it in many places: And in fine, made more corrections, alterations, amendments, and all that, than you did, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> either in <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s Tempest, or <hi>Milton</hi>'s Paradise lost.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis a plain case, honest Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that one of these two Infallibilities, either <hi>Size-Cinque</hi> (as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> call'd him) or <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. choose you whether you will, was most infallibly in the wrong. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Pope's Talent generally lyes another way than in the Bible, and he may consequently be allowed to blunder in a Book, that he is so slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with; I'll proceed to another instance, which is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so excusable.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. (whose memory we are to curse for the many Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries he erected) took upon him the Authority of altering the times, and making a new Kalender. Heretofore, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us, <hi>Caesar correxit fastos pridem vitio Pontificum per intercalandi licentiam turbatos.</hi> But now the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65199:22"/>
Emperour is not to be consulted in an affair which so nearly concern'd his civil Government, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontif, instead of embarrassing the Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack as his Predecessors had done in <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> time, was the only man that lent his helping hand to reform it. The Pope's Politick fetch in this alteration, was only to embroil and intangle the Protestants, especially those that lived in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to ruine their commerce and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in all civil matters with the Catholick Party. <hi>Baronius</hi> very pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly justifies the Divine Authority of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Kalender, by a pretended Miracle of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s blood at <hi>Naples,</hi> which ceased to bubble on the 30th of <hi>August,</hi> on which day St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s body was first discovered, according to the old computation, and bubbled upon that which fell according to the new amendment. But yet it was ill done, with <hi>Baronius</hi>'s leave, to set the two Kalenders at variance, when both of 'em had been equally countenanced by the Miracle. Now as I was saying before, the Pope may be allowed to mistake in such an unsociable book as the Bible is, as well as a new-made Justice is allowed to make a false Quotation, now and then, in his <hi>Dalton,</hi> and his Statute-book: But for a Pope to make errours in an Almanack (as your friend <hi>Gadbury</hi> will tell you Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> has done) a book of which he makes so many men free in an years time, and which he ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand as well as a Seaman should understand his Compass, or my Lord Mayor <hi>Stow</hi>'s Survey of the City; for the Pope, I say, to do such a thing, is the Devil and all of a fault, and ought not to be forgiven him.</p>
               <p>Talking of Red Letters and Almanacks, has, I know not by what strange concatenation of thought, put me in mind of the Persons that inhabit the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack, and that naturally leads me to think of a late Pope that composed a very scurvy difference between two Inhabitants of that Papal Corporation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. had appointed the 31th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> for <hi>St. Ignatius</hi>'s Anniversary Festival,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hist. Pap.</hi> p. 357.</note> upon which those of the Society arriv'd to that pitch of confidence (to give it no worse a Name) as to eject good <hi>St. German</hi> out of the Kalender, where it seems he had enjoy'd that day without any disturbance for several hundreds of years, and underhand, set up <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his room. This Treacherous Clandestine trick, gave a great deal of Scandal to most of the well-meaning people of <hi>France,</hi> who had an extraordinary respect for the memory of <hi>St. German,</hi> and tho the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was of the Jesuites party, pretended that <hi>Ignatius</hi> appeared to him in <hi>Rome,</hi> as he was on that day Celebrating his Festival, and was pleas'd to incourage his Devotions; yet they were not to be satisfy'd with any such sham Stories, and the resentments, which the affront that their Saint received had created in them, were not to be silenc'd with a foolish recital of a pretended Vision. At last they brought their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints before this Infallible Judge, who thus decided the controversie: That the Festival of <hi>St. German</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> should be kept on the same day, but that if the two Saints were not willing to stand together, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> (and all the reason in the World, since he was much the younger) should ev'n wait for Leap-year, and the odd day which happen'd, to be intercala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65199:22"/>
should be laid aside for him — Here's a knotty Point finely resolved for you, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> a Protestant Bishop cou'd as well carry his own Cathedral on his back, as hold the Scales even in such an affair, and make up the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a brace of Saints; but nothing I find is too difficult for your Unerring Guide to adjust — And now let me intreat you, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to go on to some new point, for as I hope for a fresh Bottle of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and a fresh Mistress, I am already Dog-weary of this.</p>

               <p>I find, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you're a meer <hi>Indian</hi> in History. What, did you never hear of the famous contest between <hi>Austin</hi> and the <hi>British</hi> Bishops about their subjection to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and how fatally it concluded? Did you never hear of the <hi>Wiclevites</hi> at home, and of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> abroad, which last Herd of Heretics as <hi>Reinerus</hi> the Inquisitor tells you, some people place as high as the times of St. <hi>Silvester,</hi> and others as high as the very Apostles?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>They may run 'em up to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood with all my heart, and I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you upon my word, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> I'le never grudge you the honour of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such worthy instances to prove your antiquity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>That is not the case, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> for I never mention'd 'em as tho we were descended in a down-right Line from them, as they say the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> are descended from <hi>Fergus,</hi> or as tho the merits of the Reformation depended on 'em: But only to let you know that in some part of the World
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65199:23"/>
or other, there never wanted a generation of men, even in the darkest and most barbarous times, that opposed your innovations, and had the bravery to stem the Tide of the Papal Usurpations. This might be made appear in every Century, since your Church parted with her Maiden-head to the Man of Sin; but because it is not to be done without an endless quotation of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, which is a sort of vanity that I am not naturally very fond of, I shall ee'n refer you to the <hi>Historia Papatus</hi> for your farther satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Some of your Divines have been so civil to us, as to allow us the three first Centuries, or at least to acknowledge that all those controverted points, wherein you and we differ, were not clearly established in the earliest times of Christianity. The Church, it seems, had afterwards fuller revelations of all these depending matters, and some Christian Doctrines, like <hi>China</hi>-earth, were to be buried under ground for a considerable time, before they were fit for a discovery, and the practice of mankind.</p>
               <p>Thus, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> in the opinion of your best Authors, who to be sure wou'd never pass such extraordinary complements upon us, if they cou'd otherwise help it, we have as much Antiquity on our side as we can desire. 'Tis very true, that in succeeding times, your Popes served the Christian Religion, as Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> served the Popish-plot, they found a large Foundation, upon which they raised several superstructures of their own; now we only removed and pulled 'em down at the beginning of the Reformation, so that we constituted no new Church, (as some of your Dreaming Scriblers pretend) but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored her to her primitive purity, and simplicity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, ay, you have restored her with a witness, and you are to thank the <hi>Wittemberg</hi>-Revolter for setting you upon so pious a performance. As for my own part, by reading Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> Book of <hi>Oxford,</hi> I have entertained such prejudices against him, that all the World can never remove 'em: And I heartily thank that learned Author for making the following observation, That whilst the <hi>Turk</hi> was attacquing Christianity in the Front at <hi>Vienna, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was at the same invading it in the Rear in <hi>Saxony.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> whether it is worth your while to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of such impertinent remarques, for at the same time you oblige us of the Reformation to look a little into History, and see whether we cannot make the same returns upon you. I have read somewhere or other I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that at the very same juncture when <hi>Boniface</hi> set up for Universal Bishop, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was establishing his <hi>Alcoran</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi>; and to pass by the like occurences in former ages, the <hi>Brussels</hi> Gazette acquainted the world, that Count <hi>Hains</hi> the Player, and my Lord <hi>S-l-s-b-ry</hi> were reconcil'd to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> together; and every body in the City knows that <hi>Moll. Meggs</hi> and my Lord <hi>S-nd-rl-nd</hi> were admitted into the Popish Chappel at <hi>White-hall</hi> on the same day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>However, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> I can scarce be perswaded that <hi>Luther</hi> and the other Bell-weathers of the Reformation, were ever design'd by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to restore the Church to (what you call) her ancient purity, and to retreive her from a long habitual course of Superstition and Idolatry (for by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65199:23"/>
that cut-throat name you slander the received usages of the <hi>Western</hi> Church) since they came not attended with the power of Miracles, which is the usual badge of the Missionaires of Heaven, and for his part <hi>Luther</hi> had nothing in him, to distinguish him from the rest of the World, but a peculiar talent of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling Princes, aspersing his Superiors, and treating all his Adversaries with insupportable insolence and scurrility.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>As for his Heats and Passions we have no more to say, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> but that your Infallible Guides have not been without 'em, witness he that blasphem'd so heartily, for having only lost a Peacock. Now I wonder that you should fall so severely upon <hi>Luther</hi> for the freedom he took with King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th (for I suppose you had your eye upon him, when you tax'd the <hi>German</hi> just now with the reviling of Princes) when there's scarce a Priest, or Scribler of your party throughout the Kingdom, that has not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted that or any other Princes memory with greater boldness and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who has had the hardiness to mortifie the Churchmen: you need not be informed how that Haberdasher of Gerunds and Supines <hi>Scioppius</hi> the Grammarian, used King <hi>Iames</hi> the First. But a little warm raillery in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant I find is an unpa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>donable sin, while the Catholic Cause sanctifies even the vilest ribaldry, and ascribes it all to the score of Zeal and Devotion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>But why, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> should you think the worse of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for its want of Miracles? We don't pretend to have raised a new Church, and consequently don't stand in need of 'em, and as for the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Saviour and the Apostles, we have as good a title to 'em as you can have. As for what relates to all those stupid ill-contriv'd prodigies and delusions, by which the Monks have supported their superstitious practises, ever since the days of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great (to whom <hi>Trajan</hi> was more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding than to his Master <hi>Plutarch,</hi> for he pray'd him out of Hell) much good may they do you, and if I had a mind to curse any one heartily, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I cou'd not do it more effectually than by wishing him the late <hi>Quakers</hi> stomach to devour all manner of Offel, and for the second course, a faith capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enough to believe all the senseless stories in <hi>Iacobus de Voragine,</hi> and <hi>L' Escole d' Euchariste.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Under favour, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I wou'd not have you rely too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the argument of Miracles, for to my certain knowledge the best and the most gainful, nay I was going to say, the only distinguishing Doctrine of your Church, scorns as much to be defended by a Miracle, as a Gentleman of the Town wou'd scorn to take a Poet or a Parson for his Second in a Duel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>The Doctrine my Friend is talking of, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> will never pass the <hi>Ordeal</hi> of miracle; for to prove Transubstantiation, a tenet that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts all our Senses, by a Miracle, which is a formal appeal to 'em, is as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn a piece of nonsense as to go about to prove one of <hi>Euclid</hi>'s propositions out of <hi>Littleton</hi>'s Tenures, or the circulation of the Blood out of Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>'s Apology for Man-midwifery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>In this case, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> a Miracle does the same mischief, as the <hi>Saxons</hi> did in the case of the poor <hi>Britains,</hi> it ruines the very cause it was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65199:24"/>
sent for to support. If you believe a Miracle is, as I told you, an appeal to the Sences, 'tis as impossible then to justifie Transubstantiation by one, as, if you admit a Dispensing Power, to suppose there can be any such thing in the World as an inviolable <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for Liberty of Conscience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugenius.</speaker>
               <p>But why Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> should you expect that condescension in the Almighty Poet (as you are pleas'd to call him) which you wou'd severely condemn in an ordinary Tragedian? You know what <hi>Horace</hi> says to this point, and perhaps he's as good a Casuist in the matter as any of your <hi>Trent-Divines.</hi>

                  </q>
Now most of your pretended Miracles are delivered down to us by a pack of such dreaming unthinking Sots, were wrought in such obscure places, under the protection of such a Barbarous Age, and what chiefly moves me, were performed for such trival insignificant ends, (except you think the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching a few strowling Spiritual jugglers cause enough to put Heaven to the perpetual expence of Miracles) that I had much rather believe there was never any such thing as a Miracle since the Creation, than receive all for such that your Priests have recounted; as I can sooner perswade my self there was never such a person as King <hi>Arthur,</hi> than that he perform'd all those mighty exploits that the History relates of him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Now we are upon this Subject Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> there goes a Golden say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of King <hi>Iames</hi> the first, Cited by my Lord of St. <hi>Albans.</hi>
                  <q>Kings ought to govern by the received Laws of their Country, as God by the ordinary rules of Nature, and ought as seldom to make use of their Prerogative, as God does of his power of Miracles.</q>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Why, in my opinion 'tis the noblest Apothegm that ever any Prince in the World was guilty of, and I wish one of his Successors had followed the advice. I have not without a great deal of regret observed in the late Reign, that the very same persons who make the Almighty so familiarly violate the Laws upon of Nature every frivolous account, were the men that perswaded his Vicegerent the late unfortunate King, to dispense with, that is, to break half the Laws of his Land, and all, for the noble end of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a few Starving <hi>Irishmen,</hi> hungry Converts, impudent Priests, and needy Officers. Now as the Prerogative must needs grow very Cheap when it is prostituted to every sawcy Petitioner, so must the power of Miracles certainly fall into contempt, when they are challenged upon every inconsiderable pretence.</p>

               <p>To the shame of your Church be it spoken, the Heathen Poets were a great deal more civil to the Deity than the writers of the Saints Lives among you have been: They never <hi>Subpaena</hi> him to appear on the Stage, or to hazard himself in a Machine, but when an intricate perplex'd affair happens, which only a <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or an <hi>Apollo</hi> is capable of unravelling: But 'tis otherwise with the Monks; for they'l scarce let the Saint whom
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65199:24"/>
they recommend, Eat or Drink, or Sleep, or go to Stool without a Miracle to keep him Company; he never makes the sign of a Cross, but the Devil is in as great a fear, as an overgrown Bawd at the sight of an unmerciful Justice; and when the freak takes him to Preach alone in the Fields, as St. <hi>Francis</hi> and St. <hi>Anthony</hi> have done, the Birds and Beasts make an Audience for him, and listen to his harangue with as much Complaisance and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a Midwife to a discourse of a Procreation, or a City Prentice to a story of Knight-errantry.</p>

               <p>And is not this a down right Calumny Mr. <hi>Eugenius</hi>? Why do you father any such reproachful things on the writers of our Communion?

               <p>Well, Sir, have you made an an end of your rambling speech at last? I warrant you, I shall have a care of you for the future, and not give you the like occasion for trespassing upon my patience. But prithee tell me, dear Mr. <hi>Crites</hi> (for we have hitherto talked nothing to the purpose) what is your Opinion of the life of <hi>St. Xavier?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I must needs own that 'tis writ with more caution than generally such kind of Lives are, and as for the Language and the Ornaments of the stile, I have nothing to except to them, for without any more Ceremony, they are extreamly fine, both in the Original and in the Translation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, now you rejoyce the cockles of my heart, honest Mr. <hi>Crites</hi>; oh I love dearly to have my pieces commended, and all that, by a Person of Understanding: I'gad I do, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> 'tis the greatest refreshment in the World. Prithee, dear Rogue, let me hugg thee to pieces. Come, I'll give thee a Dish of Tea for this—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>But notwithstanding, Mr. <hi>Bays</hi>—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>How, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> do you attack me in the rear with a <hi>But,</hi> and a <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> too? No mortal breathing can bear it. What you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to kick down the Milk you have given?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis but your own way, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> as you may remember in your Verses upon <hi>Mr. Oldham,</hi> where you tell the World that he was a very fine ingenious Gentleman, but still did not understand the cadence of the <hi>English</hi> Tongue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Very true Sir, but what have you to say to the <hi>Notwithstanding?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to make friends with you, I'll leave out the <hi>Notwithstanding.</hi> But as I was saying before, I don't well apprehend the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy either of Writing, or Translating such a Book. The design of the History runs upon this Key, <hi>Here was a Saint that Converted whole Kingdoms to the</hi> Christian <hi>Religion, he raised People from the Dead, he Cured all manner of Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; in short, his whole life was nothing but a continued Series of Wonders and Miracles, therefore the Doctrines he taught were Infallibly true, and the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, of which he was so Zealous a Member, teaches nothing disagreeable to the Will of Heaven.</hi> This is the summ and substance of the Book, is it not, Mr. <hi>Bays?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>No body makes a question on't, as I know of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Very good. Now (say I) what advantage cou'd the Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to himself by Writing such a Book. He knew very well that we He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks did not believe a Syllable of the Miracles wrought here by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society in <hi>Europe,</hi> and did he then imagine we could ever be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65199:26"/>
brought to believe all their pretended Miracles in the <hi>East-Indias.</hi> This is such a piece of stuff, as if a man that ask'd me to lend him half a Crown, and I thought fit to deny him that small summ, should therefore desire me to lend him a Guinea.

No Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> our understandings are not altogether so <hi>Irish,</hi> as to be thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon. The late <hi>Leige</hi>-Letters, and the fine account they sent to <hi>Rome</hi> of the progresses they made in Converting the three Kigdoms, have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently instructed us, what a share of Faith is to be given to the Disciples of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> If a Protestant had been worth the saving, methinks they might have allow'd us one Miracle at least here at home. It had been as necessary I am sure as in <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Iapan.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugenius.</speaker>
               <p>So now Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> what Complements have you in store for this honest friend of yours? Oh 'tis a fine thing to have one's performances commended by a person of judgment! it comforts and relieves the poor heart infinitely beyond <hi>Daffy</hi>'s <hi>Elixir,</hi> or the <hi>Ros Florentinus.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Nay I gad, I think the Devil himself can't tell me, to which of you two I am the most indebted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Besides Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> there are ten thousand passages in that History, even too gross for a <hi>Laplander</hi>'s apprehension. Cou'd not the honest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drop his Crucifix in the Sea, but a Crab must be presently employ'd to bring it ashore? Cou'd not he go a Ship-board as well as other People upon their Lawful occasions, without entailing a Miracle upon it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving it afterwards from the injuries of wind and weather? Cou'd not he dye after the usual rate of mankind, but an Old Image at his Father's Castle must out of pure pitty drip at the very same moment? Cou'd not a poor Taper or so burn before his Image, but the very droppings of it must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cure all manner of Infirmities? Cou'd not he be content to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the Infidels after the plain manner of the Old <hi>Apostles,</hi> without teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the <hi>Confiteor</hi> and the <hi>Ave-Mary,</hi> and leaving them that foolish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism, which you may find copied in <hi>Ludovicus Dieu</hi>? Cou'd he with any safe conscience reprove the <hi>Bonza's</hi> for cheating the poor people of their Money, and pretending to return it them with Usury in the next World, and then instruct them in the Doctrines of his Mother Church about private Masses and Purgatory, which practises the very self same Imposture?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, after this rate you may ridicule every thing in the World, if you please.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>I profess, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I don't see any reason why the Saint should fall so severely upon those <hi>Indian</hi> Recluses, the <hi>Bonza's,</hi> as the History in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us he did, since they led no other lives, than the <hi>Monks</hi> generally do here in <hi>Christendom</hi>; they pretended to a great deal of austerity when they walked abroad, and in their private Cells gave themselves over to all the licentiousness imaginable, Hypocrisie was their peculiar Talent, and they were expert masters at the Trade; one principle they held, which is, I am sure, Orthodox enough, and very agreeable to the sentiments of your Church, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65199:26"/>
that Poverty is a damnable sin, and no one can be saved who has not the grace to be Rich. Methinks for the sake of this single Doctrine the Pious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might have been enclin'd to pass by their other infirmities, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em not as meer Infidels, and Aliens, but as half-converts, and fellow-labourers in the Vineyard.</p>

               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>My Friend has already told you, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to what little purpose the Author writ the History of St. <hi>Xavier:</hi> Prithee then tell me what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages you cou'd propose to your self in the Translating it? Was it to get a pretty round sum of money, or so, from your friend <hi>T-ns-n</hi>? Come, I saith Little Rogue thou must tell me the reason.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Must,</hi> Mr <hi>Eugenius?</hi> What do you give the <hi>Must</hi> to a man of my Character and Gravity? Were Reasons as cheap as Black-berries, I'de not give you one I gad upon compulsion. What <hi>must</hi> give you a Reason, dear Mr. <hi>Eugenius?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugenius.</speaker>
               <p>Why if that won't do, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I intreat and conjure thee, as thou hopest for no Famine in this World, and no Gnashing of Teeth in the next, nay as thou hopest for preferment for the Virtuous Sons of thy Body, and a good Third Day for the last issue of thy brain, <hi>Don Sebastian,</hi> to acquaint me with the Reason why thou didst undertake the aforesaid Translation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, now you accost me with Civil Language and all that, I can deny you nothing: You must know then that 'twas purely done for the sake of the Late Queen, when she gave the people hopes of obliging 'em with a Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> St. <hi>Xavier</hi> was the Card she depended upon; and let me tell you he's a Person that never fails to oblige his Votaries.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>The reason is, because he has liv'd but a short while in the <hi>Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but when he has passed an age or two there, 'tis ten to one but he'l grow as sleepy and unmindful of his Clients, as the rest of his Brother Saints have done. We see the same things practised by our Lawyers; when they first set up for themselves, nothing can be more diligent in attending all manner of Causes than they are; but when they have once acquir'd a Reputation and an Estate, you may dance attendance a long while at their Chambers, before you can get 'em to mind your business.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>I find, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are as passionately affected for a new Saint, as the Gentlemen at this end of the Town are for a new Play, a new Tavern, and a new Mistress; you know how the late famous Cardinal of <hi>Millain</hi> St. <hi>Carlo</hi> has overtopt the name of venerable St. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> But prithee tell me how St. <hi>Xavier</hi> came to be pitcht upon in this weighty affair, one that had herded so long amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> and besides was not half so well acquainted with the condition of <hi>Europe,</hi> as his contemporaries St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and St. <hi>Francis de Sales</hi> were?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>For a very good reason Sir. The late Queen-mother of <hi>France</hi> you must understand for a long time had no Children, and tho she used the most effectual means in the world to remove her barreness as the—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>As the help of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee, Mr. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> don't disturb me thus, as the Prayers of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65199:27"/>
the Church, and the advice of her Physitians, yet all would not do: At last she was happily perswaded to recommend her self to the protection of St. <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi> nor was the counsel long with out answerable success, for to his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful intercession she owed the present King of <hi>France, Lovis le Grand.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Nay if any thing on this side Hell had a hand in praying for so choice a blessing, I dare swear it was one of the <hi>Society</hi>; and so, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> because St <hi>Xavier</hi> met with such success in <hi>France,</hi> it was believed he'd meet with the like in <hi>England,</hi> and procure us an Heir Apparent to the Crown. We have already seen the blessed effects of his mediation, and I am afraid the poor Saint will find it a harder business by far to pray his Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> into a Throne, than he found it to pray him into the World.—I am in good hopes, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you have not many more Objections now in store to make against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for methinks we have been discoursing along while about her, therefore pray dispatch.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>For your comfort, Gentlemen, I have only one Objection more to make, and then I have done: You may think it somewhat strange perhaps for a person of my Profession to quarrel with your Church for her want of discipline, and observation of fasting days, and lastly, because I am willing to sum up all my forces at parting, for her want of Ceremonies, and that Grandeur, which is requisite to support every Religion in the World, but yet I have done it.— I gad I have Gentlemen —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>I must confess, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> it looks as odd for a Poet to be angry with any Religion, because it is not guilty of rigour, and severity, as for a Bawd to quarrel with the Government of the City, because it does not hang, draw, and quarter all people that have committed Fornication: Such an Objection from a Poet is altogether as unnatural, as it wou'd be for an Atheist to find fault with the Translation of <hi>Lucretius</hi>; or for a Parson that carries three Steeples in his Pocket, to condemn the Church for allowing of Pluralities.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Well, you may pursue your Drollery as far as you please, but in my opinion your Church is guilty of a certain sin, with a damnable hard name to it, and the learned Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> calls it an <hi>Autocatacrisis</hi>; that is, you need no adversary to arraign you in the present case, for you condemn your selves. In your <hi>Ash-wednesday</hi> Service, you wish the primitive discipline were restored again, you wish I say it were restored, but it never proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any farther, for you never attempted any thing in order to establish it since the Reformation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>We may e'en thank your Infallible Guide for that, and no one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; he for a long time had taken the power upon him to lay aside the old penitentiary Canons, and instead of those severe Mortifications, which the Primitive Church inflicted upon Offenders, either imposed pecuniary mulcts, or else enjoyn'd the people for the attaining an Absolution, to go and be knock'd in the Head in the Holy-Land, or else to be damn'd in his service in fighting against Heretics at home. However mony was still the powerful business, and whatever the offence was, mony still aton'd for it. Now after
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65199:27"/>
so long a disuse of the Ancient Discipline, the Reformers found it as impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable a thing to introduce it on the sudden, as it would be for the present Government to revive all the old Penal Statutes, that have lain dormant ever since <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>This is a very good jest I gad, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> we have ruined (you say) Pennance, and utterly confounded it, as if it was not still received for a Sacrament amongst us, and kept up to the highest rigour and austerity. Well, I perceive you are not so well acquainted with the constitutions of our Church as you should be; Alas! you know nothing of the Pilgrimages we enjoyn, or of the Religious Exercises we prescribe in such cases.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Yes I do, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> but still I tell you mony will make up all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and repair the greatest breaches you can mention: As for your other punishments they are so very foolish and ridiculous, that they are almost beneath any mans consideration to expose 'em.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>A Whore has committed Fornication, and acquaints her Father Confessor with it. Go (says he) to <hi>Loretto,</hi> or St. <hi>Winifreds</hi>- Well, and there be sure you repeat so many Prayers a day, and leave some small Token be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you at the Altar; and then according to the civility of your Religion, he gives her Absolution; for 'tis the complaisance of your Church to grant a full release before debt be discharged. Away she goes, and if Barefoot, so much the better; but 'tis an even lay, that before she reaches her journeys end, she is guilty of that sin a hundred times over, for which the Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was enjoyn'd her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>A Tradesman for some honest cheats that he uses in his Vocation, is enjoyn'd after the like manner to beat the Hoof to the next Saints Shrine, and there pay his Devotions: Now what kind of commerce the Priest keeps with the solitary Lady, all the while that the Poor Husband is upon his <hi>April</hi>-Errand, is not difficult to imagine. For when such an intreague is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, the Spiritual Guide takes the same care to remove that Evil Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the Cuckold, as the Popes did to send the <hi>Western</hi> Princes out of the way by a <hi>Crusade,</hi> when they were laying the foundations of their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Greatness. In short, those idle unaccountable performances that your Church requires, you must call Pennance, by the same Figure only, as you call eating the best Fish, and drinking the best Wine, a Religious Fasting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Now you remind me of Fasting, which is a duty that you of the Reformation so seldom practise; pray tell me how you can excuse your selves for so unpardonable a failure, or what you have to Object to us in that Particular.</p>

               <p>I shall make use of no other answer, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> than what you have already furnished us with in one of your Plays. 'Tis the return of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>Indian</hi> in the Conquest of <hi>Mexico</hi> upon an Impertinent <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that was discoursing the very same things upon this occasion as you have done.

                     <l>Your selves proscribe it how to punish you.</l>
                  </q>
There are abundance of very smart reflections in the same Scene upon the Pope's Supremacy, and the sawciness of your Priests; for to say the truth you spare 'em no more when ever you meet 'em conveniently, than the <hi>French</hi> Privateers do the <hi>English</hi> Merchant-men; but this being written, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you receiv'd your last illumination, I shall urge it no more upon you. However, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to deal plainly with you, there's no such thing as fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your Church, especially amongst people of any quality, unless you'l ridicule the regaling one self with the most provoking Meats, and the most generous Wines by that name. The Poor indeed fast in the literal sense, because they can't help it, otherwise they might make a shift to relieve na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture well enough; and with such kind of devout Fasters every Church in the World is sufficiently stock'd, and ours amongst the rest, for you may find large Herds of'em every day in the <hi>Temple</hi>-Walks, the <hi>Irish</hi> Coffee-house, or the <hi>Piazza's</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi>

               <p>The truth on't is, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> you had done much better to have let this business of fasting and all that alone; because amongst Friends be it spoken, to charge us with that, which you your selves practise with such dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of management, looks as odd as it wou'd be for a protected Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mans man to rail at the priviledges of <hi>Alsatia</hi>; or for one of <hi>William Pen</hi>'s Herd to rail at the Five Bishops for not swearing to the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; or lastly, for one of the Heralds at Arms to quarrel with Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains and Poets for flattering of Families.—The other plea about Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is a thousand times more justifiable, and to say the truth, is the only proper Objection that a Dramatic Poet can make to the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Well I am glad however, that once in my life-time, I had the grace to light upon something which is proper (as you call it) and sutable to the occasion. I gad I utterly despair'd of meeting you in so good a humour, for hitherto you have us'd me like an Infidel, and denied every thing which I propos'd — And now, Gentlemen, let me see how you'l excuse the <hi>Dishabillé</hi> of your Church as to the point of Ceremonies. You cannot but be sensible how solemn and august the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in her devotion, but you I am sure can pretend no such matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Very right, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> we cannot, while the people of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion have nothing but Show and Ceremony in their Publick Worship, as in the Lives of their Saints they have nothing but sheer Miracle to entertain 'em. We have as much Ceremony I'm sure as decency requires, as much as is sufficient to hide the nakedness of Religion, and to use any more we think it as great a Solecism as it had been for <hi>Adam</hi> when he only design'd to cover his Nakedness, to have cloath'd himself all over with Leaves, like the Green man in the <hi>Distillers</hi> Coat of Arms.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis otherwise with you, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> for you have laid so much <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Paint upon the Matron, that 'tis scarce discernable of what complexion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65199:28"/>
she is, whether <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Pagan.</hi> We yield to you I confess in the Gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Chargeable Dress of Devotion, and the reason of it is very plain, for it has ever been the Talent of the wicked World to cultivate Superstition with more expence and cost, than the Truth it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you know most of the <hi>Limberhams</hi> of this end of the Town keep their Misses a great deal finer than their Wives.</p>
               <p>The Religious of the Three First Ages, tho it must be acknowledged that out of a Principle of Decency they admitted as much Ceremony as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Nature of Christianity, yet they never carryed the matter to such extremities as afterwards they were; they placed no Sanctity in the observation of them, and the ceremonies they retain'd wanted no Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Dictionaries, or <hi>Rationale's</hi> to explain them, they were obvious to the meanest apprehension, and entertained upon solid substantial grounds; such as the promotion of piety, and the like, and not for amusing the ignorance of the people, or for advancing the interests of an ambitious Priesthood. 'Tis indeed very true, that every Nation of the World tinctur'd the Christian Religion when it came into their hands, more or less, with the customs of their own Country. This is visible from the conduct of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who being some of the earliest receivers of Christianity, modell'd it in a short time according to their own fancies and inclinations; they were a free gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous drinking people, and accustom'd all along to make much of themselves in their Sacrifices, and Libations; and so when they made profession of a new Religion, which one would have thought might have restrain'd them from sueh extravagancies, yet they were resolved to introduce good eating, and good drinking, into their Churches; and so they did, till at last their entertainments grew so very scandalous, and irregular, that they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to lay them aside. On the other hand, the <hi>Italians,</hi> who had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of recommending their own Scheme of Religion, to this part of the <hi>Western</hi> World, by having the Imperial seat in their own Country, were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to Musick and Painting, and all that Pageantry that serves to entertain the senses. This sort of divertisement, failed not after some time to creep into the Church, and as we read, the Old <hi>Romans</hi> used upon some extraordinary occasions, to make whole Cities, nay, Provinces, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, free of their City; so their Successors, afterwards out of the same principle of Latitude and Generosity, made either all, or most of the Old Pagan Ceremonies, free of the Christian Religion. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in their <hi>Mosarabic</hi> service, which still continues in some Churches in <hi>Spain,</hi> made use of Horses, and Morris Dancing, which, as a certain Bishop pleaded for them at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> were very significant ceremonies; and so without question they were, for Horses might be excused out of that Verse in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> where it is said, <hi>He rides upon the Heavens as it were a Horse</hi>: And as for Dancing, besides that it is sufficiently countenanced from the <hi>Levites</hi> Dancing before the Ark, may very symbolically denote that our souls ought to observe the same agility in the peformance of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Duties, as our bodies do in that nimble exercise. If the <hi>Danes</hi> had had the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65199:29"/>
opportunity of prescribing a mode of Worship to the world, I make no question but Kettle-Drums had been by this time <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> and used in Churches, as well as the Ladies in <hi>America</hi> keep up the drinking of Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in their Churches, a custom which their Priests indulg'd them in long before their conversion; and which, as Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> informs us, they still continue.</p>
               <p>One that reads in <hi>Livie</hi> all that foolish superstition that was practis'd in Old <hi>Rome,</hi> and sees the same, if not a great deal grosser practis'd in the New, would certainly conclude that the Popes had transcrib'd all their Ceremonial out of him, so that it had been very well for you, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> if <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great could have totally destroy'd that Authors Works as he endeavour'd, for then, perhaps, you had either not practis'd that idle Pageantry which now you do, or else you might have passed for the Inventors, whereas we now very well know whence you had the Originals. In <hi>Athenaeus</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>lib</hi> 9.</note> the Receipt of making Holy Water, was by taking a Fire-brand from the Altar, and dipping it into the Water; you retain in your Church much such a sort of Water, but only differ in the making it; you pour in some Salt, and then exorcise the Devil out of both the Creatures before he was ever in them, and afterwards ascribe the Lord knows what efficacy to this rare composition; but for all that, I believe <hi>Athenaeus</hi>'s Holy Water, if a man would try it, is as good as yours to all intents and purposes, and confers a much Grace to such as discreetly use it. <hi>Durandus,</hi> and the <hi>Doway</hi>-Catechism, give several Pious Reasons for the Sacerdotal Tonsure.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Euterpe.</hi>
                  </note> Now <hi>Herodetus</hi> tells us, the very same custom was used by the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Priests, but they, as we are informed by him, did it not upon the score of Religion, but only to keep themselves from being Lousy; and no question on't, shaving in that hot Climate, where you see the fashion first began, was very commendable, and as I take it, requisite for the Laity as well as the Clergy; and this reason I look upon to be ten times more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and solid, than what your Divines give for the Tonsure, for it's the easiest thing in the World, to turn that into a Religious Observation which at first was only a Civil Custom, and then to give abundance of fine plausible Reasons for the doing of it. A man might easily trace the rest of your super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious practices, and tell you whence you had them, but that, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> would require too much time, and therefore I shall on purpose pass them by.</p>
               <p>That which vexes me most, is to see that the people of your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not content to do these foolish ridiculous things, but they must offer such reasons for them, as if they were of Divine Institution. <hi>Let him kiss me with the kiss of his Mouth,</hi> therefore the Priest must kiss the Altar. <hi>Thou shalt see my back parts,</hi> therefore the Priest must turn his back to the people. <hi>Wash me again,</hi> therefore the Priest must wash his hands twice. <hi>Put off thy Shooes for this place is holy.</hi> Therefore the Bishop at Mass must change his Shooes and Stockings. <hi>Christ is the Rock,</hi> and therefore the Altar must be of Stone; and therefore (say I) if such Reasons as these will hold Water, two Priests may play a Game at Cards upon the Altar, and do no harm at all but edify the Congregation; for the Ace may put them in mind of the Unity,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65199:29"/>
and the Tray of the Trinity, and the Knave of <hi>Iudas</hi>; and so on, till they have run through the whole History of the Christian Religion. And thus likewise they may play at Sword and Buckler, to signifie the perpetual scuffle between the Flesh and the Spirit, and what a fine Buckler Faith is; and thus instead of Incense, they may smoak a Pipe of Tobacco (which by the by, is less chargeable than Incense, and will serve much better to fright the Devil out of Church) to denote that sinful man is Dust and Ashes, and to represent the Conflagration to them. Thus they may play at Blind-mans Buff, to show how blind the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> are in their Natural State, and and thus they may do ten thousand such freaks as these, and yet not want very good reasons to support the practice of them, because there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World too fulsom, and gross for superstition to swallow, and for ignorance and interest to justifie.</p>
               <p>And now, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> we have run over all the objections you made against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and endeavoured to answer them. Now if you please to perform the second part of your promise, and give us your reasons why you settled in the Romish Communion, you'll extreamly oblige us.— But first, Boy, fill us a Dish of Tea apiece—</p>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Gentlemen, I shall give you my Reasons, tho I must tell you beforehand, I expect no other answers to them but Banter and Drollery, from persons of your complexion. But as I have already been a Confessor for my Religion, so (if my Destinies require it) I am ready to be a Martyr for it, as my Brother Poet <hi>Prudentius</hi> was before me.</p>

               <p>Oh, I understand your meaning, you have lost your Laureats and Historiographers place; whether you abdicated or forfeited it, is not now the question— Here, Boy, give Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> a Dish of Tea—and now, dear Confessor, prithee begin.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>To make short work of it then, being well satisfy'd of the truth of the Christian Religion; but—</p>

               <p>And was't thou so little <hi>Bays</hi>? But how can a man believe thee?

               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Why prethee Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I took thee for a man of more Philosophy and all that, than to be thus disturb'd for so small a matter. I thought you had been of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s opinion, that all creatures could not affront you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>I am indeed Sir, and thank you heartily for reminding me of him, so now I'll proceed —Being, as I told you, very well satisfied of the truth of the Christian Religion, but not so well satisfied that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was the true Church; I cast my eyes round about me, and discover'd in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> several particulars which no other Communion of Christians in the World cou'd pretend to, as Infallibility, Unity, Uiversality, Antiquity, and Clemency, and therefore here I settled. After some conversation and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65199:30"/>
I found here to be a Church of so severe a Discipline, so exampla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Devotion, so admirable an Unity, so majestic a Grandeur, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I may be pardon'd the expression, if I say she has been so far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching and corrupting, that she has even improv'd the Christian Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I'll say that for your Church, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> she has as good a hand at improving of hints, as ever any Church in the World had. As for example, the Rhetorical Apostrophes and Flourishes of the first Fathers to the <hi>Saints,</hi> she has improved into a solemn Invocation of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>The idle conjectures of some melancholly persons, about a middle place in the fourth Century, she has improv'd into a real Purgatory, peopled it with inhabitants, and by certain <hi>refrigerium</hi>'s so corrected the unwholesom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the air, that it wou'd be now nothing nigh so great a punishment to pass a winter there, as any where under the Line.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s salutation she has improved into a Prayer, the Real Presence into a Corporal one, the civil respect that was formerly given to the Relicks of Martyrs into a Religious Veneration of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Primitive Institution left us only two Sacraments, which she has since improv'd into seven. The first Missionaries of our Religion, bequeath'd but twelve Articles to be believ'd by us, and she has lately improved them into the jolly number of <hi>Falst aff</hi>'s <hi>Buckram-men,</hi> twenty four.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of one Mediator only that makes continual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us; and she has been so civil, as to furnish us with above forty thousand. Universal Tradition has handed down to us but twenty two books in the Old Testament, and she has added the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> and may in due time, if she summons another Council at <hi>Trent,</hi> introduce the <hi>Talmud</hi> into the <hi>Canon.</hi> Thus, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> your <hi>Catholick Church</hi> has improv'd the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> with a witness, made the Porch bigger than the Building it self, and renew'd the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes, where the void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er exceeded the Bill of fare.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Let us now turn the Tables, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> and see whether your Church continues still in this giving humour; it would certainly exhaust the treasure of any Church in the Universe, to be always issuing out largesses, and never retrenching her expence; and therefore it may be worth our while, to examine whether the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that has been guilty of so much profuseness one way, has not made as many retrenchments another way, to ballance her accounts. The Apostles left us the Scriptures in common, as a part of our property and inheritance, but she for certain pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential considerations, has thought to keep them under Lock and Key.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Primitive Institution left us the Sacrament under both kinds, <hi>Bibite ex hoc omnes</hi> is the word, but she has retrench'd us of the Cup. Our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion allows us a free possession of our Reason and Senses, but she obliges us to renounce them. The Scriptures only forbid Marriage within the degrees of Consanguinity, but she has forbid it within the degrees even of a spiritual Relation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>The Apostles left us at large exempt from the <hi>Iewish</hi> observations
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65199:30"/>
of clean and unclean, but she has introduced them again. <hi>Praestat nubere quam uri</hi> says you know who; no, by no means cries the <hi>Hind,</hi> let the Priests rather commit Incest, Sodomy, and Adultery, than be allow'd the liberty to Marry. Thus you see, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> what the Sea gives in one place, it takes away in another; and thus your Mother Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if she gives with the right hand, she takes away with the left, to make amends for her extraordinary charges, just as you see some Gentlemen, of this end of the Town, discard their Servants, and pinch their Families, to put themselves in a capacity of keeping a Glass-Coach, and a single pair of Horses.</p>

               <p>Well, Gentlemen, you have both of you run your selves out of breath with this discourse, but not a word all this while of Infallibility.</p>

               <p>Oh dear Confessor, I am obliged to you, for refreshing my memory as to that point, for I love Infallibility extreamly. I am clearly of thy opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, little <hi>Bays,</hi> that Infallibility, if it were any where to be found, were worth both Testaments, and cast all the Creeds in <hi>Christendom</hi> into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and now I'll tell you a Story. There was a certain Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, no matter for his Name, or where he lived, but he had read the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducismus Triumphatus,</hi> and was so mightily taken with Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Notion of a Vehicle, that he could not rest, till he had bought him a Vehicle, call'd in <hi>English</hi> a Calash; so he eat and drank in his Vehicle, and slept in his Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, and lay with his Wife in his Vehicle, and got an Heir Apparent upon her Virtuous body in his Vehicle; and Vehicle was his Name—a.</p>

               <p>Why, as foolish as it is, it shall serve for a Vehicle to another story, which is of a certain Tooth-drawer of my acquaintance, that lived in the <hi>Strand:</hi>

               <p>A very good jest i'saith; I protest, dear Rogue, thou begin'st to mend upon it —Why, this same fellow you must understand, had made a shift, out of some Church-yard or other, to pick up some two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Teeth, and hung them on a string before his Shop, to perswade the World that he was a man of great business in his Mystery of Tooth-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but all would not do, no body came nigh him, so he was ready to starve; and (as he has since told me) he was brought to those extremities, that he resolved one <hi>Friday,</hi> about eight in the morning, to draw his own Teeth out, and his Wives, and his little Daughter <hi>Bettys,</hi> and hang them on a string, because there was no occasion for them in his Family, he having not a bit of bread in his House to employ them. At last, (says a friend of his to whom he made known his condition) to him, "<hi>Iack,</hi> come, down with your Sign, and set up a new one, with this Inscription, <hi>Here lives an Operator in Teeth, that draws all manner of old Srumps, and rotten Gums, without any manner of pain, most Infallibly,</hi> and I'll engage, that within this fortnight, thou shalt have as much business, as thou canst turn thy hands to. He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65199:31"/>
the advice, and wou'd you believe it, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> got the greatest practice of any Touth-drawer in City or Country. In one Week, as I was credibly inform'd the last year, he drew the Teeth of a hundred and fifty Courtiers, besides, of half the Court of Aldermen, and my Lord Mayor's into the bargain; and he has so well batten'd upon his profession, that he's in a fair way now to keep his Vehicle.</p>

               <p>Nay, he that has the patience, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> to hear you tell a story, may defie, I think, all the plagues on this side Hell, as a declaiming Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentman, a Case-repealing Templar, a Quibling Justice of Peace, and an University Critick.

               <p>How, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> have you so soon forgot your Philosopher <hi>Socrates</hi>? Come, I see, I must remind you of him once an hour, at least, or you'll be apt to renounce his acquaintance. Why, prithee man, he's only in jest, and there's no harm in what he says; therefore let it not, to use Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi>'s expression, disturb the serene tranquillity of thy sagacious Soul.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>At your entreaty dear Mr. <hi>Eugenius</hi> I'le go on; and to let you see what dexterity I use in my <hi>Ergotering</hi> (pray take notice of that word, for 'tis of my own Coining) you shall see me prove the infallibility of our Church within the compass of two lines.
<q>
                     <l>Then granting, this Unerring guide we want,</l>
                     <l>That such there is you stand oblig'd to grant.</l>
                  </q>
Pray, Gentlemen, observe the force of this argument, for I protest to you 'tis exceeding pretty; an Infallible guide is very necessary to direct the Church here upon Earth, to set People in the right way, and show 'em what is Heresie and what not. This, I'm confident, no body that has any guts in his brains, will deny. Now from this very <hi>Principium</hi> because he's necessary, I conclude I gad, that there is such an Infallible guide.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>By your favour Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> I don't see that this conclusion of yours is very naturally deduced; for you know we want ten thousand things in the World, which yet are not be had for Love or Money; For instance, your Seamen that make long Voyages, want an unfailing Pilot to conduct 'em to their Port, want unfailing Brandy, and Bisket, and Water to serve 'em all the way, want unfailing breezes of Wind to carry 'em thither, and home again; and yet you will not say, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> that because they want all these unfailing circumstances, that therefore they are possess'd of them. I am sure the <hi>East-India</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65199:31"/>
Company wou'd allow you a better Pension than your late Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher Royals place amounted to, if you cou'd make your words good. And therefore that solid argament in your Canon-Law, <hi>Si Dominus Deus non fecisset Papam infallibilem, Dominus Deus non fuisset discretus.</hi> Which you Translate, <hi>he were else wanting to supply our needs</hi>: Will not pass with me, I'le assure you.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Eugenius</hi> your friend here begins again to be rude and uncivil, he denies plain demonstration, and therefore I have done with him. But I know you to be of a person of a better temper, and so I'le go on.
<q>
                     <l>It then remains that only Church can be</l>
                     <l>The Guide, that owns unfailing certainty.</l>
                  </q>
You see I prov'd before that a guide was necessary, that therefore we had one. Now I' gad, by another argument full as invincible, I Establish this undeniable truth, that the Church which owns such a guide is certainly possess'd of him.</p>

               <p>Is it the same thing then to pretend, and to have? This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, is a secret that I was never made acquainted with before; but now I intend to make the best use on't I can. This is therefore to acquaint all the Goldsmiths, Mercers, Vintners, and Linnen-Drapers in or about the City, and lines of Communication, that I <hi>Crites</hi> am infallibly possest of an Estate to the value of ten thousand Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> somewhere in the <hi>North,</hi> and that whosoever shall presume to deny me credit, for two or three thousand Pounds worth of Goods, is a rude person, and I'le throw him into Jail for his Pagan Infidelity—But Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I fancy it wou'd be worth a mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, to know where this same infallibility resides, to have a little conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with him, for I'de willingly be resolv'd in some such material points as these. Whether Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> had the better end of the staff <hi>de Quadraturâ Circuli.</hi> Whether is in the wrong, Mr. <hi>Flamsted,</hi> or Captain <hi>Blackborough</hi> about the Longitude of the Sea. Whether a North-East pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is to be found to <hi>China.</hi> Whether it is not rank Non-sence to prove those things, which you call unwritten Traditions out of the written word, and if so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether <hi>Bellarmine</hi> does not deserve to be toss'd in a Blanket, for citing twenty several places in Scripture to prove a Purgatory by. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Old Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi> of <hi>Putney</hi>'s <hi>Galatinus</hi> was ever Circumcis'd or no; and lastly what Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> meant by his five Theses of Church Government— Can you satisfie a friend to this particular.</p>

               <p>What where he Lodges? Oh most easily Sir, for you may either meet with him at home <hi>in Cathedra</hi> with a Urinal in one hand, and feeling the pulse of Madam Religion with the other; or else playing at Shuttle-Cock with his Domestics in the Conclave at <hi>Ave-Mary-lane,</hi> or lastly, if it be Term time, and a great deal of business stirring abroad, at the Sign of a General Council near <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi>

               <p>But pray Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> what is the reason that this same infallibility shifts his Lodgings so often, for I am afraid he comes as dissonestly by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65199:32"/>
what he pretends to, as the French King by his acquisitions upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> — Methinks now if it had been my good fortune to have stumbled upon this extraordinary prize, this Unerring <hi>Elixir vitae,</hi> I shou'd have taken the same Methods that your City-quacks, and Captains of Ships, and Casters of Nativities use, and certify'd the World in Bills Printed for that purpose, that I live next door to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s-<hi>Head</hi> over against the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and am to be spoke with, at my Lodgings every Morning from Seven till Eleven, and in the Afternoon from Two till Six, that the poor shou'd have Advice for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that if I had any occasions to stir abroad, I wou'd certainly leave word with my Nephew <hi>Don Marco Ottoboni,</hi> what Tavern, or Coffee-House I was gone to, with this <hi>Latin</hi> Sentence in the bottom of the Paper, <hi>Nulla no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia ut experientia.</hi>— But before we part with this Subject, one word more, and then I have done: Suppose Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Bays,</hi> any person, from the difficulty of finding out this infallible judge, shou'd be apt to imagin he's no where to be met with, but in the Isle of <hi>Pines</hi> or so, how wou'd you satisfie him pray.</p>

               <p>Only with half a dozen lines out of my Poem, Sir, and then let me see, whether this scruple wou'd ever offer to stare him in the Face any more.

Shew him but these lines, and the fine simile about Sight, that whether it be <hi>per emissionem,</hi> or (as some hold) <hi>per receptionem specierum,</hi> yet that still no body denys there's such a thing as Sight; show him but these lines, I say, and (if you'l give me leave to quibble upon my own words) I'le lay ten to one, that he presently finds an Emission of his Scruple, and the reception of the truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>That is as much as to say, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> because your own Doctors are not yet agreed, wherein the substance of the Mass consists, for some of 'em place it in the Act of Consecration, others make Consecration and Sumption together the Essence of it, and some again stand up for Fraction; shall a grim Logician thence conclude, that your Doctors believe there's no Sacrifice at all?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>

               <p>But, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> hold a little I pray; I'de desire you not to lay too great a stress upon this Argument, for I am afraid it will scarce do the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The circumstance of place is in my opinion full as necessary to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined as the circumstance of time, and yet a learned Cusuist of your Church, <hi>Sirmondus</hi> by name, and one of the stiffest maintainers of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Doctrine of <hi>Attrition,</hi> concludes that a man is not obliged to love God at all, because the Schoolmen have not decided the question, when, and how often we were to love him. So then, say I, by the same way of reasoning, a man is not oblig'd to believe, there's any such thing as Infallibility in your Church, since your Doctors have not as yet agreed where to settle it, no
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65199:32"/>
more than the Heathens knew where to settle their <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never will, between this and the Resurrection.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Well, you have prettily bandied the Doctrine of Infallibility between you both, but I can easily forgive you for it, because to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge 'tis the severest Enemy you of the Reformation have; what can you except now to the Unity, Antiquity, and Universality of our Church?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Why I thought, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> we had exchanged some words about the Unity of your Church a little while ago, when you were pleas'd to say, that the Differences and Divisions amongst us, were one reason for your lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Communion: So that there needs nothing to be said to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular here, but only this, that altho you have as many divisions in your Schoolmen, and several Orders as we have; yet as it has always been the confess'd Talent of the <hi>Children of Darkness, to be wiser in their Generation than the Children of Light,</hi> so your Divines for example, have had the discretion not to pursue their Controversies, to any great Extremities, for fear of breaking in peices, and dissolving their Ecclesiastical Kingdom. This peice of Policy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as our Saviour tells us, <hi>The Devils themselves understand and practise,</hi> and then indeed it is no wonder to find it in the Conclave, for people naturally write after the Copy that is set before them. I cou'd wish our Dissenters would consider this, for in some cases you know, <hi>Fas est, &amp; ab Hoste doceri.</hi> The Antiquity of your Church has been already considered in the Preface, and as for your pretences of Universality I shall return you no answer, but send you to the common Maps for your farther information.</p>

               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Unless I am mistaken, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> there is another Reason still behind, which helped to determine you in your choice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, but I have clearly forgot the name of it, and yet to the best of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I never met it amongst the Fifteen Marks which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives of the True Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>That may be Sir, and yet 'tis as unquestionably true as any of the rest. I mean the Clemency of our Church, and hope your Dissenters found by comfortable experience, that the Doctrine of Persecution is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Article of our Faith.

               <p>Because we are all of us in a merry humour now, I'le tell you. If ever you had the curiosity to read over the Church-history of <hi>Scotland,</hi> you know there happen'd a famous Dispute there whether the <hi>Lords-prayer</hi> might be said to any of the Saints, and how it was resolved. Now those very distinctions which were used to qualifie the <hi>Lord's-prayer</hi> for the use of the Saints, will serve for this business of the Toleration. It was meant then <hi>Formaliter,</hi> to our party, to the other Herd of Dissenters <hi>materialiter. Ultimate</hi> to us, <hi>non ultimate</hi> to them; <hi>principaliter</hi> to us, <hi>minus principaliter</hi> to them; to us <hi>prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> to them <hi>secundario; capiendo stricte</hi> to us, <hi>capiendo large</hi> to them. In short, as the Schoolmen use to distinguish in the case of Image-worship, it was meant <hi>Terminative</hi> to us the <hi>Prototypes,</hi> but only <hi>relative</hi> to the Dissenters, our Images.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Why this was honestly done, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to explain your meaning. And truly now I think on't, we ought to thank <hi>Lovis le Grard</hi> for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conduct which he took at home, or else, for as much as I know, the trick had succeeded. The two Kings, I don't question, were endeavouring to propagate their Religion, but they used different methods, and so between 'em they acted the story of <hi>Penelope,</hi> what the one did in the day, the other undid in the night. After all, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to shut our hands of this Religious Discourse, Popery in <hi>England</hi> is like <hi>Sysiphus</hi>'s Stone, the Fathers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, may perhaps rowl it up to the top of the Hill, but then it will tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble down of its own accord, and help to break the bones of those that rowl'd it up.</p>

               <p>Well, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I find our Conference here is likely to meet with no better success, than other conferences of the like nature; where after a great deal of pother and noise, to no purpose at all, both Parties continue as stiff and unrelenting as at the first, and keep their old stations. — So if you please we'l turn the Tables, and discourse of something else that will be more agreeable, and edifying.</p>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart, Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> propose what you will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I have often considered with my self, how ticklish a thing it is for a man that has acquir'd a vast stock of Reputation, as you have done, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to keep it long in his hands; the World, you know, is so very peevish and ill-natur'd, that—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>And what of all that, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>That in my opinion, 'tis as difficult for any person to maintain his Reputation still about him, as for a very pretty Lady, with a very pretty Fortune, in this lewd and wicked Town, to keep her Maiden-head till fifteen. Now 'tis otherwise with you, honest Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> for though you have lived a considerable time amongst us here, yet you don't decline at all in your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; I mean as a Poet, not as a Casuist. I' faith, dear friend of mine, we must still acknowledge thee the only Oracle for Wit and Poetry about the City.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Thank you for that, Sir. Why, the business, in short, is thus— if the Spirit of Poetry fails me, I betake my self to Prose, and if that does not succeed, to Poetry again. If things of my own inventing cloy the World, then Translating comes in play; if Translating proves wearisome, why then I invent some new business of my own, and the work's done. If honest Bawdry and Mirth wont take, then a little touch of Religion, or Politicks, or Controversie, makes me amends; and if these don't relish (as the Devil take them they seldom do) then commend me to a fine stroke or two of Bawdry, to quicken the appetite of the Age. If Comedy brings me in no profit, why then Tragedy look to thy self; and so on <hi>Vice Versa</hi> to the end of the chapter.</p>

               <p>Sometimes Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> when I find the young Critics of the Town for want of other employment, begin to make busie with any of my own works at home, what do I to dissipate all these ill humours, but immediately proclaim a Miscellany <hi>Crusade,</hi> that is, do you observe me Gentlemen, I encourage all the forward <hi>Beaux</hi> of the Nation, to take a voyage as far as <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> to retreive some Captive province of Poetry out of the hands of <hi>Infidel-Invaders,</hi> where besides the reputation which a person certainly gets, by being the leading Card of all the Company, that list themselves for such an adventure, I am sure of carrying away all the profit of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to my self.</p>

               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>That was none of my fault Sir. Sometimes when I find my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue kept back, which the magnificence of former Kings thought fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon my place, I send a consecrated Rose, that is a great of very fulsome flattery I gad, to some great man or other about the Court, to procure my <hi>Apollo</hi>'s pence, my ancient income for me: Or if this method fails, I take the next opportunity I have, to expose those People in a Preface <note n="*" place="margin">Preface to Marriage Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode.</note> 
                  <hi>Who have the liberality of Kings in their disposing, and who, dishonouring the bounty of their master, suffer such to be in necessity, who endeavour at least to please him.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>You'l scarce have any occasion now, Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> to solicit for your <hi>Apollo</hi>'s pence again, since Mr. <hi>Shadwell</hi> has got both them, and your Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel from you. But pray proceed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Sometimes for an extraordinary consideration, I give leave to some noble Baronet to father one of my Plays, and afterwards when I have serv'd my turn, and got all I can out of him, I make bold to take the Brat home again, as I did my <hi>Indian</hi> Queen.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Any more of 'em? why I am an inexhaustible fountain; as suppose or instance, a Play meets with the general approbation of the World, and the Ladies clap it, and the men they admire it, and so forth, why what do I, that I may seem better-sighted in these matters then the rest of mankind, but put the Play in the Poetic Inquisition, and quarrel with the Author up to the Elbows, I gad, for introducing innovations upon the Theatre, such as making his Ghosts, and Angels in the Clouds, speak better sense, than can be expected from persons of their condition, or else for not equipping his Scene with men enough, and divesting the Stage of that necessary grandeur and ceremony, which is requisite to support it—</p>

               <p>At other times when a Play has happen'd to be damned at the Theatre, to see how the Quick-Silver varies in this Weather-glass of mine, I presently take up the Cudgels for the Author (not that I am any more concerned at his or any other bodies miscarriage, than one of your City Protestants wou'd be, if the French King should think fit in his Royal Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to hang or drown himself) but only to magnifie my own Talent, and pretend to better judgment in these affairs than any body besides.

               <p>Sometimes Gentlemen when the living Poets are too many for me, I betake my self to the protection of the Dead; talk of Old Decrees, and Ancient Constitutions, and pretend that all those passages which are imputed to me for faults, are to be found in venerable Antiquity, as in the case of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65199:35"/>
                  <hi>Almanzor,</hi> who, as I affirm'd, was a Gentleman as well bred and born, and of as peaceable and civil a deportment as <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Achilles.</hi> But if the Scene chances to be alter'd, and some prying Hereticks in Poetry give out that the Ancients are of their opinion, and that I have misunderstood, mispresented 'em, and all that, have made false quotations, and worse deductions, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fall foul upon the Old writers, and positively maintain that there's scarce one of 'em in a hundred who was master of a refined Genius; and that it is the unquestionable prerogative of Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> as he is <hi>Apollo</hi>'s high Pontiff, to reverse former orders, and substitute what new Articles in Poetry he thinks convenient.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>Ay Sir, I have a certain profound stratagem still behind, my <hi>Sacra Anchora</hi> I call it, which is only to be made use of upon extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, and which I was never forced to employ but once in my time, and is as follows. When any young Author has been so fortunate in his first undertaking, as to win himself the applause of all the World, so that 'tis impossible for one to ruin his reputation, without running the hazard of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Throat cut by all sort of company, I am as forward as the best of 'em all to commend his ingenuity, to extol his parts, and promise him a Copy of Verses before his Book, if he honours the World with a second Edition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Very good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>At the same time I privately feel his Pulse, and examine the nature, and inclination of the Beast. If he chances to be a little Saturnine like my self, I set him upon a gay undertaking, where 'tis the Devil and all of ill luck if he does not Ship-wrack all his former credit. But if he proves a man of a brisk and jolly temper, I perswade him of all loves to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of his abilities upon some serious solemn subject, tell him if he ever expects to be saved he must out of hand do justice to the <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Canticles,</hi> which work he's as uncapable to manage I gad, as little <hi>David</hi> was to fight in <hi>Sauls</hi> Armour. Thus Gentlemen by engaging the Author in a Province, where he has not stock enough to carry on the Plantation, I never fail one way or other to compass my designs, and at long run to defeat my competitor.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crites.</speaker>
               <p>Why Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> this is like enjoyning a Painter, that has a good fancy at drawing of <hi>Saracens</hi> Heads, and <hi>Grotesque</hi> Figures only, to draw you a <hi>Venus</hi> or an <hi>Adonis,</hi> where he must certainly miscarry. Now I am apt to fancy you trepann'd the honest Translator of <hi>Lucretius</hi> with this profound piece of policy, come confess the truth man. Did you not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>You cou'd not have guess'd better Mr. <hi>Crites,</hi> if you had div'd into my <hi>Diaphragma</hi> for the secret.

Now to undermine and ruin him to all intents and purposes I took these measures. I flatter, hugg, and caress him like an <hi>Achitophel</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:65199:36"/>
as I was, after the strangest manner imaginable, profest all the respects and friendship in the world for him; tell him, that providence had certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd him for working Miracles in Poetry; and that I had some ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies by me at home, which declared him to be the very person that was to deliver the immortal writers of former ages out of that <hi>Algerin</hi> captivity they had so long labour'd under —</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bays.</speaker>
               <p>That if by his mighty <hi>Feat</hi> he cou'd form those <hi>Irish</hi> Atoms of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> into so regular, and well disciplin'd an Army, cou'd raise such harmony out of a dull unmusical Philosopher, how glorious and exalted wou'd his attempts be upon <hi>Horace</hi>; or what might we not expect from so advantageous, so promising an undertaking. And so Gentlemen with the help of a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense and flattery, I so cajol'd this <hi>AEsops</hi> Crow, that he presently dropt his <hi>Epicurean</hi> Cheese out of his Mouth, to sing one of his unmusical ill-turn'd Odes of <hi>Horace.</hi> I perswaded this Welch Courser to leave his ragged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible precipices, where there was no coming after him, to try his strength and feet upon good plain Carpet ground, where an English Vinegar-horse I knew wou'd easily distance him.</p>

The drift of my meaning in disswading him from the Town, and advising him to continue still in the University, was to keep him at as great a distance as I cou'd, lest he should set up for himself here in the City, and spoil my own Trade; and I never car'd what encouragement he found at <hi>Avignon,</hi> as long as I was the chief man at <hi>Rome</hi>; for let me tell you by the by, <hi>Parnassus</hi> tho they say it has two tops, yet I am confident it will but just maintain one Monarch, or one incumbent at a time. In disswading him from Matrimony, I pretended to have a great concern for the young Man's welfare, and cunningly insinuated, that it was not convenient for the health of his body to be drain'd and suck'd by two insatiable Leeches at a time, a Muse, and a Wife.</p>

You know Gentlemen how I have treated him in my Essay upon Dramatic Poetry, a thousand times worse I gad then any of his Presbyterian friends.

                     <l>The Gen'rous Eagle (so his Stars ordain)</l>
                     <l>Chases th' affrighted Lyon from the Plain.</l>
                     <l>Their Gen'ral gone, the rest like Lightning fly,</l>
                     <l>A cheap, unfighting Herd, not worth the Victory.</l>
                     <l>And now the Birds with eager haste pursue</l>
                     <l>Through lanes, and devious tracts the scatter'd Crew.</l>
                     <l>Amongst the rest, beset with dangers round,</l>
                     <l>The trembling Bat was in a Cellar found.</l>
                     <l>'Tis pitty, Fame ne're chronicled his Taker,</l>
                     <l>But all Records agree they found him in <hi>Long-acre</hi>;</l>
                     <l>Pearcht on a Pole they brought him to the Bar,</l>
                     <l>Where the full House sate talking of the War:</l>
                     <l>Straight at the sight a various noise began,</l>
                     <l>Which through the Spacious Hall, and neighb'ring Lobby ran.</l>
                     <l>Each Member in the public mirth concurr'd,</l>
                     <l>And droll'd upon the poor Apostatizing Bird.</l>
                     <l>First Parrot <hi>S-ttle</hi> open'd wide his Throat,</l>
                     <l>Next Cuckow <hi>Ph-lips,</hi> always in a note;</l>
                     <l>And Peacock <hi>Ch-tw-d</hi> of the Clergy kind,</l>
                     <l>But his Poetic Feet disgrac'd the Train behind.</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Cr-ch</hi> and <hi>N-rris,</hi> Kites of high renown,</l>
                     <l>And Turkey <hi>Lee</hi> by his large Gizzard known:</l>
                     <l>Nay, to enhance the hardship of his woes,</l>
                     <l>Owl <hi>D-rfy</hi> clapt his Wings, and hooted in the close.</l>
                     <l>When now their raillery began to spare,</l>
                     <l>(And faith 'twas too too much for one poor Bird to bear.)</l>
                     <l>The Eagle order'd silence in the Room,</l>
                     <l>And thus aloud pronounc'd the shiv'ring Lubbers doom.</l>
                     <l>Beast of a Bird! thus to desert thy Friends,</l>
                     <l>And joyn the Common Foe for base ungen'rous ends,</l>
                     <l>What punishment can suit so black a Crime?</l>
                     <l>Hear then, and stand accurs'd to all succeeding time.</l>
                     <l>From all our Diets be thou first expell'd,</l>
                     <l>Or those in silent Groves, or those on Steeples held.</l>
                     <l>When our gay Tribes in youthful pomp appear,</l>
                     <l>To join in Nuptial Bands, and meet the smiling year.</l>
                     <l>Nay more, to make thee mortifie and grieve,</l>
                     <l>To Buzzard <hi>Sh-dw-ll</hi> we thy places give.</l>

               <p>I hope Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> I have now made you amends for your Ode, I don't question but you like it, because it's writ in your own stile. Will you stay now, and hear the Application of the Fable?</p>

               <p>No I gad, Sir, I thank you heartily; I am not such a Bat neither as you take me for: What not understand the Fable without the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? 'Tis plain enough without one, and the Author may chance to hear more from me in a short time. No, Sir, I'le have none of your Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and so Good Night.</p>
