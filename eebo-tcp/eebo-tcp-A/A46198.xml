            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS we are highly sensible of the many and great inconveniences, which His Majesties good Subjects in this Kingdome are too frequently brought under by the multitude of causeless present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Indictments, which are usually prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Assizes and Sessions, rather out of malice or revenge than for the furtherance of justice; as also by the immoderate exaction of Fees in Clerks of the Crown, Clerks of the peace, Sheriffs and Gaolers, which do not onely disturb the peace and quiet of this Kingdome by the continual creating of animosities, and vexations, but do also very much impoverish and disable the Subjects by exposing them to unnecessary and excessive charges. For the preventing and remedying of which mischiefs, we have thought fit, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly do by this our Proclamation direct and require His Majesties Judges in their respective Circuits, and also His Majesties justices of peace in their respective Counties, that they do take care at the respective Assizes and Sessions hereafter to be held, that no Grand jury shall offer, nor any Clerk of the Crown, or Clerk of the peace shall receive any indictment, except for Felony, or Treason, or any presentment hereafter to be made, without the name of the prosecutor, with the addition of his quality and place of abode thereunto annexed, to the end that if upon tryal it shall appeare to the Court, that the said indictment or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment was malicious, the said prosecutor may be punished according to Law
<pb facs="tcp:104946:2"/>
for such prosecution. And whereas the ascertaining and publishing of the Fees of the above named Officers may tend much to the ease and quiet of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Subjects, and to the preventing of all undue exactions upon them; We have thought fit herewith to publish the establishment made of Fees due to the said Officers in the time of the Lord Uice-count <hi>Grandisons</hi> Government in this Kingdome and hereunder mentioned, which Establishment We do strictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be observed, and that the same be affixed in some publick place at every Assizes and quarter Sessions, and that no Clerke of the Crown, Clerke of the peace, Sheriff or Gaoler under the pain and penalty of extortion do take other, or greater Fees than are therein Established, except onely in such cases, where by any Statute other Fees are allowed to the said Officers; And whereas there hath been a Fee of Ten shillings usually taken by His Majesties Justices of Assize, upon the tender of any Travers to such Indictments or Presentments as have been found before them, which doth occasion an increase of charge to His Majesties Subjects, who are often found innocent upon their Tryals, and doth hinder many persons from traversing such Indictments and Presentments as are causelesly prosecuted against them, the charge of being acquitted upon such tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses being commonly so great, that it is usually more easy to submit to a small fine for such offences, whereof they are really not guilty, than to traverse such Indictments; And we having conferred with His Majesties Judges herein, they have freely and unanimously offered for the further ease of His Majesties Subjects to remit the said Fee of Ten shillings, which hath been formerly taken by them upon the tendering of such traverses, whereof we have thought fit to give this publick notice to all persons, who shall be hereafter concerned therein.</p>
            <p>And whereas we are informed that the Offices of Clerke of the Crown, and Clerke of the peace are often let to Farme in several Counties of this Kingdome, which is not onely illegal, but also very inconvenient, and by reason thereof the execution of the said offices is often committed to insufficient persons, Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Presentments are multiplyed, and undue Fees are exacted, We have thought fit hereby to require His Majesties Judges of Assize, and Justices of the peace of the respective Counties of this Kingdome to take care, that none of the said offices be let to farme, or executed by any persons, who do farme the same, but that the same be executed either by the respective Patentees of the said Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or by such able and sufficient sworne Deputies, as shall be approved and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of by the said judges and justices. And in all cases where it shall appear to the said judges or justices, that any Indictments or Presentments are maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously prosecuted before them, they are hereby required to proceed with all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that the law will admit against such prosecutors, and also to certifie unto Us the names of such persons, who shall so malitiously prosecute any such Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Indictments, to the end they may be proceeded against and punished, as disturbers of the publick peace of this Kingdome; And the said judges and justices are also from time to time to certifie unto Us the names of such Clerks of the Crown, and Clerks of the Peace, as shall continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this our Proclamation to let to Farme their said Offices, or shall neglect or refuse to execute their said Offices themselves, or by such able and sufficient Deputies, as by the said Judges and Justices shall be approved and allowed of: And His Majesties Judges of Assize in the several Counties of their respective Circuits, are to cause this Proclamation and the said Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fees, to be openly read in the hearing of the Countrey at the publick Assizes in every County, and the justices of the Peace in every County are to do the like at the Quarter-Sessions.</p>
