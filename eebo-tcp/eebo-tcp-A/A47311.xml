            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE
Right Honourable
WILLIAM Lord DIGBY,
BARON DIGBY
OF
Geashil in Ireland.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I Preach'd this Sermon to my
own Parish, I had no Design to
make it more publick. But since
your Lordship desires it should come
abroad, I readily submit to it. For, besides the just
and great Regard I have to your Lordship's Request,
I would not be wanting in any thing, that may serve,
though in a very small measure, to do Honour to that
most dear, and exemplary Saint, your deceased Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I am conscious that the Draught I have made
of him is very imperfect: but such as it is, it sets
out many things most worthy to be imitated, which
may render it no lost Labour to the World. To do Right
indeed to the Subject, I should speak in Proportion to
what he deserved: but to do service among those that
survive, the saying any thing almost of him is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
since it must needs be worth Mens while to hear
<pb facs="tcp:95989:3"/>
any Particulars remarqued upon, where almost all are
excellent. And so long as his Character may benefit
others, were he on Earth again, he, whose stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
care it was to do good, and shun the praise of it,
would readily pardon all the well-meant Errors and
Defects of the Compiler, which make it wanting to
his own Honour. And I am well assured your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
who succeeds him in his Virtues, as well as in his
Estate and Honour, will do so too.</p>
            <p>In particular, my Lord, I hope your Lordship will
reap Benefit by these Papers. For to your own
Stock of an excellent good Nature, and Religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
you have made the discreet Choice of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Example to improve both, and have already tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
it, in some choice and commendable Methods.
God grant your Lordship a lasting Continuance, and
daily increase of those Noble Endowments, which make
you Brothers in Virtue as well as in Blood, that you
may not only equal, but exceed him in all those Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Pious Qualities, which set him out for a rare
Pattern, and injoy a much longer Life, wherein to
display, and do good to the World with them. This,
my Lord, is, and always must be the most hearty
Prayer of,</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Your Lordship's
in most Affectionate
Duty and Service,

SERMON
Preached at
Coles-Hill in Warwickshire,
<date>January 24. 1685.</date>
On occasion of the DEATH
OF THE
Right Honourable
SIMON Lord DIGBY,
On Heb. 6. 12.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q type="sub">That ye be not slothful, but followers of them, who
through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ONE of the best Encouragements to act,
especially in difficult and perilous Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
is other Mens Examples. And
the Argument, which is like to have
most force, and prevail most in Examples,
is their good Events, when we see others, under the
same Disadvantages and Hardships we suffer, to injoy
the same Divine Aids whereon we rest, and meet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95989:4"/>
at last with the same success which we hope for. And
this Argument the Apostle uses in this place, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Converts, to Constancy and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
in the Faith. <hi>We desire,</hi> says he, <hi>that</hi> as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>ye have shown love towards God's Name</hi> in a free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion, and <hi>ministred to the Saints,</hi> who
suffer for him, (thereby openly owning and avowing
both him and them) so <hi>ye would</hi> still continue to <hi>shew
the same diligence to the full assurance of</hi> your <hi>Hope unto
the end. That ye be not slothful</hi> and<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> faint-hearted,
like those cowardly Apostates mentioned v. 6. whose
case is desperate, <hi>but followers of them, who through
Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which he particularly notes in these Examples,
is their <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> Their <hi>Faith,</hi> that is their
<hi>firm trust in God, and belief of his Promises, relying on
his Word under all Tryals.</hi> And their <hi>Patience,</hi> that is,
their <hi>perseverance in this Trust and expectation under all
Delays, and constant adherence to him under all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
These <hi>two</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> singles out from among
many others, because they particularly serve his
Purpofe, which is to press <hi>Perseverance in the Faith,</hi>
neither totally abjuring and <hi>falling off from Christ,</hi> as
some had done v. 6; nor <hi>forsaking the Publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>
in perilous Times as<note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 10. 25.</note> others did, which would
shortly end in it: which Perseverance is best secured
by these two Virtues. But good Examples give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of many other Virtues wherein they are to be
followed; and are equally serviceable to all other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as well as these: and in that latitude I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them in the ensuing Discourse.</p>
            <p>This Text excites the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to <hi>diligence in good
Works,</hi> from the Examples of deceased Saints, who
are now reaping the Reward of all their former Pains,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95989:4"/>
and <hi>inherit the Promises.</hi> And in treating on it, I shall</p>
            <p>1. Show what use we are to make of Pious Mens
Examples.</p>
            <p>2. Propose one to your imitation.</p>
            <p>1. I shall show what use we are to make of Pious Mens
Examples.</p>
            <p>A good Example is both a very <hi>instructive,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging</hi>
thing. And the Examples of <hi>deceased Saints,</hi>
have more Power and Efficacy than the Examples
of the <hi>living.</hi> For nothing gives us so just an Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of any Excellencies, as the loss of them. And
when once good Men are gone, there is no more
Emulation, to make those that survive detract from
what was imitable and praise-worthy in them. And
after their Deaths, we look upon them not only as
<hi>Good,</hi> but as <hi>Blessed,</hi> and so are apt to be influenced
the more by their Virtues, because of our Veneration
for their Persons and Memories. And these the <hi>Apostle</hi>
here proposes, directing us to look up to those, who
are now no longer Candidates and Expectants, but
<hi>inherit the Promises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the use we are to make of their Examples, is
both for a <hi>Lesson to direct and teach,</hi> and also for a
<hi>Motive to hearten and excite us to an imitation of their
Virtues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>We must use the Examples of Good Men for a Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to direct and guide us in the way of Goodness.</hi>
Examples are more plainly instructive than Precepts.
For Precepts prescribe Virtue in general Terms, which
afterwards needs farther Reasoning to supply Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and accommodate them to particular Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
But Examples shew it in particular instances,
attired in all its various Forms and Circumstances,
and fitted for Practice; so that when they are in sight,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95989:5"/>
we have nothing left to do, but to follow what we see
before us. And this use our <hi>Saviour</hi> directs us to make
of <hi>his Example,</hi> to look upon his <hi>Life</hi> as a <hi>Sermon,</hi> and
make his Practice our instruction. <hi>Learn of me, for
I am meek and lowly</hi> Matt. 11. 29.</p>
            <p>But in this use, of <hi>learning our duty from Good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi>
we must take care to <hi>chuse such acts of Good Men
for our imitation, as had a law of God to direct them.</hi> Good
Mens examples are no warranty to our Consciences,
when they are alone. They make our duty plainer by
illustrating Gods Laws; so that they help our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of what is good, when there is a Law with
them. But they do not make any thing a duty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Law, and much less can they authorise any action
which is against a Law of God: so that we must not
think it enough to justify us in any action, that any
good Men have done the same.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>We may not imitate all the Actions of Good Men;</hi>
because no Men are perfectly good in this World, but
have a mixture of Good and Evil in them. They have
not only Virtues to be followed, but over-sights and
Humane Passions to be pityed and avoided. And these
being faults and blemishes in them, can give no secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in following them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>We may not imitate all such acts of theirs, as the
Scripture recites without blaming.</hi> Such is <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Rebekkah</hi>'s fraud, in making <hi>blind Isaac</hi> go out of his
way, and <hi>Stealing away Esau's blessing. Gen.</hi> 27. And
<hi>Holy David</hi>'s putting his friend <hi>Jonathan,</hi> to excuse his
not attending upon <hi>Saul</hi> at the Feast of the <hi>New Moon,</hi>
by making a feign'd Story for him, 1. Sam. 20, 5, 6.
And by such another fiction getting the <hi>Shew-bread</hi> and
<hi>Goliah's</hi> Sword from <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> which occasioned the
death of <hi>fourscore</hi> and <hi>five of the Priests,</hi> and of <hi>all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95989:5"/>
inhabitants, not only Men,</hi> but also <hi>Women and Children
in the City of Nob.</hi> 1. Sam. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. &amp;c. 22 These, with
other such like actions of Good Men, the Scripture
relates by way of bare History and Narrative, without
making descants and reflections, or passing any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
on them. But the silence of the Holy Pen-men in
this Point, is no sign of their Approbation. God has
plainly enough laid down the Rules, whereby Men
ought to act in these cases, and from which we are to
judge of their actions. And therefore having related the
facts which were done, they leave others to bring them
to the Rules, and see whether they are according to
them. When any Good mans action then is related in
Scripture, 'tis no sufficient justification of it to say it
is <hi>not censured,</hi> unless it can be shewn moreover that it
is <hi>not lyable to censure;</hi> that is, that it is against no Law
of God, which both the Holy Pen-men and we are to
censure and judge of all Actions by.</p>
            <p>Nay further,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>We may not imitate all such Actions, as we find justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and commended in the Scriptures.</hi> The Reason of this
is, because the Scriptures commend, not only purely
virtuous, but also mixt actions, which are only justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
on some accounts, but culpable on others. Thus
the <hi>Lord</hi> in the <hi>Parable</hi> doth by his <hi>needy Steward,</hi> who
at his going off provides for his future subsistence
among his Lords Tenants, by a false Stating of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
accounts: <hi>he commended the unjust Steward that he
had done wisely. Luk.</hi> 16. 8. Where, though the Lord
commends his fore-sight, that he acted Providently,
yet, had he design'd to speak to it, he would as much
have blamed his fraud and dishonesty. And thus our
Saviour doth by <hi>David,</hi> when he speaks of his <hi>eating the
Shew-bread:</hi> he justifies his <hi>eating of it,</hi> though it were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95989:6"/>
               <hi>appropriated to the Priests,</hi> and was <hi>Holy,</hi> because all
that was superseded by his Hunger and necessity. <hi>Matt.
12.</hi> 3, 4. But although he there maintains his <hi>eating
of the Holy Bread,</hi> yet are we not thence to conclude
he would also have defended that falshood whereby he
procured it. 1 Sam. 21. 2. Thus <hi>St. Paul,</hi> among
his other <hi>Worthies,</hi> praises <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Samson,</hi> and
<hi>Jephtha, Heb. 11. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> But that which he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to imitation among us from their Practice, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their <hi>faith,</hi> not their Hostilities and <hi>Warlike invasions.</hi>
And the like judgment we may reasonably pass upon
the Commendation given to the <hi>Egyptian Midwives,</hi>
who with their Pious Charity in saving the lives of poor
Innocents, joyn'd falshood to their own Prince, to
whom, when they reply'd any thing at all, they ought
not to have given a false answer in their examinations.
<hi>Therefore,</hi> says <hi>Moses, God dealt well with the Midwives,
and made them Houses,</hi> thereby not approving their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity,
but only rewarding their Pious Charity. <hi>Exod.
1.</hi> v. 16. to v. 22. In these, and the like instances,
when the Good part in a mixt action is the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
as in the case of the Midwives; or when the ill
part happen'd through a pityable fear, and great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it, as in the case both of them, and <hi>David:</hi> God,
who is much more prone to approve than to spy faults,
and had rather observe what may make for us, than
what would make against us, is pleased oft-times to take
notice of the virtues of his servants, which are to their
Praise, without mentioning the defects intermixt,
which would be to their disparagement. But because
in these mixt actions God commends what he likes, we
must not think that he also approves what his Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
and punishes. The ill part of good mens Actions,
their faults and defects, are no ground of his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95989:6"/>
and so can give no warranty for our imitation
of them.</p>
            <p>One example, indeed, there is, which is perfectly
without sin, and that is the example of our <hi>Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
who did no sin, neither was guile found in his Mouth.</hi>
1 Pet. 2. 22. But although we are secure, that in his
example nothing justly deserv'd blame, yet must we
not draw even it as a Rule in all Points for our imitation.
For he was a Person of a most peculiar office and stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and many things which he did were in virtue of
that, which are not compatible to us that follow him.
He<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>fasted forty days and forty nights,</hi> at his entrance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the office of being a Law-giver to the Church, as
<note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 34. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Moses</hi> had done before him. He <hi>whipt the buyers and
sellers out of the Temple, and overthrew the Tables of the
Mony Changers, without any visible</hi> authority of a publick
Character or warrant from the Magistrate, but only as
he was the<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 2. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Son of God,</hi> and because the <hi>Spirit of Zele</hi>
was upon him. He<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> 
               <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>openly reproved the Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> those great Rules among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
call'd <hi>King Herod</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 13. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Fox,</hi> by virtue of his <hi>Prophetical</hi>
Commission. These, and several other things he acted,
not as an ordinary person, by his pattern to lead on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men: but as being acted by an extraordinary Spirit,
and in pursuit of his mediatory office and undertaking,
which is a thing wherein we must not pretend to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
him.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, our Lord's example is a Rule to direct us in
our duty, and he intended it should be so, calling us to be
his <hi>followers</hi> by treading in the <hi>same steps,</hi> and to be
<hi>meek</hi> and <hi>lowly,</hi> as we saw he was. But in taking
Measures of our duty from it, <hi>we must not conclude any
thing a duty barely from his Pattern, but only where his
Laws say the same.</hi> For not to be minute in all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95989:7"/>
wherein our Blessed Saviour's example may
instruct us, the safest and easiest argument from his
actions in this case, is when they are instances and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrations
of his own Precepts. It is not his practice,
but his command that makes any thing a duty, and
when he practises according to it, that exemplifies the
commandment in its lively forms and circumstances, and
is a more sensible manifestation of the duty injoyn'd
by it. The adding of his practice, where he has given
a Precept, serves for a clearer illustration of it: but if
there be no precept, his practice alone doth not bind,
nor make any thing become a duty which before was
not one. And accordingly those instances, wherein
the Scriptures recommend his example to us, are things
injoyn'd by his own Laws. As when we are bid to be
<hi>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k and lowly,</hi> as he was, Matt. 11. 29; to inherit the
virtue of <hi>Blessing</hi> our Persecutors and Slanderers from
his practice, 1 Pet. 3. 9; to <hi>follow his steps</hi> in a <hi>Patient
Resign'd endurance</hi> of unjust sufferings, without <hi>railing</hi>
or wrathful returns, 1 Pet. 2. 20, 21, 23. and the
like.</p>
            <p>And as this is true of the example of Christ, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of the Examples of other Holy Persons recorded
in Scripture. For even their unmixt Actions, which
were not blameable in them, are sometimes unfit for
our imitation, being <hi>perform'd in pursuit of peculiar offices,</hi>
or <hi>authorized by such circumstances of things</hi> and <hi>other speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
inducements,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> had at that time, and which do
not agree to <hi>us</hi> in common with them.</p>
            <p>1. Several of their Actions, which the Scripture justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
were <hi>by virtue of immediate divine warranty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
which would have fallen under a just censure, but for
that reason.</hi> Thus the <hi>Israelites</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 11. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>borrowed of the Egyptians,</hi>
and pay'd not again, because God, the supreme Disposer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95989:7"/>
of all mens Goods, had given them that express Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<note n="†" place="margin">Num. 25. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Phineas,</hi> though a private Man, did a <hi>Publick
act of justice upon a Malefactor,</hi> without expecting the
forms of Law and the Magistrates order for it, because
he had a <hi>Particular Divine impulse</hi> (a thing sometimes
vouchsafed under the <hi>Jewish</hi> dispensation) and the <hi>Spirit
of Zele</hi> was upon him.<note n="*" place="margin">2 King. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Jehu</hi> took Arms against <hi>the
House of Ahab,</hi> and <hi>slew his Master Joram</hi> by a <hi>particular
command of God,</hi> which would have been a most detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Treason and Rebellion without it. The <hi>Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
are most publick and plain in their reproofs, both
of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> calling them<note n="*" place="margin">Is. 1. 10 23.</note> 
               <hi>Companions of
Thieves, Rulers of Sodom,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Is. 56. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Blind Watchmen, Dumb
Dogs, greedy Dogs,</hi> and the like, because there were
such Profligate Powers then, and though they were
in Authority, this was <hi>no criminal speaking evil of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
because the Prophets spoke not of themselves,
but only delivered Gods Message, which he had put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Mouths. These bold and open reprehensions
of higher Powers were good in them, because the Lord
had bidden them. But this is no justification at all
to the <hi>black-mouth'd Quakers,</hi> and other <hi>railing Rabshekah</hi>'s
of our time, who have neither the like just occasion,
nor, if they had, can reasonably pretend to any such
prophetical office and commission.</p>
            <p>2. Other of their Actions were commendable upon
<hi>their suitableness to the present circumstances and particular
state of things at that time, which would have deserv'd no
praise, but rather reproof at another season.</hi> Such was
<hi>David's eating the Shew-bread</hi> in the pressing necessity of
his Hunger, and when he could have no other; which
had been unjustifiable and blame-worthy out of that
circumstance, and at any time when common Bread
was to be had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such also was <hi>St. Pauls</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 16. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>circumcising
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95989:8"/>
Timothy,</hi> when he chose him out <hi>to gather Jewish Converts,</hi>
because that would help him to gain upon the <hi>Jews,</hi>
who at that time having a great devotion to the Law
of <hi>Moses,</hi> would not only be slow to receive instruction
from, but also to give access and converse freely with an
uncircumcised person. But because he did it in this
advantageous circumstance, we must not conclude it
may be done indifferently in any others, or to comply
with their error, who <hi>press the necessity of circumcision
and the Law of Moses:</hi> in which alteration of the case,
the Apostle himself was so far from doing the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that he inflexibly refused to <hi>circumcise Titus</hi> when
the necessity of it was urged upon him by the <hi>false Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
and <hi>Judaizers.</hi> Gal. 2. 3, 4, 5. Such again was
the practice of<note n="†" place="margin">Act. 4. 34, 35.</note> 
               <hi>having all things common at Jerusalem,</hi>
when the necessities of the <hi>poor Saints</hi> could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be supplyed, and the confiscations coming upon
the Church for Christ's sake, would let no Christian
there call any thing his own long. And the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Rules of<note n="*" place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 6. 14. &amp; 1 Cor. 5. 11.</note> 
               <hi>holding no acquaintance</hi> or <hi>commerce with
stubborn contemners of Church-orders,</hi> and <hi>notorious evil
livers,</hi> which, whilst the Church was encompassed
with Heathens, so that its own members would seek
shelter from it, and the offenders were fewer in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and so unable to protect themselves, was like to
reduce them. These practices were good then because
prudent in their circumstances, and proper for that
season: but would not deserve the like approbation in
those, who should go to imitate them unseasonably at
another time.</p>
            <p>3. Lastly, Some Actions of good Men, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
under the Old Testament, <hi>were justifiable whilst
that Dispensation stood, which would be criminal in us
now, who are under a Law more perfect.</hi> Such was<note n="†" place="margin">2 King. 1. 10, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Elias</hi>'s
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95989:8"/>
               <hi>calling down Fire from Heaven</hi> upon his Adversaries,
which agreed well enough with that State. But when
<hi>the Disciples James and John</hi> went about to do the like,
and pleaded his Example in justification of it, <hi>Jesus
rebuked them,</hi> and told them his Dispensation required
<hi>another manner of Spirit, Luk.</hi> 9. 54, 55. Such also
are the Liberties, of <hi>having many Wives,</hi> of <hi>putting
away their Wives for every cause and dislike,</hi> of <hi>cursing
Enemies and praying down Judgments upon their Heads,</hi>
which no good Christian must presume to do, because
he finds it done<note n="†" place="margin">Psal. 35, 36, 80.</note> often by <hi>holy David</hi> in the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 109.</note>
and by<note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 18. 21.</note> others of the <hi>holy Prophets,</hi> since our <hi>Saviour</hi>
has out-stripp'd <hi>Moses,</hi> and rais'd our Duty higher in
these Points.</p>
            <p>As to this use then of <hi>good Mens Examples,</hi> viz. <hi>taking
the information and measures of our Duty from them;</hi>
their Examples are not sufficient to warrant our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
when they are alone, but only when we see
the Law and Rule too which they went upon. It is
not enough to justifie us in any Action, that they did
it, unless it may appear that they did well in it, and
that it is according to Law, which shews what they
ought to do. Their practice is not to give Laws, but
is it self to be ruled and judged by them, as ours is.
If they act against any Law of God, that Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
them, and so will never justifie us for following
them in an unlawful thing. But if they acted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, we may safely follow them: but that is not
upon the authority of their Pattern, but of God's Law,
which justifies both us and them. They are only his
Laws, not other Mens Practice, which at last must
judge us. <hi>God shall judge the World according to my
Gospel,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2. 16. and <hi>my Word shall
judge Men at the last day,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 48.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95989:9"/>
And if Laws must govern our Sentence, bare Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
without Laws can never be sufficient to guide and
authorize our practice. So that in learning our Duty
from good Examples, we must seek to understand a
Command more fully and usefully by seeing it exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified,
but not think bare Examples make Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and authorize Actions where there are no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
at all. And this I have insisted the longer on,
because in judging of their Duty, Men are generally
prone to build too much upon the Examples of such,
as have been eminent for the Practice of it. They
find it easier to follow what they see others do, than
to enquire what they ought to do: and so by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discriminate
imitation, sometimes turn those Pious
Examples, which were intended for the Souls most
wholsom Food, into its Poison.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The</hi> second <hi>use we are to make of Pious Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
is</hi> for a Motive, to hearten and excite us to an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their Virtues.</p>
            <p>This is the most proper use of Examples, when
Laws have made Duties, and establish'd the goodness
of Actions, to be an argument and incitement to the
Practice of them. This end they serve, by working
upon that natural Emulation which is in Men, who
care not to be out-done in an advantageous or
praise-worthy thing, and seeing others reap Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or Happiness from any Performances, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
much incited to attempt the same. Now the
Example of Pious Persons spurs us on to an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Virtues, both as it shews the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of our Duty to be <hi>very desirable,</hi> and <hi>fairly
possible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As it shews it <hi>very desirable,</hi> and inflames us
with a noble eagerness, and earnest longing to do as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95989:9"/>
they have done. That which principally doth this in
Examples, is the <hi>honourable end,</hi> and <hi>happy event</hi> of them:
for the Glory and Greatness of the Rewards shews the
desirableness of any Service, and is fittest to work upon
our Emulation. And this the Scripture particularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
us to look to in the Examples of Holy Men. <hi>Ye
have heard of the Patience of Job, and have seen the end of
the Lord,</hi> how bountifully he rewarded him for it, says
St. <hi>James</hi> to the Jewish Converts, when he exhorted
them to <hi>bear Affliction patiently</hi> as he did, <hi>Jam. 5. 10, 11.
In running our</hi> hard <hi>Race with Patience,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,
let us look unto Jesus,</hi> who endured much worse; <hi>and
is now set down</hi> for it <hi>at the right hand of God,</hi> Heb. 12.
1, 2. <hi>Be ye followers of them,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the
same <hi>Text, who through Faith and Patience inherit the
Promises.</hi> And <hi>remember them, who have spoken to you
the Word of God, whose Faith follow, considering the end of
their Conversation,</hi> and what Eternal Bliss they got
by it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. Thus doth the Scripture propose
the end of their Services, their purchased Glories and
Rewards, as the most Powerful Argument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle
noble Desires in others, and gain Followers.
So that if we would give our selves the Benefit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Saints Examples, we must consider the Blissful
End of them, and often reflect, how their Piety has
placed them in a state of most pure, perfect, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Happiness, where they are at absolute Rest from
all their Labours, and eternally exempt from all Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
Fears, and Cares; where they injoy all their
Hearts can desire, and live always in the Presence,
and about the Throne of God, whence they daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Communications ineffable, and Glories incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
and such ravishing Delights, and inward
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95989:10"/>
Satisfactions, as no Fancy can reach till we come to
feel them, all which they are to injoy for evermore.
This is the incomparable Reward of all the good they
did, and a due and serious Consideration of it will
inflame in us an Emulous Desire, and mightily ingage
us to do the same.</p>
            <p>2. Their Example encourages us to imitate their
Virtues, as it shews such imitation <hi>fairly possible.</hi>
They were Men of like Passions, Over-sights, and
Infirmities; and subject to like Trials and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with our selves. And since notwithstanding all
these Difficulties and Discouragements, they were
successful in their virtuous Attempts, we may justly
take Heart, and hope to be so too. For our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
are no greater than theirs were, and
our Assistances from the Spirit and good Providence
of God will be no less. He will be the same in all
Times, to all that labour in expectation of his Aid,
and Faith of his Gracious Promises. So that if we will
imitate their Labours, we may promise our selves to
experiment their Success, and to prosper and be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
as they have been before us. And this use
also the Scripture makes of good Examples. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
endeavours to support the Faith and Patience of the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> by telling them <hi>there hath no Temptation
taken them, but such as is common to Man,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13.
and St. <hi>Peter</hi> bids the persecuted Christians <hi>be stedfast
in the Faith, knowing that the same Afflictions are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd
in their Brethren, which are in the World,</hi>
1 Pet. 5. 9: and St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to
<hi>Patience in their Race,</hi> sets before them the <hi>Cloud
of Witnesses,</hi> who were Glorious in their Successes,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95989:10"/>
though of like Passions and Trials with themselves,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. Thus to strengthen his Faith in God's
mercy, the Psalmist says <hi>he will remember his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of old, and talk of his doings</hi> for others, which
would incourage him to hope for the same himself,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 77, 11, 12. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
that <hi>whether he be afflicted,</hi> or <hi>comforted, it is for
their Consolation and Salvation; and is effectual in
their enduring of the same Sufferings which he suffers;</hi>
they having thereby, not only God's Promise, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
his Experience to assure them of the same support
in their Afflictions, which he found in his, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 1. 6.
Thus was one great Benefit they design'd Men in
proposing good Examples to them, the overcoming
their Diffidence, either of God, or of themselves,
and possessing them with good Hopes of Success in
their Attempts after any Virtues. And therefore
if we would give our selves a just Advantage from
the Examples of Deceased Saints, we must duly
consider their Discouragements and Assistances,
and that as they were of like Passions and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with us, so shall we find like Grace and
Success with them, if we<note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 12. 3.</note> saint not in a holy
Undertaking.</p>
            <p>Having thus shown what use we are to make of
Pious Mens Examples, and how fit they are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be Guides and Directions to our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
or a Spur and incitement to our Practice:
I proceed now</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To</hi> propose one to your imitation.</p>
            <p>It has pleased the All-wise God to take from us
an excellent Person, who whilst he lived was a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95989:11"/>
bright Example, and a publick Good, whose Life
could credit an Holy Religion, and whose Rank and
Quality in the World afford Interest and Support
to it. He was a clear Instance of many noble Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and both a discreet and zealous Stickler in
promoting them. As for his <hi>Funeral,</hi> he desired
it might be Private, without Splendor and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
wherewith his Friends would otherwise
have begun to pay Honour to his Memory. And
this he did out of a Generous Contempt of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Show and Pomp, and a fixt inclination of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
his Liberality, which indeed was Great,
in Pious and Charitable Works, which are things
of solid use: Chusing such Methods of Expence, as
were like to bring most Glory to God, and Good
to Men, not such as were only empty and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
signs of Honour to himself. This way of
Carrying him to his Grave, occasioned no Publick
Meeting at his Funeral, which superseded such
Accounts, as might otherwise have been expected
of him at that time. But I think an Example, from
which so much is to be learnt, ought not to pass
without some Remarques upon it. And although
I do not intend a just and full Description of him,
yet that you of this Place, who have been Eye-Witnesses
of his Conversation, may not lose the
Benefit of such a Pattern, I shall draw him out
in some rude Lines for your imitation. And if
we can be so wise and careful as to imitate him,
that will make a Recompence for our Loss, and
in part supply the want we must all expect to find
of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95989:11"/>
He was a Person of good understanding, without
haughty opinions and conceit of his own knowledge,
which is the greatest hindrance to any mans gaining
more, and growing wiser. He was of a quick, and
clear apprehension; of a temper very sedate and
calm, free to hear, and patient to consider of such
reasons, as were offer'd to him; of sagacity to direct
his thoughts to the right mark, where the stress lay
in any point; and of a well poys'd judgment, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which was the right side. He did not affect
to hear himself talk, and ingross the discourse, but
was industriously careful to appear, as one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
rather to learn than to teach, and to be free
to hear other mens sense, as well as to give his own.
But what he took occasion to speak, was pertinent
and proper, with such insight into things, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
consideration of them, as made it well worth
the Hearing. He had a very good talent of Reason,
and was careful so to imploy it, as might enable him
to give the best and most unblameable account of it,
that is, in understanding himself and his own duty,
in bringing Honour to God, and doing Good to Men,
and fitting himself to be serviceable to his friends,
and to his Country.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Religion,</hi> that was the height of all his aims,
and the most open of all his Professions, wherein he
endeavor'd most to be a Good Proficient himself, and
which he most sought to Propagate among others.
Of which, for your godly imitation, I shall give these
following accounts</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95989:12"/>
He was a person of <hi>true tenderness of conscience,</hi> very
impressive, and soon touch'd with any thing, that
had true goodness in it. But although he was thus
justly tender, yet he was not of a scrupulous temper,
<hi>i. e.</hi> apt to run away from trifles, and startle at such
things, as have in them no illness, or hurt at all.
And to prevent being mis-led into doubts and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
by any unnecessary Rigors or unwary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
which sometimes occur in Good Books, he
was studiously careful to get distinct notions, and to
discern what things recommended in them were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of necessary duty, and what only of Prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Godly direction: which thing if it had been
more remarqued by some that have written good
Books, as well as by those that read them, several
laudable directions, that have occasion'd much trouble
to some Pious minds, would have proved only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Helps to mens Practice, without engendring
doubts and scruples, or any ways insnaring of their
Consciences.</p>
            <p>Next to this true tenderness, and intire sense of
Duty, which I think is the first, and must always be
the leading excellence in any Good Man, since our
Practice of any duties must follow upon our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them: I shall recommend to you his <hi>intire care</hi>
and <hi>regard to observe all.</hi> This indeed, was the Sum
of all his Prayers, of his studies, and endeavours, to be
an upright and intire Man; <hi>i. e.</hi> to have an eye to all
the commandments, and observe God in every thing
he had required of him. To keep up a constant
sense of his weaknesses and miscarriages, he took
daily accounts of his daily practice, besides what he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95989:12"/>
did with more care and exactness at set times.
And his examinations of himself stood not only in the
most notorious and weighty duties, but also in such
others, as though Christ has equally injoyn'd, yet
in the Practice, and too often in the opinion of the
World, are least observed. He judg'd himself for
his <hi>uncharitable</hi> Surmises, and <hi>hard censures,</hi> for his
<hi>unwary propagating and reproachful falshoods</hi> he had
heard of his Brethren, nay for his <hi>unnecessary utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of any real miscarriages</hi> he knew by them, for
his <hi>omissions to discourage an ill thing,</hi> or <hi>to embrace and
promote a Good one</hi> when it lay before him. These,
and such other less observ'd errors of the Tongue, and
sins of conversation, and other less noted breaches
of duty, for which, though Christ at last will judge
us all, yet so many otherwise serious neglect to judge
and reform themselves, were the matter of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
and confessions.</p>
            <p>And when he had confess'd them, his care, like
a Good Christian, was to <hi>amend them,</hi> and to be
more watchful to prevent the like again. The
plain truth is, he carefully studyed this Art, as one
that greatly desired, and wisely intended to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
in it. And among all the Methods he took for
this end, the principal were these.</p>
            <p>The chief cause why Men, who in the General
aim and bent of their minds are set upon their duty,
are yet for all that liable to transgress it, is because
it is slipt out of their thoughts, and they want a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
sense of it when they should be govern'd by it.
To prevent this, his first care was what in him
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95989:13"/>
lay to <hi>familiarize all particular duties to his mind.</hi> In
order to this, <hi>one</hi> way he chose, was out of Books
to extract a scheme, containing all particulars in a
short compass, which might easily be inured to His
thoughts: <hi>another</hi> was, to have all the sins he needed
to confess, and the graces he was to beg of God, set
down as particularly, as might be, in his daily devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
His great desire and care was to make his
Prayers serve for lessons and instructions, that his
confessions of Sin might shew him what he was to
shun, and his Prayers for Grace be monitors to his
practice, and his daily Petitions to Almighty God,
become Rules to himself. And intending thus to
live according to his Prayers, he desired in them
to be very particular in the Points of Practice, that
in his daily devotion, he might not only have the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of a supplication, but withall the daily use and
admonition of a Sermon.</p>
            <p>Having taken this care to maintain in himself
a present lively sense of all duties, his next care
was to <hi>study, what were the most expedite, easy, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Rules of practising them.</hi> And after he had wisely
chosen, and proposed these Rules to himself, he was
careful to observe them, and took account of himself
how he swerv'd from them: remembring in the mean
time, that many of these rules were not necessary
duties, but only prudent means, and such as he had
set himself, but God had not prescribed him. These
Rules, with the sins, which by Nature or custom,
or the course of temptation, he was most exposed to,
and which they were design'd to cure, he set down in
writing. And that both his dangers, and his reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95989:13"/>
might be kept fresh and familiar upon his
mind, his Method was <hi>to have two fixt days in every
week, to peruse and consider of them,</hi> that so, if he did
forget himself, it should be but for a short time, and
that within a very few days, he might return to his
former Guard again.</p>
            <p>In Sum, the course of his repentance was plainly
a most studied and contrived thing. He forethought
ways, how <hi>to carry on good motions;</hi> how <hi>to prevent
surprizes;</hi> or, when at any time he fell, how <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
himself by an immediate repentance;</hi> how <hi>to prepare
for the temptations of any day, or business;</hi> how <hi>to
maintain a constant liveliness of Heavenly Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
by sending up <hi>Divine Breathings</hi> and <hi>Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
not only <hi>every day,</hi> but almost <hi>every hour</hi> more
or less. So that repentance was the Art he studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and was as truly his daily business, as some
mens Trades and occupations, others vices, and
the vanities and Diversions of a third sort are
theirs.</p>
            <p>This was his care of good living in the general,
but I shall expose it still nearer to your view and
Godly imitation in some particulars.</p>
            <p>To begin with the <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion of
his Spirit,</hi> he had a <hi>Prosound Honour and Reverence
for Almighty God,</hi> and <hi>Love for Religion,</hi> which
without the extremes, either of fear, or Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he would openly profess and own in a licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and prophane Age, that thought such preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to Religion to bewray want of Spirit or Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95989:14"/>
He did not only take care of the Practice, but
espouse the party of true godliness: he would
bravely and wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly plead for it, and labour to gain
Profelytes to it. He had a compassionate sense of
the difficulties and temptations that attend Men of
Quality, through the Worlds adopting many wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Practices into Rules of Good breeding, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such things into Laws of Honour, as are
not only a most open Breach of the plainest and
most important Precepts of Religion, but the
grossest absurdities to any sober reason and common
discretion. And having wisely consider'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
his own mind against them, where he could,
he was glad to convince and strengthen others, and
where he could not, he pitied and griev'd for them;
lamenting to see some, in other respects very wise
and sober Men, too deeply tainted with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monness
of the infection. To ingage his friends to
a serious and powerful sense of Religion, he would
follow them with Good Counsels, which he would
manage discreetly, and time seasonably, laying
wait for them in their most impressive Moods,
especially after any great dangers, or in the time
of sickness, and wherein he would reason clearly,
endeavoring to convince and persuade them, both
from the cogent Reason of things, and from the
more affecting argument of his own experience.
Whilst he lived, he would urge them by advice and
importunities, and at his death, by the most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
Messages and dying Intreaties. In Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of this end he would stoop to any thing, and
sometimes make himself a companion of mean
Persons, not only sending Books or Instructors to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95989:14"/>
them, but making repeated Personal Addresses,
and becoming a Preacher to them himself. And
as for his Servants and Dependants, with the
care of whom he knew God had particularly
intrusted him, he was more especially careful to
have them told their Duty, and observant how
they practised it, teaching them to honour the
Name of God, to attend duly upon his worship
in the Church, and particularly upon that
highest instance of it, the Holy Sacrament, to be
constant at Prayers in his own family, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
taking Notice of such as neglected them,
declaring that his business should not be admitted as
their hindrance and excuse. Thus was he resolv'd,
so far as either his Perswasions, Example, or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would prevail with them, that they who serv'd
him, should fear and serve his Lord and Master
too.</p>
            <p>And then as for his <hi>Prayers and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which are the very vital Breath of a
Religious Spirit, as in his <hi>Closet,</hi> so in <hi>Publick,</hi>
he gave an example most worthy to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
shewing both much Zeal, and discretion in
them.</p>
            <p>He was, as you all know, a <hi>Careful</hi> and <hi>constant
Attender upon Gods Publick worship,</hi> and so desirous
to bring others to do the same, that when for
the convenience of the family, he has on any festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
first had the service of God at home, to induce
others by his example, he has several times gone
presently after to Church to have it there again.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95989:15"/>
And in this he was not content to attend by halves, but
was careful to come to the beginning of the service:
sincerely desiring rather to come before the time,
and with Patience wait the Beginning of the Prayers,
than lose any part of them. For he thought it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
a great coldness, and want of Zeal for God, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it doth, to use delays in paying him attendance,
and though they be as forward as any in expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Blessing from him, yet to be among the
hindmost when any Honor and service is to be paid
to him: wherein I hope those among you, who are too
remiss in this Point, will learn to follow him. And as
for the Holy Sacrament, though he was laborious in
recollection, and much in devotion against that
time, yet were the returns of it, whereat he was
always a devout attendant, so far from being a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to him, that he several times desired they might
be more often.</p>
            <p>Thus careful and constant an Attender was he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Publick Worship and Service of God. And
whilst he was at Church, we all know the <hi>Gravity,</hi>
the <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Devoutness of his carriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Behaviour</hi> there was <hi>grave and composed,</hi>
and a Habit of seriousness visibly dwelt upon his
Spirit; which testified a mind duly sensible, that
there he was in the more especial presence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, and negotiating Affairs of greatest
moment, which require the utmost intention of
mind, and are not to be undertaken by a Light and
trifling, a remiss and stupid, a desultory and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95989:15"/>
It was also very <hi>Reverent,</hi> and in <hi>Decent show</hi>
of Profound Humility and Submission of Spirit, to
his aweful apprehensions of God, adding <hi>humble</hi>
and <hi>respectful Postres,</hi> and praying always upon
his Knees. For which he had so Conscientious a
Regard himself, that as he has told me, he was
really scandalized to see the careless, neglectful,
and misbecoming Gestures some others would
use at Church in their Prayers: being uneasie in
himself to see men, even when they profess'd to
honour and pray to God, to do it in such care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Postures as shew'd not Honour but Neglect,
and wherein, though they presume to pray to
God, yet they dare not come to Petition any
Powerful, or Great man.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Devotion of his Heart,</hi> when he
appeared among you in any Publick Worship,
how easily might you observe a Spirit Greatly and
Piously affected? How humble, and hearty was
he in his Confessions, how fervent in Holy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
how affectionate in Praises and Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings?
In a word, he discover'd a profound sense
of God's Majesty and adorable Excellencies, a full
Conviction of his own Meanness and Sinfulness,
and an high Esteem and ardent Desires of the
Favour of God, and of the Mercies of another
World. All which Devout Tempers and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
were livelily drawn out in his outward
Meen, and yet without appearance of Vanity
and Ostentation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:95989:16"/>
This was the Religious Behaviour of this Pious
and excellent Person towards Almighty God. And
as for his <hi>Carriage among Men,</hi> it was such as became
a Heart so piously and devoutly affected.</p>
            <p>He was a Person remarkably <hi>Temperate.</hi> His
Quality and Fortune would have supply'd him with
any thing, to gratifie and caress any Sense and
Appetite: But in the midst of all these, he chose
rather to deny himself, and triumph over them.
The Power of abstaining from what Meat, and
Sensual Delight he pleased, was a Point of Virtue
he particularly affected: and this made him so
far from indulging the Body, that he burden'd
it with more Severity than his Friends thought it
could well bear. And as for his <hi>Sobriety</hi> in a
Temperate use of Drink, to say he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
himself, is but a small part of his Praise,
who, so far as he could help it, would by no
means suffer it in others. He would lay no Snares
to draw in others to excess, nor suffer it to be
done by those, that depended on him. Nay, if
any Persons were inclinable to over-load them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
his Conscience would not allow him to seek
the Reputation of being Hospitable, by ministring
to their Excess. For he thought, and he thought
truly, that to minister to any Vice, is to partake
in other Mens Sins. And that a Man may as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently
furnish out Opportunities and Supplies,
to those who are seeking to gratifie their unclean
Lusts, or greedy Rapine, as set out excessive Stores
of Wine to those, who are playing Prizes in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and contest like Profest Champions in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95989:16"/>
He ministers to other Mens Sins in
both these Cases, only in the two former he helps
them to sin against their Brethren, but in this last
against their own selves.</p>
            <p>He was very <hi>sincere,</hi> and <hi>plain-hearted in his
Speeches and Professions,</hi> making this his Rule,
<hi>never to promise any thing, but what he intended
exactly to keep,</hi> and <hi>to mark down</hi> what he had
promised, lest he should forget it. Nay, even
in Civilities and Ceremonious Addresses, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the World are most subject to transgress, the
Measure whereby he govern'd himself was, that
<hi>he might safely speak less, but never profess more
than he meant, nor tell a Lye even in Complement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his <hi>Dealings he would be just,</hi> not daring,
I will not say to Cozen by <hi>Down-right Fraud</hi> and
<hi>Falseness,</hi> but even to prey on others by <hi>over-reach
of Wit</hi> and <hi>Skill,</hi> in <hi>Play,</hi> or <hi>Business:</hi> or if at
any time he forgot himself in this Point, he durst
not rest, without finding out some way to make
<hi>Restitution</hi> of it. Nay, in his Pastimes, he was
Conscientiously careful, not only of the Honesty
and Fairness, of his getting, but also of the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of others losing to him. And some Men of
mean Estates, being forward to mix themselves with
Persons of Quality in their Diversions, when, by
their forwardness to Wage with him, he has fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
won what he thought their Family at Home
would find a want of, he has taken Care secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to convey it back to the Wife and Children,
without the Profuse Husband's knowing any thing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95989:17"/>
of it. This charitable Care and Christian Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
was very agreeable with that Rule he
had set himself in his Diversions, which was <hi>to
be no gainer by any Games, but what he lost should
go as the Price of his own Pleasure, but what he
won should accrue to the Poor, and the Needy should
be his Receivers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As his Justice was Exemplary and Great, so
his <hi>Charity was Noble</hi> and <hi>Eminent.</hi> He would do
generous and noble Things, and these he loved,
so far as he could, to steal in upon the World,
and carry so private, that unless the Deed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
it self, there should be no expectation
rais'd, nor noise made of it; hoping thereby to
secure a greater Purity of Intention in the Good
he did, and intitle it the more to his Reward,
who sees what is done in secret. In distributing
his Alms, his Rule was first <hi>to distinguish between
Objects,</hi> that he might give wisely, to supply
real Wants, not to support Idleness, and then
<hi>to give freely and liberally, with all secrecy.</hi> In
pursuance of his compassionate Sense of poor
Peoples Necessities, he would sometimes take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
privately to visit them, and give them
Relief. And being more especially sensible of the
great Miseries they suffer in Sickness, which by
a little Physick seasonably administred would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
soon be ended, and thereby they be both
eas'd of their uncomfortable Distempers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
more speedily to return to their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to maintain themselves and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
He agreed with a Physician for a yearly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95989:17"/>
Pension to take care of all the Sick Poor of his
own Parish, and ply them with Remedies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for their Distempers, requiring him to say
nothing of this his Exemplary, and wisely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
because most wanted Charity, being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
only to secure to himself the Virtue of the
Act, and then let who would have the Praise
and Honour of it. Out of his sincere Zeal for
the Honour of God, and the Beauty of his House
and Worship, he has adorn'd the Quire of this
Church, and nobly augmented our Furniture of
Communion-Plate. Upon the Death of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Lady, besides his Liberality to every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Parish for a present Distribution, he allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a considerable Sum to the use of the Poor for
a perpetual Settlement. And now at his own
Death, he has given a much greater for the use of
the Poor of this Parish, and restored two Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations,
one whereof is very considerable, to
the Church; <hi>viz.</hi> the Impropriate Tythes of this
Parish of <hi>Coles-Hill,</hi> and of the Parish of <hi>Vpper-Whitacre,</hi>
to those two respective Churches. The
Bestowing of the two <hi>Impropriations,</hi> was a thing
he had fully design'd in the time of his Health.
For as for <hi>Vpper-Whitacre,</hi> he had purchased it
with a Design of annexing it, the Summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he died. And as for <hi>Coles-Hill,</hi> by a solemn
Paper left Sign'd with his own Hand, to provide
against all Casualties, lest he should die before he
had accomplished what he intended, he took care
to tell his surviving Relations, how upon mature
Study and Deliberation, he was also fully and
Religiously resolved to restore it, <hi>which,</hi> as he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95989:18"/>
words it, <hi>belonging to the Church by several Titles, ought
not to be withheld.</hi> These are noble instances of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Piety towards God, and Generous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for whose encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he design'd them, for which God, I doubt not,
has rewarded him, and all future Ages shall cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
his memory and call him Blessed, whilst this
Church and State shall stand.</p>
            <p>This was the Charity of his Purse. And as for
all the other instances of Charity in conversation,
as <hi>long-suffering, civility in carriage, mercifulness,
candor in passing interpretations, Patience upon Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi>
and the like, without which, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 3.</note> says, <hi>giving all our Goods to feed the Poor will sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
nothing:</hi> he had an equal Regard, and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
care of them too. His Religion did not
sowre into moroseness, nor his severities to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
render him peevish and uneasie towards others.
To set him out to your imitation in all the virtues
of Conversation, I shall not describe his carriage
in all the Particulars, which would take up too
much time, but rather chuse to set down the
Rules whereby he govern'd himself, which will
be, as the more compendious, so I hope as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
a way for those, who are disposed to follow
him. Those Rules, as they appear in his own
Papers, were such as these; <hi>viz. to cross himself
in any eager desire, and in things most to his own
Humour; to prefer others ease before his own; not
to neglect, or over look the meanest Person; to stoop
to the meanest offices to do others kindnesses; not to
be high in his expectations from others</hi> (one of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95989:18"/>
best Securities against being exceptious) <hi>to own the
least kindness he had receiv'd, and be really inclined
to return it; to forget all injuries done to him, and
stifle all thoughts of resenting them; not to speak at a
venture, without thinking; whensoever he proposed any
Reasons, to do it with a modest deference; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any thing to his own Praise; nor to discommend
others; nor to strive to out-do, or vie in the least mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
These, and such like, were the Maxims,
he proposed to live by in conversing with others,
and whereby he judg'd himself in his retirements
and self examinations. And the Effect of them
was answerable, in a truly humble, courteous, and
obliging carriage. He was careful not to pass <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
censures,</hi> nor shew any <hi>unchristian violence</hi> which
might cause just offence, even to his enemies, and
to those he most opposed in interests and opinions:
making it his frequent Prayer, to help it the better
into his daily Practice, that with <hi>just Zeal</hi> against
their <hi>Errors,</hi> he might still preserve all <hi>due Charity</hi>
for their <hi>Persons,</hi> and never use any sinful means and
unlawful expedients, in opposing the worst things,
or pursuing the most Pious, Publick, and generous
ends in the World.</p>
            <p>As he was thus careful to practise this excellent
virtue of charity himself, so was he very Studious
to <hi>maintain it among others.</hi> He sought to deserve
the title of a <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> and when he heard of
differences ready to flame out, would interpose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a protector of the oppressed Parties, and hear
complaints and pleadings, and compose and adjust
differences, and if the Authority of Reason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95989:19"/>
would not do, make use of the Power he had
over his <hi>Tenants</hi> and <hi>Dependants,</hi> not allowing them
to commence Suits for Redress, till they had first
complained to him, and seen what Redress he
could make them.</p>
            <p>In sum, he was a well-studied, and improved
Christian, able to plead for Virtue and Goodness,
with such Reason and Argument, as might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and careful to practise it with
such exactness, as might adorn a <hi>Cloyster.</hi> He
was a Person of very sincere and warm Devotion,
a most Religious Honourer of God, and of the
Clergy for God's and their Function's sake, an
affectionate admirer of true Virtue and Worth
wheresoever he found it, a sincere and zealous Son
of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in whose Communion
he lived and died, desiring above all things in his
last Extremities, to receive the Holy Sacrament
and Priestly Absolution according to its order and
appointment, and a faithful and serviceable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the King. He was strict in his Trusts,
faithful and active in his Friendships, a dutiful Son,
a discreet and loving Husband, a good and careful
Master to his Servants, and in the inclination of his
Mind, and according to the opportunities of his Life,
an universal Friend and Benefactor unto all.</p>
            <p>This is such an Account, as I thought fit to give
you of this Place, of this truly Pious and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
Soul. And I have chose to give it, not so
much from general Characters of his Person, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Relations of his Practice, both because this is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95989:19"/>
most Honourable to him, there being no way so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
of drawing out excellent Persons, as by
shewing the Draught they have made of themselves,
their own Praise-worthy Deeds making them more
truly illustrious, than all the Paint and Varnish of
abstracted Eloquence: and especially because this is
of more use, and a better help to imitation. For
however some Persons may hear general Characters
with more approbation and applause, as thinking
they shew more of Fancy and Wit than plain Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives
of Fact: yet the exposing of their particular
Performances, of the Rules they observ'd in governing
themselves, and of their wise and worthy Actions,
is that which is like to gain most Followers, and
turns most to Profit in all great Examples. This
goes before Men in the way, and marks out the very
steps they have troden, and so plainly shews and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
the Path to all that have a Mind to follow after
them. God grant us all the Grace to imitate these,
and other his Virtues after his Death, which we
had so just Reason to admire, and bless God for
in his Life; and then we need not fear at last to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
those great Rewards and glorious Promises,
which we have reasonable Grounds to believe he is
now an happy Sharer of.</p>
