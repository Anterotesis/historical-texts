            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

This, where ſome private Innovators

an account of ſundry publick Promiſes, Eccleſiaſtick
and Sacerdotall, freely made by deliberate choice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by Oath and Subſcription? And what Perſons
more appoſite Hearers than your ſelves, eſpecially
bound to make and to perform them, by your high
Office, your near attendance on the Lord your God?
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115757:3"/>
Place, Time, and Perſons ſo well agreeing, harken to
the charge of my Text: You emphatically, whom it ſo
cloſely concerns, you of all men. <hi>Promiſe to the Lord,
and keep it, all ye that be round about him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parts are three: 1. A Counſell commended,
<hi>Promiſe.</hi> 2. An Obligation thereof begotten, <hi>Keep it.</hi>
3. The Parties betwixt whom it paſſes, <hi>You,</hi> and the
<hi>Lord.</hi> Which may be reduced to three Propoſitions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Holy Promiſes are laudably made.</item>
               <item>2. Being once made, they muſt be neceſſarily kept.</item>
               <item>3. Eſpecially kept between ſuch Parties. The Bond
is ſtreightned becauſe aſſign'd to the Lord, aſſign'd by
them that be round about him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, Holy Promiſes are laudably made: elſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
it ſelf is blameable, whoſe covenant binds us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the World, the Fleſh, and the Devill. I need not
over-urge this truth, if onely I forbear the name of a
Vow, which carries an odious ſound of ſome Jewiſh
or Popiſh Relick. As in manners, we may ſafely equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
but not lie; falſly accuſe, but not ſlander; take
away, not rob nor ſteal: So in Religion, promiſe we
may, ſo we do not vow; proteſt, not ſwear. Nay, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is grown ſo verball, that many Earneſt Points,
conſiſting in meer words, have quite thruſt out all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of much pious matter. Becauſe we will not
hear of Juſtification but onely by Faith (for Faith is the
radicall vertue) we abhor the concomitant works of
Charity as mortall ſins, ſcarce to be nam'd, never
committed amongſt us. Becauſe Confirmation hath
been ranck'd amongſt Sacraments, (for, as Baptiſm is
our birth in Chriſt, ſo Confirmation is our growth,
and fits us for mans eſtate in the Euchariſt;) it is now
ſcarce thought a godly Ordinance. Becauſe Confeſſion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115757:3"/>
hath ſometimes given a name to the Rood, (for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
is the reading of faults) away with the Apoſtle's
Precept, we may not <hi>confeſſe our ſins one to another.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Pennance, thereafter enjoyn'd, hath been held an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Sacrament, (for it is a holy and cleanſing Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline)
it is now ſcarce allowed for an honeſt chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Becauſe the Liturgy and Communion hath
ſometimes been called Maſſe, (for there is <hi>Chriſtus
miſſus</hi>) the onely ſervice of God i<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> now to hear him
ſerve us: we come to as little of Prayers, as without
danger of loſing Sermon preciſely we can, and ſeldom
Receive without compulſion. Becauſe the Table hath
ſometimes been called the Altar, (though Chriſt and
St. <hi>Paul</hi> have call'd it ſo too, that's all one) yet, for the
word's ſake, 'tis humbled to a lower place, to another
poſture, to filth and rottenneſſe, till it be ſcarce known
for a Table. Becauſe the Miniſter hath been called
Prieſt, (for Chriſt is our High-Prieſt) therefore he is
now throughly be-miniſtred, made our Miniſter, not
God's, and muſt pipe what we bid him. Becauſe ſome
Churches have harboured Superſtition, (though Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
be ill reformed with Sacriledge; ſelling of
Doves, with plucking down of Walls) yet the word
Superſtition being given, they, and many a Pariſh
Church beſides, at once fell to ground, and the word
<hi>Congregation</hi> is built in their ſteed. Ju<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſo, becauſe ſome
Vows were made ſuperſtitiouſly to the bleſſed Virgin,
in hope of Mediation; or preſumptuouſly to Chriſt,
with opinion of Merit; therefore all Vows muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
all cenſur'd unlawfull in themſelves. Brethren,
you may remember, that the covetous fury of Church-Reformation,
like that which was wrought on <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
did almoſt proceed to the ruine of a Tribe, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115757:4"/>
rooting out of the Clergy: that as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was driven to
repair the loſſe, by granting them wives of rapine; ſo
this Land, by admitting ignorant Prieſts, ſnatch'd from
their Shops and Trades. How taught they their Hearers
in publick? but as their Hearers taught them in private.
And what Doctrine could prove the ſpoile of the
Church lawfull, but the unlawfulneſſe of Vows? And
what could totally diſcountenance the thing, but repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the neer common Name, including Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
together with Devotion. Words are deputed for
Things; and change of words made the buſineſſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
to ſeem more numerous and weighty, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it ought to ſeem. For as the Church had great
need to be reformed, ſo the Spoilers had much more
need to reform her, and their heirs have ſtill the ſame
need. Wherefore if you dedicate your ſelves or any
thing elſe unto God, remove it further from the ſpeciall
name, and favour it with a ſtyle more generall; call it a
Promiſe, no Vow; no Vow, I beſeech you.</p>
            <p>If I ſpake to unletter'd people, I would forbear; but
before you that can well diſcern ſubſtance from ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
I dare preſent the truth naked. The Greek and
Latine Tranſlations are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Vovete, Vow unto the
Lord.</hi> The Acts which I ſhall inculcate are properly
Vows; and therefore I plainly pronounce, That Vows
are alſo laudable.</p>
            <p>In ſtrict Language, Vows are holy Promiſes of a
more ſpeciall kind. We may ſometimes promiſe a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
neceſſary, as <hi>Jacob</hi> his Tythe, <hi>Naaman</hi> his ſole
Worſhip of God; ſuch an Act is barely a Promiſe.
And ſometimes a matter Voluntary, as <hi>David</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for a Temple, <hi>Hanna</hi> her ſon for a Prieſt; ſuch an
Act is both a Promiſe and a Vow. As he that denies
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115757:4"/>
all promiſes, condemnes Baptiſm; ſo he that denies all
vowes, condemnes all Eccleſiaſticall Offices, and chiefly
the Order of Prieſthood: which Order is ever freely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
but when it is taken, drawes with it theſe inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vows, Attendance over the Flock, many rare Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
practick Obedience to the form of Liturgy, to the
Book of Articles, to Eccleſiaſticall Canons, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
of the Dioceſan.</p>
            <p>Examine, Compare a true Vow and the office of
Prieſthood: Is the one, by its nature, a voluntary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made unto God? ſo is the other. Are theſe the
Conditions of the one, Deliberation of mind, Purpoſe
of will, Pronunciation of mouth? the ſame are Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
in the other. No man is ſurprized ignorantly, or
forced unwillingly, or admitted ſilently: not without
Age and Triall, not without humble ſuite, not without
ſolemn proteſtation made to ſeverall Propoſalls, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably
utter'd, and openly teſtified before God,
whom we fear; before men, whom we reverence; his
owne Ears preſſing to his Conſcience what his Mouth
hath ſpoken. And what's the matter of a Vow? Some
over paſſing good, plac'd within our Power. Why good?
not indifferent, leſt, inſtead of a Promiſe, we ſeem to
offer a threat. Why over-paſſing? leſt for a ſingular
praeſent, we offer a new Bond of an old vulgar debt.
Why within our Power? leſt we offer the Sacrifice of
fools, which vaniſhes with their breath. Such it muſt be,
ſome Excellent piece of Virtue, without Gods precept,
but within His Counſell; without the common path,
but within ſome private reach; not binding our neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and abſolute duty by an Epidemicall Command, but
inclining our free reſpective Devotion, through perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
grounds. Is not the buſineſſe of Prieſthood the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115757:5"/>
very ſame? Good, no doubt, for it is God's Ordinance;
and evidently ſurmounting mans common duty, elſe all
the Sheep are bound to be Shepheards, yet ſurely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageable
by ſome particular Abilities, rais'd by the Spirit
of God, and ſingled out by his attractive Motion: for
ſome muſt needs bear the heat of the Day; and, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye be the men or no, whether inwardly call'd, is the
Biſhop's queſtion, when he outwardly ordains. Laſtly,
what's the end of a Vow, or what of Prieſthood? the
ſame of both. For whether we dedicate our Goods, our
Bodies, our Souls, or our Service, ſtill we aime at a
neerer Union of the Creatures with God, whereby the
Glory of the one is exalted, the Happineſſe of the other
increas'd. And now, what think you? you have ſeen a
ſevere ſearch, you find a perfect agreement in their
Nature, Conditions, Matter, End.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I may ſeem to decoy your favourable Opinion, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Vowes by this ingagement of your Office; but
I hope to excite a reciprocall zeal towards your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
by the Commendation of Vowes. There are
two Grounds, whereon all poſſible vowes are ſafely
built. The one is Baptiſm, in which a generall promiſe
to forſake the World, the Fleſh, and the Divel; all
Negative vowes of Mortification, and Abſtinence,
are ſuper-induc'd on this Foundation, and rais'd by
particular Motives of the Perſon vowing, able at a
farther diſtance to chaſe away theſe deceivers. The
ſecond Ground is that generall Precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt
love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart;</hi> all poſitive
vowes of free Devotion, or Almes, ſpring from this
Root. Where God hath plac'd an Extraordinary gift,
ſerviceable for eminent Acts and Offices, he loves not
his Lord with all his heart, who refuſes to take a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
anſwerable to his ſhoulders.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115757:5"/>
               <q>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> commends Virginity, he doth not
commend it to all, he doth not impoſe it on any:
True; yet whatſoever is not neceſſary for all, is not
therefore unlawfull for ſome; but rather laudable,
for ſuch as can and will. Betwixt <hi>Muſt</hi> and <hi>must not,</hi>
there is <hi>May</hi> and <hi>may not:</hi> As a contingent may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm'd or denied; ſo it may be honeſtly done, or
not done, as Occaſion or Circumſtance ſhall ſway
the Subject; be the matter Virginity, or any other
unuſuall Abſtinence, or work of Excellence. So it
ſtands: God could have multiplied his Law into ſo
many particular branches, as might have expreſſely
determin'd all variety of perſons to their ſeverall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but, out of his great bounty, he hath left us an
occaſion to be bountifull towards Him; he hath not
in plain terms challeng'd all our juſt debt, that we by
a Voluntary Offer might more ingratiate our ſelves
into his Favour; he hath left his Rule under a ſeeming
imperfection, that we might appear before him the
more perfect, and receive the reward of diligent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
apt to underſtand his ſilent intimation, and
doing things reducible to his Command, though
not commanded. Under the Law, where he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
the place of a Judge, the vow which he would
not directly injoyne, he plainly ſuppos'd, and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
preſcrib'd ſet forms unto it: Under the Goſpell
where he perſonates a Gracious Father, he leaves it
more to the Love of his Children. Though the form
be now antiquated with the Ceremoniall Law, the
Morall ſubſtance doth yet remain: inſtead of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
we may vow our goods; inſtead of a Carcaſſe,
we may offer Our-ſelves, a reaſonable and living ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
with willingneſſe, and cleanneſſe of heart,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115757:6"/>
out-paſſing all former Ceremony. And we find in
the 18 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> an exemplary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Goſpell, yoak'd himſelfe under a vow;
though what it was, I leave to Conjecture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sorry I am, that any Extraordinary Vertue is as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
here, as Extraordinary Vice; as dangerous now as
in the dayes of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> and muſt forthwith be baniſht
the Land. To man, we may be as good as we liſt, not
to God by any means; we muſt be ſure to keep him ever
ſhort in our ſervice, for him we cannot ſerve ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
we muſt beware of Liberality to Him, for <hi>He gives
us all things.</hi> O the Logick of a corrupted Chriſtian!
ſhould we not ſo much the rather ſtretch our weakneſſe
to make up in Will what is wanting in Power, and at
leaſt, ſtrain our Poverty to a ſhew of thankfulneſſe?</p>
            <p>Many wayes a Man may vow to man; his Goods by
Reverſion, his Body by Wedlock, his Service by Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and there is good Law for this: Is there no Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to ſecure a Conveyance to God, to incourage the
ſpirituall wedlock of vow'd Chaſtity, to countenance
the vow of our Miniſtry, and ſhew that God is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
fit to be dealt with? We may all vow one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
no man excepted; and behold, God himſelfe hath
freely vow'd himſelfe to us all. He ſent his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son to pay the vowes which he often made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and to his Seed, and to all Nations; ſhall only a
Reciprocall relation of man to God, be totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in all? When his turn comes, ſhall we pretend
an utter diſability of performing any promiſe? Let not
a Neighbour hear us, none then will take our words for
a Groat.</p>
            <p>Why are we only there tenacious, where it is greateſt
gain to be Liberall? A promiſe paſt to thy Neighbour,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115757:6"/>
tends to his good: When God receives a Promiſe, he is
gracious to thee, not needy in himſelf; <hi>Qui non creſcit
ex redditis, ſed in ſe creſcere facit redditores,</hi> (ſaith St.
<hi>Auſtin, Ep.</hi> 45.) who cannot grow by thy Addition,
but will make thee grow by Diminution, adding and
bettering thy Payments into thine own boſome; as he
makes thy graſſe to flouriſh, by the vapour ſent up to
himward, and thence diſtilled back again. Thus he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
thee, not onely at the time of Payment, but at the
time of Promiſe. As <hi>Solomon</hi> was the richer for finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Temple, ſo was <hi>David</hi> the abler for promiſing:
<hi>Wilt thou build a houſe for me</hi> (ſaith God)? <hi>behold, I
have built thee a houſe for ever.</hi> A willing heart is bleſt
with a large hand; but coldneſſe of will is alſo puniſh'd
with ſhrinking of Power.</p>
            <p>
               <q>May we not do liberally (will ſome reply) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
promiſe? Not ſo well. A good Act ingrafted
into one or more vertues of higher ſtrayn, is much
ennobled: Morall Excellence, by reſpect to God, is
turned to Religion; by Promiſe, to Devotion: 'tis
now become both Obedience and Sacrifice. Fair
Buildings, after Dedication, are much more reverend;
ſo, much more holy are our Souls and Bodies, when
they are vow'd the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is no ſuch Diſcipline to train up a Chriſtian
in the way of Perfection, as that of Confeſſion, (which
is now alſo diſus'd) and this other of Vowing; whereof
the one makes us aſham'd of doing amiſſe, the other
prevents it, and further emboldens us to do good: That
ſerves to mortifie ſin, and This not onely ſo, but to
quicken Vertue: for the tying up the Soul from wonted
looſneſſe to ſome retir'd purpoſe, or holy work, both
cuts off many occaſions, many objects of ſin, and ſets
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115757:7"/>
the Votary to his courſe and task without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
'Tis a great conqueſt which it brings unto us, of
maſtering our ſelves: for hereby our hearts are fixed,
our wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls confirmed, which adds as much perfection to
vertue, as Obſtinacy adds evill to Vice. <q>'Tis a glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
hearing, when Righteouſneſſe in her turn is
drawn with cart-ropes; when the Treaſure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is kept ſafe under many locks; good Intentions
ſeconded with Vowing.</q> But that which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it, is the near and abſolute ſubjection of the
Soul to God, wholly ſurrendred up unto his ſervice, for
he that ſubjects himſelf by promiſe unto him, yields up
both his actions, and alſo the power of working; and
(as <hi>Anſelm</hi> compares it) he bequeathes the Fruit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Tree alſo; Fruit, leaves, branches, body,
root, and All: a Condition, This, moſt like to that in
Heaven, the very next ſtep to true Bleſſedneſſe, which
chiefly conſiſts in a perfect union with God moſt
bleſſed. So that the difference is but this, A Vow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothes,
and Heaven wedds.</p>
            <p>Pardon me this commendation of Vows, becauſe
they are uſually wrong'd by diſcommendatiòn; and the
cold froſt of mens hearts is over-bound with chiller
wind of Diſſwaſion.</p>
            <p>But do I now entice you to Will-worſhip, to a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
fancy, ſuch as the Adoration of Angels? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid:
if it be ſuch, 'tis repugnant to God's will. But that
which I preach, though not by him commanded, is by
him commended; no Precept to all his Servants, and
yet a Counſell to certain friends; Counſell that will
make us men, not onely according to his Word, but
according to his Heart. Men like the Apoſtles, who left
all to be followers of Chriſt. Again do I toll you on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115757:7"/>
into needleſſe danger, the danger of breaking an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſterable
Vow. That which thou canſt not maſter,
do not promiſe: for (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> inſtructs thee) <hi>Si non
voviſſes minor eſſes, non pejor:</hi> Leſſe thou maiſt be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Vowing, not worſe; but leſſe howſoever. Wouldſt
thou be great, and never expoſe thy ſelf to hazardous
difficulty? Danger is ever the Porter to Greatneſſe.
<hi>He that conſiders the wind ſhall not ſow, and he that fears
rain ſhall not reap, Ecclus.</hi> 11. No proceeding in the
way of Man, or of Chriſtian, without perill. And for
what ſhould we ever venture, if not for a maſſe of
Glory? Know alſo, that the danger lies not in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Vow, but in the weakneſſe of the Vower: So
excuſe thine own Weakneſſe, that thou do not ſlander
the ſtrength of others Excellence; though thou want
Power thy ſelf, be not guilty of wanting Will by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
others: if Power be preſent, be alſo an Actor,
leſt by reſolving to ſtand unbound where thou mayſt,
thou ſtand more rigorouſly bound where thou muſt;
and in no leſſe danger of non-performance: For he that
factiouſly denies to go farther than he needs muſt,
ſhews, that he would not go ſo far; whereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
a debtor even of that which he pays, becauſe he
pays unwillingly. Whether thou vow, or vow not,
God exacts nothing but true endeavour, which is more
wanting to the wilfull Refuſer, than to the unwilling
Breaker. Do I ſeek to abridge your liberty? No, rather
to enlarge it. Are the Angels in Priſon becauſe they
are confin'd to goodneſſe? then is God the cloſeſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.
No, no; the nearer our ſervice to God, the more
perfect our freedom. To range after the creature is to
be turned looſe to Slavery; to be tied up unto God, is
to be bound to Liberty. In the one is all ſadneſſe, as in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115757:8"/>
loſing our way through a wilderneſſe; in the other all
content, as in paſſing a pleaſant walk. <hi>Non te voviſſe
poeniteat, imo jam gaude jam tibi non licere quod cum tuo
detrimento licuiſſet,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi>) He that hath
bound himſelf to God by a Vow hath no more cauſe
to be ſad, than ſhe that hath wedded her ſelf to a man,
whom deſervedly ſhe beſt loves.</p>
            <p>Why then, how differ I from the Romaniſts? Take
heed of that; there is more care of differing from Them,
than to ſtand right in Our-ſelves. Thus: I do not think
that Vows for their own part are Meritorious, but in
Us Serviceable, to God Acceptable, ſuch as may rather
find than earn a Reward; for though they ſurpaſſe the
generall Precept, they do not exceed our perſonall Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
and thoſe we ought to imploy with all our might.
<q>If any Might do lie in promiſing, we ought to engage
our Hands with our Tongues, our Actions with
Words.</q> Beſides, no extraordinary ſervice in this or
that point can quit our ſcores with God, or ſuffice to
croſſe out thoſe other <hi>Items</hi> of our manifold offences.
Though ſome of God's ſervants be more willing, all
come ſhort; and ſhould any come home, they would
yet be unprofitable; to Him unprofitable, though not to
Themſelves. Now ſince there is no Preaching without
Oppoſing, let me Oppoſe for the other part too, and ſo
brandiſh on both ſides. The Superſtition of Papiſts is
cried down with a worſe crime of others, the Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
of Anti-papiſts. Vows are Meritorious, ſay
they; Damnable, cry theſe; and thou ſhalt neither add
nor detract, ſaith God: Add they ſo much as theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract?
an unpleaſing Circumſtance add they; but theſe
deſtroy the whole Subſtance. Nay, the Accuſer is many
times the worſer Thief, more guilty of the ſelf-ſame
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115757:8"/>
crime; ſo is the unſatiable Reformer. The humble Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
he accuſes of ſuperſtition, even his own ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
is alſo greater; greater is this of not-vowing,
than that of vowing, and produer thereof is he. They
ſtood on points of deep-dejected Service, he on points
of arrogant Adoption; they on much painfull Praying,
he on much eaſie Hearing: The retir'd Moncks he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
of Idleneſſe, his Idleneſſe is far more ſcandalous;
For they, though many, perform'd their frequent Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
together, and fed their Neighbours; he on the
ſame revenue contracted to one graſp, curſes God, and
grindes the face of the poor. The blindly devoted Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
he accuſes of Idolatry, his own Idolatry is far
groſſer: for they gave worſhip to bleſſed Saints, he to
every creature, every Picture and Fancy which the
Idolatry of Covetouſneſſe hath ſet up in his heart.
<hi>Rome</hi> he accuſes for her ſwarm of Prieſts, and ſundry
kinds of Locuſts; himſelf by taking away all diſtinction
of holy Orders and Vows, would make far more, all
in a like manner, one unholy Prieſthood.</p>
            <p>And thus to make all men Prieſts, is to unmake thoſe
that are. But you, my fellow-ſervants, ſtand up for your
Calling, and rejoyce in the vow of your Profeſſion,
whereby ye are ſeparate from the world to Chriſt; a
Vow ſuperlative, not onely ſanctifying your own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but giving you in charge all the Vows of the
People ſanctified under you. Other men's Vows ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them nearer into God's Houſhold, yours into his
Cloſet. And next under you are the Church-Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
preferr'd on their holy Promiſes to be Stewards
and Officers of God's Houſe; you his Eyes, and they
his Hands; you his Tongue, and they his two rowes of
Teeth; you to direct, and they to execute. All that are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115757:9"/>
drawn and lug'd to theſe places, do not remember, that
it was the ambition of the beſt King to be God's Dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper.
<hi>My heart is on thoſe who offer themſelves willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
When God cried out, <hi>Who is on my ſide?</hi> out ſtept
<hi>Levi,</hi> a whole Tribe at once; And God had no better
reward for their good ſervice, than to make them his
Houſhold-Chaplains and Servants.</p>
            <p>Now as none can be admitted into a Prince's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
without an Oath, ſo neither into an Office
under the King of Heaven. The heighth of their Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
requires the beſt aſſurance of our Loyalty. Duty
is not ſo firm as Promiſe, nor Promiſe as an Oath;
wherefore all ſacred Contracts with God are tied with
this knot: Baptiſm, Confirmation, Marriage, Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
are all celebrated in the Name of the Father,
the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, a Clauſe equivalent with
an Oath: But Ordination more expreſly and ſolemnly,
with a Head ſubmitted to Imprecation, with a Mouth
kiſſing and ſwearing, with a Hand ſubſcribing, and a
knee bowing. For Swearing, I could call a Jury of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
but let one ſtand for all: If God himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
his Promiſe with an Oath when he made his
Son a Prieſt, Shall thy word be taken before his? or wilt
thou, that makeſt a ſcruple of all ſwearing, appear
more holy than God? No. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear, The Lord
liveth, in Truth, in Judgment, in Righteouſneſs, Jer.</hi> 4. 13.
No doubt of the Oath, but be ſure of the Adjuncts; of
Truth, that thou know the matter fully, and deliver it
unfainedly; of Judgment, that thou conſider it delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
with thy ſelf, and deliver it judicially before the
Magiſtrate; of Righteouſneſſe, that thou weigh both
the Poſſibility and Honeſty. Wherefore thus Promiſe,
Vow, Swear to the Lord; and when thy hands are ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115757:9"/>
tied to the Plow, that thou canſt not let them go, do
not look back with thine eyes, as wiſhing to be looſe; let
theſe Bonds be thy Triumph.</p>
            <p>The Promiſſory Oath, leads me aſide to the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
and 'tis but a little aſide. For, as the one obliges
to a profeſſion of future Offices, ſo the other to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of paſt Offences: the one freely taken by our
ſelves, the other judicially exacted, <hi>ex Officio Judicis,</hi> by
the Officious inquiry of the Eccleſiaſticall Judge. Some
Innovators would fain purge the Conſiſtory of this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Oath: but how unworthily, you may eaſily ſee by
the Matter, the Proceeding, the End. For in what
Matter is this Oath adminiſter'd? in ſuch as may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
weak fleſh to Perjury? The matter is indeed Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall,
but not Capitall: Some, perchance for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Life of the Body, may hazzard the Life of the
Soul; few (I hope) for inferior Motives: A little meer
ſhame is an evill, not comparable to the double guilt
of ſin and perjury. For theſe are ever to be loaded with
fear or puniſhment, the other quickly ſets you free and
vaniſhes: eſpecially, being ſuch as it is, a ſhame that
maketh not to be aſham'd; the Pillory may be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Pennance cannot, 'tis like a Cure without any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Scar. Think rightly of Deponents, and (as the
Law doth) humanely and religiouſly, then is the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
doubt of Perjury ſufficiently prevented. But
how proceeds this Oath? Violently, as 'tis objected?
with intrenching on God's hidden Prerogative, with
forcing of Nature, with wreſting of judiciall Order?
Nothing leſſe: here's no Tyrannicall ſearch of hearts,
no breach into God's Peculiar ſecrets utterly conceal'd;
but only a neerer inquiry into ſcandalous and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deeds, partly broken out all ready, and further ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115757:10"/>
nor is it true, that the Defendant is unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
forc'd to ſtand a party againſt himſelfe; nor true,
that the Judge is irregularly become a party againſt the
Defendant: The Adverſary which troubles all, and yet
ſeems loath to be found, is the Traytour Sin, a lowd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
whoſe foul clamour betrayes the Entertainer.
Though ſin hide its Head, yet the Foot-ſteps, the Sent,
and Cry is commonly left behind; Effects are the Foot-ſteps,
Probabilities the Sent, Report the Cry: All which
ſupply the place of open Accuſers, and hunt out the
Malefactors; they hunt them out, as <hi>Adam</hi>'s flight pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
him at his back, as <hi>Cain</hi>'s face accus'd him to his
face, as <hi>Sodoms</hi> cry call'd for a ſtorm on their heads.
Any of theſe tokens may ſtartle a vigilant Over-ſeer,
as well as an expreſſe Information, any hint may ſuffice
to ſtir a Queſtion, though not to clear the Deciſion.
Wherefore, if ſin lye cunningly conceal'd, Juſtice muſt
be wiſely Inquiſitive: ſo long as the Thorn ſticks in the
ſides of the Church, partly diſcern'd, and partly hid;
that which appears, muſt cauſe a ſearch of that which
appears not: whether it be the Matter, as <hi>Achans</hi> theft;
Perſon, as the unknown Murtherer; Circumſtance, as
the place in <hi>Suſanna</hi>'s ſlaunder; no proceeding till thoſe
be drawn forth, which ſometimes cannot be without
ſwearing the D<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ponent, to diſcover the whole and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Truth. Some kind of ſin, being ever done in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and in no other Court puniſhable, cannot elſe be
puniſh't: And no way more honourable for the party,
then to be tried by his owne word: And nothing more
worthy of the Judges favour, then the Partie's own
confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Then what's the end? crooked, as it is noys'd? that
the Deponent may become a prey? No, that Truth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115757:10"/>
may be gain'd. What? that by ſpeaking Truth he may
accuſe himſelfe? No, that either he may quit his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
or confeſſe his guilt; which Confeſſion differs
from accuſing, as Tenting from Wounding. And what
next? to be then puniſh't with ſhame and ruine? No,
to be amended by a fatherly and ſaving correction, ſuch
as in other Churches, the humble Soul will ingenuouſly
ſeek by voluntary Confeſſion; a practice rather ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
than ever condemn'd, even with us (Brethren)
who live ſo Anti-popiſhly undiſciplin'd,</p>
            <p>What ſtrength have now thoſe wonted Objections,
which are ſtill repeated, as if they had never been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd;
Fear of Perjury in the matter queſtion'd, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in the Proceeding, inſnaring of Brethren touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the End? What fear of perjury, when ſhame is a
leſſer Evill then that? What violence in the Judge,
when the clamor of Sin will not let him reſt? What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring
of Brethren, when their health is mainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
If every wholſome Ordinance, ſhould be ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
rejected for the accidentall Evill, which ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
from thence may gather, ſtop your Ears at the
Word, fly the Sacrament; in the one ye may ſuck
the ſavour of Death, in the other ye may eate your own
Damnation. Yet, as none but a <hi>Judas</hi> will abhor the
bread, leſt a Divell ſhould enter into him; ſo none but
the wicked-minded, ſuch a one as may paſſe, <hi>pro Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſo
&amp; Convicto,</hi> will mutter againſt this Oath, leſt it
ſhould turn to his poyſon. He that ſpites the Gallows,
though it be the Engin of Death, is, or would be, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor;
but this Ordinance is a proviſion for Life,
whoſe direct and proper conſequents are, the opening of
Truth, the rooting out of Exemplary ſin, the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Peace of ſinners: and, beſides the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115757:11"/>
to the party ſworn, it works alſo many publick
Ends, not deer even with the loſſe of ſome particular
perſons, Scandall remov'd, Juſtice maintain'd, the
Church Edified, God glorified.</p>
            <p>This policy of the Church, being never Thundered
down by any plain prohibition of Scripture, is ſtrongly
buttreſſed up by its generall precept of Obedience: as
in the firſt of Saint <hi>Pet.</hi> ch. 2. v. 13. <hi>Submit your ſelves to
every Ordinance of man,</hi> even of man, <hi>for the Lords ſake;</hi>
The Magiſtrate when he croſſes not the ſupream Maſter,
doth ever bear his Perſon. Submit your ſelves to Him,
therefore, as to God, even with your ſouls; <hi>Let every
ſoul be ſubject to higher Powers, for there is no Power but of
God, Rom.</hi> 13. 1. Though an Oath be <hi>vinculum Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,
Num.</hi> 30. a chain laid on the Soul; yet ought it
no more to be refus'd, than a chain laid on the Body, in
like caſe of a ſuſpected crime. The Goſpell being ſent
to all Nations, govern'd by different Lawes, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
no ſet form, but only Obedience to that, which
is any where eſtabliſhed. By which implied Warrant,
each particular Church is authoriz'd to conſtitute her
Nationall Orders; but in this Order, all Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
(a great ſigne that it is very Naturall:) and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if God's peculiar Policy may bear any ſway with
your Imitation, know that in his judiciall Ordinances
over Jewry, himſelfe did immediately, and expreſſely
injoyn this form: and in matters, both Capitall and
leſſe Criminall, in caſe of Theft, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 11. When
goods intruſted miſ-carry, an Oath of the Lord ſhall
be between them, that he hath not put his hands to his
Neighbour's goods: in caſe of Adultery, <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 19.
<hi>If the ſpirit of jealouſie come upon a Man, the Prieſt ſhall
charge the Woman with an Oath;</hi> in caſe of Murder,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115757:11"/>
               <hi>Deut. 21. v. 6. When a man is ſlain, all the Elders of the
City, that is next unto the ſlain man, ſhall waſh their hands
over the heifer that is beheaded in the Valley; And they
ſhall teſtifie and ſay, Our hands have not ſhed this Blood,
neither have our eyes ſeen it; Be Mercifull, O Lord.</hi> If
in the weightieſt Matters, ſurreption of Goods, deſile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Body, ſpoil of Life, an Oath might be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and from perſons, happily unblameable, an honeſt
Man, a civill Woman, a whole City; and on ſlight
grounds, power of the Houſe or Field, jealouſie of an
ill Husband, Vicinity of place, and all to ſatisfie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
loſſes; why, not then an Oath with us, in leſſe
matters, from ſcandalous perſons, on greater ſuſpitions,
for publick good?</p>
            <p>Would you ſee the practice of this precept, how
Gods rule hath been follow'd by the example of Men?
this form hath been anciently obey'd, when the Oath
was dangerous to the Perſon ſworn; So did <hi>Achan</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to <hi>Joſhuah, Michaiah</hi> to <hi>Ahab, Jeremy</hi> to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi>
all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Eſdras:</hi> ſo did <hi>Peter</hi> to the Jewiſh Councill,
<hi>Stephen</hi> to the high Prieſt, <hi>Paul</hi> to the Captain: ſo did
one Neighbour to another, as from <hi>Solomons</hi> ſuppoſition
you may gather, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 6. 22. Yea, ſo ſhould every one
confeſſe his theft, only upon generall Curſing, without
a particular Inquiry, <hi>Pro. 29. v.</hi> 24. Much more his
fault, being queſtion'd, and on the publick behalf, and
before the Judge, and on his Oath. Before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
who ſuſtains Gods Perſon, a meer Interrogatory
is little leſſe conſtringent than the Oath added; for as
the perjur'd man, calls God a witneſſe to a Lie, ſo the
falſe anſwerer lies to God's face: ſo that from ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
an anſwer may be, and is well taken without it;
Nevertheleſſe, God in his wiſdome hath abundantly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115757:12"/>
provided againſt the dull inconſiderance of the vulgar
people, by preſcribing to the Jews, and every where
by permitting an Oath. Good reaſon for it you <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ave
ſeen, you have ſeen God's Law, and the Interpreter
thereof, the Saints Practice; and how far, or in what
caſes, Obedience thereto hath been commanded and
yielded: for proof whereof, I have turn'd my Bible in
the Church; do not you at Home turn yours for Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
leſt unhappily the Devill interpret; to ſome
he hath don't already, as appears by their cunning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
againſt the Church in this particular. For though
the ſame Oath be practiſed in Temporall Courts, in the
Chancery, Exchequer, Common-Pleas, and be there
put to the Defendant, Witneſſe, or Jury; though the
Body elſe-where be ſometimes Rack'd to draw out
confeſſion, they do not gainſay: Onely they grudge
againſt this Rack of the Soul in the Examination of the
Church; that which onely troubles them, is the Power
of the Church. All Courts of Judicature partake the
ſame reaſon, the ſame ground of their power, for All
derive it from Chriſt. Yet becauſe the Church is leſſe
arm'd with external might to redreſſe her wrongs, they
firſt aſſay the weaker Fort, that when they find the
ſame flaw in a ſtronger, their malignity may grow
more confident, and ſucceſſively batter down all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>But you, my Brethren, who have ſworn to obey your
Ordinary in all things lawfull, have made this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Oath a part of your Promiſſory; you have taken
<q>an Oath that you will take this Oath, which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
refuſe nor diſgrace without breaking the other.</q>
Concerning this and other Injunctions, ſince you have
paſt a promiſe to God, it muſt be your neceſſary Care,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115757:12"/>
and my next Argument, that you keep it. <hi>Promiſe to the
Lord, and keep it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Second main Propoſition, Holy Promiſes
once made muſt be neceſſarily kept. <hi>When thou abſtaineſt
from vowing, it ſhall be no ſin unto thee, Deut.</hi> 23. 22.
The not-doing may or may not be ſin, according as the
caſe ſtands; howſoever, the not-Vowing ſhall not be ſin,
for where no Law hath commanded the form of Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there the omiſſion can be no tranſgreſſion. Leſſe
righteous thou mightſt have been, not more ſinful; but
having once undertaken to ſhine, thou muſt continue a
Star, or go out a Snuff; after thou haſt once betrothed
thy Liberty to God, a ſtrong Neceſſity is laid upon
thee; that which is gone out of thy lips, God will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
require at thy hand, not now as thine own, but as
truly his; for Promiſe gives over to another the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion
of Right, in earneſt of future performance.
And therefore, as to violate a betrothed Virgin is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
for Adultery, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 24. ſo the breach of holy
Promiſe is no leſſe than Sacriledge.</p>
            <p>For prevention whereof, God, who hath given no
Law that thou ſhouldeſt Promiſe, hath given a Law
that thou ſhouldſt Perform; and he hath very cautiouſly
preſcribed the manner. Be it done Entirely, Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Diligently. Entirely, <hi>Levit. 22. v. 23. A bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
or a ſheep that hath a member ſuperfluous or lacking,
thou maiſt preſent for a Free-offering; but for a Vow it ſhall
not be accepted.</hi> A free gift is not examin'd; but in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of debt due upon Bond, the Seals are call'd for.
The performance of that holy Office which thou haſt
vow'd, as it may not be extravagant by adding new-fangled
conceits of thine own; ſo it muſt not be one
grain too light, by ſubtracting the leaſt circumſtance,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115757:13"/>
not by omitting a Ring in Marriage, a Croſſe in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
a Knee in the Euchariſt; not by leaving out or
changing one Collect in the form of Liturgy. 'Tis not
with Thee, as with thoſe Forrainers with whom thou
trad'ſt in Ware and Religion; thoſe <hi>Alexanders,</hi> thoſe
Copper-ſmiths, who in every Port-Town may do us
much harm, and by way of the Church may alſo myne
a paſſage into the State: They are free, but thou haſt
ſworn; thy performance is Monſtrous, if not Entire.
And Willing it muſt be too; thou ſhalt keep as thou
haſt-vow'd it, Willingly unto the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 23.
Thou that at once uſeſt and confuteſt the Church Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
with froward ſignes, and unſeemly tokens;
with a ſcrewed face, and a warpt ſhoulder: doſt thou
think that thou haſt performed thy Vow? No, not the
Law. Thy Faith to God? No, not thy Obedience to
Man. But, God requires more yet; Diligence in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance;
<hi>When thou voweſt a vow to the Lord, thou ſhalt
not be ſlack to pay it, Deut.</hi> 23. 21. He that ſearches not
before-hand the Rubrick and Rules of the Church, to
know his duty; he that afterward conforms in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only, not in Practice; or in Practice not yet, or not at
all times, not without Omiſſion and Intermiſſion, not
without Complaining and Citing, not without Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
Deprivation, Excommunication; doubtleſſe he
would not at all. Should thy covenant-ſervant thus
ſerve thee, with wilfull ignorance, neglect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
deliver thy cup without reverence, with <hi>Cain</hi>'s
face, and ſcarce ſo, but ſlowly and by fits; How
wouldſt thou ſerve him? and yet perchance thou haſt
need of his Attendance. God requires obſervance, not
for his own, but for your want; He hath not need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
but you to pay; nor is he ſo exacting of his own
dues, as carefull for your diſcharge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:115757:13"/>
Which that you may obtain, by making true pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in manner anſwerable, give me leave to joyn my
Advice. Firſt, Make triall of matters more Eaſie, and
thoſe for a certain Time; that by habituall Diſcipline,
you may prepare and harden your ſelves for Vows
more difficult: This is to reckon the coſt before you
build, and to make proviſion before you warr. As it
argues Diffidence to venture nothing on Grace and
humble Endeavour; ſo to attempt the higheſt reach of
Perfection at firſt leap, and to bind over your ſelves
wholly before you have gotten experienced Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in any part, this is a raſh Undertaking. The way
to keep a Vow, is to Vow that which we well hope to
keep.</p>
            <p>But, O the perjur'd condition of many an haſty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and outwardly demure Saint! who without any
preparative conſideration, having ſolemnly plighted
his Faith, having done it with Mouth, Hand, and
Knee, twice or thrice in Academicall Degrees, twice
in Ordinations, and as oft in his Inſtitutions as he can,
doth preſently go forth with reſolution to break it;
charges his wit to invent fallacy againſt his Duty, and
to Preach againſt that Vow which enables him to
Preach. Can there be any Atheiſm more hideouſly
contemptuous! Hand and Seal given to man, will tie us
to our Word, or to the Jayl; onely God can have no
fair dealing, no ſufficient redreſſe. In point of holy
Promiſe, (God be mercifull to us) we have loſt all
conſcience, the conſcience that is, runs clean contrary
to our promiſe, whereby if we ſtand bound, we think
our ſelves bound to break it; the faſter tied, the looſer
we play; and that which was Duty before it was
vow'd, is by vowing eſteem'd unlawfull. If God make
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115757:14"/>
a Promiſe to Us, though it be but Conditionall, we
claim it as Abſolute; no diſobedience of ours can ſet
Him free, we allow not his Majeſty ſo much Mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as on our change to be conſtant to Juſtice: But
when our ſelves have dedicated a Promiſe to him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by our Governours, or alſo in our own perſons, be
it never ſo full and abſolute, any or no condition ſhall
ſuffice to cancell it; and we that deny our ſelves the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Vowing, will take an unmeaſur'd liberty of
Diſannulling, or perchance feign a Neceſſity of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
what indeed we would not do. And to cure this
Evill, what remedy? <q>For ſince all the Land hath out
off God's inviolable Tenure, formerly confirmed by
the whole Land; ſince all are involved in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sacriledge, What man with effectuall courage
can do him right? or with what face controul a
Vow-breaker?</q> 
               <hi>Injuſta vincula rumpat Juſtitia,</hi> ('tis,
I confeſſe, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s rule.) Bad Promiſes are well
broken, for ſuch are Threatnings rather than Promiſes,
and Threatnings are recall'd without Injury; whereas
to ſecond bad words with like performance, is double
wrong. The miſ-applying of this Rule, when men are
bent to tranſpoſe the name of Good and Evill, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
miſchievous; for under this pretext, ſome have
recanted or neglected their own duty, and ſome have
nullified the piety of others. Falſe Brethren that crept
into the Church, by ſwearing Obedience, have baſely
betraid her to her enemies for a piece of bread, abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuppoſing, that any Rites, in themſelves indifferent,
may as eaſily be made Antichriſtian by cenſure of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Rebellion, as they were made neceſſary by ſworn
Covenant under publick Authority. <q>Some diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeming
the Churchwardens Oath, as a meer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115757:14"/>
Engine to get Fees, eſteem it their Office not
to diſcharge their Office at all, leſt they be counted
Medlers and Buſie-bodies; from whence ungodly
Neglect growes into Cuſtome, and Sin preſcribes
againſt Duty. Here Churches drop down unſpied,
there Souls hang deſperately ruinous; and all for want
of 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Reparation, or 12<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Preſentation in due ſeaſon.</q>
Other ungracious children blaſting the works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with the name of Superſtition, and colouring their
rude Sacriledge with the name of Zeal, make it their
gainfull Godlineſſe to raze out the yet-unraz'd God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
of their Predeceſſors. The old Romans ſhall
judge theſe Novell Chriſtians; they, after ten years
omiſſion, paid the Vows of <hi>Camillus</hi> with their own
Jewells; theſe, after long poſſeſſion of Conſecration,
would wring from God all the Vows of their Fathers
into their own hands, and again rake over the poor
gleanings which the Robbers have left. But let not
Sacriledge in the People hire the Prieſt to Diſobedience
and Treachery; let not a few Crums bribe you from
barking againſt the Thief, and guarding the Houſe of
the Lord; to which Care you eſpecially are bound, by
my third and laſt Propoſition, directed to <hi>Thoſe that be
round about him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Promiſes made to God by them which be round
about him, are in reſpect of the Parties moſt conſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent:
And firſt, becauſe they are made to God. If a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
paſt to our Neighbour, ought to be kept, though
it be to our loſſe; much more to God, when it alſo
tends to our good. Will not his goodneſſe hold thee
firm? let his Fear chain thee. That Name which begets
Awe and Truſt in Human Contracts, is much more
Awfull in Religious Vows. There he is called onely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115757:15"/>
for a Witneſſe, here he is alſo a Party: thou ſweareſt
now both By Him, and To Him. Did men ſeriouſly
conſider to whom they ſtand engag'd, they would be
more heedfull of their Obſervance. 'Tis the King to
whom thou ſweareſt Loyalty, though a Juſtice take
thy Oath; 'tis God to whom thou makeſt thy Vow,
though the Biſhop receive it. His Receiver thou maiſt
ſometimes delude, Him thou canſt not. Words and
Thoughts are to him more legible, than Actions to us,
for God is Light; whoſoever ſeeks to rob Him doth
leſſe lie hid, than a Thief in a Candle.</p>
            <p>Again, as the Majeſty of your Lord God obliges
you, to more awfull Reverence; ſo in reſpect of your
ſelves, doth the neer dependance of your Office, to a
greater fidelity. Perſwaſions and Arguments may be
needfully urg'd to Lay-men; nothing to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Officers but promiſe: Others are onely bound by
order of their Praedeceſſors, you by Perſonall dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
they to naked Aſſent, you to Action; they by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
you by voluntary and deliberate Oath. Say not
before the Angel, (or thy Biſhop) ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> that
thy promiſe was out of Ignorance: Thou a ſeer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy eyes were open? thou blind, and preſume to
be a guide? thou a Meſſenger of Truth, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd?
thou perjur'd, and yet ſo neerly tied to fidelity!
Want of breeding, Ignorance, Blind zeal, Company,
Profit, leſſe Obligation may in ſome part excuſe a Lay-man;
'tis impoſſible for an unconform'd Miniſter, to be
tolerably diſhoneſt. Nothing ſo much aggravates the
Defection of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as his two Antecedent Viſions
and Dialogues with God: how frequent yours have
been, you well know; how many publick Vowings, ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115757:15"/>
many Dialogues with the Moſt High. Through ſuch
nearneſſe of Relation, we behold Treachery as through
a multiplying Glaſſe, far greater than otherwiſe it
would appear; and we do not onely apprehend, but find
it ſo indeed. To poyſon a King is not murder, but
Treaſon; but for a Wife or Servant to do it, is double
Treaſon: And breach of Vow to God, is not Treaſon,
but Sacriledge; in a Prieſt <hi>ſacro-Sacrilegium,</hi> the moſt
execrable kind of Sacriledge, doubled by the condition
of the Perſon: Which being conſider'd, nothing can be
more injurious to God, more dangerous to Himſelf,
more exemplary and pernicious to Others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a Kiſſing <hi>Judas,</hi> a Thieviſh Treaſurer, a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Divel, what more injurious to God? for beſides,
the unkind requitall of much Infidelity, for much Love
and Truſt; the treacherous defailance brings with it a
ſcandalous Repute on God's ſervice, who will not be
thought a good Maſter, ſo long as his neereſt Servants
Revolt from their Station. As in Heaven, there is moſt
Joy for a Converted ſinner, who comes from far; ſo
there is moſt grief for a perverted Servant, who goes off
ſo neer.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, The Evill falls the heavier on himſelf;
the more Immediate he was before, the leſſe Mediation
to re-unite him: If the Man and Wife be two, who
ſhall intercede? perchance ſome friend, as deer as a
Wife, elſe none. But if God and the Prieſt be two,
who ſhall there Officiate an Atonement? The fall of
an Angell, makes him Divel; no ſpace for him betwixt
Heaven and Hell. The ſin of a common Prieſt, coſt as
much Sacrifice as the ſin of the whole people; but the
ſin of <hi>Eli,</hi> the High Prieſt was not to be purg'd away
by any Sacrifice whatſoever. The nearer to God you are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115757:16"/>
by Office, ſo much the farther off by neglect. What
can waſh Water, or ſeaſon Salt, or ſanctifie the Prieſt!
if theſe have loſt their Purity, Savour, and Holineſſe,
what can do on them their Office? We may write up
the forlorn Sentence of the Plague, <hi>Domine miſerere,</hi>
Lord have Mercy upon them! no Phyſition but the God
offended.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe the Prieſt is an Angell, he ſeldome
falls without a Train; the height of his Dependance,
enlarges the contagious Power of deriving his diſorder:
Well might his ſin be rated aequivalent to that of the
whole people, for the defection which to day is His,
to morrow will be Theirs: <q>If he renounce the Vowes
of a Prieſt, why not they the Vowes of Chriſtians?
Prone they are of themſelves, to that form of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which is moſt eaſie and leſſe chargeable: if he
by neglect of Duty and Ceremony, by Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of unyoak't Liberty, ſhall puſh forward this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
great muſt the fall of the Church be. For
Church-Wardens, the next Pillars, being men cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of the People, they alſo will alternately ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
their Office, and prove as careleſſe of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Temple, as the Prieſt of the Spirituall. O what
ſhall become of the Congregation, when their
Guides come in or go out, the worſt of men? what
ſhall become of the Church, when Officers are choſen
to look to its decay?</q> An Officer more neglectfull of
Order, than the Common Laity, is much like his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;
that Thetcht while the Body of the Church is Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
or like his Table; that foul and moth-eaten, while
the Pewes are fair and garniſh't: or like his Surpleſſe;
that coorſe and ragged, while the Womens Aprons are
fine and ſound: Wherefore, He and his Church, juſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115757:16"/>
as they proceed, ſo they will end, both in a like ruine.
Neceſſity will at length cauſe us to be all Browniſts,
left without Churches, and the ſtream of deprav'd
Cuſtom, carry us into Libertiniſm, from thence into
Fanaticall madneſſe, Miſery, and Death: at length, God
himſelf will add ruine, and call for <hi>Zim</hi> and <hi>Ohim</hi> to be
his Prieſts: for ſo he hath done already to many dead
Carcaſs'd, and waſted Churches. Thoſe places which
our Fathers vow'd to Gods perpetuall Service, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
by a degenerate Poſterity, to their own abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
the ſacred wills of devout Teſtators, confirm'd by
Generall Parliament, awfully fenc'd with ſolemn Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations
of the Prieſt, ſtrongly tied by God's expreſſe
Inhibition, <hi>Lev. 27. 28. Whatſoever is conſecrated to me,
ſhall not be taken away,</hi> are now quite fruſtrated: the
Holy Sanctuaries are reform'd, from Dens of Idleneſſe,
to Dens of Rapine; from Babels of pride, to Sties of
Luxury: where once God's Altar ſtood, there is the
Glutton's Table, perchance the Bed of the Adulterer?
the Sculls of Holy Fathers are dug up, to make ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Cellarage for Hogs-heads and Drunkards; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Chalices which held the Blood of Chriſt, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
into Bowls; and 'tis hop'd, that by demoliſhing
the Walls, all hand-writing like that againſt <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi>
is ſufficiently prevented. But whence all this, the ſound
whereof makes both the ears of them that hear to Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle?
even from the defection of Prieſts, careleſſe of
their Vowes, ſhort of their pretended Holineſſe. No
great evil hath ever befaln the Church, but by this way:
by Perſecution it ever proſper'd, and only decay'd by the
Treachery of her Officers. <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell to Idolatry, but
who made the Calf? <hi>Aaron.</hi> The Ark was taken and
prophan'd, but through whoſe fault? the Sons of <hi>Ely.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115757:17"/>
Iſrael</hi> forſook the Divine Worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
built them high Places, but who ſerv'd thereon? <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi>
Prieſts: How fell the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
why ſo many of ours at once, and why are the reſt
yet-ſtanding in ſo much danger? through the Default,
the Corruption, the Tergiverſation, and perjury of
Prieſts, and Officers.</p>
            <p>And in this particular Place I cannot imagine, that
ſimple Women (zealouſly, though blindly, affected)
would ſo quickly re-iterate their Rebellious Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
contrary to Oath and Subſcription, if ſome trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Guide did not ſecretly underbear and encourage
them with peſtilent Inſtructions. But know this, you
of the Laity, that whenſoever ye hearken to ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravers
of Form and Diſcipline, critically bent for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation,
ſacred pretenders of a moſt tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and yet unſenſible of ſolemn Oaths; you chuſe
for your Leaders perjur'd Hirelings, wicked Vow-breakers;
and what can you expect of the Building but
Ruine, when the firſt ſtone of the Foundation is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury?
In all this I ſpeak the Truth, I lie not: So help
me God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; To Whom,
&amp;c. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
