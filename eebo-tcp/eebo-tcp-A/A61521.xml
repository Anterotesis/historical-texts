         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to resolve the <hi>Case</hi> by a very
subtle distinction of the <hi>Paper</hi>
and <hi>Ink</hi> of which the Book is
composed, and the <hi>Conceptions</hi>
of the mind contained therein;
<pb facs="tcp:49659:3"/>
the former he gives to the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi>
and the latter to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
which he proves ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
substantially; <hi>for,</hi> saith he, <hi>the
conceptions of the Book being
the outward images of what
was only in the mind of the
Author can belong to no other
than to him that formed them;</hi>
but against this ariseth a shrewd
objection, that by this means eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man hath right to the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
that is made of him, and
the Painter only to the <hi>Canvas</hi>
and <hi>Colours.</hi> To which he
answers very gravely, <hi>that the

immediate representation of
<pb facs="tcp:49659:4"/>
the Person, but of that Idea
of him which was in the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Painter.</hi> But upon
this another Controversie arises
(as we find every day that one
doth beget another) whether
that <hi>propriety</hi> which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath in the <hi>Conceptions</hi>
of his Book, can be disposed of
by way of <hi>Legacy,</hi> or no; and
all the resolution I can meet
with is, that it is <hi>probable</hi> he
may; but on the other side, the
<hi>Superiours</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> may
make use of the contrary <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,</hi>
and challenge the
<hi>Book</hi> for their own.</p>
            <p>It is very well known to
<pb facs="tcp:49659:4"/>
You, that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> was
lately a <hi>Member</hi> of Your <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
who was the <hi>Author</hi> of
the Book, to which this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Answer is made; What
<hi>Right</hi> You have challenged in
it I know not, but I think it
not likely he should dispose of
it to any but to Your selves;
since he saith, his first writing
against me was by his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours

Book he declares, <hi>that what he
writes was not his own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>SInce <hi>Your Lordships</hi> going from
<hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s <hi>Epistle Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logetical
to a</hi> Person <hi>of</hi> Honour
<hi>touching his Vindication of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet
<hi>came to my hands;</hi> and bears
<pb facs="tcp:49659:9"/>
date, <hi>from his Cell, March 21. A. D.</hi>
1674. <hi>being the Anniversary day of</hi>
S. Benedict. And he is not only
thus punctual in the date of his
<hi>Epistle,</hi> but he begins it with a very
particular account, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi>'s Book
was sent to him; viz. <hi>by the Letter-Post,
but partly to abate charges and
likewise to disguise the shape of a Book,
it was folded up in loose sheets with all
the Margins close pared to the very
quick.</hi> After I had observed so
much <hi>niceness</hi> in these, not very
material circumstances, I could
hardly expect that the least
line of the Book should escape
without numbering the words,
syllables, and letters in it, and
giving every one a distinct and
punctual confutation. But I
soon found several considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts gently passed over,
<pb facs="tcp:49659:9"/>
and indeed by the very bulk of his
Book, I presently perceived, that
he was more curious to give the
World an account, how the other
came to him, than careful to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it. For if he had treated
every thing that was of like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with equal exactness, it
might very well have passed for
the <hi>Second Tome</hi> of his <hi>Ecclesiastical
History.</hi> And in truth, the matter
of some part of it, is not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
for he tells so long a story in
the middle of it <hi>of the Kindness of
some and the unkindness of others in</hi>
England <hi>to him, and of the Books he
had written,</hi> that it looked very like
a <hi>Legend</hi> of himself; only I do not
find any <hi>Miracles</hi> he had done in any
of them.</p>
            <p>Before he comes to his <hi>Apologie</hi>
for himself, he takes great care to
<pb facs="tcp:49659:10"/>
make me understand the mighty
obligation laid upon me, by that
<hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> who was pleased
with so much <hi>Kindness</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
my Vindication from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
assaults of an enraged Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.
Which I was so justly
sensible of before, that Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
might have spared his pains; for
surely it was no small Favour to be
delivered from the paws of so fierce
a Creature, as he appeared to be in
his former Book; but to have it
done in so obliging a manner, by
a <hi>Person</hi> of so great <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi>
was as much beyond my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
to hope for, as it is now
above my Power to requite. I
with I were a Person of that <hi>Credit</hi>
and <hi>Interest</hi> to be able to express
my Gratitude in that very way
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> directs me to; for of all
things I desire to avoid <hi>the odious
<pb facs="tcp:49659:10"/>
character and brand of Ingratitude.</hi>
But since I make so small a Figure
in publick affairs, the utmost I can
do, is to save that <hi>Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
the farther trouble of making
<hi>Animadversions</hi> on this <hi>Epistle Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical.</hi>
Which is written with that
shew of humility and respect, that
those who look only on the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
would imagine him strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come off from the rage and fury
he was in, when he writ his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Book; but if we observe more
carefully his sly reflections and
crafty insinuations, we shall find
that he hath only learnt to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his passion, and to do the same
mischief with a fawning Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>The first part of his <hi>Epistle</hi> is
wholly spent in <hi>Vindication</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as to the <hi>sharpness of Style</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:49659:11"/>
bitter <hi>Invectives</hi> he had used against
me, which I shall briefly consider
before I come to the more material
parts of his Book.</p>

and raging with the violence of passion,
and so tormented with the <hi>creatures</hi> of his

expressing it to that degree in his <hi>Book,</hi>
as deserved rather the pitty, than the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of his Adversary? This the <hi>Person</hi> of

of his <hi>excellent Discourse,</hi>

but upon an impartial view of the
places in my <hi>Book</hi> at which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>

guilty of so much bitterness and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
passion: but when the reasons
were so many to convince him, that he
was the <hi>Author,</hi> he had rather still lay
the fault of his manner of writing upon
the commands of his <hi>Superiours,</hi> than
his own temper and inclination.</hi> Upon
this Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> makes many Apologies <hi>for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49659:12"/>
the sharpness of his style against me;</hi>

spins out a great part of his <hi>Epistle</hi> on this
<hi>subject;</hi> which he needed not to have
done, with any regard to me, as though I
were concerned at it; for I assure him, if I
would wish an Adversary to write so, as to
do the least prejudice to me, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to himself and his Cause, I would wish
him to write just after that Copy; and I
cannot easily think of a provocation great
enough to make me follow his example.
But he pleads for himself, <hi>that Charity it
self sometimes requires sharpness of style
and even bitter</hi> (that is, uncharitable) <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives.</hi>
I suppose he means such a sort
of <hi>Catholick Charity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 6.</note> as first <hi>damns</hi> us, and
then brings <hi>railing accusations</hi> against us:
and I do not question, but he that pleads
for <hi>bitter Invectives</hi> out of meer <hi>Charity,</hi>
could make as fine an harangue to shew
not only the admirable <hi>Charity,</hi> but even
the <hi>Mercy</hi> of Fire and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aggot: and he
knows the <hi>charitable</hi> method of the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>
is, first to put on the <hi>Sanbenits,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the Persons with <hi>Pictures</hi> of
<hi>Devils</hi> upon them, and then to carry them
to execution. I remember I have read that
<hi>Machiavils</hi> Son being summoned to appear
before the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Inquisition,</hi> to answer
to some things laid to his Charge; the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49659:13"/>
grave <hi>Inquisitors</hi> asked him, <hi>Whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
as the Church believed;</hi> he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>yes, and a great deal more;</hi> at which
they were not a little pleased, hoping to
get from his own words enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him; and asking him, <hi>What that was
which he believed more than the Church
believed,</hi> he gravely told them, it was,
<hi>That their Worships Informers were a pack
of Knaves.</hi> So indeed I should think that
I believed <hi>more than their Church believed,</hi>
should I believe that they damn us out of
meer charity, and write bitter Invectives
for a demonstration of their Kindness.
Alas! how hath the World been mistaken
in them! Their cruelty, is meer pitty; their
Invectives, Compassion; and their Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Charity.</p>
            <p>§. 2. But Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> wants not great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
for this; for he brings in no
meaner than <hi>of</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 7.</note>
               <hi>St.</hi> John Baptist, <hi>Christ and his Apostles,
and several Fathers of the Church for it.</hi>
It seems then, the practice of railing hath
Antiquity, Universality, and Consent for it;
which is much more than they can shew
for many other of their practices; and
which is the greatest wonder of all, they
have <hi>Scripture</hi> too: and that, not one single
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49659:13"/>
passage, like <hi>Hoe est corpus meum;</hi> but
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>the Prophets, Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
nay, S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> too, do all <hi>bear
witness</hi> to it. Any one would think, if
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> say true, the Bible were the
railingest Book in the World. What not
<hi>Moses the meekest man upon earth</hi> forbear
such <hi>bitter Invectives?</hi> not our <hi>Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
who <hi>when he was reviled, reviled
not again, when he suffered he threatned
not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>but committed himself to him that
judgeth righteously!</hi> not he, who hath
threatned Hell-fire to him that uses contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious
expressions against his Brother!
such as <hi>Zani,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 22.</note> or <hi>Scarron,</hi> or the like. Not
he,<note place="margin">11. 29.</note> who bids his Disciples <hi>learn meekness
from him,</hi> and was the most incomparable
pattern of it, that ever appeared in humane
nature! Not his <hi>holy Apostles!</hi> who charge
all Christians <hi>to put away all bitterness and
wrath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 31.</note> 
               <hi>and anger, and clamour, and evil
speaking!</hi> And would they indeed, do that
themselves, which they so severely forbid in
others? Where is Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s <hi>Charity</hi> for
them the mean while? While he produces
these examples to justifie his own bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he makes the most bitter Invective
not only against them, but even <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
it self. But what will not men do, or
say, to justifie their violent passions? If he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49659:14"/>
had stabbed me, he might as well have made
<hi>Phinehas</hi> his precedent; and if he had cursed
me, have quoted some passages in the <hi>Fsalms</hi>
for it. If <hi>Moses</hi> was so <hi>angry</hi> that he brake
the <hi>Tables of the Law;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 19.</note> doth Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
think, it was at any that spake against the
<hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>the Golden Calf?</hi> no; it was at
those who committed it: and it is probable
he might have been so, at those who
would have struck the <hi>second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
out of those <hi>Tables,</hi> or eluded the
<hi>force</hi> of it by vain and idle distinctions.
The great anger of the <hi>Prophets</hi> was against
those who drew the people to Idolatry:
and Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is so pertinent in his proofs as
to bring this to justifie his rage against me,
<hi>for writing against the Idolatry of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 11, 12, 13, 15, 16.</note> for so much he expresses in
several places. <hi>Our Saviour</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn
Baptist</hi> do express great zeal against the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees:</hi> but let Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
consider, they were a sort of sowre, ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
hypocrites, that would allow none a
good word, nor so much as <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
that were not of their way; that were
full of malice, and envy, and all evil passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and at the same time pretended highly
to <hi>mortification</hi> and more <hi>devotion</hi> than
others. I find nothing like <hi>Invectives</hi> in
all the <hi>writings</hi> of the <hi>holy Apostles;</hi> unless
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49659:14"/>
it were against the <hi>opposers,</hi> or <hi>corrupters</hi>
of <hi>Christianity;</hi> and when Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> proves
me to be <hi>guilty</hi> of either of those, I will
lay my self open to the darts of the most
Venomous Tongue among them. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of that I know no other cause in any
Books I have written, that should expose
me to the rage of these men, beside the
zeal I have therein discover'd for the <hi>honour</hi>
and <hi>purity</hi> of the Christian Religion, against
the fopperies and corruptions of the <hi>Roman
Church.</hi> And for such a <hi>Cause</hi> as this, I
am prepared to suffer, whatever their fury
and malice can raise up against me. This,
this is the <hi>Cause,</hi> which I hope I should not
be ashamed nor afraid to own and defend,
although Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> were as great
as his <hi>Charity.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> I
do from my heart honour and esteem,
(notwithstanding all the base suggestions
of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> to the contrary, even in this
<hi>Epistle Apologetical</hi>) but I do therefore so
much esteem it, because in it the Christian
Religion is preserved free from the frantick
heats of Enthusiasm and the dotages of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.
If they will undertake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me, that the things I condemn in
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> were any parts of the
Christian Religion delivered by <hi>Christ</hi> or
his <hi>Apostles,</hi> I shall diligently weigh and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49659:15"/>
consider what ever they have to say; but
if they only give hard words, and betray
impotent passions; if they shuffle and shew
tricks instead of reasoning; if all their <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
towards me lyes only in <hi>bitter inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,</hi>
they will do but little good upon
me, and I think not much to their own
Cause.</p>
            <p>§. 3. <hi>But I am mistaken all this while,
Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>doth not write this</hi> Apology <hi>to

at all, to charge me so often</hi> with preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricating
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
designing to destroy her, under a pretence
of defending her! <hi>These are some of the</hi>
flowers <hi>of Mr.</hi> Cressy'<hi>s</hi> Charity <hi>towards me,
which I have picked out of some few pages
of his</hi> Book; <hi>and he hath taken abundant
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49659:16"/>
care to prevent any unlikeness in the parts
of it. And doth Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
think, it is no breach of</hi> Christian
Charity <hi>to charge me upon such pittiful
grounds, with no less than carrying on
blasphemous, Atheistical, treacherous and
cruel designs? But if this be his</hi> Christian
charity, <hi>what would the effects of his</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<hi>be? Let now any indifferent person
judge, whether the</hi> Person <hi>of</hi> Honour <hi>had
not reason to say,</hi> That he never observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so many personal reflections and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,<note place="margin">P. 63.</note>
fuller of causless passions, and of
bitterness and virulence in so little room
in any Book.</p>
            <p>But whatever the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi>
thinks, Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> makes his appeal to the
<hi>genuine Learned Protestant</hi> English <hi>Clergy.</hi>
If he had been a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> who had done
me that great <hi>kindness,</hi> then Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
would have appealed to <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Honour;</hi>
and surely such are the most competent
Judges in cases of affronts and injuries:
but herein lyes Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s art which runs
throughout his <hi>Epistle,</hi> that he would fain se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
me from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and
make <hi>my cause</hi> distinct from <hi>hers:</hi> I do
not wonder, that they would part me from
my company, and deprive me of my shelter,
when they have such a mind to run me
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49659:16"/>
down. But these arts are easily understood:
and the design is too fine to hold, and too
apparent not to be seen through. Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
knows very well, the Use that was made at
<hi>Athens</hi> of the <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Dogs</hi> and the
<hi>Sheep;</hi> and what good words and fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
the <hi>Wolf</hi> made to the <hi>Sheep;</hi> if they
would but consent, that the <hi>Dogs</hi> might be
given up to be destroyed. And no doubt the
crafty Wolf would have made a very fine
speech to the Sheep, to have perswaded
them, that he had no manner of <hi>ill will to
them;</hi> for he had known them long and
loved them well, and alwayes looked upon
them as a company of very innocent and
harmless creatures; but for those <hi>Dogs</hi> that
were set to watch them, he knew how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
their principles were, and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to them, if occasion served; and
for all that he knew, these <hi>Dogs</hi> might have
<hi>Covenanted</hi> together to worry them, upon a
fair opportunity; and therefore for his
part, he could not but wonder at their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
that some of the stoutest Rams
among them, did not set upon those pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Currs; or at least, he hoped, they
would not be so regardless of their own
safety, as not to suffer some well-wishers to
the flock, to take them quietly and destroy
them. For alas! at the best, they do but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49659:17"/>
make a noise, and disturb the repose of
the Sheep; and if they were gone, there
would be nothing but unity and love left.
I need make no application of this to
Mr. <hi>Cressy;</hi> and I am far from the vanity
of supposing this capable of being applyed
to my case, any farther than as I am one of
those, who are at present engaged in the
<hi>Defence</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> against that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
It is the happiness, and honour of our
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that it hath in it at
this day such store of persons both able
and willing to defend her <hi>Cause</hi> (as, it may

and I look on my self as one of the meanest
of them: but it hath been my lot to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
more early and more frequently in

so great a hatred of my <hi>Adversaries</hi> upon
me; but I thank God, I have a good Cause
and the testimony of a good Conscience
in the management of it, and so long I
neither fear the waspishness of some, nor
the rage of others.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But this is their present design to
represent me as one of different principles
from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and not only
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49659:17"/>
different, but such as if well understood,
are <hi>destructive</hi> to it, and therefore they
very gravely advise our <hi>Reverend Bishops</hi>
to have a care of me, if they hope to
preserve the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And can
we think it is any thing else but meer
kindness and good will to our <hi>Church,</hi> that
makes them so solicitous for its welfare?
<hi>It is a sad thing,</hi>

use of the most invidious and reproachful

Protestant has appeared as a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the</hi> English <hi>Church and State against
me; but on the contrary even some</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
<hi>Prelates themselves have congratulated
and boasted of my supposed successful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
against the Catholick Church,
though ruinous only to themselves.</hi> Alas,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49659:18"/>
good man! his heart is even broke for
grief, that our <hi>Bishops</hi> take no more care
to preserve the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> The
<hi>Church</hi> he hath alwayes so entirely loved,
and ventured as much for her as any body,
while she was in prosperity, and there was
no danger; and only forsook her, when
she was not able to reward his Love. The
truth was, he gave her for gone at that
time; and then it was <hi>the late Church of
England</hi> with him; and no wonder when
he thought her dead, that he made Court to
a richer Mistress; but it was but a swooning
fit, she is come to her self again, and I hope
like to hold out much longer than that
which he hath chosen. And although
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s hands be now tyed, and he
hath entred into new Vows; yet he cannot,
for his heart, forget the kindness he had to
her in her flourishing condition, because
she was then very kind to him; he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
the marks of her favour, and the rich
presents she made him; and therefore some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the old Love revives in him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, at least so far that he cannot
endure to see her ill used; when her <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
neglect her, and her <hi>Sons</hi> prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with her. If Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s <hi>faith</hi> had
been as great as his <hi>Charity,</hi> to have made
him believe that she would ever have come
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49659:18"/>
to her self again, I cannot think he would
have forsaken her so unhandsomely; and
left her in a <hi>dying</hi> Condition: but who
could ever have thought that things would
have come about so strangely? But what
if all this present shew of kindness prove
meer collusion and prevarication in him?
What if it be only to divide her Friends,
and thereby the more easily to expose her
to the malice of her enemies? For as long
as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> stands, she up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids
him, in his own words, <hi>with malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
ingratitude:</hi> and it is the plausiblest
way for him that was once a Servant and
a Lover, to compass her ruine with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

up a <hi>Church</hi> distinct from the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England?</hi> If it be any, I assure him, it
is a very <hi>invisible Church;</hi> for it is a

I declare my self to be not only a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>

            <p>§. 1. <hi>ANd the</hi> first thing <hi>is about
the</hi> Charge <hi>of</hi> Fanaticism;
<hi>which gave the</hi> Title <hi>to that</hi>
Book <hi>of Mr.</hi> Cressy'<hi>s, upon
which the</hi> Person <hi>of</hi> Honour <hi>bestows his</hi>
Animadversions.<note place="margin">Fanaticism sect. 2. n. 10.</note> 
               <hi>This Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>said</hi> he
would begin with, and particularly that part
of my Book which concerns the life and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Contemplation commended and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
only in the Catholick Church; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a State, <hi>he saith,</hi> which from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of the Church hath been esteemed the
nearest approaching to that of Glorified
Saints: and this is that, from whence I
took an occasion to vilifie him; <hi>but adds,</hi>
that he is very well content to receive his
proportion of scorn with such companions,
as <hi>Thaulerus, Suso, Rusbrochius, Blosius,</hi> &amp;c.
But to the end I may not boast, <hi>he saith,</hi> of
the Novelty of my invention and profanely
employed wit, he doth assure me, that he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49659:21"/>
heard the same way much better acted a
long time since, but the Actor was obliged
to make a Recantation Sermon for it. <hi>I
thank Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>for more of his</hi> Charity
<hi>still, in that he parallels the representing
the</hi> Fanaticism <hi>of their</hi> Church <hi>with the
histrionical representing the life of our</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<hi>and his</hi> Att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndants: <hi>it seems, there
is no great difference to be made between
the Reverence due to the Founders of their</hi>
Monastick <hi>Orders, and to the Son of God
himself. I do assure him if I had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinion of our</hi> Blessed Saviour <hi>as to his</hi>
Wisdom <hi>and all manner of</hi> Excellencies, <hi>than
as yet I see ground to have of the</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their Orders, <hi>I should be far from
that esteem I now have of the</hi> Christian
Religion: <hi>but however, the</hi> Person <hi>of</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<hi>hath better informed Mr.</hi> Cressy'<hi>s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi>
viz.<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> 
               <q>
                  <hi>That the Recantation Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
was made upon the account of</hi> State-matters;</q>
               <hi>and therefore Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>very
wisely passeth it over in his</hi> Epistle Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical.</p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> adds, <q>That
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> had no such reason to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
at me for this Charge, since the
provocation was given me by my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
by whom the beginning of so many
<hi>Sects</hi> &amp; <hi>Fanaticisms</hi> was laid to the charge
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49659:21"/>
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> which unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and untrue reproach,<note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. p 26.</note> made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for me to answer and refell that
calumny, and as reasonable to let them
know that their own Church is much
more lyable to that accusation than the
other: and why this provocation should
be so innocent an assault for the one,
and the defence by the other should prove
so heinous an offence, will require an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Judge to determine.</q> To this
Mr.<note place="margin">Epist. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loget. sect. 26</note> 
               <hi>Cressy</hi> thus answers; <hi>That my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
chanced unhappily though inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
to let drop out of his pen one line or
two which has undone us all.</hi> I know no
design of <hi>undoing</hi> them that any of us have
had; unless it be as some men think they are
<hi>undone,</hi> when they are kept from doing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief:
but I hope we may have leave to take
care of our own preservation, and of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
we ought to value above our lives: but
suppose it were so, whom may they thank for
it? him that gave the provocation, or him
that did but his duty in Defence of his
Church and Religion? But come, come
Mr. <hi>Cressy;</hi> let us not flatter our selves, it
is not the Fly upon the Wheel that raises
the Dust; we <hi>Writers</hi> of <hi>Controversies</hi> are
no great <hi>Doers</hi> or <hi>Undoers</hi> of publick busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> denyes, <hi>that my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49659:22"/>
did lay the imputation on the Church
of</hi> England; <hi>and craves leave with all due
respect to tell the</hi> Person <hi>of</hi> Honour,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 27.</note> 
               <hi>that
it was a great mistake in him to say so.</hi>
Of that we may judge by the very words
produced by Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether the
judgement of King</hi> Henry, viz. <hi>in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Bible to be read in</hi> English, <hi>ought
not to have been followed in after-times, let
the dire effects of so many new Sects and
Fanaticisms as have risen in</hi> England <hi>from
the reading of the Scripture bear witness.</hi>
In which words the rise of <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisms</hi>
is plainly imputed to the reading the
Scripture, the reading of the Scripture in
<hi>English</hi> is an effect of the <hi>Reformation</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (for it is the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> as reformed, that is only the
subject of the dispute) And therefore I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to any indifferent person, whether
the <hi>Reformed Church of England</hi> doth not
in their Opinion bear the blame of all the
<hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Fanaticisms?</hi> But this is too plain
a thing to be insisted upon: <hi>No,</hi> saith
Mr. <hi>Cressy, the very naming of</hi> Fanaticism
<hi>and</hi> England <hi>in the same line, was provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
enough for me; who seemed with an
impatient longing to have watched for such
an advantageous opportunity to empty my
voluminous store of Collections.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ib.</note> How
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49659:22"/>
strangely may some be deceived by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening
imagination! I was so far from
having a <hi>Voluminous store of Collections,</hi> that
I never thought of the Subject, till it came
in my way to answer it; and then I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
some things I had read to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
which put me upon a farther search
into the <hi>history</hi> of those things. And since
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will have it out, this is the true
account of the birth of that terrible <hi>Mormo</hi>
that hath brought so many reproaches and
execrations upon me.</p>
            <p>§. 2. There are two parts of this Charge
of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> thinks
himself particularly concerned in; and
which I shall therefore handle distinctly;
the one concerns <hi>Mystical Divinity;</hi> and
the other, the honour of S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and
his <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> these two Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
sets himself with all his force to defend,
and I hope before I have done to make
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> repent the heat, he hath shewed
about them.</p>
            <p>I begin with that concerning <hi>Mystical
Divinity;</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> still speaks
with the greatest Veneration imaginable;
he had before called it,<note place="margin">Fanaticism p. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The practice of
Christian Vertues and Piety in the greatest
perfection this life is capable of;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 11</note> 
               <hi>the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49659:23"/>
approach to the state of glorified Saints;
the most divine exercise of contemplative
Souls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 181.</note> 
               <hi>more perfectly practised only in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
and now he makes a prayer for me,
that it would <hi>please God to give me and all
my friends a holy ambition to aspire to the
practice of contemplative prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loget. n. 37.</note> 
               <hi>though by
me so much despised.</hi> But of <hi>the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi>
he saith <hi>it would have upon me,</hi> I do
the most wonder at that which he adds,
viz. <hi>that it would exceedingly better my
style.</hi> I have hitherto thought the choice
of clear and proper expressions, such as
most easily and naturally convey my
thoughts to the mind of another, to be
one of the greatest excellencies of Style;
but all before Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> that have been
the greatest <hi>Friends</hi> to <hi>Mystical Divinity</hi>
have endeavoured to excuse the hard words
of it. Surely never any Masters of Style,
before Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> thought obscure, strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
affected, unintelligible phrases, were any
Graces and Ornaments of speaking: Would
it not add much beauty to ones style, to
bring in the <hi>state of Deiformity, the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essential
life, the union with God in the pure
fund of the Spirit,</hi> and abundance of such
phrases; which are so very many that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximilian

               <hi>Carolus
Hersentius</hi> hath nothing to answer to this,
but only, <hi>that the matter cannot be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
expressed in Mystical Divinity;</hi> which
is so far from being an argument to me
that it can improve ones <hi>style,</hi> that it gives
me very much ground to suspect the very
thing it self. For God would never require
from men the practice of that (as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he doth the duty of <hi>Prayer</hi> and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>Love</hi> of himself) which it is impossible
for men to understand, when it is proposed
to them. What obligation can there be to
practise no man knows what? The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion</hi> is a very plain and intelligible
thing; and if it had not been so, I do not
know, how men could be obliged to believe
it? I do not say, that men could form a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
conception in their minds of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of some of those things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in it; as how an infinite being
could be united to humane nature; but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49659:24"/>
this I say, that the terms are very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
and the putting of those terms into
a proposition, depends upon Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the Son of God was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
so that all the difficulty in this case
lyes in the conception of the manner, which
by reason of the shortness of our concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as to what relates to an infinite being,
ought to be no prejudice to the giving our
assent to this Revelation; since we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the union of a spiritual and material
being in the frame of mankind, and are as
well puzzled in the conception of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it. But in <hi>Mystical Divinity,</hi> I say,
the very terms are unintelligible; for it is
impossible for any man to make sense of
that <hi>immediate Union with God in the pure
fund of the Spirit,</hi> wherein the Mystical
Writers do place the <hi>perfection</hi> of the
<hi>Contemplative Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 3. But because Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> referrs the
<hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> for the understanding those
<hi>Mystical phrases,</hi> which I had quarrelled
with, to the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Roman Churches
Devotions vindicated,</hi> which was purposely
writ in answer to me upon this subject; I
shall therefore consider what light he gives
us in this matter; for I am very willing to
be better informed. In the beginning he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49659:24"/>
saith, <hi>that Prayer is the most Fundamental
part of a Christians Duty;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to the matter in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
prayer,</hi> it must be implyed, that this
is a <hi>part</hi> at least of that <hi>fundamental Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and if it be so, I think my self obliged
to understand it; and it must be a very cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
ignorance, not to understand so <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi>
a part of a <hi>Christians Duty.</hi>
Therefore I shall pass by all his excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and hold him close to the matter in
debate; I confess he prepares his way with
some artifice, which makes me a little jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
for things plain and easie need none.
He insinuates, 1.<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> 
               <hi>That those who have not
these things, cannot well know what they
mean;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> and then adds, 2. <hi>That the means
for obtaining them, are</hi> (in his own words)
<hi>much frequent and continued vocal or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
prayer, much solitude and mortifications
of our flesh, and abstraction of our thoughts
and affections from any creature: much
recollection, much meditation on selected
subjects, and the endeavouring a quiescence
as much as we can from former discourse,
(these actions of the brain and intellect
now hindring the heart and will) and the
bringing our selves rather to a simple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation</hi>
(without any action of the
brain or intellect, or at least as little as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49659:25"/>
may be) <hi>to exercise acts of love, adhere
to, sigh after and entertain the object
thereof: and after this, come passive uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are rather Gods acts in us than
our own, and are particular Favours to
some, and those not constant.</hi> By this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
I am fallen into utter despair of
understanding these things; for if <hi>the acts
of the brain and intellect prove such hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
to the desired union, and the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence
in order to it be that of Discourse,
viz.</hi> of all ratiocination; I am utterly at
a loss, how this should ever be understood
by the persons themselves, and much more
how it should be explained to others: And
I extreamly wonder at those, who go about
to explain things which themselves confess
are so far from being understood, <hi>that the
acts of the understanding are hindrances to
the enjoyment of them.</hi> But <hi>F. Baker</hi>
speaks more plainly in this matter,<note place="margin">

describes this <hi>Mystick contemplation; by
which,</hi> saith he, <hi>a soul without discoursings
and curious speculations, without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
use of the internal senses, or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Images, by a pure, simple, and repose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

Universal and Incomprehensible Good.
This is true Contemplation indeed.</hi> And
afterwards he adds, <hi>that as for the proper
exercise of active contemplation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>ing it more and more
profoundly in God, with no other sight or
knowledge of him, but of an obscure Faith
only.</hi> And towards the conclusion of his
<hi>Book</hi> he hath these words, <hi>We mortifie our

               <hi>we
exercise Discoursive prayer by sensible I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
to the end we may loose all use of
Images and Discourse: and we actuate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by operations of the Will, to the
end we may arrive to a state of stability
in prayer above all direct exercises of any
of the souls faculties: A state wherein the
soul being oft brought to the utmost of her
workings, is forced to cease all workings
to the end that God may operate in her. So
that till the soul be reduced to a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nudation
of Spirit, a deprivation of all
things, God doth not enjoy a secure and
perfect possession of it.</hi> Nay, he saith else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<note place="margin">Sect. 1. c. 4. n. 14.</note> 
               <hi>that all use of meditation must be
for a long space passed and relinquished,
before the soul will be brought to this good
state of having a continual flux of holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</hi>
I might produce much more to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49659:26"/>
the same purpose out of him; but this is
enough to shew, that they leave no use of
<hi>ratiocination</hi> or <hi>memory,</hi> in that which
they call the <hi>perfect state of the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative
life;</hi> and how is it then possible,
that it should be either understood or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained?
Nay, <hi>F. Baker</hi> saith, <hi>that there is
a cessation of all Workings of the soul,</hi> which
is a little harder yet: But this is that <hi>otium
mysticum, or divine state of quiescency</hi>
which the <hi>Mystical Divines</hi> magnifie so
much; and which it is impossible to give
any account of; either how the soul being
of so active a nature can subsist with a
cessation of all her workings; or supposing
that possible, how it can ever give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that state wherein there was a ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of all her workings. It is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as possible to give an account of the
state of <hi>Not-being,</hi> as of such a state,
wherein there were no operations of the
soul; or at least no use of <hi>ratiocination</hi>
and <hi>memory.</hi> And of all things, methinks
it is most improper to call that the <hi>State of
Contemplation;</hi> the <hi>State of Nothingness,</hi>
is much more agreeable to it. But <hi>O. N.</hi>
defends this to be a <hi>State of Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for although,</hi> saith he, <hi>it be applyed
to the will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 61.</note> 
               <hi>yet its act is not single, but

sight of the object performed by the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
without any, or at least much Discourse
thereof;</hi> but this is not fair dealing, for
<hi>F. Baker</hi> expresly excludes all Discourse,

if there be any, <hi>Baker</hi> makes it not the

was a gift of perfection, which God did not
communicate to all, but only to his elect;
and therefore no wonder if others did not

not after all this <hi>understand S. Paul?</hi> and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49659:27"/>
it is most evident he doth not. For S. <hi>Paul</hi>
doth not there speak of any that had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> and rejected
any sublime pretence of devotion, as a
thing not <hi>intelligible</hi> or <hi>consonant</hi> to the
<hi>Christian Religion</hi> (which are the reasons
of my rejecting <hi>Mystical Divinity</hi>) but he
speaks of such, who rejected the Doctrine
of Christianity it self, because it depended
upon Divine Revelation. And so the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is not the <hi>sensual man,</hi> as
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> out of meer <hi>charity</hi> to me ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it; but the man that supposes such a
<hi>natural sufficiency</hi> in the <hi>humane soul</hi> in
order to its own perfection and happiness,
(as the <hi>Philosophers</hi> did) that there was no
necessity either of <hi>divine revelation</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
any new doctrine, or of <hi>divine Grace</hi> to
conduct us to our happiness. This I could
easily make appear to be S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning,
from the consideration of the design of his
discourse, as well as the importance of the
words, and the consent of the best <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> I mean S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and
his Disciples, viz. <hi>Isidore Pelusiot,</hi> and the
<hi>Greek Scholiasts;</hi> but I forbear, for fear
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> should think, I take another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to <hi>empty my voluminous store of
Collections.</hi> But notwithstanding all the
endeavours of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> and his Friend <hi>N. O.</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:49659:28"/>
to make the <hi>State of Contemplation</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by <hi>F. Baker,</hi> more <hi>intelligible,</hi> it hath
yet so much of <hi>darkness</hi> and <hi>shadow</hi> in it,
that the more they pursue it, the farther it
flyes from them.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But that is not all the quarrel I
have to this <hi>Mystical Divinity,</hi> that it is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible;</hi>
but that it leads persons into
strange illusions of fancy, and when they
think themselves freest from <hi>Images,</hi> they do
then labour most under the power of a <hi>strong
imagination,</hi> embracing only the <hi>Clouds</hi> of
their own <hi>Fancies</hi> instead of such <hi>an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Union with the Divine Essence in
the pure fund of the Spirit.</hi> And this I
take to be a great injury, not only to those
melancholy <hi>souls,</hi> that are led through this
Valley of Shades and Darkness; but to
the Christian Religion it self, as though the
way of perfection taught by it were a low,
mean, contemptible thing in comparison of
the <hi>Mystical</hi> flights of this <hi>Contemplative
way.</hi> There are these two things therefore
I shall endeavour to shew, 1. That this
Mystical way hath no foundation at all in
the Christian Doctrine, 2. The way and
manner, how it came into the Christian
Church, and hath obtained so much favour
in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49659:28"/>
1. That it hath no Foundation at all in
the Christian Doctrine. It is the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the Christian Religion, that it
gives us such incomparable directions in
order to the compleat Felicity of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
souls. That it hath not only disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
more plainly, and fully, the <hi>blessed
state</hi> of another life; but teaches men the
most effectual way to prepare their minds
for it; <hi>viz.</hi> by sincere repentance, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
purity, by subduing our passions, and
due government of our actions according
to the Rules of temperance and justice, by
dependence on Divine Providence as to the
affairs of this world, by patience under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
by doing good to others, although
our enemies and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecutors; by deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and mean thoughts of our selves;
by a large charity, thinking as well of, as
doing well to others; by valuing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of another life, above the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of this, (which is called <hi>self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal;</hi>)
and to that degree, that when our
<hi>Religion</hi> calls for it, we should willingly
part with our lives for the sake of it. This,
as far as I can understand it, is the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
comprehension of a <hi>Christians Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
in order to his happiness; and by <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
continuance in Well-doing</hi> he may with
reason hope for the enjoyment of that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49659:29"/>
               <hi>Blessed State</hi> which is reserved to another
life. The which being made known to the
world by the Doctrine of Christ, therefore
<hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>our Lord Iesus Christ</hi> is made so
necessary a part of a Christians Duty;
and because we want divine supplyes, and
assistance, to enable us to do our duty,
therefore we are so much commanded to be
frequent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ervent in prayer; and many
promises and encouragements are given to
the due performance of it, from Gods rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to hear the prayers of the <hi>Righteous,</hi>
and to grant the requests they make to
him. All this, is not only excellent in it
self, and most reasonable to be done, but
very easie to understand; but not a word
in all this tending to any immediate <hi>Union</hi>
with <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>pure fund of the Spirit,</hi> or

               <note place="margin">c. 4. p. 16.</note> 
               <hi>she relates</hi> her very great sickness, so
great that <hi>she saith,</hi> it alwayes deprived
her almost of her senses, and sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together:
and after she had read the third
A, B, C <hi>(a Book</hi> of Mystical Divinity) <hi>she
saith,</hi> she came to quiet prayer, and arrived
to passive unions before she was twenty
years old;<note place="margin">P. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and herein again she far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went

S.</hi> Paul. <hi>She confesses,</hi> that she was
in so great torment, that they were afraid
who were about her, that she would have
gone mad;<note place="margin">C. 5. p. 25.</note> that she was put into such a
heat that her sinews began to shrink with
such intolerable pains that she could take
no rest neither day nor night, but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
oppressed with a most profound Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.
<hi>These are the very words writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by her self as they are translated out of</hi>
Spanish <hi>by an</hi> English Iesuit; <hi>after this
she saith,</hi> she fell into a trance; so that
she remained without sense almost four dayes,<note place="margin">P. 26.</note>
after which she remained under violent
Torments,<note place="margin">C. 6. p. 28.</note> and her head exceedingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered;

her Patron; whom she called her Father and

us in some one necessity, she had experience
that this Saint helpeth us in all; and that
our Lord will give us to understand, that as
he was subject to him on earth, so likewise
in Heaven he obtaineth whatsoever he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
<hi>(I am very much mistaken if this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
not of other kind of</hi> Divinity <hi>than

               <hi>she saith,</hi> she saw Christ more plainly
with the eyes of her soul, than she could
have seen him with the eyes of her body;
and she looked upon it as a temptation of
the Devil, that she was ready to think,
this was nothing but Imagination. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>she relates at large</hi> how she came

the operations of the understanding; in
which,<note place="margin">P <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>she saith,</hi> it understandeth more in
the space of a Creed without discoursing,
than we can understand with all our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diligences in many years: <hi>This she calls,</hi>
being wholly ingulfed in God; and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
this State,<note place="margin">P. 62.</note> wherein the soul seems
to be altogether out of her self, from Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<hi>and she describes</hi> the third degree of
Prayer to be a glorious frenzy, an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
folly;<note place="margin">P. 111.</note> in which, <hi>she saith,</hi> she had been
as it were frantick and drunken in this
love, and could never understand how it
was; and in this State, <hi>she saith,</hi> they speak
many words in Gods praise without order,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49659:32"/>
at least the understanding is nothing worth
here;<note place="margin">P. 113.</note> 
               <hi>for she adds,</hi> that then she speaketh
a thousand follies, and she knew one who,
being no Poet, chanced to compose very sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
Verses <hi>extempore,</hi> declaring his
pain very well, not made by his own wit.
But there is a degree beyond this, <hi>which
she calls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 122.</note> the State of not feeling, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
without understanding what we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy;
but how this Union is, and what it is,
she cannot give it to be understood, but
leaves it to the Mystical Theology. <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
she distinguisheth between</hi> Union
<hi>and</hi> Raptures:<note place="margin">P. 140.</note> 
               <hi>and saith,</hi> that these exceed
Union, <hi>which he that writes the</hi> Glosses <hi>in
the</hi> Margin <hi>saith,</hi> that she means that the
soul enjoyeth God more in raptures; <hi>but she
tells us,</hi> that Union seemeth beginning,
midst and end; but our Lord must declare
this, i. e. <hi>she knew not what she meant her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self.
In some of her</hi> raptures <hi>she speaks</hi>
of Gods carrying away her soul,<note place="margin">P. 141.</note> and almost
ordinarily her head also after her, so that
she could not detain it, and sometimes her
whole body lifting it up:<note place="margin">P. 142.</note> in these <hi>she saith,</hi>
she undergoes great violence, and she was
quite tyred with them: at other times <hi>she
saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 148.</note> her body was so light in raptures,
that all the heaviness of it was taken
away; or rather, that the body remaineth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49659:33"/>
as it were dead, without doing any thing,
in which sometimes the senses are wholly
lost; but ordinarily they are troubled: and
in the height of raptures, <hi>she saith,</hi> they
neither hear,<note place="margin">P. 149.</note> nor see, nor feel in her opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
no power hath the use of it self, nor
knoweth what passeth in this occasion; nor
are we capable of understanding it. In
this state, <hi>she saith,</hi> the soul is ingulfed;
or to say better, our Lord is ingulfed in her,
and keeping her in himself for a little
space, she remaineth with her will alone:
<hi>and sets forth</hi> the body as bound for many
hours in it,<note place="margin">P. 150.</note> and yet sometime the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and memory distracted; and after
they return to themselves. When the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is over, it happeneth sometimes that
our powers are so absorpt and as it were
drowned for a day or two or three, that it
seemeth they are not in themselves. <hi>There
are these circumstances more to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning her:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 42.</note> 1. That she was under

<hi>as she had been advised before;
and put her upon</hi> greater perfection; <hi>then
she fell into her</hi> raptures, <hi>and understood
in one of them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 185.</note> that hence forward she
was not to converse with men, but Angels:
<hi>and after this,</hi> she had such kind of voices
very frequent within her,<note place="margin">P. 187.</note> which <hi>she saith,</hi>
are very formal words, but not heard with
corporal ears, but understood much more
plainly, than if they were heard; and these
speeches,<note place="margin">P. 204.</note> 
               <hi>she saith afterwards,</hi> were very
continual with her; and she had visions ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
frequently; <hi>in one of which</hi> she saw
only the hands of Christ,<note place="margin">P. 215.</note> 
               <hi>and in another</hi>
his divine Countenance, which seemed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to abstract her,<note place="margin">P. 216.</note> and afterwards she saw
him altogether, but not with her corporal
eyes, <hi>she confesses: and she satisfied her
self,</hi> it could not be her imagination only,
although her Confessor told her so,<note place="margin">P. 221.</note> because
the beauty was so great, as to exceed her
imagination; <hi>yet he still encouraged her,
when as appears by her</hi> own confession,<note place="margin">P. 224.</note>
others about her <hi>whom she had a great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49659:34"/>
of, endeavoured to convince her it
was only her imagination,</hi> to her great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<note place="margin">P. 225.</note> 
               <hi>insomuch, that she saith,</hi> the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the good were sufficient to have put
her out of her wits. <hi>This</hi> Vision <hi>of the</hi>
Beauty of Christ continued ordinarily with
her for two years and an half,<note place="margin">P. 226.</note> in which
she had a great desire to see the colour of
his eyes, and what bigness they were of, but
never could obtain that favour. <hi>When
the</hi> Iesuit-Confessor <hi>was out of the way,
others told her plainly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 228.</note> it was the Devil
that deluded her; <hi>and they bid her</hi> cross <hi>her
self when she saw a</hi> Vision;<note place="margin">P. 234.</note> 
               <hi>she held a</hi> Cross
in her hand to save her self the trouble,<note place="margin">P. 229.</note> and
Christ took it in his and gave it her again
with four Precious Stones which had the five
wounds artificially engraven upon them,
which no body could see but her self. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this,</hi> she had a vision of Angels, and
clearly discerned the coelestial Hierarchy;<note place="margin">P. 232.</note>
but she supposed one of those she saw to be
one of the Seraphins, who pierced her heart
with a fiery dart, and when he pulled it
out again, it left her wholly inflamed with
great love to God; but under excessive pain,
which yet caused so great pleasure, that

               <hi>she saith,</hi> she
was like a Fool,<note place="margin">P. 233.</note> she desired neither to see

long after she relates,</hi> how sometimes for
three weeks together her imagination would
be so tormented with trifles and toyes,<note place="margin">P. 238.</note> that
she could think of nothing else: <hi>then she
fell</hi> into such a fit of dulness and heaviness
without any kind of sense or remembrance
of her former Visions and Raptures;<note place="margin">P. 240.</note> or else
no otherwise than as of a dream to afflict,
and then she was full of doubts and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
that all was but imagination;<note place="margin">P. 237.</note> and
if she conversed with any, the Devil put her
in such a distasteful spirit of anger,<note place="margin">P. 240.</note> that it
seemed as if she would eat all, not being

comfort in an instant,<note place="margin">P. 241.</note> sometimes with a
word, sometimes with Visions; <hi>which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for a time</hi> more frequent than before;
then she thought,<note place="margin">P. 242.</note> that her bodily sickness
was the cause of her former disturbance,
and that her understanding was so unruly,
that it seemed like a furious fool, whom no
body could bind, neither was she able to

an Ass,<note place="margin">P. 244.</note> being in a manner without any feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>and so</hi> it falleth out oft-times, <hi>she
saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 245.</note> that one while she laughed at her self,
and other times she was much afflicted; and
the inward motion provoked her to put
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49659:35"/>
posies and flowers upon Images, <hi>and such
kind of imployments. After this, the scene
of her imagination was quite changed, for
it</hi> represented nothing but Devils to her:<note place="margin">P. 246.</note>
               <hi>in which state, she tryed one pleasant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi>
viz. <hi>how much more the</hi> Devils
<hi>are afraid of</hi> Holy Water, <hi>than of the</hi> Sign
<hi>of the</hi> Cross;<note place="margin">P. 247.</note> from the Cross they fly, but so
as to return presently, but from the Holy
Water, so as to return no more, (<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
then she should have used it but
once</hi>) and it was not more terrible to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
than she found it comfortable to her
soul; <hi>for she saith,</hi> that she found a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and very evident comfort when she
took it, and such a delight which strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
her whole soul: which she found very
often, and considered it with great reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>then she relates,</hi> her being in Spirit in
Hell,<note place="margin">P. 261.</note> and what she endured there; <hi>and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the conclusion,</hi> her being placed in
Heaven in a rapture,<note place="margin">P. 323.</note> and seeing what was
done there, where she saw her Father and
Mother, <hi>&amp;c. after which she adds,</hi> that
our Lordshewed her greater secrets (<hi>What!
than what is done in Heaven?</hi>) for it is
not possible,<note place="margin">P. 324.</note> 
               <hi>she saith,</hi> to see more than was
represented unto her; the least part of it
was sufficient to make her soul remain
astonished; and found it impossible to declare
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49659:35"/>
some little part of it. <hi>And now we find
her at S.</hi> Pauls <hi>height, and need go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the account of her</hi> Visions, <hi>which
continues to the end of her Book; but let
me ask</hi> O. N. <hi>who hath particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended</hi>
this life <hi>to the</hi> consideration
of any sober Protestant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Churches Devotions vindicated <hi>p.</hi> 23.</note> 
               <hi>whether he doth in
good earnest</hi> think <hi>that</hi> M. Teresa <hi>had the
same kind of</hi> Raptures <hi>that S.</hi> Paul <hi>had? I
know he must not</hi> say <hi>otherwise, since
the</hi> Roman Church <hi>hath</hi> Canonized <hi>her for
a</hi> Saint; <hi>but I think, they had done her a
greater kindness, to have appointed her good</hi>
Physicians <hi>in time, instead of her</hi> Iesuitical
Confessors. <hi>I could hardly have thought,
that among</hi> Christians <hi>I should have found
S.</hi> Pauls Rapture <hi>parallel'd by such as these;
but we have lived to see strange things.
If S.</hi> Paul <hi>had discovered in his Writings so
many Symptoms of a disturbed fancy, such
an</hi> oppression <hi>of</hi> Melancholy, <hi>such rovings
of</hi> Imagination, <hi>such an uncertainty of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
could we ever think the world would
have believed that</hi> Ecstasie, <hi>which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
with so much Modesty, and makes
so many</hi> Apologies <hi>for himself, that he
was forced to mention it; by the false</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<hi>boasting of their Revelations?</hi> It is
not expedient for me doubtless to glory;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 1, 2, 5, 6.</note> I
will come to Visions and Revelations of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49659:36"/>
Lord. I knew a man in Christ above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years ago, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of such a one will I
glory, yet of my self I will not glory, but in
mine infirmities;—but now I forbear
lest any man should think of me above
that which he seeth me to be, or that he
heareth of me. <hi>Although he had many</hi>
Revelations, <hi>he mentions but</hi> one; <hi>and
that with the greatest modesty that may
be under a third person, and that above
fourteen years ago. He tells no long sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of a</hi> succession <hi>of</hi> Visions <hi>and</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<hi>and</hi> sights <hi>of</hi> Angels <hi>and</hi> Devils;
<hi>mixed with many impertinencies and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of a disordered Imagination. But
saith</hi> O. N. that could not be in S. <hi>Teresa,</hi>
considering the diligence that was used
for several years in the tryal of her Spirit,
and her Visions were confirmed to be from
God, by a general attestation of them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Christian World; even those who
suspected and questioned them at first af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
magnifying them. <hi>But I desire
no other evidence in this case, than what
she gives her self; supposing the matters
of fact to be true according to her own
relation; not that I would condemn her,
according to Mr.</hi> Cressy<hi>'s soft language, as
a</hi> hypocritical Visionaire; <hi>nor as many of
her Friends did, as</hi> one deluded by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49659:36"/>
               <hi>but I see nothing in her case but
what might be a natural effect of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated
Imagination, in a Person of a very
melancholy devout temper, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before-hand possessed with the</hi> Notions
<hi>of</hi> Mystical Divinity. <hi>And for the</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations
<hi>given to her</hi> Visions <hi>I do not wonder
at them, since there was a Design to</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize
<hi>her for a</hi> Saint, <hi>and she was the</hi>
Foundress <hi>of a</hi> new Order; <hi>and that there
was something relating to this, in the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of her</hi> Visions, <hi>seems to be not obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intimated in the last</hi> Page <hi>of her</hi> Book,
<hi>where she desires him to whom she writ it,</hi>
to make haste to serve his Majesty,<note place="margin">P. 364.</note> that he
might do her a Favour; <hi>for it seems by her
own relation, her Order met with great
contradiction at</hi> Court.<note place="margin">P. 312.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And for the <hi>approbation of her Books,</hi> I
do no more wonder at that, than I do at
others that proceed upon the same princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Mystical Theologie.</hi> But I do
exceedingly admire at those persons, who
dare to bring the single <hi>instance</hi> of S. <hi>Pauls
Rapture,</hi> to justifie all the pretences to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
and <hi>Raptures,</hi> of the Melancholy and
distempered <hi>Women</hi> of their <hi>Church.</hi> If
we had not so great reason to put such a
mighty difference between them, as to the
Wisdom of the Persons, the reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49659:37"/>
of their Doctrine, the Miracles wrought
to confirm the testimony of the <hi>Apostles;</hi> it
would be, as <hi>Cardinal Bessarion</hi> said of the
<hi>Canonizations of new Saints, that it made
men Question the old;</hi> so these new <hi>Raptures</hi>
and <hi>Visions</hi> would expose the credit and
Authority of undoubtedly <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Therefore let Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> and <hi>O. N.</hi>
have a care, while they are so ready to
charge me <hi>with blaspheming Gods Saints,</hi>
that by making the case so parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> and their
<hi>new Saints,</hi> they do not lay in the way of
all considering men of their Church,

<hi>which himself expresses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">O. N. sect. 29.</note> by those superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
elevations wherein are communicated
to the soul many times Celestial Secrets,
and Divine Mysteries, and future events
by internal words and Revelation; all which
things are received by it with a great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
and attention, and cessation of the
natural use of its Faculties Sensitive or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49659:38"/>
nor seems it in its own disposal
while it hath these touches. And this is
that, <hi>he tells us,</hi> which the Mystick Divines
express by the terms of a supernatural, or
rather superessential life, a Deisormity, or
Deification; of a sense or fruition of Gods
presence in the fund, depth, or center, or
innermost part of the soul, or also in the
Apex or supream point of it; of Passive
Unions, wherein is to be understood not an
exclusion of all acts whatsoever, but an
exclusion of any discursive and laborious
acts, and any primary moving of it self to
action. <hi>This explication I accept of; and
undertake to make it appear, that in it is
contained the greatest height of</hi> Fanaticism.
<hi>For what can be imagined greater, than
to exempt all pretenders to</hi> Enthusiasm <hi>and</hi>
Divine Inspiration <hi>from any tryal by</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
reason? <hi>For</hi> if no persons are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Iudges of these supernatural eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but those which have experience of
them; <hi>as they assert; if</hi> by virtue of these
elevations men come to the knowledge of
Divine Mysteries and Future Events by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
words and Revelation; <hi>what is to
be done with any Person who pretends to
these</hi> elevations? <hi>Must their</hi> Confessors
<hi>judge of them? But why? for either they
have not experienced these things, and then
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49659:38"/>
they are no</hi> competent Iudges; <hi>or they
have, and then they are pretenders to the
same things, and ought as much to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by others: but how? by the</hi> acts of
reason, <hi>and the</hi> rules <hi>of it? how is that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
when they are supposed to be above
all</hi> acts of Reason and Discourse? <hi>and to do
it</hi> without reason, <hi>will be as little honour
to the</hi> Iudges, <hi>as it will be Vindication to
the pretenders. But</hi> the Church is to be
Iudge: <hi>Why so? since the</hi> Spirit <hi>can no
more deceive one than a thousand; and
they have satisfaction in themselves, that it
is</hi> the Spirit of God <hi>in them, as much as
it is possible for any to have that the</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God directs the Church; <hi>nay, much
greater, for the other is only the certainty
of</hi> reason <hi>and</hi> discourse; <hi>but this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Certainty <hi>of</hi> Experience, above all
ratiocination. <hi>But</hi> how <hi>again shall the</hi>
Church judge <hi>of this? If the</hi> Church <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the same thing, she is lyable to
the same accusation; if she does not, she
can have no pretence to judge of things that
are to be known only by</hi> experience. <hi>So
that if men speak consequently and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to themselves, there is no way of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
left for pretenders to these things. And
what should hinder every</hi> Enthusiast <hi>from
this pretence, or something very like it;</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:49659:39"/>
viz. Divine Inspiration? <hi>Why should the
pretence to the</hi> Spirit <hi>be more lyable to
the tryal of other mens</hi> reason <hi>or</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>than the pretence to</hi> Mystical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<hi>Cannot they make use of the very
same places of</hi> Scripture <hi>to justifie all the</hi>
Fanatick pretences <hi>to</hi> immediate impulses
<hi>and</hi> motions <hi>of the</hi> Divine Spirit? <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
they tell men as easily,</hi> that they that
are unexperienced are no Iudges in this
case; <hi>and that</hi> the sensual man cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the things of the Spirit of God?
<hi>Nay, these have been the very pleas of all
our</hi> Enthusiasts, <hi>and there is scarce one
place of</hi> Scripture <hi>mentioned by</hi> O. N.
<hi>which they have not been before-hand
with him, in producing to the very same
purpose. I cannot then find out the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
between the highest of our</hi> Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts
<hi>and</hi> theirs; <hi>and the very same pleas
which serve for the one, will justifie the
other also. What have they ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to, but to understand</hi> celestial secrets,
divine mysteries, or future events by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Revelation? <hi>Now all these things
are owned, defended and justified by the</hi>
Roman <hi>Church, and yet they not lyable to
the charge of</hi> Fanaticism?</p>

§. 7. <hi>No, saith</hi> O. N. Enthusiasm or

high and mysterious effects, Visions,

of these, or the like, when having no

to them. <hi>So that the main point is yielded

<hi>this must be his method of proceeding

            </p>
            <p>Friend, I perceive thou talkest much of
the Spirit of God moving thee and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hidden mysteries of his Kingdom to
thee, but thy pretence is vain, and thou
art deceived by thy own fancy, if not by
an evil Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49659:40"/>
No, <hi>saith</hi> the Quaker, I know, I am not,
for I have the testimony of the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me that I am not deceived; but thou
art deceived and lyest against the Holy
Ghost, and blasphemest the Spirit of God
working in his Saints.</p>
            <p>Not I, <hi>saith</hi> O. N. I grant that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost doth work in his Saints such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
elevations, whereby they understand
divine Mysteries, and have Visions and
Raptures and Revelations more than any
of you; but all ours are true, and yours
are false.</p>
            <p>Thou lying Prophet, <hi>replyes the</hi> Quaker,
Gods speaks truth by thee, as he did once
by <hi>Balaams Ass</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas;</hi> but thou
through the Wickedness of thy heart dost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Generation of his Saints among
us as hypocrites; and wouldst have the
Spirit of God dwell only among you, that
are the Sons of Mystical <hi>Babylon</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of all her defilements, that are the seed
of the Beast and the false Prophet, that
commit adultery with Images, and set up
the Man of Sin in his Throne, that have
covered the face of the earth with your
abominations, and still go about to deceive
the Nations. You have the Spirit of God
among you! You pretend to the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hidden Mysteries, and immediate
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49659:40"/>
Revelations and Mystical Unions with God!
No, yours are the Mysteries of Iniquity,
the Revelations of Antichrist, and unions
only with Mystical <hi>Babylon.</hi> You have
the Spirit of God among you! No, yours is
the Spirit of Enchantment and Divination,
the Spirit of lying and deceit, the Spirit of
Antichrist and not of God.</p>
            <p>I say again, <hi>saith</hi> O. N. that we have
the Spirit, and you have not.</p>
            <p>And I say by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that you have
not, <hi>saith the</hi> Quaker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And is not this a fair conclusion of this
Dispute?</hi>
               <note place="margin">O. N. sect. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Hath not</hi> O. N. <hi>extreamly got
the better of the</hi> Quaker? <hi>But</hi> O. N. <hi>pleads
yet farther,</hi> that they make use of Notes and
Rules of discerning of the pretences to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration;
<hi>which I shall consider after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
but that which</hi> O. N. <hi>and Mr.</hi> Cressy
<hi>do most insist upon, is this,</hi> that if such
pretenders to Inspirations do speak or do
any thing against the Catholick Church <hi>(as
they call it)</hi> then their pretences are to be
rejected as Satanical illusions. <hi>Very good!
This is a way to preserve themselves, but
what is this to the preventing the delusions
of such fanatick pretenders to Inspirations,
who may be grosly deceived, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
speak or do any thing against their
Church; but it seems the least touch that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49659:41"/>
way presently marrs all. If</hi> Mother Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resa
<hi>had but chanced to let fall a word
against the</hi> Power <hi>of</hi> Holy Water in driving
away Devils, <hi>or chanced in one of her</hi> Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>to have seen</hi> Bread upon the Altar, after
consecration; <hi>away with her, a meer hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
and Impostor, one deluded by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
and it had been well, if after all her</hi>
Visions <hi>and</hi> Raptures, <hi>she had escaped the</hi>
Inquisition. <hi>For can it possibly be so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that she had</hi> Divine Visions, <hi>as that</hi>
Holy Water drives away Devils; <hi>or that</hi>
she had Mystical Unions, <hi>as that</hi> no bread
remained upon the Altar after consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<hi>No, no. If melancholy Women once
offer to meddle in those matters, they must
then be told of their</hi> weakness of Iudgement
<hi>and</hi> strength of Imagination <hi>and</hi> delusions of
the Devil; <hi>but if they admire every super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
foolery, and see strange effects of</hi>
Holy Water, <hi>and in some</hi> Visions <hi>can discern

<hi>then</hi> O heavenly Visions! O Divine
Saint! <hi>Then her</hi> Confessor <hi>must sooth and
flatter her, and suffer her to be deceived by
her own imagination at least, if not by
something worse. So that this whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of</hi> Visions and Revelations <hi>among
them is managed by</hi> Politick Rules; <hi>if they
can serve to strengthen their interest, they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49659:41"/>
are encouraged, if not, the persons are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
discountenanced, and if they persist
in their pretences, in great hazard of the</hi>
Inquisition. <hi>But may not weak and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Persons be deceived in judging the
effects of a strong</hi> Imagination <hi>to be the</hi>
Inspirations <hi>of the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> God? What

have Persons</hi> Canonized <hi>for</hi> Saints, <hi>and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
and worshipped, chiefly for the sake
of these things? In which case, not only
the particular persons, while they lived, were

upon; and the effects of a strong</hi> Imagination,
<hi>and</hi> Mystical Unions, <hi>are recommended as

I shall now shew, that such kind of <hi>Ecstasies</hi>
and <hi>Revelations,</hi> as the <hi>Mystical Divinity</hi>
pretends to, have been condemned by the
<hi>Christian Church</hi> in former Ages; which will
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49659:42"/>
yet farther discover, how far it is from being

               </gap>o far is it from
being <hi>the perfection of a Christian State.</hi>
And the Instance I shall produce, will be
such a one, wherein the judgement of the
whole <hi>Christian Church</hi> was seen, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
ecstatical <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Raptures</hi> and <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
which <hi>Montanus</hi> and his followers
pretended to.<note place="margin">Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Baronius</hi> proves from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of <hi>Philastrius, Epiphanius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi>
and others, that <hi>Montanus</hi> and his
companions were <hi>good Catholicks,</hi> and great
practisers of fasting and mortifications,
and were in great esteem in the <hi>Church</hi> for
a more than ordinary degree of sanctity;
when they wee in this reputation they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have extraordinary <hi>Visions</hi> and
<hi>Ecstasies,</hi> wherein they suffered such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
as <hi>Mother Teresa</hi> describes; and
were under such a <hi>force</hi> upon their minds,
as they thought <hi>divine,</hi> which deprived
them of the present <hi>use</hi> of <hi>ratiocination,</hi>
in which state, they said, they had many
<hi>Revelations from God.</hi> Now here we have
the very case of <hi>Mystical Unions;</hi> and we
all know that this <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Montanus</hi> was
rejected in the Christian Church as a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
Enthusiastical Spirit;</hi> but, it will
be worth our while, to shew that it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this very ground, because the <hi>Montanists</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49659:42"/>
pretended to such <hi>Ecstasies</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi>
from God, which deprived men of the use
of their Reason. <hi>Claudius Apollinaris Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>

<hi>Enthusiasts, Prisca</hi> and <hi>Maximilla;</hi>
and all the account he gives of their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the communion of the Church
was because the Christian Church all over

to their <hi>Enthusiastical Spirit,</hi> and that
the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia</hi> having met together

it <hi>as impious,</hi> whereupon they were cast

<hi>he saith,</hi> hath much in it of the nature of
Wine, which is more apt to heighten and
inflame mens spirits, than Hony, or Milk,
or water, it first makes men talkative,
then eloquent and bold; then it stirs them
to action, then it puts them into a rage,
and at last by custom makes them meer
Sots: all these several qualities some men
have by their natural tempers: some, <hi>saith

those whom Melancholy makes ecstatical;
which temper although naturally cold, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a greater degree of heat; as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

become hotter than the Coals: so, <hi>saith he,</hi>
it is with Melancholy, if it be over-heated,
it fills them with joy and singing, and
makes them ecstatical; and because thus
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49659:51"/>
heat comes very near the seat of the mind;
it is apt to make men distracted or enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical;
thence the <hi>Sibylls</hi> and the <hi>Bacchae</hi>
and such <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> became such not by a

that which is said in the</hi> Life <hi>of S.</hi> Teresa
<hi>of one that made</hi> verses in an Ecstasie, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
<hi>hath a very fit parallel of</hi> Maracus a

good Verses, as when he was really Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical:
<hi>and for the great inequality of
the tempers of such</hi> Ecstatical persons, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
<hi>saith,</hi> that Melancholy as it produces
very odd and irregular distempers, so it is
very unequal of it self, sometimes very hot,
and at other times very cold; <hi>which the</hi>
Mystical Divines <hi>call the</hi> State of Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but this temper being apt again to be
inflamed of a sudden, it fills them with
strange pleasures, especially the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being fixed upon an Object of Love,
<hi>which this temper,</hi> Aristotle <hi>observes, is</hi>
more particularly disposed to: <hi>but because
whatever makes persons</hi> Ecstatical, <hi>deprives
them of the</hi> use <hi>of their Reason; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these</hi> Mystical Unions <hi>which have so
much</hi> Ioy <hi>and</hi> Pleasure, <hi>are said to be with
a suspension of all the</hi> Discoursive Acts <hi>of
the</hi> mind. <hi>Which things are not to be
thought extraordinary, especially in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49659:51"/>
not only of a Melancholy temper;
but whose temper hath been heightned by
the power of diseases, great severities, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
silence and retirement: and whose
Imagination hath been possessed with such
Notions as do highly gratifie an</hi> Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Disposition, viz. <hi>such as relate to a
more immediate</hi> Union <hi>with an Infinite</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>of</hi> Love. <hi>So that there seems to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this</hi> State <hi>of</hi> Pure Contemplation, <hi>of
which a reasonable account cannot be given

an account of certain</hi> Orders <hi>of</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<hi>among them, who make vows of</hi>
Chastity, Poverty and Obedience, <hi>living in</hi>
Convents under Superiours, <hi>who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called</hi> Iauguis, <hi>i. e.</hi> united to God,
who used <hi>themselves to many hardships,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49659:52"/>
and were looked on as so many</hi> Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
<hi>by the People; being accounted
true Saints, illuminated and perfect</hi>
Iauguis; These are people that have
entirely abandoned the world, and seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
themselves into some very remote
corner, or garden like Eremites without ever
coming to the Town. If you carry them any
meat, they receive it; if they do not, 'tis
believed that they can live without it, and
subsist by the sole Favour of God in perpetual
fasting, prayer, and profound Meditations:
for they sink themselves so deep into these
raptures, that they spend many hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in being insensible, and beholding in
that time, as they give out, God himself, like
a very bright and ineffable light, with an
unexpressible joy and satisfaction, attended
with an entire contempt and forsaking of
the world. For thus much one of them that
pretended he could enter into this Rapture
when he pleased, and had been often in it, told
me; and others that are about them affirm
the thing with so much seriousness, that
they seem to believe in earnest, that there
is no imposture in it. <hi>Which therefore</hi>
Bernier <hi>imputes to an</hi> illusion of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
caused by Solitude and Fasting; <hi>and this
he calls</hi> the great Mysterie of the Cabala of
the <hi>Jauguis; and adds,</hi> that their extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49659:52"/>
of Poverty, and Fastings, and Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
contribute much to it; wherein <hi>he
saith,</hi> the <hi>European</hi> Fryers or Eremites are
but Novices in comparison with them. <hi>I

<hi>sets down these as the words of</hi>
Plato <hi>(and not as his own experience, as</hi>
Cardinal Bona <hi>relates them</hi>) Being often in
the depth of contemplation, my body being
left behind, I seemed to enjoy the chief
Good with incredible Pleasure. Wherefore
I stood as it were astonished, finding my
self to be a part of the upper world, and
to have obtained immortality, with the
clearest light; which cannot be expressed
with words, nor heard by ears, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the thoughts of men: <hi>and then he
describes</hi> the sadness he felt at the decay
of that glorious light; and the pleasure which
returned with his former Ecstasies. <hi>This</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49659:53"/>
Cardinal Bona <hi>thinks might either come by
the</hi> natural force of contemplation, or the

the same appearances that are pretended
to in</hi> Mystical Unions. <hi>And to shew the</hi>
Power <hi>of</hi> Imagination <hi>in causing</hi> Ecstasies;

Inspiration, that the Spirits of the Prophets
are subject to the Prophets in this, that they
do not speak with any disturbance of mind,
as though they were acted by another, but
from their own sense with a quiet mind,
understanding what they speak; therefore,
<hi>saith he,</hi> they that speak in alienation of
mind, or after it, do not remember what
they spake in it, have no true inspirations.
From whence it appears, <hi>saith he,</hi> that those
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49659:55"/>
who in their Ecstasies speak in the Person of
Christ, or of some Saint, as though they
were acted by them, are either seduced, or
do seduce. And yet the foolish world is asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and admires, and adores these words
and actions. <hi>But this rule, although as
much grounded on Scripture and Reason,
as any; is, as far as I can find, very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

by their own Rules as to Raptures and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasies,
so neither can there be as to <hi>Visions</hi>
and <hi>Revelations.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>They grant, that those that are of no
use, are not to be allowed; as,</hi> If the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Revelations be vain and curious,
<hi>saith</hi> Iesu Maria, <hi>or</hi> that which may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

known without Revelation; <hi>now, say I, if
there be no Revelation at all to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
as to matter of doctrine, all the
other things</hi> are vain and curious, <hi>there
being no other end suitable to divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
besides this. And</hi> Cardinal Bona
<hi>makes a very ingenuous confession, that
there</hi> is a great deal of danger and no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
at all in Visions;<note place="margin">De discret. Spirit. c. 19. n. 1.</note> and that by them a way
is opened for many deceits and illusions of
the Devil. <hi>Can any man of common sense
then believe that God should cause such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
Visions, <hi>which bring no profit
but abundance of danger along with them?</hi>
We walk much more safely, <hi>saith he,</hi> by
faith, whose light far exceeds all Visions
and Revelations of Mysteries. And no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

of sanctity,<note place="margin">De Not. &amp; sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>saith</hi> Scacchus, can be
drawn from them; because Christian perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
doth not consist in them: and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do not make us either more pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, or more useful to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<hi>and he quotes</hi> Gerson <hi>with approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for saying,</hi> that the antient Fathers
did fly from the curiosity of Visions and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as the most deceitful and dangerous;
and that <hi>S. Austin</hi> gave God thanks that he
was delivered from it, <hi>and that</hi> Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>saith,</hi> it is to be abhorred and striven
against with all our power. <hi>And</hi> Scacchus
<hi>himself concludes,</hi> that there is usually a
secret pride and hypocrisie to be thought
Saints, which makes Persons desire Visions
and Revelations, which are inconsistent with
true Sanctity; and if it be not pride, it is
a vain curiosity, wherefore God often suffers
them to be deceived.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That it is a very hard matter in this
case to distinguish the</hi> illusions of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<hi>from</hi> Divine Visions and Revelations.
<hi>For they do not pretend to the only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
way which the</hi> Prophets <hi>and</hi> Apostles
<hi>made use of,</hi> viz. the working miracles to
confirm the Truth of their Testimony: <hi>for
among all the numbers of</hi> Miracles <hi>they
boast of, they pretend to none for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
end <hi>of</hi> Miracles, <hi>viz.</hi> to confirm Divine
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49659:58"/>
Revelation. <hi>And therefore, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
Scacchus <hi>yields up this,</hi> as a very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing, considering how easie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a thing it is for the Devil to deceive
men in this matter.<note place="margin">De discret. Spirit. c. 19. n. 7.</note> 
               <hi>And</hi> Cardinal Bona
<hi>confesses,</hi> that the Devil doth often assume
the Person of Christ and of the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
with so much art and cunning as to
deceive very good men, as is evident from
most certain experience, as well as the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Fathers. <hi>Nay,</hi> he denyes,
that ever the Person of Christ did appear to
any since S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Vision;<note place="margin">N. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and he saith,</hi> that
to assert otherwise, is against the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
consent of the Fathers, and not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that article of our Faith, wherein
we believe that he sits at the right hand of
the Father, and shall come again to judge
the Quick and the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad. <hi>Yet what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of</hi> Visions <hi>of</hi> Christs Person <hi>do we
meet with in the</hi> Legends <hi>of</hi> Saints, <hi>and of
his appearance with</hi> flesh and blood <hi>in the
Eucharist? but if the Person of Christ do
never appear, it cannot be proved from
any of those</hi> Visions, <hi>that the</hi> very body of
Christ <hi>is there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That it were far better if a stop were
put to all private Revelations among them
that are not confirmed by <hi>Miracles</hi> or <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Scripture.</hi> This <hi>Cardinal Bona</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49659:58"/>
wishes,<note place="margin">c. 20. n. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that the Confessors among them
would at last take care of;</hi> which no man
certainly would do, if he believed them
to be from God. <hi>Cardinal Cajetan</hi> saith,
<hi>that we can have no certainty of private
Revelations, although the Persons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cajet. in 2. 2. q. 174. art. 6.</note> 
               <hi>should not only protest but
swear to it, that they have them from God:</hi>
and in general concludes, <hi>that we are not
bound to believe them.</hi> From which it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follows, that there are no certain
Rules to know when they are from God;
for if there were, an obligation to believe
them would lye upon those who had tryed
them by those Rules.</p>
            <p>4. If Revelations made to two several
Persons do contradict each other, that there
is great Reason to suspect both. <hi>For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,</hi>
saith <hi>Cardinal Bona,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De discret. Spirit. c. 20. n. 4. p. 409.</note> 
               <hi>it be possible
that one may be true and the other false,
and the Devil may endeavour to take away
the Authority of the True by the false, yet
for the most part they are both suspected
and doubtful.</hi> And before he saith, <hi>that
it is reasonable to believe those Women
Saints were deceived,</hi>

S. <hi>Brigitt</hi> and S. <hi>Katharin,</hi> which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
each other expresly about the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
conception; and which I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as a plain instance of a false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to <hi>Inspiration</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
it being impossible God should contradict
himself.<note place="margin">Fanati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>m. p. 67, 68.</note> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> in answer to this, first
<hi>confesses that the publick Office of their
Church testifies that each of them were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
with Divine Revelations, and then
produces the Testimony of S.</hi> Antonin, <hi>that
those things may be supposed by the Persons
themselves to be divine Revelations, which
are but humane dreams.</hi> Thirdly, He cites
<hi>Cardinal Baronius,</hi> who seems <hi>to reject the
Revelations on both sides.</hi> And yet he by
no means will allow <hi>the honour of their
Church to be concerned herein,</hi> which hath
approved them both as Persons <hi>truly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired;</hi>
when Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> confesses, <hi>they did
not testifie their Revelations by Miracles,</hi>
and that <hi>without it Divine Revelation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be known.</hi> I would not desire a greater
advantage from an Adversary, than Mr. <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy</hi>
here gives me against himself. For by
his own confession then, their Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
those to have had <hi>divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
which never gave the proper evidence
of it, <hi>viz. Miracles,</hi> and such whose Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
are questioned by the Wisest men
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49659:59"/>
among them. And what is all this but to
give Countenance, (for all that the
Church can know) to a meer pretence to
<hi>Inspiration?</hi> which is the highest <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism</hi>
in the World. And if as he saith,
<hi>notwithstanding the Councils approbation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 70.</note>
               <hi>there is scarce a Catholick alive that thinks
he hath an obligation to believe either of
them;</hi> this makes as much to my purpose
as I desire; for if they have no obligation
to believe them, they may without sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them not to <hi>be divine Revelations;</hi>
and since they are given out to be such and
approved by their <hi>Church,</hi> all such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may without sin charge them with the
highest <hi>Fanaticism</hi> in a false pretence to
<hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> And why then should
I be so much blamed for doing that, which
Persons in their own Church may do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sin? But I see Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the common Doctrine of their own
<hi>Divines</hi> about the obligation that lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Persons to believe Private Revelations;
For they agree,</p>
            <p>1. That those Persons to whom those
Revelations are made are bound to believe
them before any <hi>approbation</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi>
For say they, the primary Reason of assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Divine Revelation is from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Veracity; to which it is wholly acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49659:60"/>
whether it be publick or private, and
the Churches proposition is only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
external condition of applying the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Faith to us; but there may be as
great an obligation to believe a private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
supposing only sufficient motives
to the mind of the Person that this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
comes from God. This is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

<hi>Cajetan, Sotus, Canus</hi> and some others
as of another opinion; but <hi>Suarez</hi> saith,
<hi>they seem to differ only in words,</hi> because
they will not have that assent called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith;</hi> which the other are willing
to yield to them, and call it <hi>Theological
Faith,</hi> but do make it as certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
as the other. Which they prove, not
only from the obligation to faith in the
private Revelations mentioned in Scripture,
but from invincible Reason, because the
ground of the assent of faith is not the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickness
of the Revelation, but the Divine
Authority and Veracity; which being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
must equally oblige, whether the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
be private or publick. And if
there be sufficient motives to believe a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Revelation; to deny an obligation to
believe it, is a contempt of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49659:60"/>
and to suppose there cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
motives, is to say, that God cannot do as
much by himself, as he can by the Church.
The force of which Reason I do not see how
it is possible for those to avoid who assert,
that God doth still communicate private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
to mens Minds.</p>
            <p>2. That supposing these Revelations to
be proposed by the Church, all others are
bound to believe them to be divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For then they have the same reason,
which they have to believe any Revelation.
All the difficulty now is, to understand what
a sufficient proposal by the Church in this
case is; <hi>Suarez</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Suarez ib. n. 7.</note> 
               <hi>that although pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Revelations be chiefly intended for the
persons to whom they are made, yet a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
proposal of them being made to others,
there doth arise from thence an obligation
to believe them.</hi>

private Revelations without the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

and then</hi> saith <hi>Suarez, the believing them

I desire to know, how it is possible for their

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:49659:61"/>
than it did in those of S. <hi>Brigitt?</hi>
they being frequently examined by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>Authority</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> and after such
examination declared by the <hi>Pope to have
come from the spirit of God;</hi> and at last
approved, say their own writers, <hi>at the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council of Basil.</hi> How could they
possibly express greater approbation of any

all this, these <hi>Revelations</hi> may pass
among them for <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Fancies, and
no men are obliged to believe them,</hi> let them
clear their Church from <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> if they
can. For either those <hi>Revelations</hi> were

if they were, then since they were approved

a bad habit of body, that have a restless and

the Imagination, so as they are apt to fancy
that they see and hear things which they
neither see, nor hear. And likewise, <hi>saith
he,</hi> from long fasting and immoderate watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
vain phantasms may arise in the brain,

young men to be hot and credulous; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
great caution must be used towards

vehemency of their thoughts and affections
they think they see that which they desire,

it is from him, they not only borrow the
<hi>Mystical Notions,</hi> but most of the <hi>Phrases</hi>
too: And assoon as those Books, written
by him, came to be known and admired in
the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches,</hi> there
were some so fond of this Mystical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as to cry it up as the most perfect way
of <hi>devotion,</hi> being especially accommodated
to Persons of an Enthusiastical temper;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49659:63"/>
who were withall confined to Solitude and
Retirement from the World. It will not
be amiss therefore to give a taste of his
<hi>Mystical Divinity,</hi> as far as it is possible to
bring his affected Bombast within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of our language. Thus he begins,</p>
            <p>O thou superessential Trinity,<note place="margin">Dionys. de Mysticâ Theol. cap. 1.</note> above all
notion of Deity and Goodness; O thou Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Divine Wisdom of Christians,
direct us to the most unknown, most clear,
and most supream height of Mystical Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
in which the simple, absolute, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
Mysteries of Divinity are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
by the over-shining darkness of a
Teaching Silence, discovering the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
light in the most profound obscurity,
and over-filling the blindest minds with the
most beautiful beams, in that which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be felt nor seen.</p>
            <p>Let this Prayer be for my self: But Thou
O friend <hi>Timothy</hi> by thy diligent exercise
in these Mystical Speculations, leave thy
senses and the operations of thy mind, and
all things sensible and intelligible, and all
things which are not and which are; and
after an unknown manner elevate thy self
to that Union which is above all essence and
knowledge: and when by a pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Abstraction of thy self, thou shalt be
free and loose from all things, thou shalt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49659:63"/>
be raised to the superessential Ray of Divine
Darkness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then after he hath given caution to</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,
that these divine Mysteries be not
communicated to those that would make use
of their knowledge in these things, any more,
than to those, who followed their Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<hi>because</hi> the superessential being dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in darkness; and as to him, affirmations
and negations are not opposite, being above
all; <hi>he shews,</hi> that the Cause of all things
is above all Reason and understanding, and
is only truly and plainly made known to
those who ascend above all sensible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
things, and above all divine Lights,
and heavenly Sounds and Words, and are
swallowed up of Darkness: <hi>which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth,</hi>
by the Allegory of <hi>Moses</hi> going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Cloud upon the top of the Mount:
then, <hi>saith he,</hi> this Mystical <hi>Moses</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
up above all visible and intellectual
heights, being taken into the truly Mystical
Cloud of unknowing, in which he puts a stop
to all knowing perceptions, and is in that
which can neither be seen nor felt, being
altogether his who is above all, and not of
any one else, neither of himself nor any
other; and being under a cessation of all
knowledge is in a firmer union to that which
cannot be known; and because he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49659:64"/>
nothing, he understands more than his
mind can reach to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is certainly the very height of</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Union <hi>and the</hi> Perfection <hi>of the</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
State: <hi>in the description of
which, I have kept as near as I could to his
words, and as to the sense have followed</hi>
Carolus Hersentius, <hi>a late Mystical Divine,
who hath taken the greatest care and pains
to explain the meaning of this obscure
Author upon this argument. To the same
purpose he speaks elsewhere, where he saith,</hi>

from what men had before the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

than mankind had done before, and are able
to form a very true and distinct conception
of him in our minds, as of a Being of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

Although we cannot attain to a full compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the utmost extent of the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

not hinder our conceptions from being clear

proceeds only upon these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
1. The <hi>obscurity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and the impossibility of our attaining
so clear a perception of <hi>God</hi> in our minds,
as for us ever to hope for a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
with the exercise of our <hi>Reason</hi> and
<hi>Understanding.</hi> 2. That the only possible
way of attaining it, is by the <hi>abstraction</hi> of
our selves from all <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>intellectual
operations,</hi> and thereby bringing our souls to
an <hi>immediate Union</hi> with <hi>the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 13. Having thus endeavoured to bring
these things out of the Clouds of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Nonsense and seeming contradictions
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49659:65"/>
which they were wrapt up in, we may more
easily discern from whence all these <hi>notions</hi>
were taken and slyly conveyed into the
Christian doctrine as the highest way of
Perfection. For which we are to consider,
that the Christian Religion growing very
considerable, notwithstanding all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
used by the Roman Emperours and
Governours of Provinces to suppress it, and
very Learned men having taken upon them
the profession of it in several parts of the
Empire, but especially at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> the
Heathen Philosophers saw there was an
absolute necessity of making the best they
could of the Pagan Theology. To this end
they bestirred themselves to gather together
the most considerable parts of the <hi>Chalda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick,
Aegyptian,</hi> and <hi>Platonick</hi> Theology,
and putting them together to form such a
method for the <hi>Perfection</hi> of mens souls, as
would appear more sublime, than the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Institution. For this end <hi>Plotinus,
Porphyrie, Iamblichus, Proclus</hi> and the rest
of them, did imploy the utmost of their
study and care: for they saw now it was
to no purpose for them to spend their time
in idle curiosities, and the vain disputes of
the several Sects of Philosophers; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they endeavour to lay aside these,
(<hi>Ammonius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> having shewed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49659:66"/>
them the way) and to bend their studies
chiefly about shewing men such a way of
<hi>Purifying</hi> their <hi>Souls</hi> as might bring them
to a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi> without embracing
Christianity. For they saw, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people were become <hi>Philosophers</hi> by
the help of the Christian Religion, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
them in the bearing Torments and all
sorts of Miseries, only in expectation of that
<hi>Blessed State</hi> which the Christian Religion
did give men so great assurance of, and
gave such excellent directions, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of all divine vertues, for mens attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it. We know there was no greater
enemy in the world to the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
than <hi>Porphyrius</hi> was, against whom <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bius,
Methodius</hi> and many others writ in
defence of Christianity. Yet it appears by
what we have remaining of his writings, that
he had a very mean esteem of the common
customes of <hi>sacrificing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iamblich. de Myster. Segm. 5. c. 11.</note> and of those <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
which were pleased with <hi>the smoke of

advancing the soul to highest perfection.

of men in some sacred mysteries, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of certain rites and symbols, by
which they were admitted to the presence
of some of their Deities; the end whereof,

us from <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> that they who were puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
after this manner did converse with <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

fitted to see; but <hi>Porphyrie</hi> himself, as he
did not utterly reject this <hi>lower</hi> and <hi>symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
way;</hi> so he said, that the highest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the <hi>soul</hi> was not attainable by it;
but it was useful for purifying the <hi>lower
part</hi> of the soul but not the intellectual.
By the lower part he understood the <hi>irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,</hi>
which by the <hi>Theurgical Rites</hi> might
be fitted for <hi>conversation with Angels;</hi>
but the <hi>intellectual part</hi> could not be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by it to the <hi>Contemplation of God,</hi>
and the <hi>Vision of the Things that are True:</hi>
and herein he placed the utmost perfection
of the <hi>soul</hi> in its <hi>return to and union with
God in this upper part</hi> or fund of the soul;
for the utmost the other attained to, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to live among the <hi>Aetherial spirits,</hi> but
the <hi>Contemplative Souls returned to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
as he speaks;<note place="margin">C. 27, 28. 29.</note> which as many other of
his <hi>Notions,</hi> he borrowed from the <hi>Chalda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Theology.</hi> To shew, what this <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi>
or <hi>Contemplative Life</hi> was, that
should bring mens souls to this <hi>state of
Perfection, Porphyrie</hi> writ a Book on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

               <hi>Of the Return of the Soul,</hi> as S. <hi>Austin</hi>
tells us, who quotes many passages out of
it: and this particular precept above all the
rest, <hi>that the soul must fly from all body if
it would live happy with God;</hi> which is all
one <hi>with Abstraction of mind and pure
contemplative life.</hi> In that Book he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
that there was no perfect way yet
known to the World for this end, not the
<hi>Indian, Chaldaick</hi> or any other. But what
that was, which he meant, appears, by what
he saith near the end of the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi>
where he hath these words,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>The scope and end of
his Life was union and conjunction with
God over all: and four times,</hi> saith he,
<hi>when I was with him he attained to thus
union, by an unexpressible act of the Mind:</hi>
which he before sets forth, <hi>by a Divine il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination
without any Image or Idea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above the understanding and all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
things.</hi> And he saith of himself,
<hi>that he was once in this state of Union, when
he was 68. years of Age:</hi> which <hi>Holsteni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
understands of an <hi>Ecstasie</hi> he then fell

that we find the Foundation here laid not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>that it is in a strange place and bound

               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:49659:68"/>
in order to which he adviseth to deny the
body in its appetites and pleasures; and to
shew as little care of it and concernment for
it as may be; by degrees to lessen <hi>all sense
both of pleasure, and pain;</hi> and so to come
at last to a freedom from the passions of
the Body. Then he describes <hi>the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essential
being,</hi> and saith,<note place="margin">N. 36.</note> 
               <hi>that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </gap> it remains
therefore that if the Divine Nature can any
ways be known by us, it must be by the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Soul. For the soul being drawn
into its own unity, and removing from it
self the multiplicity of its powers, it ascends
to the greatest height of true Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
While the soul looks about on things
below it, it sees nothing but shadows and
images of things, when it comes to a state
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49659:72"/>
of Introversion, then it sees its own essence
and operations of the understanding; but
when it searches deeper, then it finds the
Mind within it self and the several Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of real Beings; when it goes yet farther
into the most secret closet of the Soul, there
it contemplates, as it were blindfold, the
Divine Beings, and the first Ideas or Unities
of Beings. And this, <hi>saith he,</hi> is the most
excellent operation of the soul, in the rest or
quie scency of its powers, to stretch it self
towards the Divine nature, and dance as it
were round it, and to raise up the whole
Soul towards this Union with it; and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
it self from all inferiour beings,
to rest upon and be conjoyned with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable
and superessential Being. And by
this means the soul comes to have the truest
understanding of all things.</p>

Which <hi>Plotinus</hi> his education under

probable, where he continued 11. years;
but whatever doctrine he heard from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius,</hi>
it is certain <hi>Plotinus</hi> his opinion as
to these matters, together with his followers,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49659:74"/>
was derived from other <hi>Oracles</hi> than those
of the <hi>Sacred Scriptures:</hi> For <hi>Psellus</hi> in

were still extant, which were frequently
quoted by these Philosophers, (and from

these things; yet as they are, they
give us sufficient ground to draw the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of this <hi>Mystical Divinity</hi> from
thence. For they speak of <hi>Gods being

notions both among the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and the
<hi>Platonick</hi> Philosophers are built upon a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ancient <hi>hypothesis,</hi> but very different
from that of Christianity; which <hi>hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
being granted, this <hi>Mystical Divinity</hi>
appears with some face of Reason, and
colour of probability; which I suppose
will not be consented to by Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> or
any of the <hi>Friends</hi> to <hi>Mystical Divinity:</hi>
Which was this, that the Souls of men
did exist in another world long before they
came into the body; that in their descent
to the body they had an Aethereal vehicle
joyned to them; which upon the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the soul and body became the
means of communication between them,
and takes up its chief seat in the brain,
which is the same which we call the
<hi>Imagination;</hi> that the soul being in this
state is apt to be much inveigled with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the body, and so forget its return
home; that the body is capable of doing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49659:75"/>
the soul mischief no other way, being it
self under the power of Fate, than as it
draws it downwards; that the mind being
the upper part of the soul is alwayes act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but we know not its operations but
only by the impressions they make upon
the Phansie; that the mind hath the true
Ideas of things within it self; but we are
deceived by the representations conveyed
by our imagination; and therefore our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination
is very short and uncertain;
that our only way of recovering our souls,
is by drawing them off from the body, and
retiring into themselves; and that upon
this, the mind hath the divine Being so
nearly conjoyned to it, that it passeth into
a divine nature, and recovers its former
state, when it parts from the body. But
because it is not to return alone without the
Aethereal vehicle i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the first Foundation of Mystical Divinity;
which I will not deny to be well enough

            <p>But the counterfeit <hi>Dionysius</hi> finding the

as he thought lofty enough to
express them; and either being not wholly
brought off from the Philosophy then in
request, or hoping by this means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare
the Philosophers, when they found
their sentiments entertained among the
Christians, makes it his business to patch
together the sublimest notions of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Platonists, and to make them pass
for good Christian Doctrine. And I think
it may be made appear that there is not
one notion thought peculiar to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<hi>Dionysius</hi> which we cannot trace the
footsteps of in these <hi>Writers;</hi> which few
of the Christians ever looked into, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their known opposition to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and therefore he had no more to
do than only to fit them to the Christian
doctrine, and they might easily pass for
new and sublime discoveries of his own.
Not only the Principles of <hi>Mystical The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,</hi>

with the same Title, as <hi>Suidas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
confesses, who reckons that as <hi>the first
of his books:</hi> but that being lost, we have
only that reason for our conjecture, because
we find him so apparently guilty in his <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Theology;</hi> To which he hath added
nothing but a more affected style, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Non-sense: For it is not enough for
him, to joyn <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>darkness</hi> together;
but that <hi>darkness</hi> must be <hi>overshining,</hi> and
the <hi>Rays</hi> of it must be <hi>superessential;</hi> he
is not content, to express nothing almost
without <hi>Metaphors,</hi> but stretches them to
<hi>Hyperbole's,</hi> and when he hath by this
means set two things as far from each other
as may be, then he claps them together, as

if one should say, the <hi>most glorious Sunshine

then we might have some reason to

taken their notions out of him; and yet it
would be very improbable that such a

leave his Works to the <hi>Philosophers</hi> at

<hi>For which I instanced, in all their most

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49659:79"/>
most commodious way to make a true judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them will be to examin their Fruits.<note place="margin">Fanati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ism. p. 21.</note>
For by their Fruits, saith our Saviour, they
will be known. Therefore to determine,
whether it was by Gods inspiration, that they
instituted their Respective Orders, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
these two wayes, 1. To examin their
several Rules, according to which their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
oblige themselves to conform their
lives and actions. 2. Whether God hath
acknowledged them for his servants by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
use of them to the great benefit of his
Church and dilation of his honour. By these
wayes he desires it may be judged whether
there were not sufficient ground for <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
to say, that such Orders were instituted
by the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, <hi>and so
do I. Which cannot be done without a
particular enquiry into the</hi> Rules <hi>and</hi> history
<hi>of their</hi> several Religious Orders, <hi>that by
them we may see what evidence appears of
any Divine Inspiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And according to Mr. <hi>Cressy's</hi> particular
zeal and concernment for the <hi>Benedictin Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
I begin with that: The <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
having given that <hi>Character</hi> of S. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict</hi>
               <q>that he believed him to have been a

to say, that neither the reading of his Rule,
nor any of the rest, will oblige any man
to be of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> opinion, that those
<hi>Orders</hi> were instituted by the inspiration
of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and because of Mr.
<hi>Cressy's</hi> great rage against me upon this
subject of <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to know his opinion particularly
concerning the <hi>Revelation</hi> of S.<note place="margin">P. 53, 54.</note> 
                  <hi>Francis</hi>
on the Mount <hi>Palombo</hi> concerning the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
observation of his <hi>Rule</hi> without any
<hi>Gloss;</hi> which is Printed with his <hi>Rule,</hi>
and with the <hi>Popes Bulls,</hi> and the <hi>Testimony</hi>
of S. <hi>Bonaventure.</hi>
               </q> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> in answer
to this, takes no manner of notice of S.
<hi>Francis</hi> his <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Revelation;</hi> but leaves
that to shift for it self; but something he
must say for the honour of S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and
it all amounts to as little as could be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For he doth not produce any one
thing, to make it appear more probable that
S. <hi>Benedict</hi> writ his <hi>Rule</hi> by <hi>divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:49659:80"/>

Must this Rule therefore be written by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inspiration? Is it not possible for men
to think them good Rules, without believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to have been inspired? Suppose
this were approved, as the best <hi>Monastick
Rule</hi> in these Western parts, by Popes, and
Princes and Councils, doth it hence follow
that it was immediately endited by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

authority with the <hi>Bible;</hi> if it were not,
the charge remains good, that it was only
an Enthusiastical pretence to Inspiration.</p>
            <p>§. 2. But to take off the force of all that
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> saith in behalf of the <hi>Benedictin
Rule,</hi> and to make good the first charge;
(although Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> hath evidently declined
the proof of the <hi>Affirmative</hi> which lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him) I shall give these<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Reasons to prove
that this <hi>Rule</hi> was never written by <hi>divine
Inspiration.</hi> 1. Because the main parts of
it were borrowed out of former Rules.
2. Because what is of S. <hi>Benedicts</hi> own,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49659:81"/>
hath manifest signs of humane weakness;
particularly misapplication of Scripture,
mentioned by the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour.</hi> 3. Because
it was never received in the Roman Church
as written by divine Inspiration.</p>
            <p>1. Because the main parts of it were
borrowed out of <hi>former Rules.</hi> Where we
can with so much ease and certainty, trace
the footsteps of humane industry in any
writing, it is very unreasonable to attribute
it to divine inspiration: And there is not
one considerable part in the <hi>Benedictin</hi> Rule,
which we cannot even at this distance of
time shew from whence it was taken. <hi>Hugo

this Preface to them; <hi>that sometimes he
met with the very same words, at other
times with the same sense which was in
the Benedictin Rule;</hi> and a little after he
saith expresly,<note place="margin">P. 70.</note> 
               <hi>that S.</hi> Benedict <hi>took his Rule
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49659:81"/>
from those who were before, and gathered
it as one handful out of many:</hi> and <hi>Menar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>

of the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Pachomius,</hi> S. <hi>Basil, Cassian</hi>
and others, who lived before him; which
will very easily appear to any one who will
take the pains to compare them. The <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictin

makes no doubt, that was the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>

we see, that S. <hi>Benedict</hi> did most

               </gap> the

               <hi>that place in the Rule is thought more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,

saith that the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> was used in the

at the end of every <hi>Psalm;</hi> but then both
there, and in <hi>Egypt</hi> they had very short
prayers; of which <hi>Menardus</hi> understands
that clause of the <hi>Benedictin Rule</hi> about
<hi>short prayers;</hi> but I rather think it is to be
understood of the <hi>concluding prayer.</hi> For
<hi>Cassian</hi> mentions only two sorts of common
prayers used by the <hi>Egyptian Monks</hi> in their
<hi>divine offices; viz.</hi> the <hi>short mental pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
made at the end of every Psalm; and
at every solemn stop in the reading of
them, of which it was usual to make two
or three on purpose in a long Psalm; and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49659:84"/>
the <hi>Collect</hi> at the end (so called because
then they did <hi>orationem colligere</hi> as <hi>Cassian</hi>
speaks) which being pronounced either by
Priest, or Abbot, or Prior, he giving the
sign, they all did immediately arise from
prayers together; and so the <hi>Benedictin

But beyond all these the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictins</hi>
say, <hi>the order of Reading the

               <hi>that if his disposition of
the Psalms doth not please, they may make
use of another,</hi> so they hold to the main
point, viz. <hi>going through the Psalter once a
week;</hi> which I perceive he laid great
weight upon, but yet he never pretends to
have had it by divine Inspiration. For he
seems by his <hi>Rule</hi> to have been more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and modest, and I am thereby enclined
to believe those stories of his <hi>Visions</hi> and
<hi>Revelations</hi> to have been made by some idle
Monks after his death, who hoped by this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49659:85"/>
means to recommend their <hi>Order</hi> more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually

What do they mean by these things? can
they have better rules than what an <hi>Angel</hi>
from <hi>Heaven</hi> hath given? or do they think
the Angel only intended them for the <hi>Monks</hi>
of <hi>Tabennesus? The Angel,</hi> as <hi>Sozomen</hi>
saith, <hi>appeared on purpose to</hi> Pachomius <hi>in
his cave to draw him out from his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and commanded him to gather Monks
and to take that brass Table for their Rule?</hi>
Could anything be mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But, if after such confessions, they think it
lawful not to believe the truth of this
story; I hope we have much more reason
to question the pretence to Inspiration ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or <hi>Ignatius
Loyola.</hi> For this is averred by much more
credible Authors, and received by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of both <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> historians,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49659:86"/>
and the <hi>Roman Church</hi> allows it in her <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology:</hi>
And yet, after all this, if there
be no reason to believe it, what becomes
of the credit of all the <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the <hi>Egyptian Monks,</hi> which are not
near so well attested as this is? And if there
be any reason to believe it, how comes that
rule not to be universally embraced? do
they think S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> or S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>

Nay, how came so many other Rules to be
received in <hi>Egypt</hi> after this rule of <hi>Pacho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>
was known? as the Rule translated by
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> composed by <hi>Pachomius, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>

another <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Orsiesius,</hi> out of which

he sends letters to the <hi>Monks,</hi> to bid
them have a care of them, for they believed
God to be incorporeal, and therein were
<hi>Origenists; for they did not believe that
God had either eyes, or ears, or hands or
feet:</hi> notwithstanding this, a very few, who
had more learning, discerning the malice and
craft of this suggestion adhered still to
them; but the far greater number who
were very simple and furious, most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
opposed them, by which means an
irreconcileable war brake forth among
them; and things, by <hi>Theophilus</hi> his means,
were inflamed to that height, that <hi>Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
and his Brethren had much ado to
escape with their lives, and fled to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>

the appearance of an Angel to that

to leave the Papacy, and retire again to

with the credulous Pope, that he soon

            <p>§. 7. By this we may see what mighty
advantage the <hi>Christian Church</hi> received in
the Infancy of the <hi>Monastick state,</hi> in
those very places where it began, by the
greatest pretence of piety and retirement
from the world in those that embraced it.
I do not wonder so many great men of the
<hi>Church</hi> should magnifie it so highly, before
they had seen the tryal and experience of it;
for extraordinary things in the way of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and abstraction of the world, are very
apt to move men of devout minds at the
first appearance; but the best judgement of
things is to be made by their continuance.
And therefore it is observable that although
the <hi>Apostles</hi> began at first with <hi>a community
of goods,</hi> while the <hi>Christians</hi> were few;
yet this did not last among them; nor
was it required in the <hi>Churches</hi> planted
by them; because it could not be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for all; and for some to do it and
others not, would be apt to beget breaches
and mutual suspicions among them. And
I do not find but that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 2.</note>
where every one was to lay aside of his
own for relief of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:49659:94"/>
was in that respect as pleasing to Christ,
as that state of the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
wherein they had all things in common.
And in matters of this nature, where the
first appearance is very fair and plausible,
(as it was in the pretended devotion and
retirement from the world in the <hi>Egyptian
Monks)</hi> we are not so much to regard the
judgement of those persons concerning it,
who lived in the first heat and beginnings
of it, which was the case of S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> S. <hi>Basil,</hi> and others; as of
those who lived to see the effects of it,
after it came into a settlement. For they
found after the first running so much of the
lees still remaining, as put them into fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

be taken up with the best things, and at
other times to partake something of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and pleasure of life. For I know my
self to be a man; and not a God to be
wholly above these pleasures, nor a beast to
be under the power of them; and therefore
that state of life which is between these,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> most agreeable to human nature.</hi> And
then falls upon them, <hi>for preferring manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
labour, before the exercise and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the mind in knowledge and useful
Learning: which is both an imployment
and pleasure to the mind. But in their ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantin
way,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>there is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
no gradual improvement, but all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49659:95"/>
upon motions and impulses, and
strange heats and transports, whereby they
hope for the end without the means, and
aim at things above reason without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it. How do these things agree, to
be now above the Heavens, and presently to
be twisting Reeds and making Baskets? But
mans excellency lyes in his Reason, which
they take the least care about: and those will
attain mans end the soonest that act most
agreeably to his nature.</hi> He doth not deny
that there have been <hi>some extraordinary
minds, which without arts or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
can do as much as others with them;
but these are as rare as the</hi> Phoenix <hi>in</hi>
Egypt; <hi>but the common sort of mankind
are uncapable of this; and all their labour
and pains is to no purpose that think to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the perfection of the mind by any
other way than by improvement of the mind
it self. And it is not safe or lawful for us to
think, that God should dwell in any other
part of us, than in our mind, which is his
proper Seat. They mightily cry up tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and continence, and admire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for those things which in themselves
are the least; any further than they serve
to higher ends.</hi> And afterwards he takes

his wonder how he could find the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
incongruity, or want of prudence in
that passage:</hi> and he spends very needless

Superiours for the direction of Souls, the
most proper title that can be given them is
that of Father,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> Abba <hi>signifies Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Very well! but what is this to the
producing that place for it? methinks <hi>Our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49659:97"/>
Father which art in Heaven</hi> had been alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as proper; for that would have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the title of the <hi>Abbot</hi> as well; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
that the <hi>Abbot</hi> was <hi>Gods Vicar</hi> upon
earth; <hi>God</hi> himself being their <hi>Abbot</hi> in
Heaven. And if S. <hi>Benedict</hi> had thought
upon this place, all that Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> saith,
would have held as well to prove there was
not the <hi>least incongruity</hi> in producing it;
and <hi>it would have afforded altogether as
useful an admonition to the Abbots to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
as Fathers, and not to Tyrannize as
Lords.</hi> But there is yet farther incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in it, for as the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
S. <hi>Benedict</hi> brings this in, <hi>to prove
that the Abbot supplies the Room of Christ in
the Monastery (Christienim agere vices in
Monasterio creditur, quando ipsius vocatur
praenomine)</hi> whereas there is no such thing
in the Text, Christ is not called there by
the name <hi>Abba,</hi> but <hi>God the Father,</hi> for
after they are said, <hi>by the spirit of Adoption
to cry Abba Father;</hi> it is said,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15, 17.</note> 
               <hi>And if
Children, then heirs; heirs of God, and
joynt-heirs with Christ.</hi> So that <hi>Christ</hi>
here is not represented under the notion
of <hi>Abba,</hi> but rather as a <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>heir</hi> to
him that is called <hi>Abba:</hi> therefore he
that sustains the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, can only
be the eldest <hi>Son, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Prior</hi> and not the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49659:98"/>
               <hi>Abbot;</hi> so that it is impossible to clear
S. <hi>Bennet</hi> from an impertinent allegation
of this place of <hi>Scripture.</hi> But this is far
from being the only place so impertinently
produced by him; for in the preface of his
<hi>Rule</hi> we have a whole Cluster of them,
wherein he puts together many places of
<hi>Scripture</hi> expressing the <hi>earnestness</hi> and
<hi>sincerity</hi> of <hi>Gods calling men to repentance</hi>
and <hi>sincere obedience, to the Monastick life
and observing the Rules of it.</hi> As though
it were impossible for men to repent and to
do Gods will, unless they did presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their <hi>estates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and submit to the
<hi>Monastick</hi> Rules. This, if he speaks to the
purpose, he must account, <hi>awakening out of
sleep: not hardening our hearts at Gods call;
hearing what the spirit saith unto the
Churches; running while we have light;
entering into Gods Tabernacle;</hi> and what
not? As though all Religion were confined
within the walls of <hi>Monasteries;</hi> and the
<hi>strait gate</hi> were no other, than that which
gives men admission into them. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was the great and fundamental cheat
of the <hi>Monastick Orders</hi> in the Roman
Church; they would be called the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Orders,</hi> and would have men believe,
that all <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> was kept warm
only under a <hi>Monks Cowle;</hi> and that, if
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49659:98"/>
there were any such thing <hi>in the world</hi> (as
they called all out of their own precincts) it
grew very cold, by taking too much aire
abroad. But although they durst not openly
defend this, for fear of giving too great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
both to <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity;</hi> yet their
insinuations tended this way; for they only
were the <hi>Religious,</hi> and the rest were but
the <hi>World.</hi> Which was a horrible abuse
of mankind, as well as of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
which doth never suppose men to
be a jot nearer to Heaven for their <hi>nastiness,
and lying in their cloaths,</hi> for <hi>abstaining
certain days from flesh, for eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a common stock,</hi> for <hi>having their
garments of such a shape and colour,</hi> or
whatever other observances were peculiar
to the <hi>Monastick state.</hi> The Christian
Religion requires sincere humility, and not
a <hi>Monkish</hi> affectation of it; inward purity,
and a chastity within the bounds which
God hath set us, and not binding our selves
by perpetual vows to abstain from what he
hath allowed us; heavenly mindedness, and
a mighty regard to the rewards of another
life, and not a needless renouncing what
the bounty of Heaven, and the care of
our Ancestors have provided for us, as to
the conveniences of this life: The <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
necessary to salvation is that to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49659:99"/>
commands of Christ, and not of an <hi>Abbot.</hi>
But this they would fain make people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that doing only what their <hi>Superiours</hi>
command them, is the <hi>self-denyal</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
their own wills,</hi> which the <hi>Gospel</hi>
makes so necessary to salvation; which is a
notorious misapplication of our Saviours
commands; but these things are common
to other <hi>Monastick Rules;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reg. S. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. C. 7.</note> S. <hi>Benedict</hi> hath
other faults of this kind peculiar to his
own <hi>Rule:</hi> as when he brings these places
for the Monks confessing their sins to the
<hi>Abbot, Revela Domino viam tuam, &amp; spera
in illo:</hi> It is great pitty the word <hi>Abba</hi> was
not there for <hi>Dominus;</hi> for then it had been
a plain case: but as it stands, it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hard to conceive how the <hi>Abbot</hi>
comes to be concerned in <hi>our making
known</hi> (if that were the meaning) <hi>of
our ways to the Lord;</hi> and to as little
purpose are the other places that follow,
<hi>confitemini Domino,</hi> and several others that
speak of <hi>confessing our sins to God,</hi> but not
one word of the <hi>Abbot,</hi> no nor of <hi>Priest</hi> in
them: yet this is not all, for in the same
<hi>chapter</hi> he brings something for <hi>Scripture,</hi>
which was never there, as when he makes
the <hi>Publican</hi> to say <hi>Domine, non sum dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

which time the <hi>Benedictin Rule</hi> was in small
reputation, till <hi>Boniface</hi>'s going into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi>
after which it began to be setled by
some Synods there; and so by degrees it
was brought into those <hi>Monasteries</hi> which
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49659:107"/>
before had been under other Rules, and
those such as had not only been embraced
before the coming of <hi>Maurus;</hi> but seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
that were made after it, as those of
<hi>Aurelianus, Ferreolus,</hi> and <hi>Donatus;</hi> which
are all mentioned in the <hi>Concordia Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
I now leave the Reader to judge,
whether there be the least probability, that
either in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Benedictin
Rule</hi> was looked upon as a <hi>Rule</hi> coming
from <hi>Divine Inspiration;</hi> which met with
so little acceptance in those Ages, when
they might the best judge concerning it,
and in those places where the Monastick
State was in great esteem.</p>
            <p>§. 11. 2. After it did come to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
received if it were really thought to
from God, how came so many alterations
and improvements of it to be made, and
new <hi>Rules</hi> to be set forth by the consent
and approbation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church?
They could not certainly think that the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> would raise up a Person on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and yet deliver by him an imperfect
Rule; if it were perfect, with what face or
conscience coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they think to amend it, or
set up others besides it? Yet both these are
manifestly done, by the multitude of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
or different Rules which came up
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49659:107"/>
afterwards. The only pretence for it, is
the degeneracy of the Order by length of
time and bad customs; but what then?
must the Rule be amended, or the lives of
men? must we have a new Bible, because
this is not observed? Or can we hope that
men will be reformed by another, if not
by this? But this was so frequently pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church as to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick
Rules,</hi> that the most charitable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
we can have of them, is that they
looked on all of them only as humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
which might be altered, or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at pleasure.</p>
            <p>The first amendment and alteration of
the <hi>Benedictin Rule</hi> was in the <hi>Monastery</hi> of

very subtilly; <hi>if he did not wear the Skins
of Beasts, how came the Shepherds to take
him for a Beast when they found him in the

your number of Coats, is not as bad as our

left, to which they so much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

And what is this but great hypocrisie, to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erfection to lye in <hi>poverty,</hi>
while they abound in Wealth? As though it
were only possible for men to be rich by
themselves; but in case they lived upon a
common stock without any particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
they must be poor and could not be
otherwise: although they had above the
third part of the Lands in the Kingdom in
their hands, as it was the case here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
Call you this <hi>poverty?</hi> Is this the
keeping a <hi>vow</hi> of <hi>poverty,</hi> solemnly made
to God? or rather is it not a plain mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, and a horrible abuse of the
Christian World? If such men did mean
honestly, they would speak as others do;
and declare that the Monastick state after the
accession of so great riches, was quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing from what it was first designed;
that it now became a more easie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
way of living (only some kind of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
must be undergone to keep the
world from seeing through their pretences)
because that in it men were freed from all
manner of cares of Families or estates, and
they lived together, without any fear of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49659:111"/>
the want of suitable company; and every
one in hopes of having their condition bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the remove or death of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
and no one in fear of having it worse,
as long as the riches of their community
continue. If some Philosophers had been
to set down the way of life with the greatest
conveniency and freedom from trouble, they
would have pitched upon a rich Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
where they were all rich in common,
and yet no man had particular property;
but I think they would have had more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
than to call this a <hi>state of Poverty.</hi>
But if ever any persons practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed <hi>Plato's</hi>
Common-wealth, they were the wealthy
Monks, who had plenty of all things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
but surely never any Philosopher
thought <hi>Plato</hi> meant to bring all men to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
by it; or that men could swear to be
alwayes poor and yet enjoy an equal share
with others of all conveniences of life. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus</hi>
himself, would have been for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
diet, and some healthful severities,
and would have born a confinement within
pleasant walks, and Gardens, with good
company. I know nothing would have
troubled him so much as to have been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<hi>Abbot;</hi> for the necessity of giving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
and treating strangers, and
looking after great revenues, might have

But to call these things the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>vow of poverty, Epicurus</hi> himself
would have abhorred: Yet this was the
way or none, which they had to observe it,
assoon as the kindness of Princes and others
to the Monastick Life had brought such
mighty possessions to Monasteries. If we

adds, <hi>that it was scarce possible at
first to believe, that an Order begun with so
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49659:114"/>
much severity as that of Monks should fall
into so great loosness; when the old Monks
met together in S.</hi> Antony<hi>'s time, their
minds were so taken up with divine things
that they forgot their bodily refreshments;
but now, saith he, it is quite otherwise, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Scriptures, nothing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
mens souls, nothing but idle talk and
laughing when the Monks do meet together;
and S.</hi> Bernard <hi>complains of them, as though
there were nothing but idleness, and luxury,
and intemperance to be found among them.</hi>
The <hi>Cistertians</hi> whom S. <hi>Bernard</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
so much in his time, were declined,
saith S. <hi>Antonin, so far from the steps of
their Fathers, that they were become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</hi>
The <hi>Cluniacenses</hi> he saith, <hi>were
as black within as without:</hi> the <hi>Camaldu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ses
were degenerated from the steps of</hi>
Romualdus, <hi>and were all gone backward, a
very few excepted.</hi> Among those of the
<hi>Vallis Umbrosa</hi> there <hi>was scarce one to be
found who did good: in a word,</hi> he saith,
<hi>all the Monkish and Regular Orders, which
began with so much fervour and zeal, had
so far by degrees fallen off from the Rules
of their Fathers, that they had nothing left
among them but their meer vows;</hi> and how
well those were kept in such a degeneracy
is easie to imagine.</p>

living twelve together in distinct Cells,

no fish but eating them when given; Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days

eggs; Tuesdays and Saturdays pulse or boil'd
herbs; the other days only bread and water;

in their Cells; where they are obliged

Orders</hi> had lost their reputation in the
world as to their pretence of <hi>Poverty,</hi> which
they began with; then appeared another sort
who would not be called <hi>Monks</hi> but <hi>Friers;</hi>
and to satisfie the World as to their <hi>Poverty,</hi>
they declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would have nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to them as a community, but
would live upon the charity and benevolence
of others, and therefore would go under the
name of <hi>Mendicant Friers;</hi> which grew
so numerous at first that the <hi>Council</hi> of

the highest pretenders to <hi>poverty,</hi> were the
last mentioned; who would be contented
with nothing short of the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty:</hi>
For this above all things was

S. <hi>Francis</hi> his <hi>Mistress,</hi> which he pretends

the bag of his own sense within his
heart. Poverty,</hi> he calls, <hi>the Foundation
of his Order upon which it would stand

he was, that they say of him, he could
never be reconciled to the <hi>Ants, because
they provided for themselves so long before

and especially in their <hi>buildings;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bids them <hi>build poor and mean lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for themselves; which they ought not
to dwell in as their own, but to lodge in
them as Travellers.</hi> And he makes it one
of the inviolable <hi>Rules</hi> of his <hi>Order, that
they should have nothing appropriated to
them,</hi>

<hi>working, he leaves it to those to whom God

Is there any perfecter Rule than
Christ himself made? If Christs Rule
be most perfect, why rulest thou thée not
thereafter? Why shall a Fréer be more
punished for breaking the Rule that his
Patron made, than if he break the hests
that God himself made?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:49659:122"/>
If your Order be perfect why get you
your Dispensations to make it easie?
Certes, either it séemeth, that ye be
unperfect, or he that made it so hard
that he may not hold it. And siker if
ye hold not the Rule of your Patrons,
ye be not then their Fréers, and so ye
lye upon your selves.</p>
            <p>Why make you as dede men when
ye be professed, and yet be not dead but
more quick beggers than you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
and it séemeth evil a Dede man
to go about and beg.</p>
            <p>Why make yée you so costly houses to
dwell in? sith Christ did not so, and
dede men should have but Graves, as
falleth it to dede men, and yet ye have
more Courts than many Lords of
<hi>England:</hi> for ye now wenden through
the Realm, and ech night will lig in
your own Courts, and so mow but few
right Lords do.</p>
            <p>Why be not under your Bishops vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation,
and léege men to our King?</p>
            <p>Why make yée men believe that your
golden Trental sung of you to take
therefore ten shillings, or at least five
shillings, woll bring souls out of Hell
or out of Purgatory? if this be sooth,
certes yée might bring all the souls out
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49659:122"/>
of paine, and that woll ye nought, and
then yée be out of charity.</p>
            <p>Why make ye men believe, that he
that is buried in your habit, shall never
come in Hell, and ye wéet not of your
self whether ye shall to Hell or no? if
this were sooth ye should sell your high
houses to make many habits for to save
many mens souls.</p>
            <p>Why covet ye shrift and burying of
other mens Parishens, and none other
Sacrament that falleth to Christian
folk?</p>
            <p>Why busie ye not to hear to shrift of
poor folk as well as of Lords and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
sith they may have more plenty
of shrift fathers than poor folk mow?</p>
            <p>Why covet you not to bury poor folk
among you? sith they béen most holy,
(as ye sayn that ye béen for your pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.)</p>
            <p>Fréer, when thou receivest a penie for
to say a Mass, whether sellest thou
Gods body for that penie, or thy prayer,
or else thy travel? If thou saiest thou
wilt not travel for to say the Mass,
but for the penie, that certes if this be
sooth, then thou lovest too little méed for
thy soul: and if thou sellest Gods body,
other thy prayer, then it is very simonie,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49659:123"/>
and art become a chapman worse than
<hi>Judas,</hi> that sold it for thirty pence.</p>
            <p>Why bearest thou God in hand and
slanderst him that he begged for his
meat? sith he was Lord over all, for
then had he béen unwise to have begged,
and have no néed thereto.</p>
            <p>Fréer, after what Law rulest thou
thée? where findest thou in Gods Law,
that thou shouldst thus beg? what
manner men néedeth for to beg? for
whom oweth such men to beg? Why
beggest thou so for thy Brethren? If
thou saiest, for they have néed, then
thou dost it for the more perfection, or
else for the least, or else for the meane.
If it be the most perfection of all, then
should all thy Brethren do so, and then
no man néeded to beg but for himself,
for so should no man beg but him néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
And if it be the least perfection,
why lovest thou then other men more
than thy self? For so thou art not well
in charity, sith thou shouldst séek the
more perfection after thy power living
thy self most after God. And thus
leaving that imperfection thou shouldst
not so beg for them. And if it is a
good mean thus to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eg as thou dost,
then should no man do so, but they béen
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49659:123"/>
this good mean, and yet such a mean
granted by you can never be grounded
on Gods Law, for then both lerid and
leard that ben in mean degrée of this
world should go about and beg as you do.
And if all should do, certes well nigh all
the world should go about and heg as ye
done, and so should there be ten beggers
against one Yever.</p>
            <p>Why wilt thou not beg for poor bedred
men, that ben poorer than any of your
Sect, that liggen and mow not go
about to help himselfes, sith we be all
Brethren in God, and that Bretherhed
passeth any other that ye or any man
could make, and where most néed were,
there were most perfection, either else
ye hold them not your pure Brethren,
but worse, but then ye he unperfect in
your begging? Whose ben all your
rich Courts that ye han, and all your
rich Iewels? sith ye séen that ye han
nought ne in proper, ne in common. If
ye sain they ben the Popes, why gather
ye then of poor men and Lords and so
much out of the Kings hand to make
your Pope rich? And sith ye sain that
it is great perfection to have nought
in proper ne in common, why be ye so
fast about to make the Pope that is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49659:124"/>
your Father rich, and put on him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection?
sithen ye saine that your
goods ben all his, and ye should by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be the most perfect man, it séemeth
openlich that ye ben cursid Children so
to slander your Father and make him
imperfect. And if ye sain that the
goods be yours then do ye ayenst your
rule; and if it be not ayenst your Rule,
then might ye have both plow and cart
and labour as other good men done, and
not so beg by Cosengery and idle as ye
done. If ye say that it is more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to beg, than to travel or to work
with your hand, why preach ye not
openly and teach all men to do so? sith
it is the best and most perfect life to the
help of their fouls, as ye make Children
to beg that might have béen rich heirs.</p>
            <p>Why hold ye not S. <hi>Francis</hi> his Rule
and his Testament? sith <hi>Francis</hi> saith,
that God shewed him this living &amp; this
Rule; &amp; certes if it were Gods Will, the
Pope might not fore do it; or else <hi>Francis</hi>
was a lier that said in this wise.</p>
            <p>Why will ye not touch no coined mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with the Cross, ne with the Kings
head, as ye done other Iewels both of
Gold and Silver? certes, if ye despise
the Cross of the Kings head, then ye be
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49659:124"/>
worthy to be despised of God and the
King: and sith ye will receive money
in your hearts and not with your
hands, it séemeth that ye hold more
holiness in your hands than in your
hearts, and then be false to God.</p>
            <p>Why have yée exempt you from our
King's Laws, and visiting of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
more than other Christian men
that liven in this Realm, if ye be not
guilty of traitorie to our Realm, or

               </gap>es to your Bishops?</p>
            <p>Fréer, what charity is this, to the
people to lie, and say that ye follow
Christ in poverty more than other men
done? and yet in curious and costly
housing, and fine and precious clothing,
and delicious and liking féeding, and
in treasure and jewels, and rich orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Fréers passen Lords, and other
rich worldly men, and soonest they
should bring their cause about (be it
never so costly) though Gods Law be
put a back.</p>
            <p>Fréer, what charity is this to prease
upon a rich man, and to entice him to
be buried among you from his parish
Church, and to such rich men give let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fraternity confirmed by your
general Seal, and thereby to bear him
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49659:125"/>
in hand that he shall have part of all
your Masses, Mattens, Preachings,
Fastings, Wakings, and all other good
déeds done by your Brethren of your
Order (both whilest he liveth and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he is dead) and yet ye witten
never whether your déeds be acceptable
to God, ne whether that man that hath
that letter, be able by good living to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any part of your déeds; and yet a
poor man (that ye wite well or supposen
in certain to have no good of) ye ne given
to such letters, though he be a better
man to God than such a rich man; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
this poor man doth not retch
thereof. For as men supposen, such
letters and many others that Fréers
behoten to men, be full false deceits of
Freers out of all reason, and Gods Law
and Christian mens faith.</p>
            <p>Freer, what charity is this, to be
Confessors of Lords and Ladies, and
to other mighty men and not amend
hem in their living? but rather as it
seemeth to be bolder to pill their poor
tenants and to live in lechery; and
there to dwell in your office of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
for winning of worldly goods,
and to be bold great by colour of such
ghostly offices? this seemeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49659:125"/>
pride of Freers, than charitie of
God.</p>
            <p>Fréer, what charity is this, to sain
that who so liveth after your Order
liveth most perfectly, and next followeth
the state of Apostles in povertie and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and yet the wisest and greatest
Clerks of you wend or send, or procure
to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to be made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
or Bishops, or the Popes Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leins,
and to be assoiled of the vow of
poverty, and obedience to your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
in which (as ye sain) stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
most perfection and merit of your
Orders, and thus ye faren as Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sées,
that sain one and do another to the
contrary.</p>
            <p>Fréer, was S. <hi>Francis</hi> in making
that Rule he set thine Order in, a fool
and a liar or else wise and true? If ye
sain that he was not a Fool but wise,
ne a liar but true: why shew ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your doing, when by your sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
to the Pope ye said, that Your
Rule that <hi>Francis</hi> made was so hard,
that ye mow not live to hold it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
declaracion and dispensation of the
Pope, and so by your déed? Ne let
your Patron a Fool that made a rule so
hard that no man may well kéep, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49659:126"/>
eke your déed proveth him a lier, where
be saith in his rule that he took and
learned it of the Holy Ghost. For how
might ye for shame pray the Pope undo
that the Holy Ghost bit, as when ye
prayed him to dispense with the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Order?</p>
            <p>Fréer, is there any perfecter Rule of
Religion than Christ Gods Son gave
in his Gospel to his Brethren? Or
than that Religion that S. <hi>James</hi> in
his Epistle maketh mention, of? If
you say yes, then puttest thou on
Christ (that is the Wisdom of God
the Father) unkunning, unpower, or
evil will. For then he could not make
his Rule so good as another did his,
and so he had be unkunning; or that he
might not make his Rule so good as
another man might, and so were he
unmighty; or he would not make his
Rule so perfect, as another did his,
and so he had béen evil willed.</p>
            <p>For if he might and could and would
have made a Rule perfect without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
and did not, he was not Gods
Son almighty. For if any other Rule
be perfecter than Christs, then must
Christs Rule lack of that perfection,
and so were default and Christ had
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49659:126"/>
failed in making of his Rule, but to
put any default or failing in God is
blasphemie. If thou say that Christs
Rule and that Religion S. <hi>James</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mention of, is perfectest; why
holdest thou not thilk Rule without
more? And why clepest thou the rather
of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or S. <hi>Dominicks</hi> Rule or
Religion or Order, than of Christs
Rule, or Christs Order?</p>
            <p>Fréer, canst thou any default assigne
in Christs Rule of the Gospell, with
the which he taught all men sickerly to
be saded, if they kept it to their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
If thou say it was too hard, then
saiest thou Christ lied, for he said of his
Rule, My yoke is soft and my burden
light. If thou say Christs Rule was
too light, that may be assigned for no
default, for the better it may be kept.
If thou saiest, there is no default in
Christs Rule of the Gospel, sith Christ
himself saith it is light and easie:
what néed was it for Patrons of Friers
to adde more thereto? and so make an
harder Religion to save Fréers, than
was the Religion of Christs Apostles
and his Disciples helden and were
saved by? But if they woulden that
their Fréers saten above the Apostles
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49659:127"/>
in Heaven for the harder Religion that
they kéepen here, so would they sitten

               </gap>ist himself for

               <hi>In these</hi> Questions, (<hi>besides several

Friers <hi>fully set forth by a Person who
lived among them in the time of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
flourishing here in</hi> England: <hi>which Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
of theirs in the</hi> pretence <hi>of</hi> Poverty
<hi>is attested by our</hi> Historians. Walsingham
<hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Walsingh. hist. p. 92. A. D. 1308.</note> that they offered the Pope at one time,
for a dispensation to break their Rule, as
to the liberty of enjoying rents and Lands,
40000 florens of Gold and much more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
<hi>The Pope asked</hi> them, where their
money was? they told him, in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
hands; the cunning Pope pretended
to take three dayes time to consider of it,
In the mean time he sends for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
absolves them from their obligation
to the Friers, and charges them under pain
of an Anathema, to pay the money into his
Treasury; and then tells the Friers, he
would not have them to break their Rule;
by which they were bound to touch no money.
And so, <hi>saith he,</hi> what they had unjustly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49659:127"/>
gotten, was justly taken away. <hi>I know
no reason they could have to complain of
any injustice in the Pope, since they declare
the</hi> property <hi>and</hi> Dominion <hi>of what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
was in the</hi> Apostolical See. <hi>And it

               <hi>that these strict Observantines might
enjoy the most magnificent Houses and costly
furniture without any diminution to the
perfection of their poverty, because the
right and property of them was not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but in the Papal See:</hi> but I cannot
understand why the same reason should not
hold for <hi>Lands</hi> too, supposing the same <hi>Right</hi>
and <hi>property</hi> to be in the <hi>Popes;</hi> for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

may not be in <hi>Trustees</hi> hands as well as the

in all this affair, that how rich soever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
this <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Mendicants</hi> was; yet,
forsooth they had nothing at all to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but the <hi>Alms</hi> of the people, for they had
vowed the <hi>very height of poverty. Why,</hi>
saith a plain <hi>Countrey man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that is not well
skilled in Metaphysicks; <hi>the beggars in our
Countrey do not live in such stately houses,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49659:130"/>
and have no such rich Ornaments nor feed
so well, nor are so well provided for as
you are: we that have Land of our own,
would be glad to have all things found us at
so cheap a rate. Do you think that riches
lyes only in trouble and care and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?
if that be it I confess you are poor
enough: but in no other sense that I see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas poor man, saith the <hi>good Frier,</hi>
we are as poor as <hi>Iob</hi> for all this.</p>
            <p>Now that cannot I understand for my
heart, <hi>saith the other;</hi> surely you call things
only by other names than we do: and make
that poverty that we plain men call riches.</p>
            <p>Well, saith the <hi>Frier,</hi> I will shew my
charity to your understanding in helping
of that, if you will shew yours to us poor
<hi>Friers;</hi> therefore you must know that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we have the full <hi>use</hi> and <hi>possession</hi> for
our benefit in the things you see, yet <hi>Pope
Nicholas</hi> 3. in the <hi>Bull Exiit,</hi> and <hi>Pope Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 5.
in the Bull <hi>Exivi de Paradiso,</hi> hath
declared <hi>that we have no propriety and
Dominion in them, but that is reserved to
the Papal See:</hi> So that we enjoy all things
but have right to nothing.</p>
            <p>Say you so, <hi>saith the</hi> Countrey man, Then
I believe you come within the compass of
the Statutes against Vagabonds and sturdy
Beggars, for you live upon that which
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49659:130"/>
is none of your own, and refuse to Work.</p>
            <p>Tush, saith the <hi>Frier,</hi> that is an heretical
Statute, and we defie <hi>Q. Elizabeth and all
her works;</hi> as long as the <hi>Pope</hi> hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us to be poor, we are so and will be so,
although we had ten times as much as we
have: For our holy Father the Pope can
change not only the <hi>names</hi> but the <hi>natures</hi>
of things; nay I will tell you farther, if
we had as much wealth as the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> if we had only the <hi>possession,</hi>
and the <hi>supreme right</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi> were
declared to be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> we were in <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
poverty</hi> for all this.</p>
            <p>I cry you mercy Sir, <hi>replyes the</hi> Countrey
man; I beseech you intercede with his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
to make me one of his Beads-men;
for I perceive poverty, as he makes it, is
better than all my Lands that I have the
Fee-simple of: but I pray think of a better
way to keep me out of the reach of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;</hi>
for if I have no manner of right to
what I enjoy, I may be endited next Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for all that I know; if I have any
right to it, then I have a property; and
if I have a property, how can I swear that
I have none, and will have none, neither
in my self, nor in common with others?</p>
            <p>Come, come, saith the <hi>Frier,</hi> these
are things too high for you; it is enough
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49659:131"/>
for us, that have had <hi>Scotus</hi> of our Order,

Vow and Rule, because the Dominion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
was reserved to the Papal See, he
published the <hi>Bull,</hi> Ad Conditorem; <hi>in
which he fully sets forth</hi> the hypocrisie <hi>of
the</hi> Franciscans <hi>in pretending to the</hi> perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<hi>of</hi> Poverty <hi>upon this</hi> reservation <hi>of
the</hi> right <hi>of</hi> property <hi>and</hi> Dominion <hi>to the</hi>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49659:132"/>
of a Christian life, lyes principally in
charity, which the Apostle calls the bond of
Perfection; which the contempt of worldly
things did only prepare men for, by taking
off that solicitude which the care of Worldly
affairs did carry along with it: but where
the same solicitude continues, there expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation,
<hi>as he calls it,</hi> can add nothing to
Perfection. But, <hi>saith he,</hi> it is notorious
that the Franciscans, after the said Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Property to the Popes, were rather more
than less solicitous about the procuring and
keeping of worldly things, both by suits at Law,
and otherwise. And under the pretence of this
reservation, they have unreasonably boasted of
the perfection of their Poverty; because they
have the bare Use of things without property
or Dominion. But if they would attend to
things rather than bare words, and submit
to Truth; they would find, that they had
much more than the bare Use, having the
liberty to sell, exchange or give away. And
in things consumed by Use, to separate the
property from the use, is repugnant both to
Law and Reason: and such a reserved Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
is not real but verbal, and a meer
fiction: but supposing there could be a bare
use, yet it could not be given the property
reserved; because there can be no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
between such a bare Use, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49659:132"/>
the full dominion. <hi>This and much more
is contained in the</hi> Popes Bull, <hi>which
fully manifests that all this pretence of</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
<hi>was a meer</hi> Iuggle; <hi>and fit only to
deceive the simple. For in things necessary
to life it is impossible to part with the</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<hi>and</hi> Dominion <hi>of them; and in other
things, it is great</hi> hypocrisie <hi>to pretend</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty

that those who are under them may <hi>possess

vows;</hi> (notwithstanding that one of these
<hi>Vows</hi> is that of <hi>Poverty,</hi> and that in the
first year of <hi>Novitiate, they are to renounce
all temporal goods not only which they
have at present, but may have hereafter</hi>)
by this means, they can not only discharge
themselves of unprofitable members with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any burden to the Society; but in case
any <hi>inheritance</hi> chance to fall to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>simple vow,</hi> they put in a fair

should leave the Congregation, and betake
themselves to some Religious Orders; for
be designed those of his Society should be
thought Religious only by the good example

the endowments of the Congregation, as long
as they continue in that liberty wherein
the Congregation was first setled: <hi>which</hi>

fearful lest that should not obey his

enflamed a Nation, what cause should I
have had to repent the attempt of Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psing

               <hi>that he did

for he said no such thing; but that which
he now tells us he meant by what he said,
was) <hi>that</hi> England, <hi>or the Countrey and

of S.</hi> Benedict: <hi>and this,</hi> he saith,
<hi>truly he must stand to.</hi> Some would be
glad to meet with any thing, which a man
of so uncertain a humour as he hath been,
will at last <hi>stand</hi> to; but the only reason
is, because <hi>he must; i. e.</hi> because he is a

of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is very unhappy to
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> that when he had Truth and
Reason on his side he could not <hi>stand</hi> to it
then; but there are some troublesome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,</hi>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:49659:141"/>
which fly up and down and make a

stand to it</hi> till they at last fall into the most
filthy places.</p>
            <p>But since Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> thinks this a great
aggravation of my crime, and is so resolved
<hi>to stand to it,</hi> I shall try whether he be not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being <hi>shocked</hi> even in this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
point of the honour belonging to
the <hi>English Benedictin</hi> Order. If then, it
cannot be proved, either that Christianity
was first brought among the <hi>English Saxons</hi>
by the <hi>Benedictins;</hi> or if it were, that it
was <hi>established</hi> in <hi>England</hi> by their means,
then all the reason Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will have left
<hi>to stand to</hi> this assertion will be only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>he must.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. I begin with the first bringing
of Christianity among the <hi>English Saxons;</hi>
and notwithstanding that the Ecclesiastical
History of those times, is for the most part
delivered by <hi>Saxon Monks,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a kindness for the <hi>Roman Missiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and very little for the <hi>Brittish Bishops</hi>
(as may be easily discerned even in <hi>Bede</hi>
himself) yet by laying several circumstances
together, we may make it appear that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
and his <hi>Companions</hi> were not the first
who brought the knowledge of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49659:141"/>
among the <hi>English Saxons.</hi> The first
settlement we find the <hi>Saxons</hi> made in this
<hi>Nation,</hi> (for no account of their Religion
is to be expected before) was after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Victory of <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Hengist</hi> was defeated; and afterwards
his Son <hi>Occa, Eosa</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in those parts submitted themselves to

the holy and single life of</hi> Letardus <hi>the

in allusion to the names of their Nation and

<hi>the desire of the English Nation to embrace

Augustin <hi>and his Companions; that the

too negligent in this Work, and began to be
more slack than formerly in it; that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
now, since he had taken so much care

he intreats them to send over so many

Is it so unquestionable that they were all

would have them prove <hi>Gregory</hi> to have been
a <hi>Benedictin,</hi> then they say he must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Augustin</hi> was so. So that the main
proof of the point, is, <hi>that it must needs be
so;</hi> and it must needs be so and they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<hi>to stand to it,</hi> because it is for the
honour and advantage of their Order. And
therefore our <hi>English Benedictins</hi> have
thought themselves more than a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this Controversie: for what
would open the purses and hearts of the
people more towards them, than for them
to be accounted the <hi>Apostolical Order</hi> of
<hi>England?</hi> Alas! what have the merits of
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> been to theirs? They, an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start
Order, that have converted some in
these latter times to <hi>Treason</hi> and the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;</hi>
but the <hi>Benedictins,</hi> the ancient
<hi>Apostolical Benedictins,</hi> were the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who <hi>Converted England</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith; and therefore they deserve
greater respect than the <hi>Iesuits;</hi> however
the others have been too cunning for them.
Thus we see, upon what <hi>hinge</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie</hi>
turns: and I cannot say, the

for Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> hath not been the

from the <hi>common Tradition of the English

This is proving it in <hi>I. S.</hi> his <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
way. As though it were possible for
the people to be deceived in a matter of

were by no means <hi>Equitians,</hi> or of any

<hi>Mons. Arnauld</hi> hath taken for <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation:</hi>
for,<note place="margin">S. 3. p. 9.</note> saith <hi>Reyner, I will instance
in an Age wherein all the Monasteries and
Cathedral Churches possessed by Monks in</hi>
England, <hi>were in the hands of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictins;</hi>
viz. <hi>in the Age of</hi> William <hi>the
Conquerour:</hi> for which he quotes many
Authors, as <hi>Mons. Arnauld</hi> doth to prove
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to have been the faith
of the same Age: <hi>Now since it is evident
that the Benedictin Order was then in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49659:150"/>
and no time can be instanced in
wherein the Benedictin Order was brought
into</hi> England <hi>from the time of</hi> Augustin, <hi>it
necessarily follows that</hi> Augustin <hi>and his
Companions brought it in.</hi> Here is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
in the case! which I grant to
be altogether as good, as that which the
men for <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> do produce for
their <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> Thus he proves it,
from Testimonies of Authors, and the
Foundations of Monasteries, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Histories of them; by which it
appearing, that they were at such a time
of the Benedictin Order, and no account
being given of any change of the Order,
he thinks it sufficiently proved that they
were Originally <hi>Benedictins.</hi> But is it
not possible to suppose that the Histories
being afterwards written by <hi>Benedictin
Monks,</hi> they would for the honour of their
<hi>Order</hi> conceal any such alteration, if it had
happened among them? We find in other
Countries, the <hi>Benedictins</hi> have done the
same thing, and why should we wonder if
they have done it in <hi>England? Trithemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>

               </gap>utation of
it. Now their Testimony, as it is set down
by Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> is thus, <hi>that they having
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49659:151"/>
spent much time in searching the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our Nation do affirm, they could find
only two sorts of Monks in the antient</hi>
Saxon <hi>Churches, the first such as followed
the</hi> Egyptian <hi>form of Monachism, before
S.</hi> Austin<hi>'s arrival</hi> (which plainly makes
against Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> being an express acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement,
that there was another Order
of <hi>Monks</hi> among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that <hi>Christianity</hi> was entertain'd by
them, before S. <hi>Austins</hi> arrival in <hi>England)
and the other</hi> Benedictins <hi>compantons of
S.</hi> Austin. <hi>And as for</hi> Equitians, <hi>no such
name was extant in any antient record.
Moreover, that whereas they could exactly
discover the Original and entrance of all
other Religious Orders, and could name the
very years, they could not do so of the</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictins,
<hi>which firmly argues that S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin
<hi>and his associates were</hi> Benedictins,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could hardly believe that Persons
of so much understanding would ever draw
up such a Testimony as this; which at least
seems to contradict it self; for whereas
they say, <hi>they could not name the year when
the</hi> Benedictins <hi>came in; and yet say that
S.</hi> Augustin <hi>and his companions did bring
the</hi> Benedictin <hi>Order hither;</hi> the time of
whose coming they as certainly knew, as of
any other Orders, looks too much like a
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49659:152"/>
contradiction for such great men to be
guilty of. But we must suppose they meant
any year after <hi>Augustins</hi> coming; yet I can
hardly think such knowing persons should
not at least be able to give a very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conjecture concerning it. For in the

<hi>Order</hi> was introduced by a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of some persons in some few places
before; to which the testimonies of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid,

but the general reception of it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the times of <hi>Dunstan;</hi> and with what
confusions and disorders, with what seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and injustice to the Canonical and
Secular Clergy it was then established, may
be easily seen in our Histories. For <hi>Dunstan,
Oswald,</hi> and <hi>Ethelwald</hi> set themselves

with all their power, (which was great by

<hi>stand to it, that Christianity was established
in</hi> England <hi>by the Disciples of S.</hi> Benedict,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49659:159"/>
hath drawn me to the Discourse of the
<hi>means</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> by which <hi>England</hi> was
converted; but it may be after all this he
may find out a reserve to himself, viz. <hi>that
he did not mean it of the first knowledge of
Christianity, but of the firm settlement of
it:</hi> But neither can this be his meaning, nor
if it were, is it any truer than the former.
It cannot be his meaning, for his words
are, <hi>that the English Saxons were indeed
converted by the Disciples of S.</hi> Benedict,
by which it is plain he speaks of the first
<hi>Conversion;</hi> but suppose he did not, the
<hi>establishment or settlement of Christianity</hi> is
no more owing to the <hi>Benedictins</hi> than the
first <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi> For which
we are to consider, that a sudden Apostasie
soon happened to <hi>Paganism</hi> after the death
of the first <hi>Princes</hi> who professed <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>§. 8. But it may be yet, Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> thinks
<hi>they were never true Christians till they
had received the Roman customes: and
that the honour of making them good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

For all that I can find, they were

Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will allow, for the causes

in good earnest think, that these are of
weight enough to <hi>unchurch</hi> whole Nations,
and null their <hi>Ordinations?</hi> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> hath
very learnedly set forth the state of the
Controversie about <hi>Tonsure;</hi> and he tells
us, <hi>there were three several kinds of Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
the first was called S.</hi> Peters,<note place="margin">Church hist. l. 16 c. 18. n. 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>which
was shaving the top of the head, leaving
below toward the forehead and ears a circle
or Diadem representing the Crown of Thorns
which our Lord bore: the second was S.</hi> Pauls
<hi>which was either a total shaving or at least
close polling of the whole head: the third
was called</hi> Simon Magus <hi>his Tonsure, by
which only a half crown was formed on the
lower part of the head before, from one ear
to the other, all the rest of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir being left

               <note place="margin">N. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Now saith</hi> Mr. <hi>Cressy, the
present dispute was, whether S.</hi> Peters <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Tonsure in use at</hi> Rome <hi>was to be
only received in Brittany?</hi> A very weighty
Controversie I confess; and very fit for
the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to be so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in;<note place="margin">N. 7.</note> for so Mr. <hi>C.</hi> tells us, <hi>that the
Popes of this Age took care, that S.</hi> Peters
<hi>Tonsure should be only received in</hi> Brittany.
And was there not great reason for it, since
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49659:162"/>
it was to be a <hi>mark</hi> of their <hi>slavery</hi> to the
<hi>Roman See?</hi> Good Lord! that ever men
should pretend to take <hi>care</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> and
excommunicate whole <hi>Churches</hi> for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the right fashion of <hi>shaving</hi> their
<hi>heads!</hi> Could they ever believe that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and S. <hi>Paul</hi> were so concerned whether
mens hair was cut in the form of a <hi>Crown,</hi>
or all off? No, they say, that <hi>Circumcision</hi>
is nothing and <hi>Uncircumcision</hi> is nothing;
but it seems the fashion of <hi>shaving</hi> is a very
great matter.</p>
            <p>But I suppose the weight of the business
lay in the keeping of <hi>Easter</hi> on a different
<hi>Sunday</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> Mr.
<hi>Cressy</hi> pretends to some skill in this matter,
and undertakes to correct many mistakes
of <hi>Protestants</hi> about it: and therefore to
prevent any needless quarrels I will take
the <hi>Controversie</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> himself states it,
and then see what can be made of it against
the <hi>Brittish</hi> and <hi>Scottish Churches</hi> and the
<hi>English</hi> which followed their example.
<hi>The errour of the Brittains</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Church hist. l. 13. c. 18. n. 11.</note> (and
consequently of the rest) <hi>consisted not as
generally Protestant writers conceive, in

means it came to pass, that if the fourteenth

would observe their Paschal solemnity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
which was contrary to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
practice of the Church, and utterly
forbidden by the first General Council of</hi>
Nicea.<note place="margin">

to distinguish the Christian Pasch from the

that it should be solemnized only on

day of the Moon fell, but the</hi> Sunday
<hi>following, and therefore counted alwayes
from the 15 to the 21, excluding the day of
the Iewish Pasch;</hi> which, he saith, <hi>was to
be celebrated exactly on the fourteenth day
of the first Moon after the Vernal Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox
on what day of the week soever it fell.</hi>
For Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s satisfaction, or rather for
the <hi>vindication</hi> of the <hi>Brittish,</hi> and <hi>Scottish
Churches</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> which followed
them, I shall enquire into two things.
1. The true state of the <hi>Controversie.</hi>
2. Whether the <hi>Roman Emissaries</hi> either
then had, or now have reason to charge
them with contradicting the <hi>Universal

            <p>§. 9. 1. <hi>For the</hi> state <hi>of the</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie;
<hi>we must consider, what they were
charged with by their enemies, and what
they had to say for themselves.</hi> Bede,

saith,</hi> that after the Resurrection or Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Saviour, the Apostles being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
abroad, and employed in preaching
the Gospel, could appoint nothing concerning
the Paschal Feast; but did observe it on
the fourteenth of the Moon what day soever it
fell upon. <hi>(Thus far sure the</hi> Brittish <hi>and</hi>
Scottish <hi>Christians were no</hi> Hereticks <hi>in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the</hi> Apostles <hi>did)</hi> But after, <hi>saith he,</hi>
the Apostles were gone, the Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
observed different customs, both as to
Paschal Fast and Feast; upon which by the
direction of Pope <hi>Victor</hi> a Council was called
at <hi>Caesarea</hi> for setling the way of keeping
<hi>Easter;</hi> where after they have fixed the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinox
on the eighth of the 5. Kal. of <hi>April,</hi>
they determined that the three dayes before
should be taken within the Paschal limits;
<hi>(so that the</hi> Sunday <hi>for</hi> Easter <hi>might be
reckoned on any day from the</hi> 11. Kal. <hi>of</hi>
April <hi>to the</hi> 11. Kal. of May, viz. <hi>from
the two and twentieth of</hi> March <hi>to the

withal they add,</hi> that it should not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for any to exceed these limits. <hi>And
yet afterwards these limits were so far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49659:168"/>
that the</hi> Latin Church <hi>in</hi> Leo'<hi>s time
made the</hi> Cycle <hi>of the</hi> Paschal Sundayes <hi>to
consist of thirty three dayes; and the</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian
Cycle <hi>took in two dayes more,</hi> viz.
<hi>the twenty fourth and twenty fifth of</hi> April,
<hi>because they found the former limits too
strait, unless they were understood of the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as they called it,</hi> i. e. <hi>that the
anniversary day of our Saviours</hi> passion <hi>should
alwayes fall between the two and twentieth
of</hi> March <hi>and one and twentieth of</hi> April.</p>
            <p>§. 11. The first person who published a
<hi>Paschal Canon</hi> was <hi>Hippolytus Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Porto, A. D.</hi> 222. above an hundred years
before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was
found <hi>A. D.</hi> 1551. and set forth by <hi>Scaliger</hi>
with <hi>Notes</hi> upon it, in which <hi>Canon</hi> he
makes the nearest <hi>Paschal Sunday</hi> to be the
sixteenth of the <hi>Moon</hi> which is <hi>March</hi> 20. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
the Lunar Month <hi>March</hi> 5. which is
one day before the <hi>Nicene Aequinox,</hi> and
five before that of <hi>Caesarea:</hi> and in which
he reckons the <hi>Paschal Sundayes</hi> not from
the fifteenth to the one and twentieth, but
from the sixteenth to the two and twentieth.
By which we may easily see, what reason
<hi>Wilfrid</hi> had to make the then practice of the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> to have been the Universal
practice of the Christian Church: for the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49659:169"/>
two fundamentals of the Rule then in use
were, that the <hi>Paschal Sunday</hi> should be
reckoned from the fifteenth to the one and
twentieth, and that it should never be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Aequinox.</hi> The first we meet with
who laid down this Rule about the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,</hi>
was <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there from <hi>A. D.</hi> 247. to <hi>A. D.</hi> 264. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

<hi>Laodicea,</hi> who would by no means have the
<hi>Paschal Sunday</hi> observed before the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,</hi>
which he following <hi>Sosigenes</hi> supposed
to be <hi>March</hi> 25. but made the first <hi>Easter</hi>
day to be <hi>March</hi> 27. But that which is
most observable in him to our purpose, is,
that he reckoned neither as the <hi>Latins</hi> from
the sixteenth to the two and twentieth,
nor as the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> from the fifteenth
to the one and twentieth, but from the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth

keeping <hi>Easter</hi> day upon the fourteenth, and
therein complying with those notable <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi>
called the <hi>Quartodecimani.</hi> But
<hi>Anatolius,</hi> in the Preface to his <hi>Canon,</hi> was so
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49659:169"/>
far from supposing an universal consent of
the <hi>Church</hi> in his time, that he complains
of very different and contrary <hi>Cycles</hi> that
were then in <hi>Use,</hi> some following <hi>Hippolytus</hi>
his Cycle of sixteen; others the <hi>Iewish Cycle</hi>
of eighty four; others a <hi>Cycle</hi> of twenty five;
others of thirty; and he mentions the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of <hi>Isidore, Hierom, Clement</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
all of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to compose this matter.
But notwithstanding all the care used to
settle this Controversie, the breaches of
the Church continued about it; and if we
believe <hi>Hen. Valesius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vales. not. in Euseb. l. 5. c. 23.</note> the inhabitants of

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what differences soever happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

all Churches obliged to reckon the</hi> Paschal

and consequently the</hi> Brittish <hi>and</hi> Scottish

the Council of</hi> Nice? This is all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that I know can be left in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but neither was this decreed in the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice;</hi> nor if it were, was it
universally observed after it. A <hi>Synodical

from the fifteenth inclusive to the one and

the difference between the two

had to condemn them. <hi>Was it that they

saith on the 12. Kal. of <hi>April,
March</hi> 21. the very day of the <hi>Vernal Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinox:</hi>
So he tells us, they did in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who it seems
thought it no <hi>heresie</hi> so to do, even after the
<hi>decree</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> But I suppose
the main fault of the <hi>Brittish</hi> and <hi>Scottish
Churches</hi> was, <hi>that at some times it would
so happen that they might keep their</hi> Easter-<hi>day
on the fourteenth of the Moon, and so
comply with the Iews.</hi> Was this it in truth
which <hi>unchurched</hi> them all, and rendred
their <hi>Ordinations</hi> null? The <hi>Apostles</hi> I am
sure did far more in complyance with the
<hi>Iews</hi> than this came to, as to matter of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
and other things, and even in this
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:49659:173"/>
point, if Ecclesiastical History may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited,
and yet I hope their <hi>Ordinations</hi>
were good, and the <hi>Churches Orthodox</hi>
which they planted. Methinks, it might
have been called <hi>complyance with the Apostles</hi>
as well with as the <hi>Iews?</hi> and will indeed
complyance with an <hi>Apostolical practice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church</hi>
whole Nations? it must be surely
only with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> that it can do
so. And yet did not the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
it self comply with the <hi>Iews</hi> in the <hi>use</hi> of
their <hi>Cycle,</hi> and in the beginning of their
<hi>Lunar Month</hi> on the fifth, and not on the
eighth of <hi>March</hi> as the <hi>Alexandrians?</hi>
And why should one sort of <hi>complyance</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church
people, and not another? If every
<hi>complyance</hi> doth it, farewell to the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> it self and her <hi>Ordinations,</hi> even
after the <hi>Nicene Council.</hi> But, what if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> after the
embracing the <hi>Alexandrian Cycle,</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
more with the <hi>Iews</hi> than the <hi>Brittish
Churches</hi> did in keeping their <hi>Easter</hi> on the
fourteenth of the Moon: for by that <hi>Canon</hi>
they were to keep it on the fifteenth, and that
was the great <hi>Festival day</hi> among the <hi>Iews,</hi>
for on the evening of the fourteenth they
did eat their <hi>bitter herbs,</hi> but the next
day was the <hi>solemn Festival:</hi> and I would
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain understand whether it were not a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49659:173"/>
complyance with the <hi>Iews</hi> to feast the
same day they did, than to keep that for a
<hi>Festival,</hi> on which they eat their <hi>bitter
herbs,</hi> and began the <hi>Passeover</hi> only on
the evening? Besides, they who kept it on
the fifteenth, must celebrate the memory of
<hi>Christs passion</hi> before the fourteenth, which
certainly was as great an incongruity as
could happen by keeping it on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth.
But supposing it were a <hi>complyance</hi>
with the <hi>Iews;</hi> it is plain it was not a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
and designed complyance with them;
for they kept their <hi>Easter</hi> on the <hi>Lords day</hi>
in opposition to them; only it happened
<hi>once in seven years,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Cressy, that
the fourteenth of the Moon and</hi> Easter <hi>met,
and then they kept it with the Iews;</hi> If this
were it which <hi>unchurched</hi> them; how hard
was it for such <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Scots to enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven!</hi> Or rather,
how hard is it for such who can <hi>Unchurch</hi>
whole Nations of <hi>Christians</hi> on such pittiful
accounts as these? S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have said,
I will keep no <hi>Easter</hi> while the world stands,
<hi>rather than destroy</hi> whole <hi>Churches</hi> of such
<hi>for whom Christ dyed.</hi> But what do we
meddle with S. <hi>Paul;</hi> they are only the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers</hi>
of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Chair,</hi> that dare so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily,

               <note place="margin">Epist. Apol. sect. 98, 99. p. 119.</note> and deserving
serious consideration; which is,
<hi>how far those who acknowledge subjection to

of what the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> saith
upon this subject; and then consider
what Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> offers by way of Reply
to it.</p>
            <p>1. He saith,<note place="margin">Ani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <q>that the <hi>Personal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> was that, and that only
which first made the <hi>Schism,</hi> and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues

of the <hi>English Catholicks</hi> against
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and produced
their separation from it; and if they will
renounce all that <hi>Personal Authority</hi> in
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and any obedience to it within
his Majesties Kingdoms, they will purge
themselves of all such jealousie, or suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of their Fidelity, as may prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the Kingdom, and against which
the <hi>Laws</hi> are provided: because it is

security of Kings and Princes, and for
the peace and quiet of Kingdoms, that it
may be clearly made manifest, what the
<hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> is, that a <hi>forreign

Dominions contrary to, and above the
Laws of the Land, and what obedience
it is that subjects may pay to such a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince,</hi> without the privity, and
contrary to the command of his own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign;
which cannot be done by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Answer, but by distinct assigning the
bounds of the <hi>Popes Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Power in England;</hi> and what the full
intent of them is, that the King may

discern whether he hath enough of either
to preserve himself and the Peace of the
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">P. 245.</note> That till such time as the <hi>Roman-Catholick
Subjects of England</hi> give as good
security to the King for their Fidelity and
peaceable behaviour, as all his other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
do, they have no cause to wonder
that they may be made subject to such
Laws and restraints, as may disable them
from being dangerous; when they profess
to owe obedience to a <hi>forreign Prince,</hi>
who doth as much profess not to be a
friend to their Countrey, and will not
declare what that obedience is.</p>
               <p>4.<note place="margin">P. 9, 101.</note> That the <hi>Roman Catholick Subjects</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> have a more immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance

any Catholick Countryes: and that those
who under pretence of Religion refuse to
declare, that it is in no Earthly Power to
absolve them from their Fidelity to the
King, do refuse to give as full satisfaction
and security for their Allegiance, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

               <p>5.<note place="margin">P. 71, 72.</note> That there is so much the more
reason to require this, since the late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

of the <hi>Irish Rebellion,</hi> wherein the

and assumed the exercise of the <hi>Regal

those Catholicks, and threatned
to take away their Lives who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
the peace, and desired to return to

a severe check to those of the <hi>Irish No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>

the <hi>Pope</hi> had no Power to dispense with
their <hi>Fidelity</hi> to his Majesty, or to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
them from any Oaths they should
take to that purpose: and imployed his

that <hi>Declaration,</hi> and to take care that it
should proceed no further;<note place="margin">P. 75.</note> and that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianl
Barbarine</hi> at that same time put
them in mind, <hi>that the Kingdom of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
<hi>was still under Excommunication;</hi>
and since that, the <hi>Pope</hi> hath made many
<hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
had forborn to do from the death of
<hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> to <hi>A. D.</hi> 1640. And
therefore there is no reason to believe,
that the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth recede from

much weight along with them, as may easily
raise the expectation of any one, to see
what Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> will reply to them. And
in truth he enters the <hi>Field</hi> like a <hi>Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>

               <hi>and what he writes
on this special subject,</hi> he desires the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>of</hi> Honour to consider, not as the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable

And he doth assure him, that there is
not any one Point of Controversie upon which
they more earnestly desire to be summoned
to give an account before equal Iudges, than
this.</hi> Thus he enters the lists, and walks
his ground, and brandishes his sword, and
makes legs to the Judges with more than
ordinary assurance, and fails in no point of
a <hi>Champion,</hi> but overcoming his Adversary.
Which he is so far from, that after these Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado's
and flourishes he dares not stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; but looks round about him to
discern any way to escape. But although
it be beneath the Greatness of his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to pursue him over all his Bogs, and to
draw him out of his Fastnesses; yet I shall
endeavour to bring him into the Lists again,
that his Adversary may not go away blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at so mean a Triumph.</p>

               <hi>There are five things which Mr.</hi> Cressy

1.<note place="margin">P. 112, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>13.</note> That there is no reason to suspect the
Catholick subjects of <hi>England</hi> to be more
wanting in Fidelity to their Prince than of
other Nations, whose Catholick Ancestors
were so far from acknowledging any Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Pope in Temporals, and much
less any Authority in him to depose Princes,
that even in those times when Church-men
had the greatest Power in this Kingdom,
Statutes were made with the joynt Votes of
the Clergic upon occasion of some Usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court,<note place="margin">Stat. 25, &amp; 27 Eaw. 3. Stat. 16 R. 2.</note> in which the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
was no less than a Praemunire against
any one who without the Kings License
should make any Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to a Legats jurisdiction, or upon the
Popes Summons go out of the Kingdom, or
receive any Mandats or Brieffs from <hi>Rome,</hi>
or purchase Bulls for presentments to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
and which is most considerable, the
ground of their rejecting Papal Usurpations
is thus expressed, For the Crown of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
is free, and hath been free from
earthly subjection at all times, being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
subject to God in all things touching
the Regalities of the same, and not subject
to the Pope; to which <hi>he saith,</hi> the Bishops
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:49659:177"/>
assented, and the Lords and Commons decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their Resolution to stand with the King in
the cases aforesaid, and in all other cases
attempted against him his Crown and Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in all points, to live and to dye.</p>
            <p>2. That whatsoever they suffer here in
<hi>England</hi> by vertue of the Poenal Laws,<note place="margin">P. 125.</note> it is
purely for their Religion and the Catholick
faith; <hi>and therefore he parallels</hi> our Poenal
Laws, with those of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi>
against <hi>Daniel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 122.</note> and of <hi>Nero, Domitian</hi> and
<hi>Dioclesian</hi> against the Apostles and their
successors:<note place="margin">P. 44.</note> and yet Mr. <hi>Cressy confesses,</hi>
that the occasion of the Poenal Laws, was the
treasonable actions of some of their own
Religion;<note place="margin">P. 104.</note> 
               <hi>but he adds,</hi> that they were scarce
one score of persons, and abhorred by all
the rest, for which actions of theirs, <hi>he
confesseth,</hi> that care is taken of exacting
Oaths both of Fidelity and Supremacy from
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks as dangerous Subjects;
and dayes of Thanksgiving are kept for the
discovery and prevention of such personal
Treasons; whereas, <hi>saith he,</hi> the whole
Kingdoms deliverance from almost an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Rebellion designing the extinction of
Monarchy and Prelacy both, and executing
the murder of the lawful Soveraign is not
esteemed a sufficient motive for such publick
Thanksgivings, neither it seems is there
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:49659:178"/>
at all a necessity of requiring from any a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of the Principles of Rebellion, or a
promise that it shall not be renewed. <hi>By
which we might think Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>had been
utterly a stranger in his own Countrey, and
had never heard of the thirtieth of</hi> Ianuary
<hi>or the twenty ninth of</hi> May, <hi>which are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
observed in our Church, and the</hi>
Offices <hi>joyned with that of the fifth of</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,
<hi>and are purposely intended for that
very thing which he denyes to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of by us, in such a manner. What
must we say to such men? who openly and
to our faces deny that, which the whole
Nation knows to be true. These stories
might have passed abroad, where they have
been wont to lye for the</hi> Catholick Cause,
<hi>but to have the impudence to say such things
here, which every Boy can confute, is not
the way to advance the</hi> Reputation <hi>of their</hi>
Church <hi>among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what doth Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> think, <hi>the
Renuntiation of the Covenant</hi> was intended
for, if not to prevent the mischief of the
former Rebellion? And is it possible for
any man who knows the <hi>Laws</hi> of his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi>
concerning these matters, to dare to
say in the face of the Kingdom, <hi>That it
seems there is no necessity at all of requiring
from any a Retraction of the principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:49659:178"/>
or a promise it shall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed?</hi>
If this be the way of defending the
innocency of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, I had
rather be accounted guilty, than have my
innocency thus defended.</p>
            <p>3. He saith,<note place="margin">P. 100.</note> 
               <hi>We also confidently affirm,</hi>
(so we have seen he hath done too much
already) <hi>that by vertue of the Spiritual
Iurisdiction inherent in the Pope, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Rights and Power of the King (or even
of the meanest of his Subjects) are not at all
abridged, or prejudiced. Which assertion,</hi>
he saith, <hi>hath been alwayes maintained in</hi>
France, <hi>the Pope not contradicting it; from
whence it follows, that it is agreeable to
Catholick Religion.</hi> After this I expected he
should speak home to the purpose, and say,
<hi>this is all the Power challenged by the Pope
as to</hi> England, <hi>or owned by any</hi> Roman
<hi>Catholicks here;</hi> which, finding what he
had affirmed about other matters, I thought
he would have made no scruple of; but I
see he durst not, either for conscience or
meer shame. But how then doth he get
over this difficulty? <hi>Why English Catholicks,</hi>
saith he, <hi>should be suspected not to be as
tender of the just Rights and precious lives
also of their Soveraign, as the Catholick
Subjects of any other Kingdom, and why
they should be thought to be willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:49659:179"/>
any Temporal Power director in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct,
to be inherent in the Pope over the
King or Kingdom, to which not any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Gentleman or Nobleman would submit,
I cannot imagine.</hi> I am very much to seek
for the sense of this, and know not what
<hi>the submitting</hi> relates to; but I suppose
something left out, or struck out by his <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,</hi>
who did not take care to leave
sense behind: But is this indeed all the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> offers, <hi>that he cannot imagine
it should be otherwise here than in</hi> France?
We find, when he pleases, he can imagine
strange things: and is this only out of the
reach of his imagination? What doth he
think, <hi>of the Kingdoms being under Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
at</hi> Rome, as <hi>Cardinal Barbarine</hi>
takes care <hi>to put the Irish Nobility in
mind,</hi> for some good end doubtless. Is
the <hi>Kingdom of France</hi> so? What doth he
imagine of <hi>Bulls</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> prohibiting the
taking the <hi>Oaths</hi> required? Are there any
such things in <hi>France?</hi> What doth he think
of the <hi>Popes Nuntio</hi> appearing in the Head
of an <hi>Army,</hi> and absolving the <hi>Kings</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from their Allegiance? I confess, it
was not much better in <hi>France</hi> in the time
of the <hi>Holy League;</hi> but what opinion had
they of the <hi>Popes temporal Power</hi> then?
Cannot Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> imagine that there are
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49659:179"/>
such people in <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Iesuits?</hi> and it
is not many years since their <hi>Reasons</hi> were
therefore shewed to be <hi>Unreasonable</hi> in
pleading an exemption from the <hi>Sanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Laws, because they did hold the Popes
power of deposing Princes, and absolving
Subjects from their Allegiance.</hi> And do
not the <hi>Iesuitical</hi> party still plead that their
opinion is the common doctrine of their
<hi>Church,</hi> confirmed by <hi>General Councils,</hi> and
approved by <hi>multitudes</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> of all
sorts; and that the contrary is only asserted
here, by a very inconsiderable party, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
some are <hi>excommunicated</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> for
their zeal in this matter? And do not we
know, how much greater sway the <hi>Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
party</hi> hath among the <hi>Nobility</hi> and
<hi>Gentry,</hi> than the despised <hi>Secular Priests?</hi>
I do not at all question, but the <hi>Nobility</hi>
and <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would do as much
to preserve <hi>the just Rights and precious
lives of their Soveraigns,</hi> as of any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the World, and have as great a sense
of their own <hi>Honour</hi> as well as <hi>Interest,</hi>
and of the <hi>Duty</hi> they owe to their <hi>Countrey.</hi>
But ought not the <hi>Laws</hi> to take so much
the more care to keep their <hi>Consciences</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
in these things? they being such
Persons whose Loyalty cannot be corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but under a <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>Conscience;</hi>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:49659:180"/>
and their <hi>Consciences</hi> being so much in
danger, by being under the direction chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of those who are the sworn <hi>servants</hi> to
the <hi>Papal Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. He offers by way of <hi>satisfaction</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their <hi>Fidelity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 108.</note> 
               <hi>that they will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the</hi> French <hi>Declaration lately made
by the</hi> Sorbon, <hi>or the Censure of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of</hi> Paris A. D. 1626.<note place="margin">P. 116.</note> 
               <hi>and that very
few if any at all would refuse subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that Form prescribed by the State,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 111. P. 120.</note> 
               <hi>in
case that unlucky word heretical were left
out.</hi> As though all those who had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
refused to take that <hi>Oath,</hi> had done it
only upon this nicety, that the word <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
were to be taken not in the sense of the
<hi>Givers,</hi> but of the <hi>Takers</hi> of the <hi>Oath:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> himself saith,<note place="margin">P. 112.</note> 
               <hi>that common
Reason teaches, that all Oaths, Professions
and Promises are to be understood in the
sense of those who frame and require them,
and not of those upon whom they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</hi>
But if this were all the ground of
refusing this <hi>Oath</hi> among any of them,
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> therein charges them with the
<hi>want</hi> of <hi>common Reason:</hi> whereas I shall
make it appear in the progress of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
that this was far from being the true
and only reason of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> refusing
the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:49659:180"/>5. That since Ordination abroad doth not
in the least render English Priests defective
in their duties to the Civil Magistrate;<note place="margin">P. 121.</note> it
will follow that whatsoever penalty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on them on such an account, is not
inflicted according to the Rule of Iustice,
and by consequence that whatsoever blood
shall be shed, the guilt of it before God will
be imputed to the whole Kingdom, since it is
shed by vertue of the whole Kingdoms votes,
and consent given long since upon motives
long since ceased. <hi>And therefore he charges
it deeply</hi> upon my conscience to endeavour to
free the whole Kingdom from such a guilt.
<hi>This is the substance of what Mr.</hi> Cressy
<hi>saith upon this</hi> very important subject, <hi>as
himself calls it; and by vertue whereof he
hopes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 119.</note> the poenal Laws may be repealed,
and those of their Religion may enjoy the
Liberty of their Religion and all the
Rights of Free-born Subjects.<note place="margin">P. 98.</note> 
               <hi>Which are
things too</hi> important <hi>to be debated in
such a manner by persons who by making
reflections on the</hi> Iustice <hi>and</hi> Wisdom <hi>of a</hi>
Nation <hi>do endeavour to expose the</hi> Laws
<hi>and</hi> Government <hi>of it to the censure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the malicious and ignorant. But
since our</hi> Laws <hi>are so publickly accused of</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
<hi>and</hi> cruelty, <hi>and the Kingdom charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the</hi> guilt of innocent blood, <hi>I hope I

the</hi> Laws <hi>of our</hi> Countrey, <hi>and as a</hi>
Protestant <hi>to wipe off the aspersion of</hi> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
<hi>from our</hi> Religion: <hi>which I shall do
without the least intention of mischief to
any mens persons, or of sharpening the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of Laws against them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 3. And to proceed with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
clearness in this matter, I shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
            <p>1. The charge of injustice and cruelty
which he lays upon our <hi>poenal Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The proposals he makes in order to the
repeal of them, and giving a full liberty to
the exercise of their Religion.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The charge of injustice and cruelty
upon our poenal Laws.</hi> Whosoever adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to charge the publick <hi>Laws</hi> of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in such a manner ought to be very
well advised upon what grounds he proceeds;
and to understand throughly the nature, and
constitution of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of
<hi>Iustice,</hi> and the power of interpreting as
well as making <hi>Laws,</hi> and the certain bounds
within which <hi>Laws</hi> may make actions <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,</hi>
and how far actions thought <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>
by the Persons who do them, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>treasonable</hi> when they are against
<hi>Laws</hi> made for the publick safety; and what
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:49659:182"/>
actions of <hi>Religion</hi> make men <hi>Martyrs</hi>
when they suffer for them and what not;
for it is certain, they are not all of equal
consequence and necessity; these and many
other things a man ought to come well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with, that dares in the face of the
World to charge the <hi>Laws</hi> of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with <hi>injustice and cruelty.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi>
may be excused in this matter, for that
would indeed be an <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>cruel Law</hi>
to require <hi>impossibilities</hi> from men: I wish
so noble a subject had been undertaken by
a Person fit for it, that could have managed
it otherwise than in a bare declamatory
manner. But since he is the <hi>Goliah</hi> that
dares so openly defie our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
I shall make use of his own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
to cut off the heads of this terrible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation.
For, 1. He grants, <hi>That the
Laws made by their Catholick Ancestors,</hi>
viz. <hi>the Statutes of</hi> Praemunire <hi>and</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
were <hi>just Laws. 2. That our King hath
reason to expect as much security of the
Fidelity of his Catholick Subjects, as any
Catholick Prince hath from his. 3. That
all Christian Kings have in some sense a
kind of spiritual Authority, that they ought
to be Nursing Fathers to Gods Church, that
they ought to promote true Christian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
both touching Faith and manners,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:49659:183"/>
and to imploy their power when occasion is,</hi>

               <hi>to
oblige even Ecclesiastical Persons to perform
their duties, and all their Subjects to live
in all Christian Piety and Vertue.</hi> These

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n words, which in short come to
this, that they are bound to promote and
pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erve the true Religion.<note place="margin">P. 105.</note> 4. <hi>That it is
absolutely unlawful for them to defend their
Religion, being persecuted by Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
by any other way but suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
which, he saith, <hi>they do sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
according to their perswasion. 5. That
the treasonable actions of persons of their
own Religion were the occasion of making
and continuing the poenal Laws: for upon
their account,</hi> he saith, <hi>they are thought
dangerous Subjects,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 104.</note> 
               <hi>and care is taken to
exact Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy
from them. 6. That where the Popes tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
power is owned, especially as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Princes, there can be no sufficient se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
given as to the Fidelity of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
This I prove from his saying, <hi>that
there is no reason to question their Fidelity,
whose Ancestors were so far from any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of the Pope in Temporals, and much
less any Authority in him to depose Princes,
that they made the Statutes of</hi> Praemunire
<hi>and</hi> Provisors, (which by his favour is a
very weak argument, unless men can never
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:49659:183"/>
be supposed to degenerate from the <hi>Vertues</hi>
of their <hi>Ancestors)</hi> but besides, <hi>the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
he offers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 116, 117</note> 
               <hi>is by renouncing the Popes
temporal power, and declaring that his power
of deposing Princes, and absolving Subjects
from their Allegiance, is repugnant to the
Word of God, although they dare not call it
heretical;</hi> from whence it follows, that
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> doth not think those can give
sufficient security for their Fidelity, who
dare not thus far renounce the Popes
power.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>That where there is no sufficient secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
given for the Fidelity of Persons, there
is great reason they should lye under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of Laws.</hi> Which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
supposes; and only complains of their
hardship upon the offers he makes of their
<hi>Fidelity.</hi> And this must hold as to all
sorts of persons who may be dangerous to
Government, although they may pretend
never so much <hi>exemption</hi> by their <hi>Function,</hi>
or being imployed in <hi>Offices</hi> not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relating to <hi>Civil Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From these concessions it will be no
difficult task to clear our <hi>Poenal Laws</hi>
from <hi>injustice,</hi> and to vindicate the whole
<hi>Kingdom</hi> from the <hi>guilt of innocent blood,</hi>
if I can prove these following asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:49659:184"/>1. That the same <hi>Reasons</hi> which justifie
the antient <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and the
<hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Catholick Princes</hi> abroad, do vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
our <hi>Poenal Laws</hi> from the charge of
<hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>Cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Laws</hi> originally made upon the
account of acknowledged <hi>treasonable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi>
do continue just upon all those who
do not give sufficient security against the
<hi>principles</hi> leading to those <hi>practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the same Reasons which justifie
the antient <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the
<hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Catholick Princes</hi> abroad, do vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
our <hi>Poenal Laws</hi> from the charge of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi>
and <hi>Cruelty.</hi> For if the <hi>penalties</hi> do
bear no greater proportion to the nature of
the <hi>offence;</hi> if the <hi>Power</hi> be as <hi>great</hi> and
as <hi>just</hi> in our <hi>Law-makers;</hi> if the <hi>occasions</hi>
were of as high a nature, and the <hi>pleas</hi> in
behalf of the persons <hi>equal:</hi> then there can
be no <hi>reason</hi> assigned why those <hi>Laws</hi> should
be just and lawful, and not ours. And the
making out of these things is my present
business.</p>
            <p>1. I begin with the <hi>antient Laws and
Statutes of England.</hi> And I hope no one
dares question, but that the <hi>power</hi> of make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Laws</hi> is as good and just in <hi>England</hi>
since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as ever it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
For if there be the least diminution
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:49659:184"/>
of <hi>Power</hi> by vertue of the cutting off the
<hi>Popes Authority,</hi> then so much of the <hi>Civil
Power</hi> as was lost by it, was derived from
the <hi>Pope:</hi> and this is in plain terms to make
the <hi>Pope</hi> our <hi>Temporal Soveraign,</hi> and the
whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> to be only <hi>Feudatary</hi> to
him: which is asserting his <hi>Temporal power</hi>
with a vengeance; and contains in it a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that none but very <hi>Self-denying
Princes</hi> can ever give the least countenance
to; because it strikes at the very root of
their Authority, and makes them only <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
Princes,</hi> (and in a much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
sense than the <hi>Popes</hi> use that Title,
<hi>The Servants of Servants.)</hi> Supposing then
the <hi>Legislative</hi> and <hi>Civil Power</hi> to be equal
since the <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>before;</hi> our work
is to compare the other circumstances toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and if it appear, that the <hi>Plea</hi> of
<hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> did equally hold
then, and notwithstanding that the <hi>penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
were as <hi>great,</hi> upon the same or far
less occasions, I hope our <hi>Laws</hi> will at
least appear as <hi>just</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> as those
were.</p>
            <p>§. 4. To make this out, I must give
an account of the <hi>State</hi> of those times, and
the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Occasions</hi> which moved the
<hi>Law-makers</hi> to enact those <hi>Poenal Statutes:</hi>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:49659:185"/>
in which I shall shew these two things.
1. That they began upon a controversie of
<hi>Religion;</hi> and that the <hi>Poenal Laws</hi> were
made against those persons who pleaded
Religion. 2. That the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of the <hi>Poenal Laws</hi> since the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
were at least as great as those.</p>
            <p>1. That the antient <hi>Poenal Laws</hi> were
made upon a <hi>Controversie</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> And
to give a clear account of the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi>
of them, I must begin from the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Conquest;</hi> for then those Foundations
were laid of all the following controversies
which happened between the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Power.</hi> On the behalf of the
<hi>Ecclesiastical Power</hi> was the plea of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
and <hi>Religion,</hi> on the behalf of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Power</hi> nothing but the <hi>just Rights of
Princes,</hi> and the necessary preservation of
their own and the publick safety. And
this <hi>Controversie</hi> between the <hi>Two Powers</hi>
was managed with so much zeal, and such
pretences of <hi>Conscience</hi> on the behalf of the
<hi>Ecclesiastical Power,</hi> that the <hi>Civil Power,</hi>
notwithstanding the courage of some <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and the resolution of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> had
much ado to stand its ground, or to be able
to preserve it self from the encroachments
and Usurpations of the other. So that to
see <hi>Princes</hi> give any <hi>Countenance</hi> to the same
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49659:185"/>
pretences would be almost as strange, as to
see them turn <hi>Common-wealths-men.</hi> I know
there were good <hi>Laws</hi> frequently made to
strengthen the <hi>Civil Power;</hi> but the very
<hi>frequency</hi> of them shewed how <hi>ineffectual</hi>
they were; For what need many Laws to
the same purpose, if the first had any force
at all? and the multiplication of <hi>Laws</hi> for
the same thing, is a certain sign of defect
in the <hi>Government.</hi> To undeceive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all those who judge of the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Affairs</hi> by the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Statutes,</hi> I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the History of this great <hi>Controversie</hi>
between the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil Power</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> so far as to shew the necessity
there was found of putting an issue to it,
by casting out the <hi>Popes</hi> pretended <hi>Power</hi>
and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> in this <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two first who began this Dispute,
were both men of great Spirits and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in their undertakings; I mean <hi>william</hi>
the <hi>Conqueror</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh, who
was the first <hi>Pope</hi> that durst speak out; and
he very freely declares his mind about the
subjection of the <hi>Civil Power</hi> to the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical,</hi>
and the exemption of all <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Persons</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> from the <hi>Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>

Kings and Dukes had their beginnings from

and it is hard to conceive any other could
be meant in this case. The King sends
some of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> to him to
put him in mind of his Oath to observe the
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> of the <hi>Realm;</hi> he told
him they were to be understood with the
reservation of <hi>being according to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 40.</note> and
that it was not so, to keep him from going
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and therefore he would not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it; and so takes his leave of the King
to be gone; and the King after his going
seizes upon all his profits. I desire to know
of such as Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> whether the <hi>King</hi> or
<hi>Anselm</hi> were in the right in all this affair?
And if the <hi>King</hi> had used greater severity
to him, whether <hi>Anselm</hi> had suffered on
the account of <hi>Religion</hi> Or <hi>Treason?</hi> But he
complains to the <hi>Pope,</hi>

               <hi>that the Law of God,

               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:49659:190"/>
and therefore he resigns his <hi>Archbishoprick

if the other were properly <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
to <hi>Princes,</hi> this is so to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and
thereby they are bound to the very same

               <hi>Princes</hi> and the <hi>duty</hi> they owe to them;
not the least notice being taken of them, as
though they did owe them any allegiance:
which we plainly see was never intended
should be paid by those who first imposed
this Oath. That Learned Gentleman Sir
<hi>Roger Twisden</hi> supposes this oath to have
been framed by <hi>Paschal</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Historical Vindicat. Chapt. 3. n. 50.</note> and it is certain,
that <hi>Rodulphus</hi> being made <hi>Archbishop of

after whose time we frequently meet with
it, but not before:<note place="margin">Eadmer. l. 5. p. 113.</note> but in truth, it is the

who make so many scruples about <hi>oaths</hi> of
<hi>Allegiance</hi> to <hi>Princes,</hi> that they make none
at all about this, which as far as I can see,
leaves no room for <hi>Allegiance</hi> to them, any

The first contriver of this Oath to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> was no other than <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. who
could not be thought to understand less
than the strictest Allegiance by it, since he
required Fealty from Temporal Princes, and
forbad all Clergy-men paying homage to
them. In the <hi>Council</hi> held by him at <hi>Rome,
A. D.</hi> 1079. the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Aquileia</hi>
took an <hi>Oath</hi> in the same form with that
published by <hi>Raynaldus</hi> out of the <hi>Vatican</hi>

the Roman Papacy and the Royalties of S.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which makes me wonder how the
form extant in the <hi>Canon Law</hi> should have
it <hi>Regulas Sanctorum Patrum</hi> instead of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia
Sancti Petri,</hi> for we are not to imagin
that <hi>Gregory</hi> 9. had any such thought to
bring down the <hi>Royalties of S.</hi> Peter to the
<hi>ancient Canons;</hi> and the <hi>oath</hi> which was
taken had the <hi>Regalia sancti Petri</hi> alwayes
in it from <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. time: unless they
hoped to deceive the <hi>simple</hi> by this means,
for we find that even <hi>Cassander</hi> himself
thought there had been no other <hi>Form</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that in the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> till the <hi>Bishop</hi>

were come to that height between the <hi>Civil

must yeild; the <hi>Ecclesiastical Power</hi> being
in the hands of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> a man after

there was so much matter prepared, and
such heat on both sides, it was no great

them was about <hi>Gregory</hi> the sevenths
principles, and if he dyed a <hi>Martyr</hi> for any
thing, it was in defence of these. Which
I shall the rather do,<note place="margin">La Vie de S. Thomas de Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

very lately published in <hi>French</hi> with a high
character of him, and dedicated to the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> but especially because I
find, that those among us of that Religion,
who disown <hi>Gregory</hi> the sevenths principles,
are willing to believe him a <hi>Martyr</hi> upon
other grounds,<note place="margin">History of the Irish Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance, from p. 397 to 462.</note> viz. <hi>that his quarrel with
the King was upon the account of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

I shall therefore prove, 1. That the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in Dispute between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Becket,</hi>
were the very same that <hi>Gregory</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
and his successors contended about,
with <hi>Christian Princes.</hi> 2. That the pleas
made use of by <hi>Becket</hi> and his party were
no other, than those, which <hi>Gregory</hi> the
seventh and his successors used, so that they
had no relation at all to the <hi>Municipal
Laws,</hi> but to the controversie then on Foot
between the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Power.</hi>
In both which I hope to make some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages

            <p>1. For the matters in <hi>Dispute</hi> between
them. The whole controversie might be
reduced to two heads. 1. Whether <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Persons</hi> were unaccountable to the
<hi>Civil Power</hi> for any misdemeanours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by them? 2. Whether the <hi>Pope</hi> had
the <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> over <hi>Princes</hi> and all
under them, so that he might contradict
the <hi>Kings Laws and Customs,</hi> and command
his <hi>Subjects</hi> against his consent to come to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:49659:201"/>
him? and whether the <hi>Kings Subjects</hi> in such
cases were not bound to obey the <hi>Pope,</hi> let
the <hi>King</hi> command what he please? These,
in truth, were the points in debate, and the
most weighty particulars in the <hi>Customs</hi> of
<hi>Clarendon</hi> were but as so many branches of
these. In that Copy of them which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in the <hi>Cotton MS.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cod. Cotton. l. 1. l. 12.</note> and was drawn up by
the <hi>Kings</hi> own Order, the occasion of them
is set down, <hi>to have been the differences
which had happened between the Clergie
and the Kings Iustices and the Barons of the
Kingdom about the Customs and Dignities of
the Crown;</hi> the most considerable of those
which the <hi>Pope</hi> condemned were concerning
1. <hi>The Tryal of Titles of Advowsons and
Presentations in the Kings Courts. 2. The
Tryal of Clergie-men before the Kings
Iudges; and the Churches not defending
them after conviction or confession. 3. That
neither Archbishops, Bishops or others should
go out of the Kingdom, without the Kings
consent, and giving security to the King,
that in going, staying, or returning, they
will do nothing to the prejudice either of
the King or Kingdom. 4. The profits of
Ecclesiastical Courts upon absolutions,</hi> for
they demanded not barely <hi>personal security</hi>
of all <hi>excommunicated persons,</hi> to stand to
the <hi>Churches judgements,</hi> but <hi>Vadium ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manens</hi>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:49659:202"/>
as the <hi>Law term</hi> was then, which
implyes <hi>real security,</hi> or so much money
laid down which was to come to the <hi>Court,</hi>
if they did not perform the conditions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
For it was one of the things the
<hi>Kings</hi> Ambassadour complained of to his
<hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Empress,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cod. Cotton. L 1. ep. 49.</note> 
               <hi>that the matters in
controversie were not things of advantage
to mens souls, but to their own purses;</hi> and
<hi>that the Faults of Offenders were not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in the Ecclesiastical Courts by the
injoyning of Penance, but by the giving of
money.</hi> And the <hi>Empress</hi> her self in her
discourse with <hi>Nicholas de Monte</hi> the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops</hi>
Friend, insisted on <hi>these pecuniary
mulcts for sins as one of the great occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the troubles;</hi> which made people
suspect this pretence of <hi>Ecclesiastical Liberty</hi>
to be only a cloak for their own profits. But
however the good <hi>Pope,</hi> whether he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
this <hi>Vadium ad remanens</hi> or no, at all
adventures condemned it. For what should
the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> do without exchanging
<hi>Money</hi> for <hi>Sins? 5. That no Person who
held of the King</hi> in capite, <hi>or belonged to
him should be excommunicated, or have his
Land interdicted without making the King
acquainted with it, or his Iustice in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
6. <hi>That in matters of Appeal, they
were to proceed from the Arch-deacon to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:49659:202"/>
the Bishop, from the Bishop to the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and from thence to the King, and not
to proceed further without his express leave.</hi>
These were the main things in dispute; and
what do they all amount to, but the very
same <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> which the <hi>Kings</hi>
predecessors did insist upon? and what could
be the sense of <hi>Becket</hi> in opposing them,
but that <hi>Clergie-men</hi> were not accountable
for their Faults to the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> and in
case of the <hi>Popes</hi> command, whether upon
<hi>appeal</hi> or otherwise, <hi>Bishops</hi> and others were
to go to his <hi>Court</hi> in spight of the <hi>King?</hi>
as <hi>Anselm</hi> and <hi>Theobald</hi> had done before.
It is agreed by <hi>Baronius</hi> himself,<note place="margin">Baron. A. 1163. n. 19<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> that the
quarrel brake out, upon the <hi>Arch-bishops</hi>
denying to deliver up the <hi>Clergie-man</hi> that
was accused and convicted of Murder after
<hi>Ecclesiastical Censure</hi> to the <hi>Secular Power;</hi>
which the <hi>King</hi> earnestly desired, and <hi>Becket</hi>
as peremptorily denyed. And upon what
principle could this be done, but the highest
pretence of <hi>Ecclesiastical Liberty,</hi> that ever
<hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh or any other asserted?
And it is plain by this, that the King did
not deny the <hi>Ecclesiastical jurisdiction,</hi> nor
hindered the proper <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
upon offenders; but the Question was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, Whether <hi>Ecclesiastical persons</hi>
having committed crimes against the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

peace, were only to be punished with
<hi>Ecclesiastical Censures,</hi> and never to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
over to <hi>Civil Iustice?</hi> Which was
the main hinge of the <hi>Cause,</hi> and which

by which we may easily imagine what

be in if these things were suffered. So
that we see the plea insisted upon at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the quarrell was, that no persons
in any <hi>Ecclesiastical Orders,</hi> upon any crime
whatsoever, were to be delivered over to be
punished by the <hi>Secular Power.</hi> And what
could such a pretence arise from, but only
from <hi>Gregory</hi> the sevenths principles of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?</hi>
viz. <hi>that the Civil Power had
nothing at all to do with Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and that all the Subjection and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
they owed was only to the Pope as
their Soveraign; and that this was the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which Christ purchased for his Church

answered the <hi>Emperours Ambassadors,</hi> and
as <hi>Becket</hi> very frequently expresses it in his
<hi>Epistles.</hi> A blessed Liberty! and worthy
the purchase of the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ; viz.</hi> a
Liberty to sin without fear of punishment,
or at least any punishment which such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
would be afraid of; for the utmost
<hi>Becket</hi> could be perswaded to in the case of
the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Bedford</hi> convicted of murder,
was only to confine him to a <hi>Monastery</hi> for
a time: which was a very easie expiation of
<hi>Murder;</hi> So that the <hi>Benefit</hi> of <hi>Clergie</hi> was
a mighty thing in those dayes. But it is
impossible to give any tolerable account of
<hi>Beckets</hi> actions, unless we suppose this to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:49659:204"/>
have been his <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Principle, that
God had exempted by his Law all Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
by vertue of being such, from any
subjection to Civil Power:</hi> For if they owe
any subjection, they are accountable for
their breaches of the <hi>Laws</hi> to that power
to which they are subject; if they are not
accountable for any crimes they must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be wholly independent on the Civil
Government.</p>
            <p>§. 11. Neither is there any ground for
such an exemption by the ancient <hi>Municipal
Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> either in the <hi>Saxon,</hi> or
<hi>Norman times:</hi> and I cannot but wonder
to see the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> concerning <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Persons,</hi> brought to prove their
total exemption from the power of <hi>Princes,</hi>
which was that <hi>Ecclesiastical liberty</hi> which
<hi>Becket</hi> did plead for. For according to
his principles, neither <hi>Alured,</hi> nor <hi>Edward,</hi>
nor <hi>Canutus,</hi> nor any other Prince had any
thing to do to appoint the punishments of
<hi>Ecclesiastical Persons;</hi> but their judgement
was to be wholly left to their own <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</hi>
And supposing there had been such
<hi>Laws</hi> among the <hi>Saxons, Becket</hi> would not
have valued them at all, but rather have
thought them a prejudice to his Cause, and
an encouragement to <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. to have repealed
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:49659:204"/>
those and made others in their place. For
why should not the <hi>Power</hi> of this <hi>King</hi> be
as good as the <hi>Saxons</hi> to make and alter <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Laws</hi> as they saw convenient?
but <hi>Becket</hi> understood his business better
than so. He would not upon any terms be
brought to the tryal, whether they were
<hi>ancient Customes</hi> or no which the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for? the <hi>King</hi> offered it very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
and by any fair ways of tryal, and
declared he would renounce them if they
did not appear to be so, he appealed often
to the judgement of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
about it, and would stand and fall by it; and
none of these things would be accepted of:
by which it is evident that either there were
no <hi>Laws</hi> could justifie <hi>Becket,</hi> or he thought
the producing them would be hurtful to his
cause; for not one of all the <hi>Customs</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
against, was in his opinion so bad, as
for <hi>Princes</hi> to take upon themselves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<hi>Ecclesiastical causes,</hi> and to appoint
the <hi>punishments</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons.</hi>
For then he knew the <hi>King</hi> need not to
stand upon the proof of his other <hi>Customes,</hi>
this one <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> would put an
end to the whole dispute. For if <hi>Henry</hi> 2.
had the same Power that <hi>Edgar</hi> had,<note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the <hi>Laws</hi> which mention <hi>persons

the least Foundation in the <hi>Saxon times,</hi>
for such open defiance of the <hi>Civil Power,</hi>

withstood the Kings desire, and no threats
could move them, but they resolved rather
than to yield to dye upon the spot for Christ
and his Church, (<hi>as he speaks</hi>) at last
<hi>Becket</hi> withdrew from them, and coming in
again used these words to them; It is the
Kings pleasure I should forswear my self at
present, and I will do it and repent after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; (<hi>were not these brave</hi> Heroick
<hi>words for a</hi> Saint <hi>and a</hi> Martyr?) at the
hearing of them, <hi>he saith,</hi> they were all asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and their hearts failed them; and
so they all promised <hi>in verbo veritatis</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the ancient Customs. Thus, <hi>saith he,</hi>
was the Controversie then ended between
the Kingdom and Priesthood, and so <hi>Israel</hi>
descended into <hi>Egypt. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this solemn promise, in a few dayes</hi>
Becket <hi>breaks his word, and attempts to
go beyond</hi> Sea <hi>without the</hi> Kings leave:
at which the King was extreamly troubled,
<hi>and as the</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> London <hi>saith,</hi> had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had wounded his body than his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:49659:209"/>
by such an escape into forreign
parts, where he was sure to be represented
as a Tyrant and persecutor of the Church.
<hi>Becket</hi> was driven back by a Tempest, the
King takes no notice of it, uses him kindly,
and bids him take care of his Church. Not
long after, a Controversie happened about
some Lands which <hi>Becket</hi> challenged as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to his Church, the King sends to
him to do justice to the Person concerned in
it: notwithstanding complaints are brought
to the King for want of it, the King sends
a summons to him to appear before him,
that he might have the hearing of the Cause.
<hi>Becket</hi> refuses to obey the summons, and
sends the King word he would not obey
him in this matter: <hi>at which saucy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
the King was justly provoked, as a
great disparagement to his Royal Authority.
Upon this he calls the Parliament at
<hi>Northhampton,</hi> where the People met as
one man; the King represents his case,
with becoming modesty and eloquence: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he consented that his fault should be
expiated by a pecuniary mulct: after this
the King exhibited a complaint against him
for a great summ of money received by him,
during his Chancellorship which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
given account for: (<hi>it was 44000

(such as that from</hi> Beckets Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>and</hi> Martyrdom <hi>is to prove the doctrine
of</hi> Ecclesiastical Liberty <hi>and the</hi> Popes tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

if they cannot</hi> find <hi>that they endeavour to</hi>

I now deal with have more ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
than to think this new pretence any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
plea for</hi> Beckets <hi>Cause. And as
the</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> London <hi>tells</hi> Becket, it is not
the suffering, but the cause which makes a
Martyr: to suffer hardship with a good
mind is honour to a man; but to suffer in
a bad cause and obstinately is a reproach;
and in this dispute, <hi>he saith,</hi> the whole
weight of it lay upon the Kings power, and
some Customs of his Ancestors, and the King
would not quit the Rights of his Crown which
were confirmed by Antiquity, and the long
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:49659:210"/>
usage of the Kingdom: This is the cause
why you draw your sword against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Person of the King, in which it is of
great consequence to consider that the King
doth not pretend to make new Laws, but
as the whole Kingdom bears him witness,
such as were practised by his Ancestors.
<hi>And although it appears, that he wished
well to the main of</hi> Beckets <hi>Cause; yet he
blames him exceedingly for</hi> rashness, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion
<hi>and</hi> insolency <hi>in the management of
it; and bids him remember,</hi> that Christ never
entred <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> his house till he came down
from the Sycamore Tree; and that the way
of humility did far better become him, and
was likely to prevail more with the King,
than than which he took.</p>
            <p>§. 13. But <hi>Becket</hi> being out of the <hi>Kings</hi>
reach, and backed by the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>
and favoured by the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> made

of his great Friend <hi>Cardinal Gratianus,</hi> for
when the <hi>King</hi> saw himself deluded by the

               <hi>and Courage against the

Church gained her strength by opposition to
Princes.</hi> We have no reason therefore
to question <hi>Beckets</hi> meaning in the former
expression, to be according to the sense of
<hi>Greg.</hi> 7. it being not only most agreeable to
the natural sense of the words, but to the

In another of his <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> he

               <hi>that in his Kingdom, the daughter
of</hi> Sion <hi>was held captive, and the Spouse of
the great King was oppressed, and beseeches
him to set her free, and to suffer her to
reign together with her Spouse: otherwise</hi>
he saith,<note place="margin">L. 1. ep. 40.</note> 
               <hi>the most Mighty would come with
a strong hand to deliver her:</hi> (as one of
his <hi>Friends</hi> writ to him, <hi>that the Church
could not have peace but with a strong hand

the King, <hi>that his Royal Power ought not
to intermeddle with the Churches Liberties,
for Priests ought only to judge Priests, and
that the Secular Power had nothing to do
to punish them, if they did not offend against
faith.</hi> It seems then in case of <hi>heresie</hi> only
the <hi>Secular Arm</hi> is to be called in for help:
and is not this very agreeable to <hi>Becket</hi>'s

methinks they might be allowed to take
care of their own and publick <hi>safety</hi> against

Priests and to defend them with all Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
But that they had nothing to do
with the judgement of them, he endeavours
to prove after his fashion;</hi> and he makes
use of the very same <hi>arguments</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi>
had done before in his <hi>Grandfathers</hi> time;
and almost in the same words; about the

places, and served him upon all occasions.
And then after his exact method, he thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
out the examples of <hi>Saul, Ozias, Ahaz</hi>
and <hi>Uzza;</hi> and again saith, <hi>that Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Powers have nothing to do in the affairs
of the Church; but that if they be faithful,
God would have them be subject to the
Priests of his Church:</hi> and yet further,
<hi>Christian Kings ought to submit their acts
to the Governours of the Church, and not
set them above them: for it is written,
none but the Church ought to judge of
Priests; and no human Laws ought to pass
sentence upon such; and that Princes ought
to submit to the Bishops and not to sit as
Iudges over them.</hi> Which he thinks he
cannot repeat too often; And after all
uses the very same argument to <hi>Henry</hi> 2.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:49659:218"/>
which <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. had done to <hi>William</hi> the

to the Priests, because they are to give an
account of them to God: and therefore he
ought to understand, that Princes are to be

no doubt a great piece of subtilty to find
out another cause of his death than he
thought of himself; for he declared, <hi>that
he dyed for God, and Iustice, and the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Liberty
of the Church; i. e.</hi> in prosecution of the
same cause, which he had undertaken from
the beginning. For <hi>Becket</hi> knew well
enough there never was a perfect reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
between the <hi>King</hi> and him; and
that only the necessity of his affairs, and
the fears of being served as the <hi>Emperour</hi>
was by the Pope, i. e. <hi>deprived</hi> of his
<hi>Kingdom</hi> by <hi>excommunication,</hi> (which
<hi>Becket</hi> pressed with the greatest vehemency)
and the jealousie he had of the rest of the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:49659:219"/>
               <hi>Bishops,</hi> several of whom kept great corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency
now with <hi>Becket,</hi> and the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
of the <hi>People</hi> to his cause, forced the
King to those shews of reconciliation; for
that they were no more on either side, is
manifest by this, that the main Controversie
was not taken notice of about <hi>the ancient
customs;</hi> each party hoping for better circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
afterwards all that the <hi>King</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to, was laying aside any personal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
against <hi>Becket,</hi> for what was passed,
and allowing him freely to return to his
<hi>Church</hi> in expectation of a better behaviour
towards him for the future. All which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Beckets</hi> own Letters to <hi>the Pope,</hi>
upon and after this reconciliation; for, he
saith expresly, <hi>the Customs were not once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

               <hi>and that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the Popes interdict and</hi> Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
<hi>condition was that which moved him
to this reconciliation.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> indeed
failed in no point of complement to the
<hi>Archbishop,</hi> as he very punctually tells the
<hi>Pope, how he saluted him at first bare-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ran into his embraces, how he bare
his rebukes patiently, and held his Stirrup
at his getting upon his Horse,</hi> (if he had
but trampled on the Kings Neck too, he
had been equal to the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, and
it might have raised some jealou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie between
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:49659:220"/>
them). But for all this reconciliation,
<hi>Becket,</hi> supposing himself the <hi>Conquerour,</hi>
resolved not to abate one jot of his rigour
against those who had sworn to the <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Customs;</hi> and therefore procures power
from the <hi>Pope</hi> to <hi>excommunicate</hi> the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
that had done it, and to return to their
<hi>excommunication</hi> those already <hi>absolved,</hi>
and to absolve none without taking an <hi>oath,</hi>
to stand to the Popes command. This the
<hi>Kings Officers</hi> upon his return into <hi>England</hi>
told him was against the <hi>Customs</hi> of the
<hi>Realm;</hi> but they promised, <hi>they should
take an oath to obey the Law,</hi> salvo honore
Regni: <hi>Becket</hi> at first said, <hi>it was not in
his Power to rescind the Popes sentence;</hi>
which he knew to be false; for the <hi>Pope</hi>
had given him power to do it; and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
adds, <hi>that he could absolve the
Bishops of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Salisbury <hi>if they
took the common oath which was in the</hi>
Cotton M S. <hi>se juri parituros,</hi> but it is
interlined <hi>se vestro mandato parituros,</hi> as
the <hi>Vatican Copy</hi> in <hi>Baronius</hi> hath it. But
the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>York</hi> told the other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
that the taking such an oath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings consent, was against the Kings
Honour, and the Customs of the Realm.</hi> And
it is observeable, that the same time, he was
so zealous for the Bishops taking this <hi>oath</hi>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:49659:220"/>
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> he peremptorily refused suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those of his retinue though required
to do it by the <hi>Kings Officers,</hi> to take an
<hi>oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> to stand by
him against all persons, <hi>nec vos excipientes
nec alium,</hi> saith he to the <hi>Pope, neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting you, nor any other;</hi> as the <hi>Cotton
M S.</hi> hath it very plainly,<note place="margin">Baron. A. 1170. n. 41.</note> but <hi>Baronius</hi>
hath Printed it <hi>Nos,</hi> whether agreeably to
the <hi>Vatican M S.</hi> I know not, but I am
sure not to <hi>Beckets</hi> sense; for he gives this
reason of his refusing it, <hi>lest by that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Clergy of the Kingdom should be
drawn to such an oath; which would be
much to the prejudice of the Apostolical
See; for by this means the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would be discarded or very much abated
in</hi> England. Judge now, Reader, whether
<hi>Becket</hi> did not remain firm to the <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
principles to the last? and whether
the immediate <hi>motive</hi> of his death did not
arise from them? for upon the <hi>oath</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> they with the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
of <hi>York</hi> went over to the <hi>King</hi> in

were brought into the Church: and if there
were any evil before, they should be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated

after so many years contest were the <hi>Rights</hi>
of the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Customs</hi> of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
given up by this great Prince; so
true was that saying of <hi>Becket, that

Princes.</hi>

which it is hardly possible
to conceive a Prince that understood and

For when it was challenged by <hi>Gregory</hi> the

<hi>The Archbishops of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and</hi> York <hi>for

<hi>Parliamentary</hi> even in that time, and I do
not question, but the Friends to the <hi>Papal</hi>
interest made the very same objections then
against those <hi>Poenal Statutes</hi> of <hi>Provisors</hi>
and <hi>Praemunire,</hi> that others since have done
against the <hi>Laws</hi> made since the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And all that were sincere for the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did as much believe it to be
meer <hi>Usurpation</hi> in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to make
any <hi>Laws</hi> in these matters; <hi rend="margQuotes">For was the

it to his <hi>Holiness,</hi> and to wait his

make <hi>Laws</hi> about the restraint of that

they not all <hi>members,</hi> and will they
dare take upon them to judge their <hi>Head?</hi>
What! <hi>Sons</hi> rise up against their <hi>Father,</hi>
and <hi>Secular</hi> men take upon them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the things which <hi>Christs Vicar</hi> upon
earth allows? What! and after all the
<hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Martyrdom</hi> of S. <hi>Thomas</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that ever we should live
to see a <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> make
<hi>Laws</hi> against that <hi>good Old Cause,</hi> for
which he <hi>dyed?</hi> This is but to increase
the number of <hi>Confessors</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> as
all those will be, who suffer by these
Laws. For do they not plainly suffer for
<hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> although the
<hi>Parliament</hi> may call it <hi>Treason?</hi> What
an honour it is rather to suffer than to
betray the <hi>Churches Liberty for which
Christ dyed?</hi> or to disobey the <hi>Head</hi> of

which the <hi>Parliament</hi> forbids? <hi>And must
we not obey God rather than men?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this manner we may reasonably
suppose the <hi>Roman Clergie</hi> and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
at that time to have argued: but it is
well Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> at least allows these <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutes</hi>
of <hi>Provisors</hi> and <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and

that made them: but I fear he hath not
well considered the occasions and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of them, and what opposition the
<hi>Papal Clergie</hi> made against them, or else
I should think he could not afterwards have
declaimed so much against the injustice and
cruelty of our <hi>Poenal Laws.</hi> But even
those antient <hi>Statutes</hi> were passed with so
much difficulty, and executed with so little
care, that they by no means proved a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
salve for the sore they were intended
for, as will appear by this true account of
them.</p>
            <p>§. 19. In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the first,
who was a <hi>Prince</hi> both <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>resolute;</hi>
the <hi>grievances</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> (by his
connivance at the <hi>Papal</hi> encroachments for
a long time,) grew to that height, that
some effectual course was necessary to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the antient <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> which
had now been so long buried, that they were
almost forgotten; but an occasion happened
which for the time throughly awaked him
to a consideration of them. <hi>Bonif.</hi> 8. out of a
desire still to advance <hi>Ecclesiastical Liberty,</hi>
had made a Constitution, strictly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>any Clergie-man paying any Taxes
whatsoever to Princes, without the Popes
consent; and both the payers and receivers
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:49659:230"/>
were to fall under excommunication</hi> ipso
facto <hi>not to be taken off without immediate
Authority from the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>unless
it were at the point of death.</hi> Not long
after this, the <hi>King</hi> demands a supply in
<hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Clergie</hi> unanimously refuse
on account of the <hi>Popes Bull,</hi> the King bids
them advise better, and return a satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Answer; at the time appointed <hi>Winchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea</hi>
then <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury,</hi> in the
name of the whole <hi>Clergie</hi> declares, <hi>That
they owed more obedience to the Pope than
to the King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kinghton de event. Angl. l. 3. c. 5.</note> 
               <hi>he being their Spiritual, and
the King only a Temporal Soveraign; but
to give satisfaction to both, they desire leave
to send to the Pope.</hi> At which saucy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the <hi>King</hi> was so much provoked, that
he put the whole <hi>Clergie</hi> out of his <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
and seized upon their <hi>Lands;</hi> for
which an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> was made to
that purpose saith <hi>Thorn.</hi>

               <hi>For</hi> William
Courtny <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>made
his Protestation in open Parliament, saying,
That the Pope ought not to Excommunicate
any Bishop, or intermeddle for, or touching
any presentation to any Ecclesiastical dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
recovered in any of the Kings Courts;
He further protested, that the Pope ought
to make no translations to any Bishoprick
within the Realm against the Kings will:
for that the same was the destruction of
the Realm and Crown of</hi> England <hi>which
hath alwayes been so free, as the same hath
had none earthly Soveraign, but only subject
to God in all things touching Regalities, and
to none other; the which his protestation he
prayed might be entred.</hi> Then passed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

it seems at last, were brought to <hi>obey the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:49659:234"/>
Laws;</hi> and that which the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> protested was a part of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi>
wherein the <hi>Commons</hi> not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their resolution <hi>to live and dye with
the King in defence of the Liberties of the
Crown against the Papal Usurpations; but
moreover they pray and in justice require
that he would examin all the Lords as well
Spiritual as Temporal severally, and all the
States of the Parliament, how they think of
the cases aforesaid, which be so openly against
the Kings Crown, and in derogation of his
Regality, and how they will stand in the
same cases with our Lord the King in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the Rights of the said Crown and
Regality.</hi> By which it appears that the
<hi>Commons</hi> had a great suspicion of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

for the <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> declared frankly
their concurrence with the <hi>Commons,</hi> and
that the <hi>Cases</hi> mentioned <hi>were clearly

(but it seems by the <hi>Records</hi> the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:49659:237"/>
he was questioned in <hi>Parliament;</hi> but at

we see, that not one of all the <hi>Papal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments</hi>
was ever cut off by the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>Poenal Laws,</hi> as long as the
<hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> was allowed; for never
any thing was more vigorously attempted,
more frequently enacted, more severely

yet in despight of all the <hi>Laws</hi> it continued
still, as long as the <hi>Pope</hi> was allowed to
have a <hi>Power</hi> above <hi>Laws,</hi> and that he
could <hi>null, abrogate,</hi> or <hi>dispense</hi> with them
as he pleased. And thus far I have given
an impartial account of the ancient <hi>poenal
Laws</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> The like to which
have been made in <hi>France, Spain, Italy,
Flanders</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> as might
be easily proved if it were necessary; but I
forbear that,</p>
            <p>§. 21. And come to compare the
<hi>ancient poenal Laws</hi> of our own Nation
with the <hi>modern,</hi> as to the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions</hi>
of them, that by them we may judge
whether those who allow the ancient <hi>Laws</hi>
to be <hi>just,</hi> can have any ground to charge
the present with <hi>injustice</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi>
which can be only on one of these two
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:49659:238"/>
grounds. 1. Either that the <hi>Occasions</hi> of
the present Laws were not so great. Or,
2. That the old Laws did not relate to the
<hi>exercise</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> as the latter do.
I shall consider both of them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>For the</hi> occasions <hi>of the present</hi> poenal
Laws, <hi>Mr.</hi> Cressy <hi>confesseth them</hi> to have
been Treasons; <hi>not consequentially only,
when an act may be declared to be Treason
which in it self is not so; but such</hi> Treasons
<hi>as all Mankind acknowledge to be such,</hi>
viz. <hi>depriving Soveraign Princes of their
Crown and Dignity, endeavouring by open
Rebellions, and secret conspiracies to take
away their Lives; if these be not</hi> Treasons
<hi>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e are none such in the world. And
that these were the</hi> Occasions <hi>of the present</hi>
poenal Laws, <hi>I shall not produce the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the</hi> Lord Burleigh <hi>in his</hi> Book <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
on occasion of the</hi> poenal Laws,
<hi>called,</hi> The Execution of Iustice in <hi>England,</hi>
not for Religion but for Treason; <hi>imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at</hi> London, <hi>A. D. 1583<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I shall make
use of the Testimony of Persons less lyable
to the exception of our Adversaries,</hi> viz.
The Secular Priests, <hi>who printed their</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Considerations, <hi>A. D. 1601. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their whole design is to shew,</hi> that the
poenal Laws, considering the many Treasons
which were the occasions of them, were very
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:49659:238"/>
just and merciful. <hi>For they acknowledge,</hi>
1. That the State of Catholicks was free
from persecution the first ten years of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth; and</hi> that <hi>Parsons</hi> and <hi>Creswel</hi>
confessed as much. 2. That themselves
were the true Causes of the change that was
made towards them; by <hi>Pius</hi> 5. moving a
Rebellion here by <hi>Ridolphi,</hi> exciting the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> abroad to joyn his Forces, and
denouncing a Bull of Excommunication
against the Queen, and absolving her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from their subjection, on purpose to
foment their Rebellion for depriving her of
her Kingdom: which they prove by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
circumstances. 3. That they could
hardly believe these things themselves, till
they saw them expressed and owned in the
Life of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> printed and allowed.
4. That notwithstanding these things, and
the Rebellion breaking forth 1569. the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
were only under greater restraint,
but none were put to death on that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but only such who were in actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:
wherein they confess the Queen
did no more, than any Prince in Christendom
would have done. 5. That upon these oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
a Parliament was called 1571. and
a Law made against the bringing any Bulls
from <hi>Rome, Agnus Dei's,</hi> Crosses, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons;
and against all persons that should
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:49659:239"/>
procure them to be brought hither; which
Law although they think it to have been too
rigorous, yet they cannot but confess that the
State could not without the imputation of
great carelesness of its own safety have
omitted the making some Laws against those
of their Religion. And although they were
in their opinion too severe, yet they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
1. That the occasions were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
most outragious, <hi>as they expressed
it.</hi> 2. That the execution of them was not
so Tragical, as was represeuted. 6. They
believe that neither this Law nor any other
would have been executed upon them, had
there not been daily new provocations:
<hi>such as, 1. Sanders</hi> his confession in his
Book <hi>De visibili Monarchia,</hi> that the Pope
had sent two Priests, <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Web</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Northern Rebellion into the North
to excite the Lords and Gentlemen to take
up Arms: declaring to them that the Pope
had excommunicated the Queen, and her
Subjects were released from obedience to
her; and that <hi>Sanders</hi> doth justifie the said
Rebellion, and imputes the miscarriage of
it, to the over-late publishing the said Bull;
affirming that if it had been sooner publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Catholicks would undoubtedly so
have risen, as that they must have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
against the Queen, and had certainly
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:49659:239"/>
executed the said sentence at that time,
for her deposition from the Crown. 2. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
his magnifying the Heads of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
after they had been arraigned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and executed by the ancient Laws
of our Countrey for high Treason: which
course since that time was followed by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
and others. 3. The full discovery of
the plot of the Pope and King of <hi>Spain</hi> with
the Rebels at home, for the depriving the
Queen of her Kingdom. 4. <hi>Stukely</hi>'s at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> assisted by <hi>Sanders</hi> and
others; which was afterwards encouraged
by the Pope himself; when <hi>Sanders</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
appeared as a Ring-leader of the Popes
Forces to perswade the Catholicks to joyn
with the Rebels already in Arms. 5. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
13. renewing the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> 5.
against <hi>Queen Elizabeth.</hi> 6. Upon this the
Iesuits coming into <hi>England,</hi> who were the
chief instruments of all the mischiefs against
the Queen; and of the miseries which they
or any other Catholicks have upon these oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
sustained. 7. <hi>Parsons</hi> his endeavour
to set the Queens Crown on another Head,
as appeared by his Letter to a certain Earl.
8. In all the Plots, none were found to be
more forward than the Priests; and the
Laity, they say, if the Priests had opposed
themselves to their designs, would have
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:49659:240"/>
been over-ruled by them. 9. All which
considered, they confess, that no King or
Prince in the World, disgusting the See of
<hi>Rome,</hi> having either force or metal in
him, would have endured the Priests, but
rather have utterly rooted them out of their
Territories, as Traytors and Rebels, both to
him and his Countrey; and therefore they
rejoyce unfeignedly, that God had blessed
this Kingdom with so gracious and merciful
a Soveraign, who hath not dealt in this sort
with them: and that all Catholicks deserve
no longer to live, than they hereafter shall
honour her from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earts, obey her in
all things, so far as possibly they may,
and pray for her prosperous Reign, and long
life; and to their powers defend her against
all enemies whatsoever.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>They say,</hi> notwithstanding all the
former provocations from the time of the
said Rebellion and Parliament there were
few above twelve that in ten years had
been executed for their consciences (as we
hold, <hi>say they,</hi> although our Adversaries
say for Treason) and of those twelve some
perhaps can hardly be drawn within our
account, having been tainted with
matters of Rebellion: and for the rest,
although themselves knew them to be
free from seditions, her Majesty and the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:49659:240"/>
State could not know it, and they had
great Cause as Politick persons to suspect
the worst. 8. <hi>They confess,</hi> that a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
being called <hi>A.</hi> 1576. no Laws
were made at that time against them: the
antient Prisoners that had been more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
restrained <hi>A.</hi> 1570. were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to their former liberty to continue
with their Friends, as they had done before:
and such who were not suspected to have
been dealers or abetters in the said Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
actions were used with that huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which could well be expected. 9. The
State having notice of the second excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
and having found the bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the former was concerned in Policy
to prevent the like by the second. And the
jealousie was much increased by <hi>Sherwin</hi>'s
answer upon examination eight months
before the apprehension of <hi>Campion.</hi> For
being asked, <hi>whether the Queen was his
lawful Soveraign, notwithstanding any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Popes?</hi> he refused to give any
Answer. Then followed a greater restraint
of Catholicks than at any time before; and
in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1581. a Proclamation was made for
calling home her Majesties Subjects beyond
the Seas; especially those trained up in the
Seminaries, pretending that they learned
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:49659:241"/>
little there but disloyalty. The same month
a Parliament ensued, wherein a Law was
made agreeable to the Proclamation, but
with a more severe punishment annexed,
<hi>viz.</hi> the penalty of death, for any Iesuit
or Seminary Priest to repair into <hi>England, &amp;c.
10.</hi> They confess, that if all the Seminary
Priests then in <hi>England,</hi> or which should
come after, had been of the mind of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and <hi>Sanders,</hi> or <hi>Parsons,</hi> the said
no Law, no doubt, had carryed with it a
far greater shew of Iustice: but that was,
<hi>say they,</hi> the error of the State, (<hi>and yet
themselves say,</hi> the State could not know the
difference between them) and yet they add
that it was not altogether (for ought they
knew) improbable, those times being so
full of many dangerous designments and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical
practices. 11. This same year <hi>Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and other Priests were apprehended; whose
answers upon their examinations agreeing
in effect with <hi>Sherwins</hi> did greatly incense
the State. For this being one of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
propounded, <hi>If the Pope pronounce her
Majesty deprived, and her Subjects discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their obedience; and after either
the Pope, or some by his Authority invade
the Realm, which part would you take, or
ought a good subject to take?</hi> To this, they
say, some answered, that when the case
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:49659:241"/>
should happen, they would then take counsel
what were best for them to do: others,
that when the case happened they would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
another, that he was not resolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what to do; and another, that if such an
invasion were made for any matter of his
faith, he thinketh he were bound to take
part with the Pope. Now, <hi>say they,</hi> what
King in the World would not in the same
circumstances, justly repute such persons
Traytors, and deal with them accordingly?
12. After this, a new plot was laid between
his Holiness, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Guise,</hi> for a sudden and desperate design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against her Majesty; at which time
they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfess the Iesuitical humour had so
possessed the hearts of sundry Catholicks, as
they rue and are ashamed at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of it. And here they give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account of the Treasons of <hi>Throck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,
Arden, Somervile, Parry, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,
Babington, Stanley,</hi> defended
by Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi> who laid down this for a
Maxim, That in all Wars which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
for Religion, every Catholick is bound
in conscience to imploy his Person and Forces
by the Popes direction, <hi>viz.</hi> how far, and
where, either at home or abroad, he may
and must break with his Temporal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
These things, <hi>they say,</hi> are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:49659:242"/>
to be known, to clear her Majesty
from the imputations of more than barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
cruelty towards them cast upon her by
the Iesuits, when themselves were the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of all the Calamities any of them had
indured since her Majesties Reign: and they
think, all circumstances considered, few
Princes living of her judgement, and so
provoked, would have dealt more mildly
with such their subjects, than she hath done
with them. 13. They confess the <hi>Spanish
Invasion</hi> 1588. to be an everlasting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of Iesuitical Treason and Cruelty.
For it is apparent in a Treatise penned by
the advice of Father <hi>Parsons</hi> altogether (as
they do verily think) that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
was moved and drawn into that intended
mischief, by the long and daily solicitations
of the Iesuits and other <hi>English</hi> Catholicks,
beyond the Seas, affected and altogether given
to Iesuitism; and that <hi>Parsons</hi> as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
(<hi>though the Book went under a greater name</hi>)
endeavoured with all his
Rhetorick to perswade the Catholicks in
<hi>England</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> but

               </gap> had made him Cardinal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to send him his Legat for the sweeter
managing this (forsooth) godly and great
affair: and there he affirms that there
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:49659:242"/>
were divers Priests in the Kings Army, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to serve ever mans necessity: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
them the assistance of all the Saints
and Angels, and of our Blessed Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Soveraign Sacrament (<hi>after a
very invisible manner</hi>) and they do not at
all deny, that the Pope did joyn and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
towards this intended Invasion.
14. That in these ten years from 1580. to
1590. the Prisoners at <hi>Wisbich</hi> lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
without any trouble, Colledge-like,
without any wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; that of all sorts towards
the number of fifty suffered death; as they
think, most of them for conscience, but as
their Adversaries do still affirm for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
that such Priests as upon examination
were found any thing moderate, were not so
hardly dealt with; insomuch as fifty five
that might by the Laws have been put to
death, in one year 1585. and in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
time, were only banished; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
some hard courses were taken against
them, yet it was not by many degrees so
extream, as the Iesuits and that Crew have
falsly reported and written of it. 15. That
there being just apprehensions of a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion,
a Proclamation was set out 1591.
against Sem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pare a way for it;
and <hi>Parsons</hi> did not only acknowledge such
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:49659:243"/>
a design, but said the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had just
cause to attempt again that enterprise: but
in the mean time they tryed a shorter
course by the several Treasons of <hi>Heskett,
Collen, both set on by Jesuits,</hi> Lopez,
York, Williams; <hi>and</hi> Squire, animated by
<hi>Walpole</hi> the Iesuit. 16. That <hi>Parsons</hi> at last
set up the title of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
endeavoured to get subscriptions to it, and
promises to perswade the Catholicks of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
to submit to it; and that the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Priests were to promote her Title,
against the Queen and her Lawful Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
From all which they confess, that
the Iesuitical designs abroad, and the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
and Traiterous attempts of some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
at home have been the Causes of
such calamities and troubles, as have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
unto them; great, (they confess) in
themselves: but far less (they think) than
any Prince living in her Majesties case,
and so provoked would have inflicted upon
us. <hi>And what more need to be said, for
the Vindication of the</hi> Poenal Laws <hi>from the
charge of</hi> Injustice <hi>and</hi> cruelty, <hi>than is
here so ingenuously confessed by the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Priests, men of the same Religion with
those who complain of them, men that suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves in some measure, men that
throughly understood the true Reasons and
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:49659:243"/>
casions of the several Laws that were then
made; and yet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter all this, can Mr.</hi> Cressy
<hi>have the impudence to parallel these Laws
with those of</hi> Nero, Domitian <hi>and</hi> Dioclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<hi>and to say,</hi> that they who suffered by
them, suffered only on the account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
<hi>If the primitive Christians had been
guilty of so many horrible Treasons and
Conspiracies, if they had attempted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
Emperours of their Crowns, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
Subjects from their Allegiance to
them, if they had joyned with their open
and declared enemies, and imployed persons
time after time to assassinate them; what
would the whole World have said of their
sufferings? Would men of any common
sense have said,</hi> that they were Martyrs
for Religion? <hi>no; but that they dyed justly
and deservedly for their</hi> Treasons. <hi>And
for all that I can see, all such as suffered in
those dayes, for their attempts on their
Soveraign and Countrey, are no more to be
said to have</hi> suffered for Religion, <hi>than the
late</hi> Regicides; <hi>who pleaded the</hi> Cause <hi>of</hi>
God <hi>and</hi> Religion <hi>as well as they; and if
the one be</hi> Martyrs, <hi>let the other be thought
so too: but if notwithstanding all their fair
pretences of</hi> Religion <hi>and</hi> Conscience, <hi>the</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
<hi>shall not be thought to suffer for their</hi>
Religion, <hi>why then should those in Q.</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth'<hi>s
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:49659:244"/>
or</hi> King Iames'<hi>s time, who suffered
on the account of actual</hi> Treasons, <hi>as those
did who were engaged in the</hi> Gunpowder
Treason, <hi>as well as those who suffered in
the Queens time? And if the supposition
of</hi> Conscience <hi>or</hi> Religion <hi>makes all men</hi>
Martyrs, <hi>the</hi> Regicides <hi>will put in their plea
for</hi> Martyrd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m; <hi>if it be not, then there is
no reason to say they suffered for</hi> Religion,
<hi>whom the</hi> Law <hi>condemned on the account
of</hi> Treason. <hi>If it be then allowed, that
the</hi> Laws <hi>must determin</hi> Treason, <hi>then it
will follow that those suffer for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who act directly against those Laws
which determine it to be</hi> Treason.</p>
            <p>§. 22. <hi>But suppose the Law should make
it Treason for men to serve God according
to their Consciences, as for Roman Priests
to officiate or say Mass; can such men be
said to suffer for Treason if they be taken in
the Fact, and not rather for their Religion?</hi>
To this I answer, that a great regard is to
be had to the <hi>occasion</hi> of making such a <hi>Law</hi>
for the right interpretation of it. For if
plain and evident <hi>Treasonable actions</hi> were
the first <hi>occasion</hi> of making it, as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in <hi>Q. Elizabeths</hi> time, then all those
Persons lyable to the suspicion of the State,
may be seized upon in what way soever they
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:49659:244"/>
discover themselves; and in this case, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Offices of their Function is not the
<hi>motive</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
but meerly the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Discovery</hi> of
the <hi>Persons.</hi> For by reason of <hi>Disguises</hi>
and <hi>Aequivocations,</hi> and <hi>mental Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
being set on foot by the <hi>Iesuits</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
discovery, the <hi>Law</hi> had no certain
way of finding them out, but by the <hi>Offices</hi>
of their <hi>Function,</hi> in which the Magistrates
are sure they will not dissemble so far as
that a man who is no Priest will not take
upon him to say Mass: and therefore the
Law looks upon the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> as
only a certain <hi>Criterion</hi> of the <hi>Persons,</hi> and
not as the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>punishment;</hi> not
as the thing that makes them guilty, but as
the way of finding the guilty. As if we
should suppose upon the account of the
<hi>Treasons</hi> of many years and frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
and conspiracies for the destruction
of the King and Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which any
Sectaries among us should be found guilty
of (as for instance, I will put the case of
Quakers as more easily differenced:) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know, whether if the Law made it
poenal for men, <hi>not to put off their hats,</hi>
only out of consideration of the <hi>Treasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
doctrines</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> they were guilty
of, should that man who were taken because
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:49659:245"/>
he did not put off his Hat be said to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er
on that account, and not rather upon
the first <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Motive</hi> of the <hi>Law?</hi>
In the <hi>Statute 23 Eliz. c.</hi> 1. the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and design of the Law is expressed to
be, <hi>to keep persons from withdrawing her
Majesties Subjects from their Obedience to
her: and because the Pope had engaged
himself in several Treasons and Rebellions
against her, by giving assistance to them,
and endeavouring what in him lay to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
the Queen of her Crown, therefore
the drawing any persons to promise Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Pope is adjudged Treason, as
well as to any other Prince, State, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate.</hi>
And where there is an equality
of Reason, why should there not be an
equality in the punishment? If any
other <hi>Prince</hi> should have engaged Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the same actions which the <hi>Pope</hi>
did, there is no question they had been
<hi>Treasonable actions;</hi> the Question this,
whether that which would be <hi>Treason</hi> if
any other commands it, ceases to be <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
when the <hi>Pope</hi> allows or requires it?
If it doth so, then the <hi>Pope</hi> must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to have a supreme Temporal
Power over Princes, and they are all but
his Vassals, which is expresly against the
ancient Law of 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. if it remains <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:49659:245"/>
then those may be justly executed for
<hi>Treason</hi> who do no more than what the
Pope requires them, and which they may
think themselves bound in Conscience
to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But on this account may not any act of
Religion be made Treason, if the Law-makers
think fit to make it so?</hi> By no
means; for in this case, there was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
tendency to disobedience and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in promising obedience to the Pope;
but there is no such thing in any meer act
of Religion, considered as such: but when
Priests have been known to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
instruments of Treasons, as they were
then, by the confession of the <hi>Secular
Priests;</hi> then those actions which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by such persons, and are proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to themselves, are looked on in the sense
of the Law and according to the intention
of it, but only as the certain <hi>means</hi> of
knowing the <hi>Persons</hi> whom the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
to punish. So that if we do allow,
that the Law of the Land can declare <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
in any sort of Persons, and punish
Persons for being guilty, and appoint a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
means of discovering the guilty; then
there is nothing in that severe Law
23 <hi>Eliz</hi> c. 1. which is not according to justice
and equity; alwayes supposing, that some
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:49659:246"/>
notorious Treasonable actions, and not the
bare acts of Religion were the first <hi>Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
or antecedent <hi>Motives</hi> of those <hi>Laws,</hi>
which is fully confessed and proved in this
case by the most impartial witnesses, viz.
<hi>the Secular Priests.</hi> And the Preface to
the Statute 27 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. gives the best
interpretation of the design of it, viz.
<hi>Whereas divers persons, called or professed
Iesuits, Seminary Priests, and other Priests
which have been, and from time to time,
are made in the parts beyond the Seas, by
or according to the Order and Rites of the
Romish Church, have of late comen and
been sent, and daily do come and are sent
into this Realm of</hi> England <hi>and other the
Queen Majesties Dominions of purpose,
(as it hath appeared) as well by their
own examinations and confessions, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other manifest means and proofs, not
only to withdraw her Highness Subjects
from their due obedience to her Majesty,
but also to stir up and move Sedition, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and open Hostility, within the same
her Highness Realms and Dominions, to
the great endangering of the safety of her
most Royal Person, and to the utter ruine,
desolation and overthrow of the whole
Realm, if the same be not the sooner by
some good means foreseen and prevented.
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:49659:246"/>
For reformation whereof be it ordained,</hi> &amp;c.
Can any thing be plainer from hence, than
that the whole scope and design of this
<hi>Law</hi> is only to prevent treasonable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
though masked only under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Religion? If the design had been
against their <hi>Religion,</hi> the Preface of the
Law would have mentioned only the
<hi>exercise</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> which it
doth not. But withal is there not a
<hi>Proviso</hi> in the same <hi>Act, that it shall
not in any wise extend to any Iesuit or
Priest that will take the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy;</hi>
then it seems all the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
they suffer for must be contai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
only in what is renounced by the <hi>Oath of
Supremacy.</hi> And is this at last <hi>the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Religion</hi> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> talks of, <hi>viz.</hi>
for the <hi>Popes Personal Authority and Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
here? But who were the men that
first rejected that Autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity and Jurisdiction
here? Former Princes long before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
did it as far as they thought fit;
and made no scruple of restraining it, as
far as they judged convenient; and upon the
same Reasons they went so far, <hi>H.</hi> 8. and
other Princes might go much farther. For
the reason they went upon was, the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
of what they opposed to the <hi>Rights</hi>
of the <hi>Crown;</hi> and was there any other
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:49659:247"/>

time, (<hi>Fisher</hi> excepted) joyn in rejecting
the <hi>Popes Supremacy?</hi> And was there no
<hi>Catholick Religion</hi> left in <hi>England</hi> when that
was gone? It seems then the whole <hi>Cause</hi>
of <hi>Religion</hi> is reduced to a very narrow
compass, and hangs on a very slender thread.
If there be no more in Christian Religion,
than what is rejected by the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi>
it a is very earthly and quarrelsome
thing; for it filled the World with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
broils and confusions, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
dreadful effects where ever it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained;
and leaves a sting behind where

supposed to be <hi>Cardinal Allen,</hi> speaks out in

               <note place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>are to be deprived of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and their Subjects immediately upon
excommunication are absolved from their
Allegiance; which he saith, is not only the
doctrine of</hi> Aquinas, <hi>and</hi> Tolet, <hi>and of the</hi>
Canon Law, <hi>but of the Council of</hi> Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
and as he endeavours to prove, of
<hi>Scripture</hi> too: <hi>and that War for Religion
is not only just but honourable; and for
the deposing of Princes, he brings se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
instances from</hi> Gregory <hi>the seventh
downwards: particularly King</hi> John <hi>and</hi>
Henry <hi>the second;</hi> and saith, <hi>that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of obedience to Princes is only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
contract, and if they fail of their
faith to God, they are free as to the faith
they promised them.</hi> This I confess, is
speaking to the purpose, and the only way in
appearance to make them <hi>suffer for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
for no doubt, these were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which led them to those treasonable
practices for which they suffered. But the
main question remains still, whether <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
be not <hi>Treason,</hi> because a man thinks
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:49659:248"/>
himself bound in <hi>Conscience</hi> to commit it?
and whether <hi>Magistrates</hi> have not reason to
make severe <hi>Laws,</hi> when such dangerous
and destructive principles to Government
are embraced as a part of <hi>Religion?</hi> If
there be any such thing as <hi>Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
appointed by <hi>God,</hi> it must be supposed
to have a just and natural <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>
to preserve it self: but how can it maintain
it self without a just <hi>power</hi> to punish those
that disturb and overthrow it? if it have
such a <hi>Power,</hi> it must have <hi>Authority</hi> to
judge of those actions which are pernicious
and dangerous to it self; and if there be
such a natural inherent <hi>Right, Power</hi> and
<hi>Authority,</hi> antecedently to any positive Laws
of Religion; either we must suppose that
<hi>Religion</hi> left <hi>Civil Government</hi> as it was,
and then it hath the <hi>Power</hi> of judging all
sorts of actions, so far as they have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on the Civil Government, so that
no pretence of Religion can excuse <hi>Treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
actions;</hi> or we must assert that the
Christian Religion hath taken away the
<hi>natural Rights</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> which is very
repugnant to the doctrine of Christianity,
and all the examples of the Primitive
Church. The substance therefore, of what I
say about <hi>suffering for Religion,</hi> or <hi>for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
is this; that whatever principles or
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:49659:248"/>
actions tend to the destruction of the Civil
Government, are in themselves Treasonable
antecedent to Laws; that Laws may justly
determine the nature and degrees of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
that those who are guilty of such
actions, let them be done out of what
principle soever, are justly lyable to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the account of Treason; and in
the judgement of the Law and Reason do
suffer on that account, what ever private
opinions they may have who do these
things, concerning the obligations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to do them: and where there is just
suspicion of a number of persons not easily
discerned, the Laws may make use of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Marks to discover them, although it
happens that those marks prove actions
of Religion; which actions are not
thereby made the <hi>Cause</hi> of their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but those principles or actions which
were the first <hi>occasions</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of
making those Laws. From which it is,
I suppose, evident, that if the antient Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws were just and reasonable, our
modern Laws are so too, because the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions</hi>
of making them were of as high a
<hi>Nature,</hi> and the guilt as proportionable to
the penalty; and that men did no more suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for <hi>Religion</hi> by these, than by the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Poenal Laws.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:49659:249"/>
§. 23. 2. But supposing these <hi>Laws</hi>
were acknowledged to be <hi>just and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
as to the <hi>Actors</hi> of those <hi>Treasons,</hi>
the Question is, <hi>Whether they continue just,
as to other persons who cannot be proved
actually guilty of those Treasons?</hi> And
here I confess, as to the principles of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reason, the case doth vary according to
circumstances: For,</p>
            <p>1. In a jealous and suspicious time, when
many <hi>Treasons</hi> have been acted, and more
are feared by virtue of bad principles, the
Government may justly proceed upon the
tryal of the principles to the conviction of
Persons who own them, without plain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the particular guilt of the outward
actions of Treason. For the very designing
of Treason is lyable to the severity of the
Law, if it come to be discovered; and
where the safety of the publick is really
in great danger, the greatest caution is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or the prevention of evil; and
some actions are lawful for publick safety
which are not in particular cases. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when sufficient warning is given before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
by the Law, and men cannot come
within the danger of it without palpable
disobedience, as in the case of <hi>Seminary
Priests coming into the Nation, when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:49659:249"/>
to do it under severe penalties;</hi> In
which case the very contempt of the Law
and Government, makes them justly obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
to the force of it. He that owns
the principles that lead him to Treason,
wants only an opportunity to act them;
and therefore in cases of great danger, the
not renouncing the principles may justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
men to the sentence of the Law. And
if it be lawful to make any principles or
declared opinions or words treasonable, it
cannot be unjust to make men suffer for
them.</p>
            <p>2. In quiet times when the apprehension
of present danger is not great, it hath been
the Wisdom of our Government to suffer
the course of Law to proceed, but not to
a rigorous execution. For the Law being
in its force, keeps persons of dangerous
principles more in awe, who will be very
cautious of broaching and maintaining those
principles which they hold; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot have so bad effects, as when
they have full liberty to vent them; but
in case Persons have been seized upon by
the legal wayes of discovery, who yet have
not been actually seditious, it hath been
the excellent moderation of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not to proceed to any great seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:49659:250"/>3. There can be no sufficient reason given
for the total repeal of Laws at first made
upon good grounds, where there is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
security given that all those, for
whom they were intended, have renounced
those principles which were the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of making them. These things I
yield to be reasonable.</p>
            <p>1. That where there is a real difference
in principles, the Government should make
a difference; because the reason of the
Law, is the danger of those principles;
which if some hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y renounce, there
seems to be no ground, that they should
suffer equally with those who will not;
but since the Law is already in being, and
it is easier to preserve old Laws, than to
make new ones, whether the difference
should be by <hi>Law,</hi> or by <hi>Priviledge,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Wisdom of our Law-makers
to determine.</p>
            <p>2. That such who enjoy such a <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
should give the greatest satisfaction
as to their <hi>sincerity</hi> in renouncing these
principles; for if there be still ground to
suspect their sincerity in renouncing, by
reason of <hi>ambiguous phrases, aequivocations
in words, or reservations in their minds,</hi>
they give instead of real satisfaction, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cause of jealousie, because of the abuse
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:49659:250"/>
they put thereby upon the Government.
For if men do <hi>aequivocate</hi> in <hi>renouncing
aequivocation</hi> (which it is very possible for
men that hold that Doctrine to do) they
thereby forfeit their credit to so high a
degree, that they cannot be safely trusted
in any Oaths or Protestations. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to be made sure, that men use
the greatest sincerity in what they do, or
else there is no ground to grant any favour
upon their offers of satisfaction.</p>
            <p>3. Where there is sufficient ground to
believe, that the much greater number will
not give sufficient satisfaction as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the dangerous principles to Civil
Government, there is no reason for a total
repeal of the <hi>Poenal Laws</hi> already establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For if the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> was
just at first, and the same Reason continues,
it becomes not the Wisdom of a Nation
to take off the curb it hath upon a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and growing party: and however cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and reserved many may seem, while
the Laws are in force, no man knows how
much those principles may more openly shew
themselves; and what practices may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon them, when impunity tempts
them. I do not plead for <hi>sanguinary Laws</hi>
towards innocent and peaceably minded
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:49659:251"/>
men (whatever their opinions be; and
how hardly soever my Adversaries think
and speak of me, I would shew my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to be better than theirs by having

Majesties Return, by one of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Wherein he shews,</p>
            <p>1. That the Iesuitical party by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
and wicked practices provoked the
Magistrates to enact those Laws; and
that their seditious principles are too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guilty of the Blood of Priests and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
shed in the Kingdom ever since
they came into it: and that it is their
principle to manage Religion, not by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
but by command and force; and
then reckons up the several Treasons in
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, the Iesuitical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of excluding the Scottish succession and
title of our Soveraign; the Gunpowder
Treason; which if it were not their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
he confesses they were highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to it, by prayers before hand, and
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:49659:251"/>
publick testifications after the fact was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
nay many years after they did,
and peradventure to this very day still do
pertinaciously adhere to it. 2. That their
practices of usurping Iurisdiction, making
Colledges and Provinces in and for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
possessing themselves of great summs
of money for such ends, are against the
ancient Laws of the Land even in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
times; it being the Law of <hi>England</hi>
that no Ecclesiastical Community may settle
here, unless admitted by the Civil Power;
and those that entertain them are subject
to the penalties ordained by the Ancient
Laws. 3. That it is no evidence of their
Loyalty that any of them have been of the
Kings side, it being a Maxim or Practice
of their Society in quarrels of Princes and
Great men to have some of their Fathers
on one part and others for the contrary;
which is a manifest sign they are faithful
to neither. 4. That there is no ground
to trust them, because of their doctrine of
Probability; and their General can
make what doctrine he pleases probable,
for the opinion of three Divines is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make a Doctrine probable, and
whatever is so, must be done by them
when commanded by their Superiours; so
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:49659:252"/>
that the tenderness of their Consciences is
only about doing, or doing what their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
orders them: besides, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
about deposing Princes, Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
mental Reservations, and divers other
juggles. 5. That they have never yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the doctrine of the Popes deposing
Princes; that their Generals order
against teaching this doctrine was a meer
trick, and never pretended to reach <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
that <hi>Santarellus</hi> his Book was Printed
ten years after it, teaching the power of
deposing in all latitude; and why should
the peace of Kingdoms have no better secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
than their Generals Order? Who
knows how soon that may alter, when
good circumstances happen? and then it will
be a mortal sin not to teach this doctrine:
that the Iesuits have never spoken one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
word against this Power of deposing
Princes; that when the Pope shall think
fit to attempt deposing a King of <hi>England,</hi>
no doubt their Generals Order will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased.
6. That by their particular vow
of obedience to the Pope, they are bound to
do whatever he commands them; as for
example, if the Pope should excommunicate
or depose the Prince, and command them to
move Catholicks to take up Arms, they are
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:49659:252"/>
bound by their Vow to do it. 7. That they
make themselves Soveraigns over the Kings
Subjects, by usurping a power of life and
death over those of their Order for pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
crimes committed in <hi>England,</hi> which is
High Treason; for their Subjects have
other Soveraigns besides the King. 8. That
there can be no sufficient security given by
them, who hold the Popes personal infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
for whatever protestations, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations
they may make at present, they
will be obliged to the contrary whensoever
the Pope declares his judgement so: and
therefore no hearty Allegiance can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from those who hold it, but such as
must waver with every blast from <hi>Rome.</hi>
9. That they not only renounce the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Equivocation and Mental Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
without which all other protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
afford very little security; but men
ought to be assured, that they do not
practise them, when they do renounce
them; and he desires them to find out
some way for this, which it seems came
not into his head. 10. That without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
those doctrines which are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the Civil Government there is no
reason to expect favour from it: for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
subjection to Princes is the main
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:49659:253"/>
ground of the peace and good Government
of the Common-wealth; and what is
against that is against the Law of God and
Nature.</p>
            <p>§. 24. I now come in the last place to
consider the proposals made by Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
for satisfaction to the <hi>Government</hi> and the
<hi>repeal</hi> of the <hi>poenal Laws:</hi> which are of
two kinds, 1. <hi>Subscribing the censures of
the Faculty of</hi> Paris 1663. and 1626.
2. <hi>Taking the Oath of Allegiance, if the
word</hi> heretical <hi>were turned into Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, 1. It were worth knowing what
<hi>Authority</hi> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> had to make these
<hi>proposals</hi> in behalf of <hi>all the Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of</hi> England: he saith indeed, <hi>that his

               </gap> Superiorum,
<hi>and what he writes, is not the inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
opinion of one particular person only:</hi>
And what then? It may be two or three
more may be of his mind, it may be his
<hi>Superiours</hi> are, it may be several <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi>
not governed by the <hi>Iesuitical

is not to be trusted in these matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have
they made any renunciation since, of any
of those doctrines which were thought so
dangerous then? or are they quite gone
from us, and to use Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
<hi>like Rats have forsaken a sinking
Ship?</hi> It would be great Joy to the whole
Nation to hear we were so well rid of
them? but which way went they? in what
storm were they carried? Was it in the
late great <hi>Hurrican?</hi> or were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
invisibly through some passage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground? But they are subtle men, they
say, and full of tricks, and therefore may
seem to be gone and not be gone, even as
they please. Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> it seems hath a
a <hi>Power</hi> beyond <hi>Proclamations,</hi> for he can
send away the whole <hi>Fry</hi> in a tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce; but
a turn of his hand, and not a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> or a
man of his <hi>principles</hi> appears more in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
But for all this, neither the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictins,</hi>
nor <hi>Secular Priests,</hi> can get rid of
them so easily; they swarm and govern
too much for their interests; they have too
many <hi>Colleges</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to forsake them
so easily, and too rich a <hi>Bank</hi> to run away
and leave it behind them: it may be, some
of the poorer <hi>Orders</hi> would fain be <hi>finger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of it, and therefore represent the poor
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:49659:254"/>
harmless <hi>Iesuits,</hi> as the <hi>only dangerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to the Civil Government,</hi> whereas they
think themselves as <hi>honest</hi> as their <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi>
and say, <hi>they hold no doctrines but
what other Divines hold as well as they,
and if they understood themselves they
would find to be the doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church for six hundred years; only
a few temporizing Secular Priests, and
some others out of spight to them, and
hopes to get a better harvest to themselves
when they are gone, would lay all the blame
upon the Iesuits: whereas the doctrine
they own was the general doctrine of their
Church and received here in</hi> England, (the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> which decrees the Popes
power over Princes having been received
here by the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Oxford</hi> A. 1222.)
<hi>and what a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Popes power of deposing
Princes, which hath been decreed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
accepted by Churches, and only opposed
by some, out of the passions of fear or hopes
from temporal Princes?</hi> What <hi>do ye tell
us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> say they, <hi>of the Sorbon, a Club of State
Divines, that act as if they believed the

            <p>For all that I can see then, Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
had not sufficient <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Atturney</hi> to
declare in behalf of all the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi>
that they would subscribe the <hi>Censures</hi> of
the <hi>Sorbon;</hi> for the <hi>Popes deposing Power</hi> is
yet good doctrine among many of them.
But why did Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> take no notice of
any <hi>difference</hi> among them about these
points? Must we <hi>Protestants</hi> be still thought
such pittiful Animals, as not to know that
which hath been publickly canvased among
them about the full Age of a man, <hi>viz.</hi>
near seventy years! Alas for us! we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of <hi>Blackwell,</hi> and <hi>Barclay,</hi> and
<hi>Widdrington</hi> of one side; nor of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
and <hi>Singleton,</hi> and <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> of
the other: We have only a little <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
Learning,</hi> and can make a shift to
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:49659:256"/>
understand the <hi>Greek Testament,</hi> and read
<hi>Calvins Institutions,</hi> or <hi>Danaeus</hi> upon <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Lombard;</hi> but for these deep points,
it is well we have ever seen those that
have heard others say they have seen the
<hi>Books</hi> that handle them. But why should
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> so slily pass over the business of
the <hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>Ireland?</hi> was that nothing
to the purpose? Did not the <hi>Person</hi> of
<hi>Honour</hi> mention it several times, that he
could not avoid seeing it? But we must
forget all those things; and <hi>Cardinal Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barins</hi>
Letters about the <hi>Irish Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance:</hi>
and whatever is material,
if it cannot be answered, is better
let slip. Yet, is it possible for us to
believe that all <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are so
willing now to renounce the dangerous
doctrines; when there hath been so late,
so numerous, so vehement, (nay, I had
almost said) so <hi>Catholick,</hi> an opposition to
the <hi>Irish Remonstrance?</hi> Not, as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
would have it believed, <hi>out of indignation
at a particular person,</hi> (who had much
greater <hi>Authority</hi> for what he did on the
behalf of the rest by his <hi>Procuratorium</hi> than
Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> doth appear to have) nor <hi>a
quarrel at phrases,</hi> but at the very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the doctrine contained in it. Was
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:49659:256"/>
it only about <hi>some phrases,</hi> that the <hi>Popes
Internuntio</hi> at <hi>Brussels de Vechiis</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it? when he said, <hi>it contained in it
propositions agreeing with those already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated
by</hi> Paul <hi>the fifth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">History <hi>of the</hi> Irish Remonstr. p. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> Innocent
<hi>the tenth,</hi> and this he expressed as the
mind of the Pope. Was it only <hi>about
phrases,</hi> when he said <hi>the Remonstrance
would do more hurt than all the former
persecutions of hereticks?</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> Was it only
<hi>about phrases,</hi> when <hi>Cardinal Barbarin</hi>
charged the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> with <hi>corrupting
faith under a pretence of Allegiance to the
King:</hi> and he adds too, <hi>that the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were condemned before by the Apostolical
See; and that his Holiness was troubled
to the very heart about it?</hi> Methinks, a
<hi>few Phrases</hi> only, should not have given his
<hi>Holiness</hi> so much disturbance. Was it only
for <hi>some phrases,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 49.</note> that the <hi>Dominicans</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it, as contrary to the doctrine of
<hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who roundly asserts <hi>the
Popes power of deposing Heretical Princes?</hi>
and they pleaded, <hi>they were sworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Doctrine.</hi> It seems then, they can
give no security to the State without <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury;</hi>
and I suppose there were some of
these among Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi>
who were so ready to renounce this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:49659:257"/>
Was it only for a <hi>few phrases,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 102.</note>
that the <hi>Lovain Divines</hi> condemned it,
<hi>as wholly unlawful and detestable; and
containing things contrary to Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi>
The true grounds of which, were
the taking away <hi>the Popes power over
Princes,</hi> and the <hi>great Diana</hi> of <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Liberty.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> accounts
these but <hi>phrases,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> owes
him but little thanks for it. But this is
so ridiculous a pretence, that all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells
about the <hi>Irish Remonstrance</hi> were
only about a <hi>few phrases,</hi> that either he
looks on the parties as extreamly quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
or it must be some greater matter
which he confesses <hi>was the occasion of so
many commotions, dissentions, and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
invectives on both sides.</hi> Since then,
there hath so long been, and we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
still to believe there is, such a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
among them about these matters,
how can Mr. <hi>Cressy undertake</hi> so boldly as
he doth on the behalf of <hi>English Catholicks</hi>
for the subscribing the <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
of <hi>Paris?</hi> But of all sorts of men, I
am apt to <hi>mistrust</hi> great <hi>Undertakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 25. 2. But supposing they should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the <hi>Sorbon Censures,</hi> we may yet que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:49659:257"/>
whether hereby they would give full
<hi>satisfaction</hi> in these matters:<note place="margin">Epist. Apol. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 118.</note> Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> is
of opinion, <hi>that this would be a more full
and satisfactory testimony of their Fidelity,
than can be given by taking the Oath of
Allegiance;</hi> which makes me very much
wonder, why they should refuse the less sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
and choose that which is more.
But men had need to have fast hold, that
are to handle such slippery points as these
are; for when we think we have them
safe, they slip through our Fingers and
escape. Those who have not considered
all their arts and evasions in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
would think they offer as fair things
as any men in the world; but when it
comes home to the point, there is some
sly distinction or mental reservation, by
which they get through all, and are as
much at liberty as ever. That alone
which in our <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> can give
satisfaction, 1. <hi>Must reach our own case,</hi>
and not that of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France; i. e.</hi>
1. Of a <hi>King</hi> not of the same <hi>profession</hi>
of <hi>Religion</hi> with those who make the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
of <hi>Fidelity;</hi> 2. Of a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
already under <hi>censure</hi> of <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as <hi>Cardinal Barbarin</hi> declared: 3. Of
a <hi>King,</hi> not barely considered <hi>as a King,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:49659:258"/>
i. e.</hi> while he remains such, and the <hi>Pope</hi>
doth not declare him <hi>not to be a King;</hi>
but so as to declare it, <hi>not to be in the
Popes power, to make him no King.</hi> For
men may subscribe the <hi>Censures</hi> of <hi>Sorbon,</hi>
understanding them of <hi>Kings</hi> of their own
<hi>Religion,</hi> not <hi>excommunicated</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi>
and while the <hi>Pope</hi> doth not declare them
to <hi>be no Kings.</hi> 2. What gives satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in our case, <hi>must exclude all manner
of aequivocation and mental reservation;</hi>
For where that is not excluded, there can
be no security at all given; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to bring <hi>aequivocations</hi> and <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi>
within any bounds; nay, those
who hold it lawful to use them, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it, and do it in denying it; therefore
the matter of <hi>aequivocation</hi> must be stated,
how far, and upon what terms, and in what
cases they allow it; and yet there may
be <hi>aequivocation</hi> in all this. So that as
<hi>aequivocation</hi> hath all the advantages of
<hi>lying,</hi> it hath the <hi>disadvantage</hi> too, <hi>viz.</hi>
that those who use it cannot safely be
trusted, though they do not use it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though it be possible they may not,
no man can be well assured that they do
not. But the <hi>Sorbon censures</hi> never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>aequivocation</hi> at all, and therefore I do
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:49659:258"/>
not wonder to see such as Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to bring in those, instead of the <hi>Oath</hi>
of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> because although himself
and some others may disown the doctrine
of <hi>aequivocation,</hi> yet if that be not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excluded, they know the very <hi>Iesuits</hi>
will swallow a <hi>Camel,</hi> let them but have
the <hi>dressing</hi> of him. They know so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tricks of <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> that I do
not see why a very <hi>cunning Iesuit</hi> may
not then think himself a fit match for the
<hi>Devil</hi> himself; for let him make never so
many promises in <hi>Words,</hi> he would have
such a <hi>secret Reservation</hi> in his <hi>Mind,</hi> as
should make his Words to signifie nothing.
But it is not safe for them to play such
tricks with so old a <hi>Sophister,</hi> that first
found out the way of <hi>aequivocation.</hi>
3. What gives satisfaction in our case,
<hi>must exclude absolutely all power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing
in the Pope;</hi> for if that be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
they are safe enough; they know
how to get out presently, for they have
one ready that can knock off all their
shackles, and set them as free as ever;
nay, they have yet another fetch concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Popes power,</hi> for he can <hi>null</hi> an
Oath before-hand, and make it stand for
nothing, as well as absolve them from it
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:49659:259"/>
afterwards. But how then can the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon
censures</hi> be so satisfactory in our case,
when they never so much as mention the
<hi>Popes power of dispensing,</hi> much less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
it so plainly as it ought to be done,
to give satisfaction? So that we see, it is
not without reason Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> would so
willingly have the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi>
changed for the <hi>Sorbon Censures:</hi> and I
do not at all wonder that fourteen <hi>Iesuits</hi>
in <hi>France</hi> offered to subscribe the <hi>Sorbon
censures</hi> 1626. which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> offers, as
the most satisfactory Form, who never yet
could well swallow the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
for they very well knew whatever
they did swear in <hi>France</hi> could be dispensed
with at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 26. 3. But farther <hi>he declares their
readiness to take the Oath of Allegiance it
self, if the word Heretical were left out.</hi>
Whose readiness doth he mean? <hi>All
Roman Catholicks, Iesuits</hi> and all? And
hath this indeed been the only bone of
contention thus many years? Did <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,
Suarez, Lessius, Fitz-herbert</hi> and the
rest of the opposers of this <hi>Oath,</hi> find no
other fault with it, but only that a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was declared <hi>heretical,</hi> which was
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:49659:259"/>
never condemned in any <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil?</hi>
Would they have been content to
have called the <hi>Popes power of deposing
Princes new, false, erroneous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Word of God,</hi> though not
<hi>heretical?</hi> For shame, let not men go
about thus to impose upon us, as though
all the <hi>difference</hi> were about this nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the signification of a word. It
would be needless in so plain a case to
shew upon what principles those went who
opposed the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance;</hi> but I
shall only instance in <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fitz-herb: Reply, ch. 4.</note> being
of our own Nation, and as considerable
as any; he therefore insists upon it, <hi>that
it is an unlawful Oath, because it flatly
contradicteth the</hi> Lateran <hi>Council, as to
the Popes power of deposing Princes:</hi> but
that is not all, but his design is at large
to prove, <hi>that it is repugnant to the
Law of God in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 5, 6, 7, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>to the practice of the Church, and
express declaration of the Pope by three
Apostolical Breves;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 17. p. 112.</note> and to those that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<hi>that the Popes first Breve was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
surreptitiously and for want of good
information;</hi> he saith, <hi>it is not only ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
but malice in any to say so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Pope published another Breve on
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:49659:260"/>
purpose to declare that the first was not
surreptitious, but written upon his own
certain knowledge, motion, and will, and
after long and grave deliberation had
concerning all things contained therein,
and that therefore the Catholicks were
bound to observe it wholly rejecting all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
to the contrary; and by
his third Breve he gave Authority to the
Arch-Priest to deprive all Seminary Priests
under his Iurisdiction that had taken the
Oath, or had taught or did still teach
it to be lawful to take it;</hi> Nay, he adds
farther to take off that common evasion,
<hi>that the Pope was not duly informed, that
before the sentence passed against it at</hi>
Rome, <hi>it was long debated in certain
Congregations of Learned Cardinals, and
other great Divines; wherein Cardinal</hi>
Bellarmin <hi>had but one voyce,</hi> and Father
<hi>Parsons</hi> (whom they suspect to have mis-informed
the Pope) <hi>none at all.</hi> Now
the <hi>Pope</hi> did not condemn it meerly on
the account of the word <hi>Heretical,</hi> but
because he said, <hi>the Oath contained in it
many things, contrary to faith and the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of souls.</hi> And therefore all those
who have any regard to the <hi>Popes Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>
in a matter of such importance have
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:49659:260"/>
other <hi>Reasons</hi> to decline taking the <hi>Oath,</hi>
supposing the word <hi>Heretical</hi> were le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
out. But some men love to pretend that a
small alteration in established <hi>Laws</hi> would
satisfie them, to try if by those arts, they
could bring the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> to
yield to them in that, and when they have
obtained it, then a thousand other obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are raised that were not mentioned
before: so I doubt not but it would be
in this Case, if the word <hi>Heretical</hi> were
left out, and when they had gained this
point, then they would start another, and
another till the whole Oath were brought
to Nothing, and I <hi>A. B.</hi> left to stand
alone. But it is a very strange thing to
me, that they who can swallow all the
other parts of the Oath should stick so
much at the word <hi>Heretical;</hi> for if they
would use some of the same mollifying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions
that they do about the other
parts of it, methinks <hi>Heretical</hi> might go
down as glib as the rest. Were I of
their Religion, I should more scruple <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing,
abjuring,</hi> and <hi>abhorring from my
heart,</hi> than calling a thing <hi>Heretical;</hi>
the other are downright and plain words
capable of no Ambiguity; but <hi>Heretical,</hi>
is a word, that may signifie this or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:49659:261"/>
thing, as men please. That is <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical</hi>
with one that is not with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>Heretical</hi> may be meant in the
<hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Givers,</hi> and not the <hi>Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi>
which is Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s way. But
besides, what is it is said to be <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal?
That Princes which be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
or deprived by the Pope, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
or murthered by their Subjects, or any
other whatsoever;</hi> where <hi>or</hi> being a
disjunctive particle, if to say that <hi>Princes
deprived may be murdered be Heretical,</hi>
though to say <hi>they may be deposed be not,</hi>

               <hi>as heretical</hi> doth not imply
<hi>equality but similitude, and that they do
abhor and detest it as much, as if it were
formal heresie;</hi> but the main of all is,
<hi>that a thing is not therefore heretical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Church defines it; but because
it is repugnant to Catholick Faith, or which
is all one to that which is revealed by
God; which he proves to be the proper
notion of heresie, from</hi> Alphonsus à Castro,
Covarruvias <hi>and others: and if this were
not the true notion of it, the Church would
have power to make new articles of Faith;</hi>
               <pb n="499" facs="tcp:49659:261"/>
and therefore upon the same ground that
any person rejects any doctrine <hi>as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the word of God,</hi> he may reject it
as <hi>heretical.</hi> I cannot therefore imagine,
whatever Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> says, that it would
give such general satisfaction to have the
word <hi>heretical</hi> turned into <hi>repugnant to
the word of God;</hi> for I cannot think the
<hi>Roman-Catholick Gentlemen</hi> to be men of
so weak understandings, to be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
all other parts of the <hi>Oath,</hi> and to
refuse taking it only on the account of the
word <hi>heretical.</hi> I must therefore beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
if I be not of too easie a faith in this
matter; it is easie to guess where the <hi>Oath</hi>
pinches, better than so.</p>
            <p>§. 27. 4. But after all this, I am not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
with the <hi>grounds</hi> of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s
hopes, <hi>that the taking off the objection as
to their Loyalty may be sufficient reason for
the Toleration of their Religion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. Apol. p. 98.</note> which is
the thing aimed at in this Discourse. For
although the inconsistency of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with the Civil Government be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground against the Toleration of
such a Religion; yet its not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
is not enough for its Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the matter of Toleration, in a
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:49659:262"/>
Nation where there is a <hi>Publick Religion</hi>
established by <hi>Law,</hi> hath a respect two
wayes, to the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> and to
the <hi>Established Religion:</hi> and the <hi>Civil
Government</hi> is bound to defend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the <hi>Established Religion;</hi> because it
is agreed on all hands that it is bound to
defend the <hi>True Religion,</hi> and that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by the <hi>Laws</hi> to be the <hi>True,</hi> which
is established by them. Now, if a
party appears active and dangerous, whose
Principles are destructive to the Religion
established by Law, I appeal to any man
of common sense, whether it be sufficient
ground for the Toleration of it, that one
objection is taken off, when the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in its fuil force? That which is
then to be considered in this case, is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such a party, which is dangerous
without Toleration, will grow less dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
by it? which I think needs no great
consideration; and it will require as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
to shew the danger that will come to
the <hi>Established Religion</hi> by a <hi>Toleration</hi> of
<hi>Popery:</hi> not only by the diligence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
and number of the <hi>Priests,</hi> who
will be glad to make <hi>new Converts</hi> to
gain <hi>new Residences,</hi> (they being at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
so much over-stocked;) besides their
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:49659:262"/>
desires to approve themselves to the <hi>Court</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> for preferments by their activity;
and telling brave stories beyond Seas
of their exploits against <hi>hereticks,</hi> (as a
late <hi>Miles Gloriosus</hi> among them hath
done) how many <hi>Legions</hi> of <hi>Hereticks</hi>
they have blown away by the <hi>Power</hi> of
<hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Demonstrations;</hi> but, by
the obligation that lyes upon them that
receive <hi>preferments</hi> from <hi>Rome, to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Hereticks, Schismaticks, and Rebels
to the Pope to their uttermost;</hi> which is
expressed in the <hi>Oath</hi> they take to the
<hi>Pope;</hi> as appears by the <hi>Pontifical;</hi> so
that these men must either be <hi>perjured,</hi>
or <hi>persecute</hi> when it lyes in their Power.
And can any Nation in the World think
it Wise or Safe to give <hi>Toleration</hi> to
<hi>Wolfs</hi> among <hi>Sheep;</hi> to those that have
solemnly sworn <hi>to persecute to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
all that own the Established Religion?</hi>
and that look upon all such as in a
damned condition that do not submit to
their Church? Till they abate of their
monstrous uncharitableness, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their Oaths to the <hi>Pope,</hi> till they
can give good security of their quiet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
in not seducing others, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
can there be, for their being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:49659:263"/>
a free exercise of their Religion, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
they should take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance?</hi>
But as to their <hi>dignified Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
I mean such of his <hi>Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
whom the <hi>Pope</hi> hath taken upon
him to make <hi>Bishops</hi> without his consent
(which was not suffered by some <hi>Princes,</hi>
even in times of <hi>Popery</hi>) it ought far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be considered, what security any
following <hi>Oath</hi> can give as to those that
have taken a former <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi>
to the <hi>Pope?</hi> as I have already proved
it to be; as much as <hi>King Iohn</hi>'s was,
upon the <hi>Resignation</hi> of his <hi>Crown;</hi> nay
yet farther, they are bound now by that
<hi>Oath to defend all those Provisions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
and Apostolical Mandates,</hi> which
were accounted the intolerable grievances
of this Nation, long before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why may they not enjoy equal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
with the Sectaries?</hi> I am not plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Sectaries</hi> Cause, (neither would
others plead it now but for a farther end)
nor would I extenuate the guilt of their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;</hi>
but they are blind, that do not

<pb n="504" facs="tcp:49659:264"/>
But this is a subject too large to enter upon
now: For my part, I am no Friend to
<hi>Sanguinary Laws</hi> on the <hi>account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
and if the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of our <hi>Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
should think fit to change that <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
way</hi> of publick suffering (which the
sufferers would have still believed to be for
<hi>Religion</hi>) into a more effectual course of
suppressing the growth of a party so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to our established <hi>Religion,</hi> I should
more rejoice, it may be, therein, than
those who are more concerned in it.
Provided, that the pretence of making
<hi>new Laws</hi> more accommodate to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State, be not carried on meerly with
the design of leaving our Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any security by <hi>Law</hi> at all against so
violent and dangerous a party: for it is a
much easier matter to repeal <hi>old Laws,</hi>
than to make new ones. And if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against the old Laws be, <hi>that they
are not executed,</hi> it ought to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whether the same objection will not
lye against others, unless they be such
<hi>Laws</hi> as will <hi>execute themselves;</hi> and
we have little Reason to believe that
they who bid difiance to our present
<hi>Laws,</hi> and make <hi>sport</hi> with <hi>Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
will be perswaded by gentler means
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:49659:264"/>
to obey others. And is such an affront to
<hi>Laws</hi> a sufficient <hi>Motive</hi> to <hi>Lenity?</hi>
And we have good ground to think, that
that they look upon all our <hi>Laws,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be, as things of no force at all
upon their <hi>Consciences,</hi> as being <hi>null in
themselves, because they are contrary to
the Popes Authority and the Constitutions
of their Church.</hi> And I believe if our
modern <hi>Papists</hi> were pressed home, the
generality of those who are obnoxious to
the <hi>Poenal Laws,</hi> would not acknowledge
those <hi>Ancient Rights</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> which
were challenged by <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
William Rufus, Henry</hi> the first, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the second, (before his submission to
the Pope) and afterwards by <hi>Edward</hi> the
first, and <hi>Edward</hi> the third; viz. <hi>No ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of any forreign jurisdiction here
without the Kings consent; no liberty of
going out of the Kingdom, though upon the
Popes Command, without the Kings leave;</hi>
and while they allow this Power to the
Pope to command his <hi>Majesties Subjects,</hi>
they make him <hi>Soveraign</hi> over them,
and make them more fearful of disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Power; <hi>No Decrees of Popes or
Bulls to be received without the Kings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;
No Bishops to be made by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:49659:265"/>
Provisions out of the plenitude of his
Power,</hi> &amp;c. Those who will not reject
these, which were challenged by the <hi>Kings</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> long before the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
as their <hi>ancient and undoubted Rights,</hi>
with what face can they plead for the
<hi>Repeal</hi> of the <hi>Poenal Laws?</hi> when the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> makes them guilty of
<hi>violating</hi> the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Crown.</hi> If
they say, <hi>the Case is not the same now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Change of Religion;</hi> I desire to
know of them, whether any <hi>ancient Rights
of the Crown</hi> are lost by casting off the
<hi>Popes Authority?</hi> if they be not, they are
good still, and what are they then that
deny them? if they be lost, then our <hi>Kings</hi>
have lost some of their <hi>Soveraign Rights</hi>
which their <hi>Ancestors</hi> valued <hi>above half
their Kingdoms;</hi> and how could they lose
them by casting off the <hi>Pope,</hi> if they did
not receive them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom him? If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them from him, then they make the
<hi>Kings Power</hi> to be so far at least derived
from the <hi>Pope;</hi> for if it were independent
upon him, how could they lose any <hi>Power,</hi>
by casting off the <hi>Popes Authority?</hi> If it
be said, <hi>that these were priviledges granted
by the Popes;</hi> I utterly deny it; for our
<hi>Kings</hi> challenged them in spight of the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:49659:265"/>
Popes, and exercised them in direct oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to their <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Decrees;</hi> even the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi>
of <hi>Councils</hi> as well as <hi>Popes,</hi> as is
fully manifested in the foregoing Discourse.
How then can such men plead for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of <hi>Poenal Laws</hi> whose <hi>principles</hi> do so
directly contradict the ancient acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Crown of</hi> England?
For others that will not only own these <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Rights,</hi> but give sufficient <hi>security</hi>
without fraud and equivocation, of their
sincerity in renouncing the <hi>Popes power of
deposing Princes,</hi> and other Principles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to Government; since it was never
the intention of our <hi>Laws</hi> to persecute such,
they need not fear the enjoyment of all
Reasonable Protection by them. But it
doth not become me to discourse of such
points which are far more proper for the
<hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>whole Nation:</hi>
And I know no true <hi>Protestant</hi> would envy
the quiet and security of innocent and
peaceable men, where there is sufficient as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
that by favour received they will
not grow more unquiet. But we cannot
take too great care to prevent the restless
designs of those, who aim at nothing more,
than the undermining and blowing up our
established <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> Which <hi>God</hi>
preserve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="508" facs="tcp:49659:266"/>
Thus much may serve for an Answer to
these points of Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s Book, the rest
I leave to a better hand.</p>
            <p>And now My Lord, what reason have I
