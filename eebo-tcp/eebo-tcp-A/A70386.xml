            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Miseries is upon them that conceale the Scripture in their hands, that alter it, and say, that what they read proceedeth from God to profit any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Misery is upon them, because of what their hands have written; misery is upon them, and upon what they have gained, in blaspheming against God. They have said, we shall continue in Fire but a certaine number of dayes: Say unto them, have you capitulated with God? He will not act against his promises: Will you speak of God what you know not? Such as have gained ought, and were entangled in the sinne of their gaine, shall for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the flames of Hell; and they that have faith in God, and doe good works, shall eternally enjoy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Paradise.

O yee that believe in God! be obedient to his Commandents, and pursue not the steps of the Devill, he is your open enemie; if you sin against God, having once learned his Commandements, know, that he is omnipotent to chastise you, and prudent in all his workes.

You will not offend God in speaking a word in secret to women that you research in marriage, although you conceale in your mind your designe to espouse them, he understandeth what ever you thinke of them; know them not secretly, untill you have pronounced the words appointed by the Law; and enter not the bonds of marriage, untill the time set downe in writing be accomplished, God knoweth whatever is in your hearts: take heed unto your selves, he is gentle and gracious to them that feare him.

See you not them that departed their houses for the fear they had of death? they are thousands in number; God hath said to them, die: after this, he raised them again: God is the Benefactor of the people, but the greatest part return him no thanks for his Favours. Fight for his Law, and know, that he understandeth and knoweth all things. Who is he that will afford him a good turne? He will augment him with multiplicity of increase; he giveth good, and taketh it away from whom it pleaseth him; you shall all returne before him to bee judged. Knowest thou not, that a company of the children of Israel, after the death of <hi>Moses,</hi> said to their Prophet, send us a King, we with him will fight for the Law of God? He answereth them, have you disobeyed the Commandements of God? If they enjoyne you to fight, you will not doe it: They said, wee have no greater desire, then to fight for the glory of his divine Majestie; wee for this Cause have abandoned our houses, and those of our parents: neverthelesse, when they were commanded to fight, they all, except some few of them, retired; but God knoweth them that sin against him.

Give to women their dowry with a good will; if they give to you any thing that is pleasing to you, receive it with affection, and civility.

O ye that believe in God! it is not lawfull for you to inherit what is your wives by force, take not violently away what you have given them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they be surprized in manifest adultery; see them with civility, if you have an avertion from them, it may chance that you hate a thing, wherein God hath placed much good; but if you desire to repudiate your wives, to take others, and that you have given them any thing, take not any thing that appertaineth to them. Wil you take their wealth with a lie and a manifest sin? How shall you take it, since you have approached each other, and that you have promised to use them civilly? Marry not the wives of your fathers; what is past was incest, abomination, and a wicked way. Your Mothers are forbidden you, your Daughters, Sisters, Aunts, Neices, your Nurses, and your foster-sisters, the mothers of your wives, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that your wives have had by other husbands, of whom you shall have a particular care: The daughters of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that you shall have knowne, are also forbidden you; if you have not knowne them, it will be no sin: the wives of your sons are likewise prohibited, and two sisters; for what is past, God is gracious and mercifull: Married

wives are likewise forbidden you, except the women slaves, that you shall have acquired.

He that shall not be able to espouse women of free-condition, shall marry such women or maids, that are slaves, as shall please him. God knoweth the faith of the one, and other. Marry your wives with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their parents, and give them their dowry with honesty: If women of free-condition, that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted neither concubinage, nor adultery, secretly nor publikely, flie into second nuptials, and come to commit adultery, they shall be doubly punished, more then the daughters of Love.<note place="margin">

God is gracious and mercifull; he is willing to teach you his Law, and direct you in the way of them that preceded you; he is gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to his people. Such as follow the appetite of the wicked, decline extreamly from the Truth. God willeth that his Law be Light unto you, for that man was created weak. O you that believe in God, devour not your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance among you with ufury; but if you traffique, be peaceable in your affairs; slay not one another, God is mercifull to them that obey him: He that disobeyeth, through malice and iniustice, shall burn in the fire of Hell; it is an easie thing to God to punish them. If you depart from mortal sins, I will cover your faults, and cause you to enter into Paradise: covet not through envie, what God hath given to your neighbor; men and women shall have the wealth they have gained; beg Grace of God, he knoweth all things. Give to your associates what apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to them. We have ordained a portion, prefixt to the one and the other, in the succession of your Father, Mother, and Kindred, God seeth all. The men shall have authority over the women; they shall have them in their

keeping; they shall have in their power the wealth that God shall give them; and shall have care of what shall be convenient to be expended for them. Discreet and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient wives observe, in the absence of their husbands, the Commandements of God, make remonstrances to them that shall be disobedient, and remove them from your Bed, chastise them. If they obey you, seek not occasion to abuse them uniustly. God is most high, and most mighty. If you fear there may happen some difference between a man and his wife, send to them some of their Kindred, to put an end to their quarrel, and reconcile them. God wil give his peace to them, he is omniscient. Worship God, and say not that he hath a companion equall to him; do good to your Father, and Mother, your Kindred, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, the Poor, your Neighbors, Pilgrims, your Friends, and your Slaves. God loveth not the proud. We have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared rigorous torments for them that are avaricious, that recommend avarice to the people, that conceal the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that God hath bestowed on them, and that are impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Such as dispend their wealth with hypocrisie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve neither in God, nor the day of Iudgement; and those that shall have the Devil for their companion, will be in exceeding bad company; he shall not approach them, if they believe in God, and the day of Iudgement, and give Alms in some part of the riches God hath given them. God knoweth them, and doth no iniustice to any one, of the weight of a small Ant. If the righteous do good of the quantity of a Pismire, God shall multiply it, and give them a great reward.

Ionas, Aaron,</hi> and to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and gave the Psalter to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> We have told thee who were the Prophets that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded thee; but we have not spoken to thee, concerning the merits of all them. <hi>Moses</hi> spake to God, as his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and Apostle; all declared his mercy, and preached the torments of Hell, to the end men might have no cause of excuse; God is Omnipotent and prudent in all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: He shall be witnesse that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was sent to thee with his Commandements, the Angels likewise testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it; but it ought to suffice thee, that God is witness. The Infidels that hindred the people to follow the Law of God, were exceedingly erroneous; God will not pardon them, he will lead them into the path of Hell, where they shall remain eternally, it is a thing easie to his divine Majestie. Oh people? A Prophet is come to you, who preacheth to you the Truth from the Lord, believe him, you shall do well; if you believe him not, know, that whatever is in Earth, and in Heaven is Gods, and that God knoweth whatsoever you do. Oh ye that understand the written Law! Obey the Commandements of God, and speak not of his divine Majestie but with truth; the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, Jesus, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is a Prophet, and an Apostle of God, his Word, and his Spirit, which he sent to <hi>Mary</hi>; believe therefore in God, and in his Prophets, and say not there be three Gods, put an end to that discourse, you shall do well; For there is but one God, praysed be God, he hath no Son; what-ever is in Heaven, and in Earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth him, it is sufficient that he is witnesse. The Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah esteemeth it no dishonour to be the servant of God, neither the Angel, nor the Cherubins, He that holdeth it a dishonour to be at his service, is too proud; he shall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble all the world at the day of Judgement, and every one shall receive the recompence that he shall have meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he shall augment his favours upon them that shall have believed in his divine Majestie, and have done good works; he shall chastise them that shall have held it a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to be his servants, and have been proud upon the Earth, they shall find no safe refuge but in his mercy. Oh people! God hath sent you a Protector, a most strong

argument, and a most cleare light; they that shall trust in God, shall enjoy his grace, and he shall guide them into the right way. They will enquire of thee concerning suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions; say to them, God teacheth you touching succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as followeth; If a man decease without issue, and hath a sister, she shall have the moity of what he shall leave, and shall inherit it, if she have no children: If they be two sisters, they shall have two thirds of what the deceased left; if they be many brothers, and many si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, the Sonne shall have as much as two daughters; God teacheth you his Commandemements, depart not from the right way, he is Omniscient.</p>

God hath sent you a Book full of light, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct into the way of Salvation them that love him, to bring them out of darknesse, and by his speciall grace, to lead them into the way of Salvation. Certainly he that saith, that the Messiah, the Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> is God, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious: Say to him who can hinder God to exterminate the Messiah, and his Mother, with whatsoever is in the Earth, when it shall seeme good to him? God is King of Heaven and earth, he created with them what seemed good to him, he is Omnipotent. The Jews and Christians have said, we are the Children of God, his wel-beloved; Say to them, shall not God chastise you for your sinnes? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ye are men; He that created you, pardoneth, and punisheth as it pleaseth him, he is the King of all that is in Heaven or Earth, and of whatever is betweene them, he is the refuge of the righteous. O ye that have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the written Law! The Poophet, the Apostle of God is come to instruct you in a time that there is none other Prophet but hee on the Earth; Will you say that no man preached to you the torments of Hell? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the word of God is this day preached to you, the torment of Hell, and the Omnipotencie of his Divine Majestie. Remember thou what <hi>Moses</hi> said to his people, Oh people, call to mind the grace of God towards you, he hath chosen from among you Prophets, and Kings, hath conferred on you what he hath given to none in the world: Enter into the holy Land, as God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, turne not your backs to your enemies, lest you be in the number of Reprobates: They answered, oh <hi>Moses</hi>! there are Gyants and Tyrants in the Holy Land, we will not enter into it, untill they be gone out of it, if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it, we will enter into it. Then two men of them that were in the grace of God, said to them, enter at the gate, and fight against them, you shall be victorious, trust in God, if you believe in his Law: They said, oh <hi>Moses</hi>! we will not enter, so long as those Tyrants dwell therein, goe and fight against them with thy Lord, we will here attend. Then said <hi>Moses,</hi> Lord, I dispose but of mine own, and my brothers person; separate us from this wicked
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29476:45"/>
people; the Lord said to him, the entrance into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land is prohibited to this people, they shall wander forty years upon the Earth, in confusion and amazement, afflict not thy selfe with the deportments of the wicked; teach them the Historie of the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> how they offered sacrifices, how the sacrifice of the one was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that of the other was not: he through envie menaced his brother, to murther him; his brother said to him, God receiveth the sacrifices, and holocausts of such as have his feare before their eyes: assuredly if thou exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thine hand to slay me, I will not stretch forth mine to hurt thee; I feare the Lord of the Universe; If thou chargest thy selfe with the murther of my person, with thy past sinnes, thou shalt goe to hell, where the unjust shall be punished: The murther of his brother seemed easie and advantagious for him, he slew him, and is in the number of the Damned. God sent a Raven that made a pit in the Earth, and shewed him the manner to bury the body of his brother: Then said he, would to God I had been weake and impotent, that I were like to this Raven? I must bury the body of my brother, and he was penitent for his offence; by reason of this murther, we ordained to the children of Israel, that he who shall slay a person innocent, shall be punished, as if he had slaine the whole world, and he that shall give him his life, shall be recompensed, as if hee had given life to the whole world. My Prophets came to the Children of Israel, taught them my Commandements, and caused them to see Miracles, neverthelesse many of them were disobedient? the punishment of them that oppose the will of God, that of his Prophet, and that endeavour to pollute the earth, is to be slain, hanged, to have the right foot, and the left hand, or right hand, and the left foot cut off, and to bee extirpated from the earth; they shall have in this world shame on the forehead, and shall feele in the other, great torments, except such as shall be converted before their death, and shall know, that God is gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Oh ye that believe! feare God, fight for his Law, you perhaps shall be happy. All the Treasures of the world

shall not bee able to redeeme Infidels at the day of Judgement, they shall endure exceeding great torments, they shall desire to goe out of the fire of Hell, but shall dwell there eternally. Cut off the hands of those men and women that steale, they contract upon themselves the wrath of the world, and the punishment that God hath prepared for the wicked: He that shall turn, and do good works, shall be pardoned, God is gracious and mercifull to the penitent. Knowest thou not that the Kingdome of Heaven, and of Earth is Gods? that hee chastiseth and pardoneth whom it pleaseth him? and that he is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent? Oh Prophet! afflict not thy selfe, to behold them running to impietie; that say with the mouth, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and have no faith in their hearts; neither for them that Judaize, and hearken to the lies of their Doctors, to relate them to others; they pervert the language of the Old Testament, and say; If you be instructed in those precepts, you ought to observe them, if they instruct you not in them, take heed to your selves. Such as make use of the name of God, to move the people to sedition, are without faith, God will not purifie their hearts, they shall have in this world shame upon the forehead, and feele in the other extreame torments. They listen to blasphemies, and eat what is prohibited; If they repaire to thee, and submit themselves to thy judgement, judge their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie with equity, converse not with them; if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their company, they shall not hurt thee, if thou givest judgement between them, Judge with equitie, God loveth the just: How shall they submit to thy judgement, seeing they have the Old Testament, which containeth the Commandements of God? They will not execute thy Judgement, neither believe in the Old Testament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is the guide of the right way, and a light to the Prophets, to judge the differences arising among true believers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Jews; their Doctors, and ther Priests, who study the Scripture, and are witnesses that it containeth the truth, feare not the world, but dread me; sell not, neither exchange my commandements for any price.

We sent after many Prophets, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> who confirmed the ancient Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to him we gave the Gospel, full of light, to conduct the people to the right way, with a confirmation of the Old Testament, a guide and instruction for the righteous.

O ye that believe! obey not the Jews, nor the Christians, they mutually obey each other in their impietie, he that shall obey them, shall be like unto them, God guideth not the unjust.

Those whom he curseth, against whom he is incensed, whom he hath metamorphised into Apes, and Swine, and who have adored Idols, shall be confined in the fire of Hell, they are in a very evill way. When they come to thee, they will say, they believe in the Law of God, they will enter thine house with impiety, and goe forth in the like manner, but God knoweth what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale in their heart: Thou shalt see many of them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Paganisme, follow a lye, eat what is forbidden, and this to displease their Doctors, and Priests, who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them to speak lies, and eat meats that are unclean.

Say to them, What better testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is there in the world then that of God? Say to them, He shall testifie between you and me, to whom he hath inspired the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to instruct you: Will any among you that shall learn it, say there is any other God, but God; I will not say so; there is but one God, and I am innocent from the sin you commit, in associating him with a companion equall to him; many of them that understand the written Law, have knowledge of the truth of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>; their children also know it, but such as forsake their owne souls, will not believe in God. Who more unjust, then he that blasphemeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and his Commandements?

They shall have none other excuse, but to say, by God, Lord, we were of the number of Idolaters.

to arise, he demanded if that were his God; no, said he to himself, certainly God will not guide me to be of them that are erronious: when he beheld the Sun rising, he likewise asked, if that were his God; and when he saw it set, he said to his people, I am innocent of the sin which you commit, in adoring many gods, I wholly commend my self to his Will, who created heaven and earth, and professe his Unity: His people would dispute against him; he said to them, will you dispute against me concerning the Unity of God, who hath instructed me in the right way? I feare not your Idols, my God doth what pleaseth him, and knoweth all things, will you not consider it? How shall I feare your Idols, since you are not afraid to affirme, that God hath companions equall to him, which you have no reason to adore? If you understand the truth, who is more true, you, or I?

Consider how fruits encrease and multiply; this serveth for instruction of Gods Unity, to them that have his fear before their eyes: the Infidels have adored the devill, with God, who created them, and said, that God hath sons and daughters, such is their ignorance; praised be God, he created heaven and earth; how shall he have a son, who hath no wives? He created and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, he is your God, and your Lord, there is none other God but he; worship him, he conserveth all things, he is seen of no man, and beholdeth all things, he is benigne, and nothing is concealed from him.

If you be not converted, you shall not escape the torments of Hell; Say unto them, do as you understand him, I will comport my selfe, as I shall apprehend him; you shall in the end understand who shall have the good part in the other world. None shall give succour to Idolaters, they, they offer to their Idols of the fruits that God hath created, and say, (following their thoughts) behold our God! Such sacrifices ascend not to God, their Idolatrie hath induced many of them to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice their own Children to their false Gods, they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed them, and were ensnared in their Religion; which they had not done, had it so pleased God; Separate thy selfe from them and their blasphemies they have said, that the fruits of the earth, and the benefits of God were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and would not eat of them. God giveth food but to those whom he is pleased to gratifie. They have prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to ride on some beasts that God gave them, and slew them for food, without pronouncing the name of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majestie, which is a great sin, but they shall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed according to their demerits, They have said it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for men to eat what is in the bellies of beasts, and that it is unlawfull for their wives, and when they had slain them, they did eat for company; but God shall chastise them for their discourse, he is most wise, and Omniscient. Such as slay their Children are wretched men, fooles and ignorant, they have forbidden to eat the good things that God hath given them, to blaspheme, and are gone astray from the right way.

Who is more wicked then he that blasphemeth, to seduce from the right way the people that are ignorant? God guideth not the unjust; Say unto them, In all that God hath inspired into me, I finde not that it is prohibited to eat of those beasts, except they die of some disease, and if they be slain without pronouncing the name of God. The flesh of Swine is forbidden you; if you eat of it, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the wrath of God; If any one be in necessity, and eateth without designe to provoke God, he shall find God gracious and mercifull. We forbad the Jews to eat of beasts whose feet were cloven, and of the fat of Beasts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of such as is interlarded in the flesh, the entrails and the bones. We enjoyned this prohibition by reason of their sinne, and we are veritable in our words, and exact in our promises: If they slander thee, Say unto them, the mercy of God is great, and the wicked shall not avoid the punishment of their crimes. The Infidels have said, had it pleased God, we had not been unbelievers, neither our fathers also, and nothing had been prohibited.

Tell us, whence ariseth this assurance? You, in this, follow but your opinion, you are but lyers, Gods providence is great; he had guided all of you in the right way, had it so pleased him.

               </argument>
               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull: I am God, the most wise, the most true. This Book was sent to thee, to preach to the True-beleevers; doubt not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it. Say unto them, Believe in what was sent to you from your Lord, and worship none other God but him; few there be among you that consider it. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities have we destroyed? How often have we infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted our punishment on their Inhabitants by day, and by night, when they reposed? Neverthelesse, they said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that they were greatly afflicted. We will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the people to whom we have sent our Prophets, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29476:57"/>
require account of what they have learned, and of what they have done. We will examine our Prophets, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an account of such as have followed, and obeyed them. I will cause them to remember what they have done worthy of reward. We forsook not our Prophets when they preached to them the Truth; their actions shall be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ballance of equity; the ballance of the blessed shall be ponderous with good works; and they whose bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance shall be light of good works, shall be damned, for having contemned our Commandements. We gave you your habitation on the Earth, and there bestowed on you what was necessary for your nourishment; but few of you are gratefull to me. We created and formed you, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Angels to worship <hi>Adam,</hi> which they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, except the devill, to whom we said, what hindred thee to worship <hi>Adam,</hi> when we comanded thee? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, I am better then he, thou hast created me of fire, and hast created man of the mire of the earth; then said we to him, depart out of Paradise, it is not the habitation of the proud, thou shalt be in the number of them that shall be laden with ignominy; the Devill answered, Let me alone untill the day of the Resurrection of the dead; wherefore hast thou tempted me? I will seduce men from the right way, I will hinder them on the right hand, and on the left, and on all sides, to believe in thy Law, and the greatest part of them shall be ungratefull: we said to him, be gone out of Paradise, thou shalt be abhorred of all the world, and deprived of my mercy; I will fill hell with such as shall follow thee. O <hi>Adam</hi>! dwell with thy wife in Paradise, and there eat of whatsoever shall please thee, but approach not that Tree, lest thou with thy wife be in the number of the unjust. The devill tempted them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dispoyled their bodies of their vestments of grace; he said to them, God hath forbidden you to eat of the fruit of that Tree, that you may not be Angels, or eternall; he swore that he spake the truth, and filled them with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy, because of their pride. They knew their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, having eaten of that fruit, and to cover themselves, took leaves of Paradise; their Lord called them, and said,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29476:58"/>
Did I not forbid you to approach that Tree? I told both of you, that the devill was your open enemy; they said, Lord, we have offended thee, and injured our souls, if thou dost not compassionate us, we shall be in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the damned: he said, Depart out of Paradise, ye enemies of each other, you shall inhabit the earth, untill the time appointed; you shall there live and die, and go from the earth to the day of Judgement. O ye children of <hi>Adam</hi>! we bestowed on you vestment of graces, signes of our Omnipotency, peradventure you wil bear it in minde. O ye children of <hi>Adam</hi>! beware lest the devill seduce you, as he did your Father and Mother, when he caused their departure out of Paradise; he dispoyled them of their garments, and made them know their deformity; he shall appear to you, with such as follow them, and you shall see him, when you least think thereon; he protecteth the Infidels: when they commit any fault, they say, we follow the Law of our Fathers, God hath so commanded us. Say unto them, Doth God command you to offend him? Will you speak of God what you know not? he hath appointed you to doe Justice, to worship him, and embrace his Law. Many shall rise again, as you have seen them; some shall be in the right way, others shall be damned, because they have obeyed the devill, and believed they were in the right way. O children of <hi>Adam,</hi> cloath your selves decently, when you shall repaire to the Temples; eat and drink what pleaseth you; be not prodigall, God abhorreth them that spend their wealth unprofitably: Say unto them, who made the prohibition of decent cloathing, when men go to the Temple to worship God? Who hath forbidden to eat of the goods that God hath given you? This is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for true believers. God shall so expound his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements at the day of Judgement. Say unto them, God hath forbidden you whoredome, private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, disobedience, injustice, desire to adore any other god but him, and to speake of his divine Majesty what you know not: every one hath his predestination, and none can advance or retard it. O ye children of <hi>Adam,</hi> did not the Prophets teach you my Commandements?

When <hi>Moses</hi> returned, he said to them, whom did ye obey after my departure? You were too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to worship that Idol; he in displeasure cast against the ground the Tables that God had given him, took his brother by the head, and dragging him to him, said Son of my mother, how hast thou governed this people?

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that your Lord heard you, when you of him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored succors, and that he assisted you with a thousand of his Angels sent from Heaven; God sent you this aide, only to let you know his grace, and to confirme your hearts; victory proceedeth from God, he is omnipotent, and most prudent: Remember that God covered you with a secure sleep, and caused water to descend from Heaven, to wash, purifie, and deliver you from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Devill.

God hath said to his Angels, I will be with you, confirme the steps of the True-believers; I will cast feare into the heart of the wicked, strike them on the head, smite them on the fingers, and feet, because they have contradicted my will, and that of the Prophet.

There be <hi>Arabians</hi> about you, and in <hi>Medina,</hi> they affect impietie; you know them not, but I know them all, I will chastise them twice on earth, (to wit, through ignominie and death) and they shall feele in the other world exceeding great torments. Others there bee, that confesse their sinnes, and who doe good and evill works; peradventure God will pardon them, hee is altogether gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull; take of their substance for almes, thou shalt render

them righteous and shalt purifie them, pray for them, thy prayers shall procure them the mercy of God, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth and knoweth all things. Know they not, that God accepteth the conversion of his Creatures, that their almes are pleasing to him, and that he is gracious and mercifull? Say unto them, doe what shall please you; God, his Prophet, and the True-believers shall see what you do, you shall one day appear before him, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the present, past, and future; he shall make you to know whatsoever ye have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shall chastise you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your demerits. There be others that attend the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, either his grace, or his wrath, his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or his mercy, God understandeth what is in their soules, and is most wise. They that esteemed, that the Temple built by unbelievers, to seduce the righteous, to distinguish the wicked from the good, and to observe such as had before fought against God, and against his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, is the Temple of his divine Majestie, sweare that they desire to do well, and that their intention is most honest, but they are lyars, and God shall be witnesse of their falshood; make not thy prayers in that Temple, make the prayers in the Temple founded on the fear of God, that is reasonable; there be persons in that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who desire to be purified, God loveth such as have a clean soul; Who is he that buildeth best, he that foundeth his bullding upon the fear of God, or he who layeth the foundation of his building upon the brink of a ditch of sand, which falleth, and ruineth it self? They who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem the Temple built by unbelievers, to seduce the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be the Temple of God, shall be with that Temple, and with the Infidels that built it, burnt in the fire of Hell; God guideth not the unjust, their building shall serve only to torment them, God knoweth their designe, and is most wise; he purchaseth of True-believers their souls and goods; and giveth them Paradise; if they be slain, or if they slay when they shall fight for the faith, they shall have what he hath promised to them in the Old Testament, the Gospel, and in the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> Who better satisfieth what hee hath promised, then

God, Declare to them, that they have made a good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, they have gained the height of felicity. Such as are firme in their faith, who pray, honour, and worship God, who observe his Commandements, and all True-believers, shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, with all manner of content. The Prophet, and True-believers ought not to ask pardon of God for Infidels, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they be their parents, having had knowledge that they are damned, because of their infidelity. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> prayed not for his father, untill he had promised him to adore one God alone; when hee knew his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be an enemie to God, he declared himselfe an enemy to his sin, he ceased praying for him, although he was exceeding charitable, and patient in his afflictions. God misleadeth not them that he hath put into the right way, he giveth them to understand what they ought to doe, he knoweth them that deserve to be seduced, and such as merit to be guided through the right way. The Kingdome of heaven and Earth is Gods, he giveth life and death to whom he seeth good: Who, except God shall protect you? he hath given his grace to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and to such as followed him in his affliction, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it wanted but a little, that the hearts of many of them inclined not to the party of the unbelievers, but he pardoned them; he hath been gracious and mercifull to three persons who deserted the Prophet, and were sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their error, they knew there was no sure refuge, but in God, he pardoned them, when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,<note place="margin">Kiab bin Malik, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. X. The Chapter of <hi>Jonas,</hi> containing an hundred and nine verses, written at <hi>Mecca.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull; I am God the mercifull. The precepts contained in this Book proceed from the Omnipotent: Doth the people wonder that we have inspired a man to preach to the wicked the torments of Hell, and to declare to True-believers, that they shall finde true what their Lord to them hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? The wicked say, that it is but sorcery and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Certainly God is your Lord, who created Heaven and Earth in six dayes, and sitteth on his Throne, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all things; no man intercedeth for his Neighbour without his permission; he is your God and your Lord, worship him alone, will ye not consider it? you all shall be one day assembled before him; he promised with truth, that he will cause men to die, and raise them again, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence such as have believed in his Law, and done good works: The unbelievers shall drink a boyling drink, and shall endure great torments, because of their impiety. He it is that gave light to the Sun, and brightness to the Moon, that created the signes to know the number of years, the account of moneths, and of whatsoever he hath created, these things teach with truth, the miracles of his divine Majesty, to such as have knowledge to understand them; the difference of day and of night, and what God hath created in Heaven and in Earth, are marks of his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to them that have his fear before their eyes. They who believe there is no resurrection, such as place their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the wealth of this world, they that trust in their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that are ignorant of the commandements of God, shal be precipitated into the fire of Hell, because of their sins, and the True-believers shall be conducted by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty into delicious gardens, wherin flow many ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, they shall there find whatsoever they shall desire, and shal say at the beginning of their prayers, praised be God;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:29476:75"/>
afterwards they shall say, Salvation be to God; and at the end of their prayers, prayse be to God, Lord of the Universe. Although God doth sometimes suddenly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise men, he alwayes attendeth the time of their Destiny. I will leave them that shall not believe in the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in their errors, to their confusion; When man is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, he invoketh us standing, sitting, lying, and in all postures, and when we have delivered him from his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he persisteth in his wickedness. It seemeth good to the wicked to do in this manner, we destroyed their Predecessors when they believed not in the Prophets, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obeyed the precepts that we sent them, and have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished you on the Earth in their place after them, to see your deportments. When thou teachest our commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them that believe not in the Resurrection; they say, that the precepts of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> are altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what thou preachest, and that thou hast altered them; Say unto them, I have no will to alter them of my selfe, I do but what is inspired into me of God, I fear to be punished at the day of Judgement, should I disobey his divine Majesty; Say unto them, Had it pleased God, I had neither read, nor taught you his Commandements, I sojourned a long time with you, before I taught you, will you not learn them? Who is more unjust then hee that blasphemeth? God doth not aid the Infidels that worship what can neither benefit nor hurt them, and say, their Idols shall intercede for them; will you instruct God in any thing that he knoweth not, of what is in Heaven or in Earth? Praised be God, he hath no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Men were all of one Religion before Infidelity took place, and if God had not said that he would deferre the punishment of the wicked untill the day of Judgement, he had already destroyed them in this world, because of their impiety; They say, We will not believe in the Prophet, if God make not some miracles to appear in him; Say unto them, God knoweth what shall be; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, I will expect with you: when we gave them to taste of content after their affliction, they had subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon our Commandements: Say unto them, God is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29476:76"/>
more subtile then you, his Messengers shall write your subtilties; he it is that made men to travell upon the earth and sea; It is he that sendeth them a favourable winde to rejoyce them in their ships; when tempest surpriseth them, they believe that the waves will overwhelm them, then they invoke God, with desire to embrace his Law, and say, if God doth deliver us from this danger, wee will believe in his Unity, and return him thanks for this mercy; and being delivered from perill, persist in their wickedness. O people! you draw mischief on your selves, you require nothing but the wealth of this world, you all shall appear before us to be judged according to your works; the life of the world is like to the rain, which we cause to descend from Heaven, it causeth with mixture all sorts of herbage to spring forth, for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of men, and beasts. When the Earth is adorned with flowers, and enriched with its fruits, the Inhabitants oftentimes believe they have the power to cause their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; then send we our chastisements day and night upon the Earth, and render it as mown, and as if the day before it had brought no fruit. Thus do I discover my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries to such as have knowledge to comprehend them. They beg their salvation of God; he saveth and putteth in the way of salvation whom it pleaseth him. He shall not cover the visage of them that have done good works, they shall appear without shame, and dwell in Paradise; where they shall remain eternally; and such as shall have done evill shall be punished after their demerits, they shall be covered with shame, and none shall be able to protect them, they shall be as if a great part of the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the night had covered their countenance, they shall be condemned to the fire of hell, where they shall dwell eternally. Think on the day, wherein we will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble all the world, and will say to the Infidels, hell shall be your habitation; where be the Idols you ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? we have separated you from each other. Their Idols shall say to them, you have not worshipped us, God is witness; was there any thing between us and you, that rendred us ignorant of your adorations? That day shall
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29476:76"/>
every one see what he hath done, and know that God is Truth it self; their Idols shall be separated farre from them, and they shall understand their blasphemies. Say unto them, who enricheth you with the wealth of heaven and earth? Who causeth life to come out of death, and death out of life? Who disposeth all things in the world? They shall answer, it is God: Say unto them, why have you not therefore his fear before your eyes? God is indeed your Lord, what is there after the Truth, but falshood? How will you depart from his Law? his Word shal be accomplished against Infidels. Say unto them, Have your Idols the power to cause men to die, and to rise again; how shall they be able to blaspheme after these reasons? Say unto them, Are your Idols able to conduct you into the right way? God guideth the people into the way of Salvation; who ought rather to be followed, he that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the people into the right way, or he that misleadeth them? What reason have ye to follow the evill way; The greatest part of them follow but their own opinion, but their opinion is not conformable to the Truth; God knoweth all their actions, there is no falshood in the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> it confirmeth the ancient Scriptures, and perspicuously explaineth them; there is no doubt, but it proceedeth from the Lord of the Universe. They say <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath invented this Book; say unto them, come and bring any thing that resembleth it in Doctrine and Eloquence, and call the Idols which ye adore, we shall see if you are sincere; on the contrary, they have blasphemed, and have talked of what they understood not, when they heard the exposition of the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> Thus did their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours; but consider what is the end of the unjust; There be among them, who will believe in this Book, and others that will not believe; Thy Lord knoweth them that defile the earth; if they slander thee, say unto them, I will answer with my actions, and yee shall answer with yours, yee are innocent of what I act, and I am innocent of what yee doe. There be persons among them that have inclination to heare thee, but art thou able to cause the deafe to heare?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29476:77"/>
Should they not be deafe, they would learn nothing; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there be, who look towards thee, but art thou able to guide the blind? should they see clearly, they would not follow the right way; God doth no injustice to men, they doe injury to themselves, through the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their offences. I will cause them to rise again at the day of Judgement, as if they had remained but one houre of a day in the grave; they shall know each other, and the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Say unto them, I, of my selfe, can neither procure good nor evill, if God doth not permit it; every one hath his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny, when the time of their destiny arriveth, they can neither retard, or advance it one hour. Have ye conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the punishment which God heretofore sent, by day, and by night against the wicked? When ye felt it, ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, and fell into it headlong. It shall be said to the wicked at the day of Judgement, tast eternall torments; shall you not be punished according to your demerits? They will ask of thee, if the pains denounced against the wicked, and if the Resurrection be matters of truth? Say unto them, yes, my Lord is most exact in his words, and all the treasures of the world shall not be able to redeem one soul. They shal repent of their sins, when they shall feel the punishment of their offences, but shal be condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injustice; whatsoever is in heaven and in earth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to God, he is exact in his promise, yet the greatest part of the world do not know him. He it is who causeth to die, and giveth life, and shall assemble men at the day of Judgement. O people! God hath sent you instructions, and remedies for your infirmities; he hath sent a guide to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29476:77"/>
conduct true-believers into the way of his mercy; it shall be to them of more advantage, then the treasures that they accumulate: Have ye considered the good things which he hath created for you? Ye have appointed one part to be eaten, and have prohibited to eate of another: Hath God permitted you to blaspheme against him? The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of such as blaspheme against God, shall be but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery at the day of Judgement; God is full of goodnesse for the people, but most of them are ingratefull. In whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever place thou art, whether thou teach what is contained in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> or whether thou labour, I am alwayes present, nothing is concealed from thy Lord, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in heaven and earth; be it great or litle, all is written in the intelligible Booke, that explaineth all things. There needeth no feare for such as recommend themselves to God, they shall be exempt from the pains of hell. The true-believers who have his feare before their eyes, shall suffer no torments in the other world; it is declared to them on earth, that they shall have all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the word of God admits of no alteration; they shall enjoy perfection of felicity in Paradise. Afflict not thy self for the words of the impious, vertue proceedeth from God, he understandeth, and knoweth all things; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in heaven and in earth appertaineth to him: They who worship Idols, follow but their opinion, and are lyars; God hath created the night for repose, and the day for labour; such as heare his Word, find therein marks of his omnipotency. They have said, doe ye believe that God hath a Son? Praised be God, he is most rich, and hath no need of any person, he possesseth whatsoever is in heaven, and earth; you have no reason in what ye alledge; will you speak of God what ye know not? God doth not aide in this world them that blaspheme against him, he shall cause them to feele after their death great torments, because of their impiety: Instruct them in the History of <hi>Noah,</hi> how he spake to his people, and said, O people! if my abode with you, &amp; the preaching of the Commandments of God, be irksom to you, know, that all my support is in God; assemble your Doctors, with your Idols, &amp; conceal not what
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:29476:78"/>
ye doe; goe whither you will, ye shall find none to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you; if ye contemne my instructions, I require not of you a reward for my pains; I desire to receive of none other then God the Omnipotent, and recommend my self to the Mill of his divine Majesty. They slandered <hi>Noah,</hi> then did we save him in the Arke, and them that were with him; we prolonged their posterity on earth, and drowned the wicked; consider the end of such as heard the word of God, and contemned it. We sent to them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets after <hi>Noah,</hi> they made them to see miracles, and gave them most salutary instructions; but they did not believe in what they had no will before to believe. Thus I harden the heart of the wicked. We after them, sent <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his subjects, without miracles, they arose against our Commandements, when the truth was preached to them, and said, it was but Magick and enchantment. <hi>Moses</hi> said to them, will you say that the Truth is Sorcery? God doth not assist Magicians and Sorcerers; they said, Art thou, with thy brother, come to divert us from the Religion of our Fathers, and to be esteemed on earth? We will believe in thy words. Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> commanded to summon the most skilfull of his Magicians; they being assembled, <hi>Moses</hi> said to them, cast downe what yee have a will to cast downe on the ground; having cast downe their cords and staves, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> said to them, know ye none other thing but Magick? God shall render it vaine, and unprofitable; he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth such as defile the earth, he confirmeth the Truth through his Word, although it be against the will of the wicked. Few men believed in <hi>Moses,</hi> because of their feare to displease <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and his Ministers. <hi>Pharoah</hi> was powerfull on earth, and in the number of the wicked. <hi>Moses</hi> said, O people! if ye believe in God, resign your selves to his will; they answered, All our confidence is in God; Lord, doe not thou abandon us to the malice of the unjust: deliver us through thy mercy from the hands of Infidels. We inspired <hi>Moses</hi> and his brother to dwell some time in <hi>Egypt</hi> with their people, and to make Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories in their houses, therein to make their prayers, and

We gave passage through the sea to the children of <hi>Israel; Pharoah</hi> pursued them with hatred and envy, untill his people were drowned. Then said <hi>Pharoah,</hi> I believe there is none other God, but the God of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and I wholly recommend my self to his Will. Thou dost now believe in God, O <hi>Pharoah</hi>! and wert before disobedient to his Commandements, filling the earth with thy enormities, I have delivered thee from this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, that thou maist be an example to posterity; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among the people are ignorant of my omnipotency. We gave the Children of Israell to dwell in places full of delights, and enriched them with the good things of the Earth, they knew the differences that arose among them touching Religion, thy Lord shall judge them at the day of Judgement. If thou doubtest what we have taught thee, repaire to them that have read the Scripture before thee; what thy Lord hath taught thee is most true; be not thou of them that doubt, neither of such as derogate from the Commandements of God, thou shalt be in the number of the wretched. Those whom God will chastise, shall not believe in his divine Majesty, should they behold all the miracles of the world, untill they see the torments of Hell. The faith is exceeding profitable to the Cities that have received it; when the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Jonas</hi> embraced it, we delivered them from our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we delivered them from ignominy, and enriched them, untill the time appointed; if it pleased thy Lord, all the world should believe in him; wilt thou abhorre the people untill they believe in God?

and Earth, miracles and preaching are of no use to such as will not believe; shall they expect what their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors expected? Say unto them, expect, I will expect with you. I will deliver my Prophets, and the True-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, from the torments of Hell, it is reasonable that I deliver them that obey my Commandements. Oh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! who causeth you to doubt of the Law which I teach you? I will not worship the Idols that you adore, I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship one God alone, who shall cause you all to dye; I will embrace his Law, it commandeth to professe his Unity, I am not of them that say, he hath a companion equall to him. Adore not what can neither benefit nor hurt thee, if thou doe it, thou shalt be in the number of the unjust. If God will afflict thee, none can deliver thee from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; if God will doe good to thee, none can deprive thee of his grace, he hath given it to whom seemeth good to himself, he is gracious and mercifull. Oh people! God teacheth you the truth; whosoever shall follow the right way, shall save his soule, and whosoever shall go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray, shall destroy it. I am not your Tutor, I do but what is inspired into me; I have patience in my perseverance, I wil expect the Judgement of God, there is no better Judge then he.</p>

               <p>IN the name of God gracious and mercifull. I am the mercifull God. The signs contained in this Booke are most true, they proceed from the most wise, who knoweth all things. Worship ye but one God alone, I preach to you from him the torments of Hell, and declare the joyes of Paradise, that ye may implore pardon of his divine Majesty, and be converted; he shall give you an happy life in the world, untill the time appointed, and shall reward every one according to his works. I feare, lest you should be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29476:79"/>
chastised at the day of Judgement; if you forsake the right way, you all shall be assembled before God to be judged. The heart of the impious inclined to hatred of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and they would have concealed themselves for some time from God; they are covered with their garments, that they may not be knowne, but God knoweth what is in their soules, he understandeth whatsoever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale, and whatsoever they make manifest. All the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the world live of his grace, he knoweth the place of their repaire, and the place where they must dye, all is written in an intelligible booke, that explaineth all things. He it is that created Heaven and Earth in six days,<note place="margin">See <hi>Kitab el tenoir.</hi>
                  </note> his Throne was before upon the waters, (the <hi>Alcoran</hi>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth you to wel-doing. If thou saist to the wicked, that they shall rise againe after their death, they will say, it is but witchcraft and sorcery; if retard some time to chastise them, they say, there is no punishment for their crimes; but they shall not avoid it, in the day when it shall appeare, and they shall feel the rigour of the paines which they contemne. If we conferre riches, and health on the impious, and deprive them of them, they dispaire in their impiety; if we give them good after their evill, they say, misery hath forsaken them, they rejoyce, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come arrogant. Such as are humble and patient in their afflictions, and doe good works, shall obtaine pardon of their sinnes, and a very great reward. Perhaps thou wilt forget to teach something of what I have inspired into thee, and be afflicted, because they say that what thou speakest shall bring thee no profit. Certainly, thou art sent only to reprove them of their sin, thy Lord is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and shall chastise them after their demerits. Assuredly, they will say, thou hast <note n="*" place="margin">Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve supra.</note> forged the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and that it is of thy invention; Say unto them, come and bring with you ten Chapters of your invention, like to the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in instruction and Eloquence, and call to your aid the Idols that ye adore; if you be righteous, if they hear not your prayers, neither afford you succors, know then, that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> descended from Heaven, through Gods permission, &amp; that there is but one sole God, wil yet not trust in him? I wil
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29476:80"/>
bestow the riches and honours of the Earth, on many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that affect them, and in the end they shall be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the fire of Hell, and the good works that they shall doe in this world, shall be unprofitable in the other. They who observe what God hath ordained, study the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and believe that it proceedeth from his divine Majesty, to teach the right way, and to obtain his mercy, as before it, was the book of <hi>Moses.</hi> Such as shall believe in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> shall be happy, doubtlesse the fire of Hell is prepared for the Infidels who will not believe therein, but the greatest part of the world is incredulous: who is more impious then they that blaspheme against God? Such men shall not see his face; the Angels shall say, at the day of Judgement, behold them that have been impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a curse is upon them, and upon the unjust that have mislead the people from the right way, they were indeed Infidels. Such men shall not escape the punishment of their crimes on Earth, they shall find none that is able to protect them but God, he shall augment their paines, because they would not abandon their wickednesse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive the light of faith. Such are miserable men, their Idols shall not afford them succors, they doubtlesse shall be eternally damned: and such as shall believe in God, doe good works, and be converted, shall dwell for ever in Paradise. The wicked are as deaf, and blind, and the True believers are like those who have good sight and perfect hearing; shall they be in paralell to each other? will ye never consider it? We sent <hi>Noah</hi> to reprove men for their sinnes, he said to them, worship but one God alone, otherwise I feare ye shall be chastised at the day of Judgement; The Doctors of the Infidels answered him, we see thee to be a man, like us, and that such as follow thee are poore people, blind, and without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell; we perceive not that thou hast any grace, that ought to preferre thee to us; contrariwise, we believe thee to be a lyar; he said, oh people! know ye not that God hath taught me what I preach to you, that he hath given me the grace of Prophecie, and deprived you of it? shall I exhort you to acknowledge his grace, seeing ye abhorre

him? Oh people! I require no recompense of you for my paines, God will reward me largely. I desire not to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish True-believers from my company, they shall one day appeare before their Lord, but I perceive that ye are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. Oh people! who shall hinder God to punish me, if I abuse True-believers? Will ye not consider it? I say not that I possesse the treasures of God, I know not what shall be; I say not that I am an Angell, I say not to them whom you contemne, that God shall enrich them, God knoweth what is in their souls; should I maintaine such discourse, I should have great blame. They said, oh <hi>Noah</hi>! we have a long time disputed together; if thou art sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, let us see the paines which thou preachest to us; God, said he, when it shall please him, shall cause you to see them, you shall not escape them, my instructions shall be to you unprofitable; if God will prove you, he is your Lord, and you shall one day be assembled before him to be judged. Will the unbelievers say, that thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and that it is of thine invention? Say unto them, if I have invented it, sinne will be upon me, and I am innocent of your blasphemies, God inspired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Noah,</hi> that none should believe in his words, but such as had already believed in him: He said unto him, build an Arke conformable to the inspiration that we have sent thee, but speak no more to me of the unjust, they shall be drowned; the passengers derided him and his Arke; he said to them, ye scoffe at me, I will laugh at you, and we shall see them that shall best understand; he whom God shall chastise, shall be covered with shame, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually tormented. When our will was to destroy that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the light of the morning appeared, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter boyled in <hi>Noah's</hi> pot, we commanded him to charge his Arke with two beasts of every kind and Species; all creatures were destroyed, except those, of which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made mention, as well such as believed, as them that did not believe, and that but a few: <hi>Noah</hi> said unto them, ascend the Arke in the name of God, who shall cause it to swimme, and to anchor; the Lord is gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull towards us. When the Arke began to flote, like to

God said, oh <hi>Noah</hi>! descend from the Arke with Salvation, and blessing upon thee, and upon a part of them that are with thee; I will enrich the other part with the wealth of this world, to punish them most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely at the day of Judgement. I teach what shall be, what neither thou, nor thy people have not yet knowne; be patient in thine afflictions, Paradise is for them that have my feare before their eyes.

Such chastisement is not far from the Infidels (that are in <hi>Mecca</hi>) We sent <hi>Chaib</hi> into the Country of <hi>Madian,</hi>

I am not sent to be your Tutor, but only to declare the word of God: they said, O <hi>Chaib,</hi> doth thy Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne us to abandon the gods of our Fathers, and hinder us to make of our goods what shall seeme good to us? thou art not of an humour good enough to be our Director. He said, O people! see ye not that God hath taught me what I preach? He hath given me wealth for subsistance: I contradict you in nothing but what is forbidden you, I will doe nothing but what is reasonable, and conform the most I shal be able to Justice; my whole support is in God, I recommend my selfe to the will of his divine Majesty, before which I must one day appeare. O people! take heed least ye become criminall, if ye forsake the company of the righteous, and lest that befall you, that hapned to them who would not believe <hi>Noah, Hod, Salhe,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi>; the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of God is not far from you, beg pardon of him.

and be converted, he is mercifull and amiable. They said, O <hi>Chaib</hi>! we understand not all that thou sayest; we see thee amongst us without force and power; wert thou not accompanied, we would stone thee; thou shalt have no dominion over us. He said, O people! esteeme ye my company, and feare ye it more then God? Have ye tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the back towards him? He knoweth all your actions, live after your own manner, I will live after mine, you shall hereafter know your error; he whom God will cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise, shall remaine in perpetuall misery, you shall soon understand who shall be the lyar, you or I; expect the issue, I will expect with you: when we commanded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them, we (through our especiall grace) preserved <hi>Chaib,</hi> and the true-believers that were with him; thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der surprized those wicked ones, and they in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning remained dead, extended as carkases in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

and so long as it shall please God, who doth as see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good to himself.

Doubt not what the unbelievers worship, they adore but the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols which their Fathers worshipped; assuredly I will chastise them as their Fathers were chastised. <hi>Moses</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the old Testament, yet did the wicked contradict his Precepts; had not God said that he will not punish them, untill the day of Judgement, he had already destroyed them, because they are in an exceeding great error; thy Lord shall reward every one according to his works, he knoweth all their actions. Observe exactly what hath been commanded you, with them that are converted; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse not the Law of God, he beholdeth whatsoever you doe. Incline not to the affections of the unjust, lest the fire of hell surprise you, and you be deprived of protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Pray to God evening and morning, and a part of the night; prayers blot out sins; it is the doctrine of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; be patient, and persevere, God will not deprive the righteous of their reward: He prohibited your Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors and their posterity to defile the earth; neverthelesse there were few among them that abstained; the unjust acted what ever pleased them, and were guilty before God: He shall not destroy <hi>Mecca,</hi> if the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of obey his Commandements; and if it pleased him, the whole world should be of one Religion, they to whom he giveth his grace, transgresse not his Will, his Word shall be accomplished, and hell shall be filled with devills, and the wicked of all Nations. They have recounted to thee, and thou understandest whatsoever things are necessary for them, and what the Prophets have heretofore taught; thine heart hath been strengthened, they containe the truth, and they shall be for a lesson to true believers. Say unto Infidels, doc, on your part as ye shall understand, we will doe on our part as we understand, and attend the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, we will attend it with you; whatsoever is in heaven, and in earth appertains to God, all men shall be assembled before him, worship him, resign your selves to his Will, he knoweth whatsoever the people doth.</p>

We have caused to discend from heaven the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue, peradventure yee will learne it. I deliver unto thee in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> one of the best things that I have inspired into thee. Thou were before the comming thereof, in the number of the ignorant. Remember thou, that <hi>Joseph</hi> said to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, My father, I saw in a dreame eleven Stars, the Sunne, and the Moone, I saw them adoring me. My sonne, said his father, discover not thy dreame to thy brothers, they will conspire against thee, the devill is an open enemy to men, thou shalt be elected of the Lord in this world, he shall teach thee the explication of Dreams, he shall accomplish his grace upon thee, and upon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as he did accomplish it upon thy fathers, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi>; the Lord knoweth all things, and is most wise. The History of <hi>Ioseph</hi> shall serve for example to posterity; remember thou, how his brothers said, our father loveth our brother <hi>Ioseph</hi> more then all us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is in an exceeding great error, let us kill <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and cast him into some secret place remote from us, his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence will render the face of our father more gentle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; after his death we will be converted. One of them said, you shall not doe well to kill him but cast him into the well, some passengers will take him, and carry him into an unknowne Countrie: They said to their Father, Father, wherefore doest thou not send <hi>Ioseph</hi> into the Fields with us?

him; dost thou feare (said they) that a wolf should de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>voure him in our presence, and that we want strength to defend him? In the morning they led him with them, and cast him into a Well. We inspired him to prophesie to them what should befall them for the mischief they acted, but they wanted knowledge to comprehend it; they in the evening returned to their fathers house, with eyes full of dissembled teares, and said unto him, father, we sported, and ran who should run the best, <hi>Ioseph</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with our baggage, a wolf came that devoured him; thou wilt not believe us although we speak the truth; then they shewed him his shirt, which they had sprinkled with blood; it is you that hath done it, said he, you shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it before God, he is my protector, and was patient, without lamenting. There past that day <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantins</hi> well; a <hi>Caravan,</hi> a number of persons travelling together.</note> a <hi>Caravan</hi> near to that Well, who desiring to draw water to drink, let downe a bucket, on which <hi>Ioseph</hi> took hold to get out; they gave him cloathes, led him away secretly, and sold him at a good rate for ready money; they would not kill him, in which they were honest men. He that bought him in <hi>Egypt</hi> commanded his wife to have care of him, that he might one day be usefull for their service, and be to them instead of a son. Thus did we establish <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and taught him the exposition of dreams, thy Lord is Omnipotent, but few men know him: when <hi>Ioseph</hi> came to the age of manhood, we gave him knowledge and prudence; thus doe we reward the righteous. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters wife became amorous of his beauty, she one day shut him into her chamber, and solicited him with love; God defend me (said he) to betray my Master, and be unchaste (he was in the number of the righteous) and fled to the door; his Mistrisse ran after him, and to stay him, tore his shirt through the back: she met her husband behind the door, to whom she said, what other thing doth he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who would dishonour thine house, then to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and severely chastised? Lord, said <hi>Ioseph</hi> she sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited me, that infant which is in the cradle, and of thy parentage shall be witnesse: Then the infant in the cradle said, if <hi>Iosephs</hi> shirt be torne before, she hath spoken

The women of the City, said among themselves, that the rich mans wife was amorous of his Slave, and that she had sollicited his love, and had erred from the right way, which she understanding, made them an exceeding fair feast, and caused <hi>Ioseph</hi> to enter the Parlour where they sate; while they carved their meat, they were so surprised, and entangled with <hi>Iosephs</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they instead of carving their meat, cut their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. O God! said they, this is not a man, but an Angel; then said she unto them, behold him whom I loved with so much passion: she another time importuned him, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her desire, and perceiving that he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to her will, menaced him with the prison, and to make him miserable: O God! said <hi>Ioseph,</hi> I had rather be a prisoner, then do what she desireth, deliver me from her malice, defend me from inclining to her lubricity, and from being in the number of the wicked: his Lord heard his prayer, he understandeth and knoweth all things. This woman seeing <hi>Iosephs</hi> resolution, judged it requisite to imprison him for some time; he was put pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner with two men, one of which told him that he had dreamed that he prest grapes to make wine; the other said, that he dream'd that he caried bread upon his head, which the birds did eat, they demanded of him the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their dreams, because he seemed to them to be a good man: he said to them before ye break fast, I wil inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret your dreams. I wil first tell you what God hath taught me, and how I quit, &amp; abandon the law of Infidels, &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Law of our fathers, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> we ought not worship many gods; such as believe in the unity of God, are endued with his grace, but few men give him thanks. O Prisoners! who hath more power, Idols, or one sole God, who is omnipotent? The gods which ye adore are

O prisoners! the one of you shall give wine to drink to his Master, the other shall be hanged, the birds shall feed on his head, the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that ye have required shall be accomplished. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him that should be saved, to remember him when he should be neer to his Master; but the devill caused him to lose the remembrance of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who remained prisoner, the space of nine years: At that time the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> saw in a dream seven fat kine, which seven lean kine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; and seven green eares of corn, with seven drie eares, of which he required the interpretation of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; they answered, that the dream was very obscure, and that they knew not the interpretation; the prisoner that had been set at liberty, said, that he would forthwith give the interpretation of the dream, remembred <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and calling him unto him, said, O righteous man! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain unto us what is the signification of seven fat kine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by seven leane, and seven green eares of corn, and as many dry, peradventure I shall return to the King and his people, and they shall understand the interpretation of this dream. <hi>Ioseph</hi> said to him, yee shall sow the earth seven years following, which shall abound in fruits, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your Harvest in the ears, and take only what shall be necessary for life; after this, there shall come seven years barren, and unfruitfull, in which the people shall suffer much. The King of <hi>Egypt</hi> having learned the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this dream, commanded to call <hi>Ioseph</hi>; the Messenger said unto him, O <hi>Ioseph</hi>! return to thy Master, and require of him the meaning of the women who did cut their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he hath knowledge of their malice, hath caused them to assemble, and demanded of them what was their designe, when they solicited thee with love; they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, they knew no sinne in thee, and his wife confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the truth, saying, she had importuned thee, but that thou art a very just man. <hi>Ioseph</hi> answered, by this it appears
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29476:86"/>
that I am no traitor to my Master in his absence, God gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not traitors; I will not say I am a man without sin, the spirit of man inclineth to evill, except such to whom God hath given his particular grace, he is gracious and mercifull to whom seemeth good to him. The King having talked with <hi>Joseph,</hi> entred him into the number of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks, and made him superintendent of his <note n="*" place="margin">All the revenues of the Crown.</note> revenews, because he knew him to be a man of spirit, faithfull, and thrifty. We, by our speciall grace, establish <hi>Joseph</hi> in the Country of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he did what seemeth good to him. I deprive not the righteous of their reward on earth, the recompence of the other world is yet greater for them that believe in my Law, and have my fear before their eyes. The brethren of <hi>Joseph</hi> returned to buy corn; he said to them, when ye shall come again, bring with you your yong brother by the father, you shall find I will make you good measure, and lodge well my guests; if you bring him not, there shall be no corn for you, approach not this kingdom without him: They answered, Lord, his father loveth him exceedingly, nevertheless we shall endeavour to perform what thou enjoynest us; he commanded his servants to put their money for corn in the bottoms of his brethrens sacks, perhaps said he, they will return, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this favour when they shall come into their Country. When they arrived at their father, they said, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is no more corn for us, if our young brother go not with us, if he go thither we shall have good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and we will be carefull of him. You will be carefull, said he, as you were heretofore of your brother <hi>Joseph</hi>; God wil defend him better then you, he the merciful of the mercifull. When they poured forth their corn, they found their money at the bottomes of their sacks, and said, our father, what shall we desire more, our money is restored to us, and we have bread for our family, permit that our brother go with us, we shall have better measure, that is a small thing to the King of <hi>Egypt</hi>; I will not send him with you, unlesse ye all sweare before God to bring him back again, if there be no great impediment. They swore to fulfill his will; then said he, I take God to be witness of

The Cup was found in the sack of his young brother; he caused him to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and accused them all of theft; Lord, said they, his father is old, he will be extreamly afflicted for his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, take one of us in his place, thou shalt in the end find us to be honest men: God forbid, said he, that I should detain other then him who was found guilty of theft, that would be injustice; finding themselves out of hope to free their brother, they saved themselves in a secret place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the City; where the eldest said to his brethren, you know the oath we took at our departure, and how heretofore we intreated <hi>Joseph,</hi> I will not go out of <hi>Egypt</hi> without my fathers permission, God is most just, he shall dispose of me and my brother as shall please him, return to your father, and say unto him, thy son was taken in theft, we saw him, and endeavoured to our power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him, they of the <hi>Caravan</hi> shall be witnesses. <hi>Jacob</hi> said at their return, they were the cause of that accident, that did not displease you; and he took patience, saying, God perhaps will favour my sons to return in health; he knoweth in what condition I am, he is most prudent in what he ordaineth. He retired from among his sons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly afflicted, and bewayled the losse of his son <hi>Joseph</hi>; had his eyes continually covered with tears, and he bore

When they came unto <hi>Ioseph,</hi> they said unto him, The famine that is in our Country, hath extreamly afflicted us, it hath often constrained us to come to buy Corn; thou, of thy favour, hast made us good measure; thou hast caused our money to be restored for alms, God will reward thee, he recompenceth such as are Alms-givers. He said unto them, Ye remember what ye did unto your brother <hi>Ioseph:</hi> They replyed, Certainly thou art not <hi>Ioseph.</hi> I am <hi>Ioseph,</hi> said he, and behold my brother <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin.</hi> God hath given us his grace; he rewardeth him that hath his fear before his eyes, and is patient in his afflictions; he depriveth not the righteous of recompence. God, said they, hath poured his favours upon us in saving thee, whom we have exceedingly offended. Be not (said he) ashamed, God this day pardoneth you that sinne, he is gracious and mercifull; return to your Father, and bear to him this shirt, cast it upon his face, hee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover sight, and return hither with him, and with your whole family. The <hi>Caravan</hi> was then halfe way upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, when <hi>Iacob</hi> said to them that attended him, I smell the odor of my sonne <hi>Ioseph</hi>; you deride me, but what I speak is most true: They told him, that he was still in his old error; some dayes following, one of his sonnes arrived with tidings of <hi>Ioseph</hi>; and cast the shirt that he had given him, upon him; and incontinently he recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his sight, and said, Did I not alwayes tell you, that I knew what ye knew not; they said, Our Father pardon us, and ask the forgiveness of God for us, who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly offended him: He answered, I will beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God for you, he is gracious and mercifull.

We sent aforetime none but men to instruct the people, will not men consider what hath been the end of the wicked that were before them? Paradise is for them that are righteous; will yee not be converted? They caused the Prophets to lose all hopes of their Conversion, and believed them to be lyars; but we protected them, and delivered from their malice such as seemed good to us. nothing shall exempt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked from the punishment of their pains; they shall serve for example to men of spirit.

               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull; I am the most wise and mercifull God. These precepts are the precepts of the Book sent to thee from the Lord; it is a thing most true, but few men incline to believe it. It is sent from God, who raised Heaven without a prop, and with a column, that appeareth, and sitteth on his throne, disposing all things. He causeth the Sunne and Moon to move, until the day appointed; he disposeth all things at his will, and manifesteth to men the signes of his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency. Peradventure you will believe in the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the flesh. He it is that hath extendeth the Earth, raised the Mountains, caused the Rivers to flow, who cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated of all sorts of Fruits, the Male and Female, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the day with the obscurity of the night. These things are signes of his unity to such as consider them. He hath created many fields of divers sorts, and Gardens filled with Grapes, and many different Fruits; he created Date<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troes, thick as Groves, and Forrests, and others that are scattered through the fields; some are moystened with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and others have a more pleasing taste. These things are signes of his unity to such as consider them. Thou art amazed at the lies of Infidels, be astonished at their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; when they deny the Resurrection, and say, What, shall God yet once again create us of the dust of the Earth? when we shall be earth, shall we be a new people? They are impious, they shall have yoaks upon their necks, and shall remain eternally in the fire of Hell; they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate themselves into eternall pains, and contemn the mercy of God, so did their predecessors; but God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to such as convert. Chastise severely the obstinate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. They have said, We will not believe in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, unless we see some miracle to appear. Say unto them, I am not sent but to preach the word of God. He hath sent persons to every Nation, to teach them the right way; nothing is hid from him in the world; he knoweth what
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:29476:88"/>
women bear in their womb; he knoweth the time and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of every thing, the present, past, and future; hee is great and omnipotent.

God hath created all things, and is omnipotent, he causeth rain to descend from Heaven, and Rivers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Foam, to flow in the Valleys. The Gold, the Silver, and Mettals which ye melt to adorn and enrich your selves, are like unto froth.

               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull; I am the mercifull God. That Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have sent it to thee to bring the people out of darkness, to guide them to the light, and the way of thy Lord, alwayes victorious and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; Whatsoever is in Heaven, and in Earth, is Gods; misery is upon unbelievers, they shall undergoe at the end of the world exceeding great torments. They who preferre the wealth of this world to that of Heaven, who goe astray from the way of the Law, and would pervert it, are in a great error, far from truth; The Prophets spake the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of them to whom they were sent to instruct them, God guideth and misleadeth whom to him seemeth good, he is omnipotent and prudent. We sent <hi>Moses</hi> with prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, to bring the children of Israel out of darkness, and to conduct them to light, he taught them the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law, to serve for instruction to such as shall persevere to do well, and shall not be ingratefull for the favours they have received. <hi>Moses</hi> spake to his people, and said, remember the grace of God towards you, he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you from the men of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who caused you to suffer great afflictions, who murthered your Children, abused your wives, and layed upon you great evills (sent from God, because of your sins.) The Lord hath said, if ye be not ingratefull, I will augment my graces upon you; if ye be impious, you shall be afflicted. <hi>Moses</hi> said to his people; if you and all men be impious, know that God will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes glorious, and hath no need of you. Know ye not what befell (before you) the people of <hi>Noah, Aad, Temod,</hi> and their posterity, that none had knowledge of but God; because of their great number? He sent them his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements by his Prophets, they bit their fingers for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and said unto them, we renounce, and condemne your Doctrine: The Prophets said unto them, is there any doubt in the beliefe of the unity of God, Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29476:90"/>
and Earth? he calleth you to remit your sinnes, and deferreth your punishment unill the day appointed: They answered, ye are men like unto us, will you hinder us to adore the Gods of our fathers? Produce argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of strength sufficient to prove what you preach; the Prophet replyed, Wee are men as you are, but God giveth his grace to whom seemeth good to him; we are come to you through his permission, the True-believers ought to trust in him; wherefore should wee not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the will of God, who hath guided us in the right way? we will continue in wel-doing, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous trust in his divine Majesty. Then said the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels unto them, we will banish you from our Country, if you be not of our Religion; but God inspired into them, that the Infidels should perish, and that they should inhabit the Land after them; that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect such as should have his fear before their eyes, and fear the pains that are prepared for the wicked. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were protected of God, and the obstinate wicked were destroyed: they shall be precipitated into Hell, and drink of water full of corruption, urine and blood, death shal appear on all sides before their eyes, before they have swallowed that drink; they shall not dye in that misery, they shall suffer yet greater pains. The good works which the wicked have done, are like to dust carryed away by an impetuous winde, they shall be unprofitable to them, and they shall be extirpated, because they depart from the truth: See they not that God hath created Heaven and Earth? that he can destroy them, and create in their place a new people, if it seem good to him? This is not difficult to God, all things are known to him. The more impotent of them that have followed the wicked, shall say at the day of Judgement, we obeyed you, wil you this day deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from the punishment of God? They shall answer, had God guided us in the right way, we had conducted you thither, we are alike miserable with you, we cry and lament in our misery, but finde neither refuge nor prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The Devill shall say unto them, what God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to you is infallible, I foretold it to you, I caused you
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:29476:91"/>
to transgresse his Commandements through my tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I had none other power over you, but to tempt you, you did me no harm, when ye hearkened to me, you drew mischief on your selves, I am not your Tutor, neither are you mine, I was impious, when heretofore I suffered you to adore me; Hell is prepared for you, and for all unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, there shall they endure great torments, and the righteous shall enter into Paradise, wherein flow many rivers, where they shall dwell eternally, with all manner of blessednesse and content; Seest thou not how God speaketh by a parable? A good word is like to a good tree that hath taken root in the Earth, and hath raised its branches to heaven, and produceth its fruit in due time, through the permission of his divine Majesty; hee teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the people his parables, perhaps they will be mindfull: An evill word is like to a bad tree, that hath been torne from the Earth, there is nothing to sustain it, and it is without root, or fruit: God fortifieth the True-believers through his word in this world, and in the other, and causeth the unjust to erre, he doth what to him seemeth good: Seest thou not them that have changed his grace into impiety, and have made such as have followed them to dwell in the house of perdition? They shall abide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in the fire of Hell. They say, that God hath a companion equall to him, and erre from the way of his Law, Say unto them, ye shall have wealth in this world, but Hell is your Rendezvous. Say to the True-believers, who make their prayers at the time appointed, and give aimes in private, or in publike, that the day shall come wherein they shall neither buy nor sell, and where every one shall be recompenced for his works. Say unto them, God hath created the Earth, and the Heavens, he maketh the rain to descend from Heaven, which causeth to spring forth all sorts of fruits to enrich you, he created the ship, that through his permission saileth on the Sea, hee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Rivers, the Sunne and the Moone, which move continually, hee created the day and the night, and bestoweth on you whatsoever yee desire, his favours towards you can neither be numbred, nor recounted,

nevertheless the Inhabitants of <hi>Mecca</hi> are alwayes impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked; <hi>Abraham</hi> said, Lord protect this City, and make it to be the refuge of the world; Keep me and my Children from the worship of Idols, they have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a part of the people; he that shall follow me, and professe thy unity, shall be mine; if any one disobey me, thou art gracious and mercifull: Lord, one part of my Lineage inhabiteth <hi>Mecca,</hi> in a place unfruitfull, give them the grace to persevere in thy service, incline the hearts of men to affect them, enrich them with the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Think not that God is ignorant of the actions of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, he deferreth the punishment of their crimes untill the day that all men shall have their eyes opened: that day shall they behold their sins before their eyes, and their hearts shall be full of desolation; If thou preachest to the people the day of Judgement, hath God (will the wicked say) preserved us to this present time, to do what thou dost appoint us? Say unto them, have ye not sworn heretofore, that there is no resurrection? Ye have dwelt with the unjust, ye have seen how they have been chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and how we have spoken to you in parables. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they conspire, but God knoweth their conspiracy, their policie is to tempt the Prophet, to see if he will make the Mountains to move. Think not that God will violate what hee hath promised to the Prophets, hee is omnipotent, and avengefull. Consider the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Earth and Heavens shall change their face, and all people shall rise again; that day shall one sole God omnipotent, command men to come out of their Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Thou shalt that day see the wicked bound in their chaines, their garments shall be full of pitch,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29476:92"/>
and guitran, their faces shall be covered with fire, that day shall he recompense and chastise every one according to his works, he is exact to keep account; This Book was sent to instruct the people, and teach them that there is but one God; the wise will remember.</p>

true-believers? Such as have knowledge of Gods Commandements, assure that shame shall be upon the foreheads of Infidels, and that the Angels shall cause them to die, because of the enormity of their sins; They will say at the houre of death, that they believe in God, and are penitent for their faults, God knoweth what they have done; he shall command them to enter into hell, where is the abode of the proud: He shall command them who have his feare before their eyes to enter the house of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and the gardens <hi>Eden,</hi> wherein flow many ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, there shall they dwell eternally with the height of their desire. Shall the wicked continue in their sin, untill the Angels cause them to die, or untill the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Thus did their predecessors. God was not unjust towards them, they drew mischief on themselves through their iniquity; they were chastised and felt the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they had despised; they have said, had it so pleased God, our fathers and we had adored him alone; so spake their predecessors. The Prophets are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but to preach and instruct the people. We sent a Prophet to every Nation, to instruct it, and to command the worship of one sole God, and to quit the adoration of <hi>Tagot,</hi> and of Idols; God guided some into the right way, and others were seduced; consider what is the end of the wicked; if thou indeavourest to put them into the right path, thou shalt lose thy time, God guideth not them that desire to erre, they shall be deprived of protection at the day of Judgement; they have sworne by their faith, that God will not make the dead to rise againe, but he shall cause them to rise againe, to chastise them according to his promises; but the greatest part of men doe not know it, did they know it, they would acknowledge their errors, and the impious would acknowledge their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies. When we willed any thing, we said, be thou, and it was! They that depart from the wicked for the love of their Lord, and shall convert themselves, shall be rewarded in this world, and yet more in the other, had they knowledge to understand it.

shall be recompensed when they least think of it. We here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore sent but men to preach our Law; ask of them that have knowledge of the written Law,<note place="margin">The Jewes and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> if it be not true? We have sent to them the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> to the end thou maist in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct men in our Commandements, peradventure they will consider it. The earth shall produce nothing to them, that shall conspire against the Prophet, they shall be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised when they least think of it; God shall afflict them in their commerce, they shall not escape his punishment, and their substance shall diminish by little and little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes; God is gracious and mercifull to them only that honour him: See they not the shadow of that which God hath created, sometimes at the right hand, sometimes at the left, to adore his divine Majesty, they certainly are contemptible; whatsoever is on the earth, and in the heavens, beast, and Angels, worship God with humility, feare their Lord, and obey his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. God hath commanded them to worship and to feare one God, alone, to whom obedience is due, eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; whom will ye feare but God? who but God shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you? when evill befalleth you, you have recourse to his divine goodnesse; being delivered, some of you give him thanks, and yet believe not in his Law: You seek on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the riches of the earth, but you shall see what shall be your end, they say that their wealth proceedeth from their Idols: by God! an account of their blasphemies shall be required of them; they affirme that God hath daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; assuredly they deceive themselves, and are not well satisfied, when it is said to them, that a daughter is born to them; they fly such as declare to them the punishment of their sins, God shall leave them in igmony, and they shall be contemned as the earth which they trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feet; because they believe not in the day of Judgement, misery shall perpetually pursue them; God shall command for ever, and be eternally powerfull and victorious. Should God chastise men when they offend, he should leave no living creature upon the earth, he defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their punishment untill the time appointed, they can neither advance nor retard it; they affirm God to have that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29476:95"/>
which themselves are not satisfied to have; they lye, when they say that paradise is for them, doubtlesse they are er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and shall be precipitated into the fire of hell. By God! we have sent heretofore Prophets to the people, the devill seduced men, and was master of the wicked in this world, but in the other they shall rescent great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: We have sent thee the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> to cleare to men the doubts touching Religion, and to guide true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers into the right way. God sendeth raine from heaven to refresh the earth, this is an evident signe of his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, to them that heare his word; ye have yet a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his omnipotency in the beasts that give you milk, to nourish you, and another marke in the fruits of the earth, in the fruits of Date trees, and the Vines, from which you extract wine, and receive profit. These things are signes of his omnipotency, to such as comprehend them. The Lord inspired the Bee to dwell in the fields, to lodge in trees, in Hives, and to eat of all sorts of fruits, it produceth honey of divers colours, that serveth for a remedy to the diseases of men; these things are signes of Gods omnipotency to them that consider them. God hath created you, and shall cause you to dye; There be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons among you that shall be full of ignominy in their life, to the end they may understand that God is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, conferreth benefits on some more then on others. Slaves have no part in the faculties of their Masters, neither are they associate with them, neverthelesse they associate to God another God equall to him, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme against his grace.) God hath created you men, and women, hath given you Children, and Children to your Children, he hath enriched you with the riches of the earth; Will you after this grace believe in your Idols, which are things inanimate, vaine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable? Will yee bee ingratefull for the benefits of God? Will yee Worship what can neither benefit not hurt you? Believe not that there is another God companion and associate with God; Hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what yee know not, hee teacheth you a Parable: A Slave that is poore cannot give Almes, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:29476:96"/>
he who is rich giveth almes secretly and publiquely, as he seeth good; are they both alike? Ought they to be put in paralell? Praise be to God: Certainly, the greatest part of men know not his graces, he teacheth you a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Behold! two men, the one was borne deaf, and dumb, and given in charge to his Guardian, he knoweth not how to imploy him, he is capable neither of doing, nor spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well, is he like to him that speaketh, that understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, teacheth men Justice, and followeth the right way? Whatsoever is in Heaven, or on Earth appertaineth to God, when he commandeth any thing, it is performed in the twinkling of an eye, yea sooner, he is omnipotent: He it is that causeth you to come out of the wombe of your mother, that giveth you hearing, sight, and sense, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ye will return him thanks; See ye not the birds that flye in the Aire; who sustaineth them but God? It is an evident signe of his omnipotency for the True-believers, he hath given you houses to inhabit, and the skins and furres of beasts to cover you, he hath given you their haire, and wooll, to furnish your houses, and enrich you; he created trees and clouds to overshadow you, made the Mountaines and Caves to cover you from rain, created garments to defend you from the heat of the Sun, and the rigour of cold, he hath accomplished his grace upon you, peradventure you will resigne your selves to the will of his divine Majesty, and professe his Unity. If the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers depart from the way of the Law, thou art obliged only to preach to them intelligibly; they know the grace of God, and contemne it, for that the greatest part of them are impious; preach unto them the day, wherein I will raise againe all the Nations of the world, and the Prophets and Apostles who have preached to them my Commandements, there shall be no excuse for Infidels, neither shall they find protection, or relaxation of their miseries: When they shall behold their Idols, they shall confesse that they were mislead, they shall understand the unity of thy Lord, and that their Idols are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to intercede for them. God hath added to the punishment of Infidels, hath sent them evill upon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29476:96"/>
evill, because they hinder the world to follow his Law: Preach unto them the day, wherein I will cause to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain all the Nations of the world, with the Prophet who preached to them, to be witness of their actions; I will be witness against them of thy Nation; I have sent thee the Book that unfoldeth the mysteries of my Law, to guid the people into the right way, and to declare the joyes of paradise to such as professe my unity. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth you to do only that which is reasonable, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth you to give almes, and do good to your parents, he forbiddeth whordom, disobedience, and injustice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth you to do good, perhaps you will consider it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what ye have promised to God, break not promised faith, ye call God to be witness of your promises, hee knoweth all your actions. Do not like the woman who spun a thred, foulded it, and afterwards entangled it and spoyled it, believe not that there is deceit and error in your Law; If the unbelievers be more in numbers then you, God permitteth it, to prove you; he shall clear to you at the day of Judgement the doubts that be among you; had it so pleased him, you all had observed one and the same Law; he guideth, misleadeth whom it pleaseth him, and will exactly require of you an accompt of your actions. Believe not that there is deceipt in your Law, take heed of stumbling; having once confirmed your steps, ye shall be severely chastised, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When thou shalt read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> implore God to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee from the malice of the Divell, abominable to all the Creatures, he hath no power over them that trust in his divine Majestie, his power extendeth over such as go astray, who obey not him, and adore many Gods.

I know, that they will say that a man hath taught him the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> He whom they presume to have taught him, is a Persian by Nation, and speaketh the Language of the Persians, and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is in the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue, full of instruction and eloquence. They who will not believe in God, shall suffer great torments; such as renounce his Commandements, blaspheme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his divine Majesty; those that reject his Law, after having professed it, shall feel the effect of his wrath, and be punished for preferring the wealth of the earth to the riches of Heaven; God guideth not unbelievers. They in whose hearts he hath imprinted disobedience, those whom he hath deprived of hearing, and sight, are ignorant, they doubtlesse shall be at the end of the world in the number of the damned; he is mercifull to them that convert, and repent to have mislead the people from the right way and persevere in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. Be thou mindfull of the day, wherein man shall dispute against himself, and every one shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to his works without injustice. God teacheth you a Parable; Behold a free and Priviledged City, on the which God poureth his graces on all sides with abundance, and is ingratefull for his benefits; but he sent upon it misery, famine, and feare, because of its ingratitude. God hath sent to the Inhabitants thereof a Prophet of their Nation, they have slandered him, and were chastised, because of their sinne. Eate of what God hath given you, and give him thanks for his grace; if it be he whom ye worship, he forbiddeth you to eat of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, of Bloud, and Swines-flesh, and whatsoever is not slaine in pronouncing the name of God; he will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and mercifull to them who shall eat through ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, without designe to offend him.

The sins of the people and knowne to their Lord; he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the riches of this world to them that desire them, to cause them to fall head-long into Hell, where they shall repent of their iniquities, and be deprived of mercy. He who shall labor to acquire the riches of Heaven, shall be protected of thy Lord in this world, and enriched with the Treasures of Heaven in the other. Consider, how we prefer our Creatures one to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the reward of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is much greater then that of the Earth. Believe not that there be two Gods, otherwise you shall repent of it, and be deprived of protection at the day of judgement. Thy Lord hath ordained to worship him alone, and to honour your father and mother, especially in their old age, and say nothing to them that may afflict them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vex them; speak to them with respect, doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them, pray to God to compassionate them, as they pittied, when they brought you up in your infancy.

Give to your parents what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to them, doe good to the poore, and to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, be not prodigall, the prodigall are brethren of the Devill, ingratefull for the favors of their Lord.

Thy Lord giveth, and taketh away his graces, as seemeth good to him; hee knoweth his people, and understandeth all their actions. Slay not your children for feare of necessity, I will give whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall be necessary for them; the murther of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is an exceeding great sin, flie whoredom, it is a thing uncleane, kill no man without reason; we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29476:99"/>
to pursue him that shal have slain his neighbour, but let not the heir sin maliciously, prosecuting the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for the guilty. The innocent is in Gods protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: take not the goods of Orphans, and be carefull of them, untill they be in yeers of discretion; satifie your promises, an accompt shall be required of you; measure with good measure, and weigh with just weights. Busie your selves not with that which you ought not to know. There shall be required of you an accompt of the sins ye have committed, in seeing, hearing, and thinking. Be not proud, ye shall never be so long as the Earth, neither so high as the Mountains; such sins are exceeding great before thy Lord: It is one part of what he hath inspired into thee, to preach to his people: Say not, there be two Gods, left thou be confined to the fire of Hell. Your Lord hath elected you, with all those men and women that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his Commandements, for his sons and daughters, as the Angels; yet say not that God hath children. We made mention in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of whatsoever is necessary to be preached to the people; say unto them, If there be a God with God, as ye affirme, invok him that hath his Throne in Heaven; praised be God, he hath no Companion, he is most high and great. The seven Heavens praise him, and all that is in Earth glorifie him, but ye comprehend it not, he is gracious and mercifull, We will separate thee from the wicked; we will harden their hearts, and stop their ears. When thou shalt read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and say, There is but one God, they will turne the back, and deride thee, I know what they desire to heare; they would have the people to hearken to the words of the unjust, who say, That thou art a Sorcerer, and a Magician; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider to whom they compare thee; they certainly are in error, and are not able to find the right way. What! we are (say they) bones and flesh, shall we rise againe, and become new Creatures? who shall cause us to rise again? Say unto them, Although ye be stone, iron, bones, and flesh, he who first created you, shall raise you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. They shall shake the head at thee, and ask of thee. In what time they shall rise againe? say unto them, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29476:99"/>
it shall be suddenly. When ye shall be called out of the graves by the Commandement of God, ye will believe that ye have remained but very little time in the world; then shall the Infidels confesse, that the Devill hath deceived them, and that he is their open enemy. Your Lord knoweth you all, he will pardon, or chastise you, as seemeth good to him: We have not sent thee to be their guardian; thy Lord knoweth whatsoever is in Heaven and in Earth. Certainly, we gave graces to some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which we gave not to others; and we gave the Psalter to <hi>David</hi>; Say unto the Infidels, invoke the Idols which you adore, and see if they are of power to deliver you from affliction. They that implore God, desire to be nigh unto him; who are they that shall neerest approach his divine Majesty they who hope in his mercy, or such as feare his punishment? Certainly his punishment ought most to be feared. We will destroy all the Cities of the world before the day of Judgement, and chastise the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with rigorous torments; this is written upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles kept in heaven; nothing hath hindred us to manifest the miracles which the inhabitants of <hi>Mecca</hi> desire to see, but the contempt shewed by their predecessors. <hi>Tenod</hi> saw the miracles of the Camell, and contemned it; I will no more shew miracles, but to make the people to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the torments of hell. Remember thou, that we have said to thee, that thy Lord knoweth all that the world doth; that which we gave thee to see (in the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by night) is to prove the people as the cursed tree,<note place="margin">See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
                  </note> which is spoken of in the <hi>Alcoran</hi>; there be persons that will believe it, others that will not believe; but I will trie them to augment their confusion: Remember thou, that we commanded the Angels to humble themselves before <hi>Adam,</hi> and that they did humble themselves, except the devill; who said, shall I adore him whom thou hast created of the earth? who is he whom thou hast preferred to me? Certainly, if thou tarry untill the day of Judgement, I will destroy his race, except that small number that shall be under thy protection. Thy Lord said unto him, get thee hence, hell shall be thy punishment, and

the punishment of them that shall follow thee; deceive by thy speeches them whom thou shalt be able to deceive, seduce whom thou canst seduce with the wealth of the earth, cause them to exercise Usury, and commit the sin of whoredome; tell them, there is neither Resurrection nor Judgement; whatsoever thou shalt promise them shall be but vanity and falshood; thou shalt have no power over them that shall worship me, I will protect them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee. It is your Lord, who causeth the ship to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell upon the waters, for the advantage of traffique; when the tempest chargeth you, your Idols forsake you, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is able to protect you, neverthelesse when he hath caused you to arrive at the Port, you deny his Unity, and follow your impiety; believe ye that he will another time make the sea calm to you? and that he will send you a favourable wind, if you doe not acknowledge him your protector; Believe ye to returne againe to the sea?

                  </note> that truth is come, and that vanity is vanished; this Book shall heal the people of their error, it shall bring them into the way of mercy, and encrease the misery of unbelievers. We have exhorted men to abandon their impiety, they have not done it, and despaired when they were touched with affliction; Say unto them, each of us doth after his will, and God knoweth him that followeth the right way; they shall demand of thee concerning the Soul: Say unto them, the soul is an effect of God, he hath given you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little knowledge; assuredly, had it so pleased him, he could have deprived you of the knowledge he hath given you, you shall find nothing that is able to protect you but his mercy?

               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise be to God, who hath sent the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to his servant. There is no contradiction in this Book; it teacheth the right way; it preacheth to the wicked, that they shall suffer great torments, and proclaimeth to the righteous, that they shall enjoy an eternall felicity; it preacheth the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, principally to such as affirm, That God hath a Son; they are ignorant, like to their predecessors; they are arrogant in their discourse, and utter nothing but blaspemies: Wilt thou destroy thy self in following their footsteps? If they believe not in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> they shall one day have sorrow, and shall repent it. We adorned the Earth, with whatsoever is upon it, for the advantage of men. One part thereof is happy and plentifull; and the other unfruitfull, and desart. Do ye not believe that the sleepers that entred the Cave, and the Paper wherein their names were written, be our miracles? when those men entred the Cave, they said, Lord, give us thy mercy, and guide us into the right way: Then did we cause them to sleep for the space of some years, and awaked them, having continued some time in that Cave, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear which of the two Religions was the most just. I will relate to thee their History with truth; they were young men, who had the fear of their Lord before their eyes;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:29476:102"/>
we strengthned them, and encreased their faith; when they were with the Infidels, they said, Our God is Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, we will never worship but one God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we shall separate our selves from the truth: This people have adored Idols without reason; who is more unjust then he, who blasphemeth against God? When they deserted the Infidels, they worshipped one God alone. Enter into the Cave, God shall make his mercy towards you to appear, and shall guide you through a path, smooth and pleasant. When the Sun arose, he cast his rayes on the right side of their Cave, and on the left, at his going down; they in the mean time were in the most spacious place of this Cave. This is one of Gods miracles; hee whom he guideth, is well guided; and whom he mislead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, shall find none to give him succour, or to guide him. Believe ye that they should be awake? Assuredly they slept and turned themselves, sometimes to one side, sometimes to another: Consider how their Dog extended his feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that old habitation of stone; if any one had entred towards them, he would have caused them to flie, and had affrighted them. In the end we awaked them, and they mutually enquired of each other in what place they were, and how long they had there continued; one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, That they had been there a day or two; then they all said, God knoweth the time that we have abode here, send one of us to the City with money to buy bread and meat; let him not be fearfull, neither make himself known to any; if wee be known, they will murther, or constrain us to follow their Religion, in which we shall be eternally miserable. Thus did we stir up the people against them, to the end they might know that thy Lord is true; when he said, He will cause the dead to arise again, the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is indubitable; nevertheless unbelievers dispute among them, concerning the History of the Sleepers, and say, That they built a secret place to retire themselves, God knoweth the Truth. The True-believers believe that they made no building; the Infidels say they were five, and that their dog was the sixth, they speak by opinion; but the True-believers affirm them to be seven, and their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29476:102"/>
dog to be the eighth. Say unto them, My Lord knoweth how many they were; few persons except God, know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Say unto them, God knoweth the time of their abode there, he knoweth whatsoever is in Heaven, and Earth, he understandeth and seeth all things, he alone disposeth every thing, and hath no companion; Preach what thy Lord hath inspired into thee, his word admitteth of no alteration, there is no safer refuge then in him; dwell with those that invoke him morning and evening, and desire to see his face; depart not from their company, if thou desirest to have content of life in this world; obey not those whose heart we have hardned, and are unmindfull of us; follow not their impiety, whatsoever they do, is but offence and sin. Say unto them, the truth proceedeth from your Lord; who shall desire [it] shall be True-believers, and who shall not desire [it] shall be an Infidell, we have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Hell to chastise the impious, and prisons wherein to detaine them. They shall implore succors against the melting pit, into which they shall be plunged, as into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it shall rost their faces, and shall be their drink; I will not frustrate of reward them that shall have done well, they shall enjoy the delights of the gardens of <hi>Eden,</hi> wherein flow many rivers, they shall have bracelets of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29476:103"/>
end, they shall endure a long time without withering: His companion said to him; If thou dost not ackowledge this to proceed from God, and if thou be ingratefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him that created thee of dust, and made thee a man, thou shalt soon finde thy gardens ruined; this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from God my Lord, who hath no companion; all strength, and truth proceedeth from his divine Magesty; If I have lesse of substance then thou, God can give me fruits more faire then those of thy gardens, or send thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that shall destroy them, he shall fill them with water of rain, that shall encompasse them, and hinder thee to approach [them.] In the morning this Infidell found his gardens destroyed to the very roots, he was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed, by reason of the expence he had made to plant them eavenly; and he said, would to God I had not adored Idols: He shall find none that is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him at the day of Judgement, but God, all protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and grace issueth from his divine bounty, and the end of the righteous shall be happy. Speak unto them this parable, the life of the world is like unto rain fallen from Heaven, that refreshed and revived the herbs of the Earth, and in the morning were drie as chaste, carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the winde; God is omnipotent: Riches and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are the ornaments of this life, but good works are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, they are acceptable to God, and give us hope of his grace. Be thou mindfull of the day when the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains shall walk, and thou shalt see the Earth to be plain; that day we assemble the good and the wicked, and will not faile of my word to any person; that day shall the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels beseech the Lord to save them, he shall say unto them, you came unto us naked, as when we at first created you, and ye believed on Earth, that there was no resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Then shall he give to every one the Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in shall be written the accompt of their sinnes; Thou shalt see the wicked trembling with fear, saying, behold here our destruction! What is there in this Book? It containeth their veniall and mortall sinnes, and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth their offences, they shall find the number of their crimes before their eyes: Thy Lord is unjust to none;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:29476:103"/>
Remember thou that we commanded the Angels to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate themselves before <hi>Adam,</hi> and that they humbled themselves, except the Devill, who was in the number of Angels, he disobeyed his Lord; neverthelesse <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity have obeyed him, although he is their open enemy, and particularly of the Infidels. Consider ye not that God created Heaven and Earth, that he made you, and hath no need to be aided of you? Be thou mindfull of the day, when it shall be said to Idolaters, call upon your Idols that ye have worshipped, for remission of your sinnes; they shall implore them, but none shall hear their prayers, we have ruined them; the wicked shall behold the fire, into which they shall fall, and finde none to save them. We taught men in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> many parables, yet do the wicked abound in questions and dispute too much; What hindreth men to believe, since there is come to them a guide, to conduct them into the right way? If they beg not pardon of God, what hapned to their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and at <hi>Beder,</hi> shall befall them, they shall be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly punished; I send Prophets only to anounce the joyes of Paradise, and to preach the torments of Hell; the unbelievers dispute vainly, to obscure the truth, they deride my Commandements, and the fire of Hell; who is more unjust then hee who knoweth the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Lord, and disobeyeth him, and forgetteth his past sinnes? We have hardned their hearts, they shall not understand the Scripture; we have stopped their eares, they shall heare nothing; if thou callest them to the right way, they shall not follow thee, thy Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and mercifull; should he chastise them after their demerits, he should forthwith destroy them, he tarrieth untill the time that he hath promised to punish them, and they shall finde none of power to protect them. Wee have destroyed Cities, when their Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have offended, and we prefixed the day of their ruine. Remember thou that <hi>Moses</hi> said to his servant, I will travell incessantly, untill I see a place where two seas meet, although I travell an Age. When he came to that place, hee and his servant forgot their fish,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:29476:104"/>
he had taken his way through the Sea: Having continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their voyage some time, <hi>Moses</hi> was an hungry, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded somewhat to eat of his servant, who said to him, Sawest thou what hapned at the Rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have forgotten our fish, the Devill made me to forget it, he miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took his way through the Sea; that Rock is the place which we seek: they both returned on their stops, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing together, untill they came to that Rock? where they found one of our servants, on whom we had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our graces, and inspired knowledge; <hi>Moses</hi> said unto him, permit me to follow thee, that thou maist teach me knowledge; and instruct me; He replyed, thou wilt not be able to abide patiently with me; how wilt thou pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endure to hear a thing which none in the world eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

because there was an Infidell Prince, who by force seized on the good vessels for his service. That infant which I flew was an Idolater, the son of a true believer, a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man; we feared he might cause his father to sin, and seduce him into his error, and infidelity; the Lord through his goodness would have him to be destroyed, to deliver his father from his malice. The wall appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to two infant Orphans of this City, there is under it a treasure that belongeth to them, their father was a righteous man, God through his goodness willeth: that the treasure be preserved for them, untill they attain to years of discretion; he likewise willed me to do what I have done: behold the exposition of what thou wert im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to learn. If any one enquire of thee concerning <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, relate to them his History: we gave him on earth what he desired, he went as far as the West, where he found a fountain guarded by a man, who said to him, O <hi>Alexander</hi>! chastise men through the murther of their persons, bondage, and ransome; he answered, I will put to death unbelievers in this world, and the Lord shall punish them in hell, and the righteous shall enjoy the glory of Paradise; I will tell the wicked, that God hath given us what we have desired. After this, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his way untill he came to a place, where the Sun riseth; he found that it riseth in a countrey, where they have nothing to shelter them from its heat, the thing is so: we taught <hi>Alexander</hi> how to shelter himself; he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his way, untill he arrived between two mountains, inhabited of a Nation that spake a Language, which he could hardly understand; they said to him, O <hi>Alexander!

I declare unto thee, that thou shalt have a son, named <hi>John,</hi> no man hath yet been called by that name; he said, Lord, how shall I have a son, my wife is barren, and I am too old? It was answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, the thing shall be as I have said unto thee, it is easie to thy Lord; who created thee; he said, Lord give me some signe of the conception of my wife; he said to him, thou shalt not speak for three nights.

We blessed the day of his nativity, the day that he shall dye, and the day that he shall rise again. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou what is written of <hi>Mary,</hi> she retired towards the East, into a place farre remote from her kindred, and took a vaile to cover her, we sent her our Spirit in forme of a man; she was afraid, and said, God will preserve me from thee, if thou have his fear before thine eyes; hee said, oh <hi>Mary</hi>! I am the Messenger of God thy Lord, who shall give thee a Sonne, active, and prudent: She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, how shall I have a sonne without the touch of man? I desire not to be unchaste; he said, The thing shall be as I have told thee, it is facile to thy Lord; thy sonne shall be a token of the omnipotency of God, and of his speciall grace towards such as shall believe in his divine <hi>Majesty</hi>; She became with child, and retired some time, into a place remote from people, where she sustained the colours of Child-birth, at the foot of a Date-tree, and said, why am I not dead? wherefore am I not in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of persons forgotten?

The Infidels are manifestly erroneous from the right way; If thou preach to them the torments of Hell and their ignorance, they will not hear thee. Wee are Lords of whatsoever is on Earth, and dispose of every thing at our pleasure, they shall be one day assembled before us to be judged. Remember thou what is written of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was a righteous man, and a Prophet, he said to his Father, adore not what neither seeth; nor understandeth any thing, and that cannot be profitable; I know what ye know not, follow me, and I will conduct you into the right way; worship not the Devill, he is disobedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; otherwise I fear that God may chastise you, and you may be in the number of the damned. He answered, oh <hi>Abraham</hi>! dost thou abhorre my Gods? unlesse thou change thy discourse, I will stone thee, depart from me for a long time; he said, May God inspire you, I will pray for you, he is exceeding good, and will hear my prayers; Whom will ye adore, when I shall be gone from

Remember thou what is written of <hi>Enoch,</hi> hee was a just man, and a Prophet, and we took him up to an exceeding high place. God gave his grace to these men, among the Prophets of the lineage of <hi>Adam,</hi> among them whom we caused to embarke with <hi>Noah,</hi> among those of the lineage of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> and among those that we assembled and guided into the right way. When the miracles of the mercifull were related to them, they fell prostrate, and adored him with tears in their eyes; their posterity forsook their footsteps, abandoned the Law, and followed their own appetites; but they shall be precipitated into Hell, except such as shall be converted, and do good works, they shall enter into Paradise, and no injustice shall be done to them, they shall enter into the garden of <hi>Eden</hi>; what the mercifull [God] doth promise, is infallible; they shall hear nothing spoken in Paradise that shall displease them, they shall hear the salutation of Angels, and morning and evening shall have what they desire; such is Paradise, which God giveth to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have his fear before their eyes.

meet at a place, and day prefixed between the and me, to come together; <hi>Moses</hi> said unto him, let us make choise of the day of your feast; if it seem good to you, the people may assemble at the Sun rising: After this discourse, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> withdrew, recollected all his subtilties, and at the day and hour prefixed, came with his people to the place appointed, where <hi>Moses</hi> was, who said unto them, misery is upon you, blaspheme not against God, he will punish you, and destroy them that blaspheme against him; The people of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> differed in opinion what they should do, kept their designe secret, and said to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> these two men are Magicians, they would chase you from your Countrey, through their Magick, and seduce your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from your Religion; recollect your subtilties and power, and chuse persons capable to dispute against them, this day shall be happy to him that shall be victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. They said to <hi>Moses,</hi> wilt thou first cast thy staffe on the ground, or shall we ours? Their cords and staves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose against <hi>Moses</hi> through their Magick, and crawled: <hi>Moses</hi> spake low, between his teeth; we said unto him, fear nothing, thou shalt be victorious, cast thy staffe in thy right hand on the ground, it shall devoure what they have done, it is but witchcraft and magick that produceth neither Profit nor Content. Then fell the Magicians of <hi>Pharoah</hi> prostrate on the ground, and said, We believe in the God of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moses; Pharoah</hi> said unto them, believe ye in him without my permission? <hi>Moses</hi> is your master, I will cut off your right feet, and your left hands; or your left feet, and your right hands, and cause you to be hanged on Palme trees, that ye may know who is the more severe in his chastisements, I, or the God of <hi>Moses</hi>; They said, the miracles that thou hast seen, have they not touched thee? He that created us, doth things which are not in thy power to performe; thy power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth only in this world, we believe in God our Lord, who will pardon our sinnes; thou art the cause that hee abhorreth us with our magick, hee is more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then thou, and eternall; Hell is prepared for Infidels,

they shall finde repose neither in their life nor death, and the righteous that shall do good works, shall eternally enjoy the pleasures of the gardens of <hi>Eden,</hi> wherein slow many delicious rivers, such is the reward of them that are purged from their sins. We said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> go out by night with my people, and make them a drie path through the Sea, fear not that thine enemies may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thee, neither be afraid of being drowned, <hi>Paraoh</hi> shall follow them with his troops; I will overwhelm in the sea, and will mislead him with his people, he shall not follow the right way. O children of <hi>Israel</hi>! we delivered you from your enemies, and conducted you towards the mountains of <hi>Sinai:</hi> we caused Manna and Quailes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend upon you, and said, eat ye of the good things that we have given you, and be not ungratefull, otherwise my wrath shall fall upon you; he upon whom mine indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall fall, shall be thrown headlong into the fire of hell; I will be mercifull to such as shall convert, do good works, and follow the right way. O <hi>Moses</hi>! who pressed thee to absent thy self from thy people? He answered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he that followeth my steps, I am come up to receive thy Commandements. We after thy departure estranged thy people from thee, and <hi>Samery</hi> seduced them from the right way; he returned upon his steps to his people, in great displeasure, and said, O ye people! did not God promise to you all manner of content? he protracted the effect of his promises, because of your sins, will you that his wrath fall upon you? wherefore have ye transgressed what ye promised to me? They said, we have not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed our promises of our own accord; we took the most weighty ornaments of the people, and cast them into the fire, <hi>Samery</hi> himself did cast them in; he made the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a bellowing Calfe, and said, with his followers, behold there your God, the God of <hi>Moses</hi> whom he hath forgotten; Saw they not that this Calf spake not to them, and that it had not power to do good or evill? <hi>Aaron</hi> had said unto them, before the comming of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>; O ye people! you have been seduced by this Calfe;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:29476:110"/>
the mercifull is your God, and your Lord, follow and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey me: They said, shall we abide here untill <hi>Moses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne? <hi>Moses</hi> at his return said unto <hi>Aaron</hi> what hindred thee to follow me, when thou sawest them to turne aside from the Law of God? wherefore hast thou disobeyed me? O son of my mother! (said <hi>Aaron</hi>) drag me not by the beard, and haire, I feared to displease thee, if I forsook the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and disobey thy Commandements; <hi>Moses</hi> said unto <hi>Samery,</hi> what was thy design? he answered, I saw what this people seeth not, I took an handfull of the earth of the footsteps of the Messenger of God, and made the Figure of a Calfe, the fairest that I could; <hi>Moses</hi> said unto him, goe, get thee from among us, thou shalt fly the presence of men all the dayes of thy life; thou shalt say unto them, come not nigh me, touch me not, the time of thy punishment is appointed, thou shalt not escape it, behold thy false god, behold the Calfe which thou hast adored, I will cause it to burne, and will cast the ashes thereof into the sea; your God is one God, and there is none other God, but the God that knoweth all things: Thus doe I relate to thee things past; we have sent thee the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> such as shall abjure it, shall beare their burthen at the day of Judgement, and be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented; I will one day require an account of their burden, and will assemble them with all their subtilities; when the Trumpet shall sound, they shall demand of each other, how long they have continued in the world? they shall say, that they have remained there but ten dayes and ten nights, I know all that they will say; the most prudent among them shall say, that they have been but one day. They shall enquire of thee concerning the Mountains; Say unto them, God shall teare them up, and levell them with the Earth, thou shalt see them levelled and beaten downe: then shall men without retardment follow him that shall summon them to universall Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they shall humble themselves before God, thou shalt that day heare low and humble voyces, that day shall prayers be ineffectuall, except of them that shall be

pleasing to God, whom he will permit to speak. He knoweth whatsoever men doe in this world, and what must befall them in the other, and they know it not, they shall humble themselves, and hang down the head before the living and eternall Lord, all Infidels shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the righteous of True-believers that have done good works, shall not feare injustice. We have sent the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue, it teacheth men our Commandements, peradventure they will feare impiety; it teacheth them what they ought to know; Exalt the glory of God, King of the world, he is truth it selfe; presse not thy selfe to read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> untill thou hast well understood it. Say, Lord encrease my knowledge; We heretofore prohibited <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the forbidden fruit, he was unmindfull of our Commandement, I found in him no perseverance. Remember thou that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Angels to humble themselves before him, they humbled themselves, except the Devill, who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to doe it. Remember that we said, <hi>Adam,</hi> the Devill is thine enemy, and the enemy of thy wife, he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make you miserable, to cause you both to goe out of Paradise, where thou sufferest neither hunger nor thirst, nor cold, nor heat; The Devill tempted them, and said, oh <hi>Adam</hi>! I will conduct thee to the tree of eternity, a treasure that shall never perish, they did both eat of the fruit of that tree, then knew they their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and took the leaves of trees to cover their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; <hi>Adam</hi> disobeyed his Lord, and became miserable, neverthelesse he heard, and pardoned him, and shewed him the right way; he said, discend from Paradise, ye enemies of each other, I will hereafter send you a guide, he that shall follow him, shall not erre, and shall be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; He that shall goe astray, and will not believe in me, shall be miserable in the world, and blind at the day of Judgement; that day shall he say, Lord, wherefore hast thou made me blind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had good sight when I was in the world: I did this day forget thee, as thou didst forget my Commandements: thus doe I intreat Infidels. The tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:29476:111"/>
of the other world are more grievous then those of the Earth, and of longer continuance; doe not unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers tremble, when they consider how many men upon Earth we have destroyed in past Ages? Their misery shall serve for example to them that are wise; Had not thy Lord said, that he will deferre the punishment of the wicked untill the time appointed, he had already destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Be patient, and endure their discourse, praise thy Lord before the Sunne arise, before it setteth, an hour before night, and at the end of day thou shalt doe a thing acceptable to him: The life of the world is sweet to tempt you, but the riches of thy Lord are better, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. Command the people to make their prayers at the time appointed, and be not impatient towards them, I require no riches of thee, I will enrich thee, and in the end Paradise shall be for the righteous. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers have said, if <hi>Mahomet</hi> sheweth not some racle from God, and knoweth not the exposition of the books of our predecessors, we will not believe in him; We before his comming destroyed many wicked persons, who said, Lord, hadst thou sent us a Prophet, we had observed thy Commandements, before we became infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and laden with ignominie; Say unto them, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one expecteth his end, expect ye, and ye shall one day know them that follow the right way, and have not erred.</p>

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. The day approacheth, wherein the people shall render an accompt of their actions, but they consider it not, and depart from the Commandements of God; if they heare them, they laugh, they understand them not, and keep secret their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill intention. Is not <hi>Mahomet</hi> a man like to you? Will ye

say that he is a Magician? you see the contrary; God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth whatsoever is spoken, both in Heaven and Earth, and knoweth all things. They say, certainly <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath dreamed what he speaketh, he hath invented it, and is a Poet, we will not believe him, unless he shew some mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as did the Prophets that were before him. We have layed waste many Cities, because their inhabitants were incredulous; we sent before thee but men who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired of us; Enquire of them, to whom heretofore was given the knowledge of the written Law, if ye know it not; they were men that did eat and drink, and were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; we effected what we promised to them, we preserved them with such as believed, and destroyed the incredulous; We have sent you a Book to instruct you, will ye under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it? How many Infidel Cities have wee made deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late? How many new people have we established in their place? When they felt our punishment, they fled; fly not, and return to what hath delighted you, return into your houses, peradventure ye will yet cover the riches of the Earth; They said, misery is upon us, we are too blame; Thus did they talke, untill they were destroyed. We have not created Heaven and Earth, and whatsoever is between them, to sport with; had it been our will that they should have scoffed on Earth, they should scoffe likewise in Heaven. On the contrary, I oppose the truth to false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to confound it, and in effect it doth confound it. Misery shall be upon you, because of your blasphemies; whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth, is Gods; the Angels are not ashamed to worship him, they prayse him day and night, and exalt his glory without blasphemie. The Infidels worship Gods made of Earth; Have they power to create any thing? Were there in Heaven, and on Earth another God, they would not accord; praised be God, Lord of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; what the Infidels relate, is untrue. Hee asketh no counsell when he will doe any thing, as do men; will they worship any other God but him? Say unto them, produce your arguments, behold what we have to speak
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:29476:112"/>
unto you, behold our reasons, and those of our predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors; Certainly, the greatest part of them are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the truth, and goe astray. We inspired into all the Prophets which we sent, that there was but one God that ought to be worshipped. They said, believe ye that the Angels are the sonnes of God? Praysed be God; on the contrary, they are his creatures, he loveth them, they speak not but after him, and obey what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them, he knoweth all their actions past, and future, they pray for no man but through his permission, and feare to displease him. Who among them will say I am God, instead of God? he shall be cast headlong into the fire of Hell; thus doe I intreat unbelievers. Know they not that the Heavens and the Earth were shut up? We opened them, and gave life to every thing, through the raine which we made to descend; will they not believe in my unity? We created the Mountains to hinder the Earth to move, we made therein wayes large and spacious for our Creatures, we covered it with the Heaven, and have exempted it from falling, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they despise our Commandement. It is the Lord who created day and night, the Moone and the Sunne, all things praise and exalt him in Heaven; we crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no person to dwell for over on Earth; all men shall taste of death, I will prove you with good and evill, and ye shall appeare before me to give accompt of your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The Infidels scoffe at you, when they see you, and say, behold them that deride our Gods! They obey not the Commandements of God; he created man of dust, and shall shew you the effects of his omnipotency, be not impatient to see the punishment of the wicked, who say, when shall be the day of judgement? did they know it, they would remove the fire from their backs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages; that day shall surprize them, it shall astonish them when they thinke least of it, they cannot retard it, and shall be deprived of protection. Certainly they scorned the Prophets that were sent before thee, but they were punished after their demerits. Say unto them,

who but the mercifull [God] preserveth you day and night? neverthelesse yee reject his Commandements; Have they any other God but me, that is able to save them? Their Gods cannot defend themselves: I will not protect them, yet will I enrich them, as I enriched their fathers, and will prolong their life, to punish them on Earth; Know they not that their estates di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish on all sides through thy Conquests? Is it so, that they are victorious? Say unto them, I preach to you what God hath inspired into me, but the deafe heare not when they are exhorted; When they are a little touched with the chastisements of God, they say, oh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery! We are too blame, and are unjust; I will weigh their workes at the day of Judgement, that I may doe injustice to no person, of the weight of a grain of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-seed, and will most exactly accompt. We gave to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> the Book that distinguisheth good from evill, and commanded them to preach our Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them that had our feare before their eyes.

He is impious; we heard it is a young man, named <hi>Abraham,</hi> who derideth them, bring

They said unto him, oh <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>! it is thou that hast so abused our Gods, he said on the contrary, it is that great Idol; They enquired of each other if those Idols spake, and if they had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; afterwards they returned to themselves, and said to the people, ye are too blame to adore those Idols; he threw them headlong against the ground, and they said, oh <hi>Abram</hi>! thou well knewest that they spake not at all; he answered, why therefore doe ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship what can neither benefit nor hurt you? You defile your selves in adoring them instead of God, doe ye not know him? Then they said, burne <hi>Abraham,</hi> and let us defend our Gods, if ye are righteous men: but we commanded the fire to lose its heat, to preserve <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>; They would have tormented him, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed them, we saved him, as we preserved <hi>Lot,</hi> we conducted him into the Land of blessing, gave him <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Children of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, righteous men, and True-believers, to instruct the people in the way of Salvation; wee inspired them to doe good workes, to pray at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to pay Tithes, and to worship us; Wee gave to <hi>Lot</hi> prudence and knowledge, and delivered him from the Inhabitants of the City, who were the most vicious upon Earth, we were gracious to him, because he was righteous. Remember <hi>Noah,</hi> and that hee heretofore invoked us; wee heard his prayer, and delivered him from great danger, and all that were with him in the Arke; we deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him from the hand of the wicked, whom wee drowned.

We have given a Law to all the Nations of the World, to guide them into the right way; if they observe it they will not dispute against thee. Invoke thy Lord, thou art in the right way; if they dispute against thee: Say unto them, God knoweth all your actions, he shal judg your diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences at the day of judgment: knewest thou not that God knoweth whatsoever is in heaven or in earth? All is written, &amp; this is most easie to his divine Maj. Idolaters adore without reason, Idols that understand not whether they be gods or no, that shall be without protection at the day of Judgment; when they preach to men my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, they know by their countenance those that are impious, and ingratefull for my graces; they would with wrath fall upon them that instruct them. Say unto them, I declare unto you things more greivous: God hath prepared the fire of hell to chastise Infidels. O peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! A parable is related to you, hear it. All the Idolls that ye adore cannot create a flye; when they shall be assembled to do it, if the flies corrupt any thing that is offered to them, they have not the power to drive them away, because of their impotency, and the weaknesse of them that adore them: They praise not God in that manner as is just and reasonable, he is most strong, &amp; most powerfull, he hath chosen messengers to bear and and execute his Commandements among Angels and men, he heareth whatsoever they say, beholdeth whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they do, he knoweth whatsoever they have don, and all things obey him.

The chief among the people that were idolaters, said to their adherents, this man is a man like your selvs, he would appear, and be esteemed more then you; if God would be adored alone, as he saith, he would cause an angel to descend, that should bring his Commandments; we have not heard spoken to our Predecessors, what he saith; he is a man possessed of the Devil, tarry, and ye shal see what will become of him. Then <hi>Noah</hi> said, Lord, protect me against them, and defend me from their blasphemies; we commanded him to build an Ark, when our command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given to destroy the wicked, and when the water of his caldron boyled, we commanded him to enter into the Ark, with two beasts of every kinde, and species; all men we destroyed, except them of whom we have before spoken, (we said unto him) speak not to me for Infidels, they shall be drowned, when thou shalt have taken order for every thing that must enter into the Ark, with thee, Say, praise be to God, who hath delivered us from the malice of the wicked, Lord, give us to descend in a blessed place, thou art the best Pilot in the world.

God hath given you sight, hearing, and sense, but few among you return him thanks, he it is that hath created you of earth, ye shall one day be assembled before him to be judged; he it is that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth life and death, and maketh the difference of day and night, will you not honor him, neither consider?

These mysteries are the mysteries of the Book that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth the truth from a lye. I relate to thee the history of Moses, and of Pharoah with truth, for the contentment of True-beleivers. Pharoah was powerfull on Earth, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his Subjects as seemed good to him, he tormented ted one party, and murthered their Children, he abused their wives, and was of them that defiled the Earth. I gave my grace to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were afflicted on earth I made them successors of Pharoahs Kingdom, <hi>I</hi> established them in his Dominions; I made Pharoah, Haman, and their Army to see what they most feared; we said, to the mother of Moses, give suck to thy Child; if thou fearest that they will mischief him, cast him upon Nile, fear not, neither afflict thy self, I will restore him to thee between thine arms, and place him in the number of Prophets.

said to <hi>Pharoahs</hi> servant, wil ye that I provide you a nurse, and people that shall carefully nourish him? We caused him to be restored to his mother, to nurse him; she ceased from her sadness, when she knew, and saw that God was sincere in what he had promised, but the greatest part of the people know it not. When <hi>Moses</hi> was aged, about thirty three years, we gave him knowledge and wisdom; thus do I reward the righteous; <hi>Moses</hi> entring one day into the City, met two men that fought; the one was of the Children of Israel, and the other was an Egyptian, and of his enemies, whom he assaulted, and slew; after this he said, the Devil tempted me, he is the open enemy of men; Lord, I have offended thee, pardon me; he pardoned him, he is gracious and mercifull; Lord, since thou hast bin so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to me, I will never give aid or succour to Infidels.

               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and merciful: I am God most wise. Men have beleived that it is sufficient to say we beleive in God, and that they be not proved: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God proved their predecessors, and knew such as were zealous in his Law, and them that were Infidels. Do they who have done evill, think to escape the punishment of their crimes, and not to be judged? Such as hope to see God, shall behold him at the time appointed by his divine Majesty; he understandeth and knoweth all things. He that fighteth for the faith, fighteth for his soule; certainly God hath no need of men, their sins shall be pardoned who shall beleive in his divine Majesty, and shall do good works. We enjoyned the children of Israel to honour their father and mother, and to do good to them; if they press thee to worship many Gods, thou shalt be damned, if thou give ear to them, obey them not in this matter, ye shall be assembled before me, I will set before you all that ye have done, I will reward you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your works, and place such as shall have observed my Law in the number of the blessed. There be men who affirm, that they beleive in God, and are impatient when evill befalleth them from God to prove them. If God give victory to the True beleivers, they say, that they are on their side, but doth not God know what is in their heart? he knoweth them that beleive in his Law, and those that are impious. The Infidels, said to the True-beleivers, do like us, follow our way, we will bear your sins; They will not bear them, they are lyars, they shal bear their own bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; shal not an accompt of their sins be required of them at the day of Judgment? We sent <hi>Noah</hi> to instruct men, he lived upon the earth 900. &amp; 50. years. The flood sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, &amp; destroyed the people of his time, because they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:29476:135"/>
were unjust, and we saved <hi>Noah</hi> and those that were with him in the Ark; this ought to serve for example to all the world. Remember <hi>Abraham,</hi> who said to his people, adore one God, and fear him, ye shall do well, if ye have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to comprehend it; ye worship but Idols, &amp; are but lyars, those whom ye worship cannot benefit you; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore succor of God, worship him, and give him thanks for his graces, ye shall one day appear before him, if ye traduce me, those that were before you traduced the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise be to God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, who created the Angels, the Messengers of his Commandments; they have wings, two, three, and foure; he maketh of his Creature what seemeth good to him, he is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent; none can comprehend the grace that he hath given to his people, it is incomprehensible, he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and most wise. Oh people! Remember the grace of God, is there a Creator beside him? he enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you with the riches of Heaven and Earth, there is no God beside him. How can the wicked blaspheme against his divine Majesty? If they traduce thee, certainly they traduced the Prophets that were sent before thee, they shall be one day assembled before God to be judged. Oh ye people! what God hath promised is infallible; glory not in the wealth of the Earth, beware least the Devill se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you, and render you proud; because that God doth a while defer the punishment of your crimes. The Devill is your enemy, be ye his enemies, he leadeth them that follow him into the fire of Hell, where they shall suffer the rigors of infinite paines; their sinnes shall be remitted that believe in God, and do good works: Oftentimes, he that delighted in what he doth, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:29476:147"/>
he doth well; God misleadeth and guideth whom it pleaseth him; be not unwilling to depart from the wicked, God knoweth all their actions. He sendeth the winds that drive the clouds unto barren and dry places, to refresh the Earth, and cause it to revive after its death; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will he raise again the dead. He that affecteth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, shall finde in God all manner of greatnesse; good speeches ascend even to his divine Majesty, and our good works are acceptable to him. Such as conspire against the Prophet, shall endure great torments, and their conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy become vain and unprofitable. God hath created you of dust and mire, be created<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you men and women; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man neither conceiveth, not bringeth forth, but through his permission; no man can either prolong or shorten his life, but following what is written in the book [kept in heaven] these things are easie to God. Those two Seas are not like to <hi>Eaphrates,</hi> whose water is sweet and pleasant to drinke; the water of the Sea is cold, and salt, neverthelesse ye eat of the fish of the one, and the other; Ye fish out of the Sea, gemmes, to adorne you; you see the Ship to run upon the waters, and cleave the waves, for the advantage of your commerce, peradventure you will return thanks to God for his graces. He causeth the night to enter into the day, and the day into the night; he created the Sunne and the Moon, that run in the Heaven till the day appointed. That God who created these things, is your Lord, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the world is his; the Idols that ye worship have no more power then the skin of an <hi>Almand</hi>; if ye invoke them they shall not hear you, they shall deny you at the day of Iudgment, and are not of power to let you know either the joyes of Paradise, or the torments of Hell. Oh ye people! ye are poor and necessitous, ye have need of Gods assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and God hath no want of you; prayse is due to him in every place; he will destroy you, if it seeme good to him, and create another new people in your place; none shall bear the burthen of another, be it never so light or heavy, no, not when they are neer of Kin. Preach thou the torments of Hell to such as feare their Lord, without seeing him and make their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:29476:147"/>
at the time appointed. He that taketh heed of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, laboureth for himself; all the world shall be one day assembled before him to be judged; The blind are not like to such as see clear; darkness is not like to light, the shade and coolnesse are not like to the heat of the Sun; the living are not like the dead; God causeth himself to be understood of whom he pleaseth, thou canst not make the Commandments of God to be understood by them that are in their Sepulchers; we have sent only to preach the pains of Hell, and the joyes of Paradise, there is no place in the world where they have not been preached; If the Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels traduce thee, their predecessors likewise traduced them whom we sent heretofore, to preach to them the mysteries of faith, and the scriptures; they were surprizd in their sins, were rigorously chastised. Seest thou not how thy Lord caused rain to fall from Heaven, to make the Earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many fruits of sundry sorts, and to nourish in the Mountains the Goats, the Stags, and Hinds? to nourish the Crowes and Ravens, the men, and beasts of divers kinds and forme?

They shall not dye in those tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their torture shall neve be asswaged; thus shall the wicked be chastised, they shall in vain implore succor of God, and say, Lord deliver us from these paines, we will do better then we have done heretofore I will no more prolong your life on Earth, I have sent you my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, They preached unto you my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, you would not hear them, taste now the pains of Hell, which ye have merited, the wicked shall this day be deprived of protection. Certainly God knoweth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in Heaven and Earth, he knoweth all that is in the hearts of men He it is that hath made you to multiply on earth, impiety shall rise against the impious, it shall render them abominable before God, and put them into the number of the damned; Say unto them, have ye well considered the Idols that ye have worshipped? Tell me, what have they created on Earth? Were they Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in the Creation of the Heavens? Hath God sent to them a Book, and reasons, to authorize their impiety? Certainly the wicked instruct one another only in pride and arrogancy; God sustaineth the Heavens and the Earth, he alone is able to sustain them, he is gracious and merciful. The wicked swore to fight for the encrease of the faith, if there should come to them a Preacher to instruct them; and when he came, they augmented their wickednes, became proud in the earth, &amp; conspired against the True-deleivers; their conspiracy fell upon themselves, and they can expect none other things then what was ordained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their predecessors, the law of God admitteth none al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.

When they entred towards him, they said unto him, Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, we have a dispute among us, judge our difference with equity, and teach us the right way. This man is my Brother, he hath fourscore and nineteen sheep; I had but one, which he hath ravished from me, because he was stronger than I. <hi>David</hi> said, He hath done thee wrong, art thou troubled for one Ew? The greatest part of men arose against their neighbor, except such as believe in the Law of God, and observe his Commandments, which are few in number. Then <hi>David</hi> knew that we had tryed him, he implored pardon of his sin, he humbled himselfe, worshiped us, and was converted. We gave him pardon of his fault, we drew him near unto us, and lodged him in a place of content.

Have I preferred the love of the wealth of the Earth, to the remembrance of God, even untill the Sun set? He caused them to be led back againe, and sacrificed some of them (for expiation of his fault.) He caused their legs and neck to be cut off. We tryed <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> we caused a suppositious person to fit on his throne, and afterwards restored him to his dominions. He said, Lord, give me thy mercy, give me so happy a reigne, that the like hath not been seen; thou art liberall towards thy creatures. We made subject to him the winds, which blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his command, where it pleased him. We made the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills subject to him; some built his Palaces, others dived into the Seas, to bring him Pearls, and others were bound and chained to attend his commands; he retained and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed whom he listed, with rendring an accompt.

Thou art in the number of the proud; he replied, I am better then man, thou hast made me of fire, and hast created him of the dust of the Earth. Then thy Lord said unto him, Get thee hence, thou shalt be chastised on all sides, &amp; my curse be upon thee untill the day of Iudgment. He answered, Lord, defer my punishment untill the day of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; he said, I will defer it untill the day appointed.

Are such as labour to be compared to them that are idle? They that have judgment will understand this discourse. Say unto them, oh ye people that beleive in your Lord! have his fear before your eyes; Such as shall do good works in this world shall enjoy abundantly the riches of the earth, God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerably reward them that persevere in obedience to his Commandments; Say unto them, <hi>I</hi> am commanded to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship one God, to professe his Vnity, &amp; to be obedient to him.

Such as shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the Law of God, shal lose their souls, &amp; families at the day of Iudgment. These are two great losses, &amp; most certain they be involved in eternal fire. Thus God preacheth to true beleivers. O my creatures! speak unto them, that have my fear before their eyes, that they adore not idols, and that if they turn to their Lord, they shall enjoy the delights of Paradise. Proclaim to them that hear my Word, and obey my Commandments, that they are in the right way, and well advised; canst thou deliver from the fire of hell him that shall be condemned? Certainly such as obey God, shal enjoy the pleasures of Paradise, wherein flow many rivers, &amp; there shal they dwel eternaly. This is the promise of God he swerveth not from that which he promiseth. Seest thou not that God sendeth raine from heaven, and maketh the rivers to run upon the earth, he causeth plants to spring forth, and herbs of divers colours; thou seest them become yellow; and then altogether drie; this is a sign of his omnipotency.

This Book is sent by the omnipotent, who knoweth all things, who pardoneth sinnes, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the conversion of his Creatures, he is severe in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements, and indulgent to his people, there is no God but he, and all the world shall one day be assembled before his divine Majesty [to be judged.] No man disputeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the precepts of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but the wicked; be not thou discontented if they live on earth with some felicity; the people of <hi>Noahs</hi> time contemned his instructions,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:29476:158"/>
their posterity did like them, and every Nation hath conspired the death of them whom God sent to instruct them; thy disputed to obscure the truth through their lies, but they were punished; and after what manner? So is the word of God accomplished against the wicked, they all shall be damned. The Angells that are about the Throne of God, and those that bear him, praise and exalt his divine Majesty, they beleive in his unity, and beg pardon of him for the True-believers; Lord, Lord, thy mercy extendeth through the whole world nothing is hid from thee, either in Heaven or Earth, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their sins that convert, and embrace thy holy Law, deliver them from the fire of Hell, open to them the gate of the gardens of <hi>Eden,</hi> which thou hast prepared for them their Fathers, wives, and children, and them of their line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age that shal do good works thou art omnipotent and wise Depart from sin, he that shall depart [from it] shall resent the effects of Gods mercy at the day of Iudgment, and shall enjoy eternall felicity; the Infidels shall be hated of God, his hatred is far more dangerous then yours; wil ye be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels after being called to the observation of the Law of Salvation? They said, Lord, wilt thou cause us to dye twice and shall we twice rise againe? But they shall say at the the day of Judgment, Lord, we confesse we have offended thee, we acknowledge our sinne, in having renounced the belief of thine unity; Shall we never go out of Hell, to observe thy Law, and follow the way of salvation? No, ye shal suffer in the fire of Hell, because that ye have be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lievd them that adored Idols, and because ye have said, that God hath companions equall to him. All things obey one sole God omnipotent, he it is that made you to see his Miracles, and sendeth you the riches of Heaven and Earth; none consider it but such as are converted. Pray to God, and observe his LAW, although it be against the will of the wicked; he elevateth his Creatures to what degree he listeth, he hath created his Throne, and sent his inspirations to whom he seeth good, to preach the day of Judgement; that day shall the people come out of their Monuments, &amp; none shal be able
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:29476:158"/>
to hide himselfe from his divine Majesty. Who shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that day? It shall be God alone, victorious; that day shall he recompense every one after his works, without injustice, he is exact to make accompt. If thou preach to the wicked the day of Judgement, their heart will lift them up, and they shall be full of affliction, their prayers shall not be heard, and none shall intereede for them: God knoweth them that have eyes of treachery, and seeth all that is in the hearts of men, he judgeth of every thing with truth; the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols which they worship are without power, God alone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth all things, and is omnipotent. Consider they not what was the end of their predecessors? who were more powerfull, and more wealthy then they? God surprized them in their sinnes, there was none of power to save them, for that they despised the Prophets of his divine Majesty, they contemned his Law, and were impious, but he severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chastised them, he is omnipotent, and most severe.</p>

Will they say that thou hast blasphemed against <hi>God</hi>?

Had God equally enriched all his creatures, they had bin in confusion upon Earth he enricheth whom he pleaseth; he seeth and knoweth all; he sendeth rain when men despair of his grace, he is the protector of believers, and praise is due to him eternally: the creation of the Heavens, and of the earth, and of all that moveth betweene them, is a sign of thine omnipotency: If evil befal you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ye have deserved it, neverthelesse he pardoneth you many things; ye cannot escape his punishment on earth, &amp; none is able to protect you against him.

They deride the Faith when they are spoken to: Certainly, they be punished in the fire of Hell, their riches shall not be able to save them, neither the Idols which they adore; they shall be eternally damned. This Book guideth men into the way of salvation; they that shall not believe in the Law of God, shall feel the effects of his fury. He created the Seas that bear the Ships for the advantage of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, peradventure ye will acknowledg this grace: He hath created for you, all that is in Heaven and on Earth; it is a sign of his goodness to such as consider it. Speak unto them that believe in the Law of Salvation, that they pardon those that have not the fear of God before their Eyes. God shall chastise them after their demirits. Whosoever shall do good, shall finde good; and ye shall be assembled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his divine Majesty, to be judged.

We taught them our Law, none disputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Commandmenes, but such as had knowledg, &amp; that through the envy thar arose among them; but thy Lord shall judg their differences at the day of Iudgment. We have sent thee our Law, observe it, and follow not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of the ignorant, they shall not be able to deliver thee from eternall pains. The Infidels obey each other, and the true-belivers obey God. This book is the light of the world, it guideth into the way of Salvation and the mercy of God, them that believe in his divine Majesty. Do the wicked imagine they shall be intreated like the godly in their life and death, and that they shall not be judged? God hath created heaven and earth for a mark of his power, he shall judg every one according to their works, and shall do injustice to none: Consider how they worship what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into their fancy, God hath seduced them from his certain knowledge, he hath rendred them deaf, hath hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their heart, &amp; blinded them; who shal guide, if God seduce them?

They say our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection shal be like the life of this world; some dy, others are born; length of years cause us to die, they know not what they say, and speak but by opinion.

each other, and the Idols shall not acknowledge them that have worshipped them. When they heard the <hi>Alcoran</hi> read, they affirmed it to contain the truth; and when they were commanded to observe it, they said, that it is but magick. Will they say that thou hast invented it? Say unto them, if I have invented it, ye cannot deliver me from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of God, he knoweth all that is in this book, it is sufficient that he is witnesse between you and me, he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and mercifull: Say unto them, <hi>I</hi> am not the first Prophet, nor the first Apostle that God hath sent, I know not what God shall determine of you and me, I do but what he hath inspired into me, and am sent to preach the torments of hel; have ye considered in what condition ye shall be, if the <hi>Alcoran</hi> be sent from God? Ye have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, but one of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> is witnesse that it is sent from God, and hath believed in his divine Majesty, neverthelesse ye are become proud; God guideth not the proud. The Infidels say to the believers, if the <hi>Alcoran</hi> were any good thing, you should not exceed us in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, it guideth not into the way of salvation, it is but an old Fable; The book of <hi>Moses</hi> that came before it, teacheth the right way, and the Will of God: Say unto them, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> confirmeth the Scriptures sent hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them that precedeed us, it is in the Arabique tongue; he preacheth the pains of hell to unbelievers, and declareth the joyes of Paradise to the righteous. Such as shall believe that God is their Lord, and shall obey him, ought to fear nothing, they shall suffer none affliction at the day of Judgment, they shall enjoy Pardadise for the reward of their good works. We have recommended to man, to honor father and mother, and to do good to them; his mother beareth him with pain, she bringeth forth with dolour, she giveth him suck, and weaneth him at the end of thirty moneths; she hath care [of him] until he be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to govern himself, &amp; hath attained to age of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

God pardoneth the sinne that thou didst commit, when thou wert too prompt, and when thou wert too tardy, [to fight for his Law;] he shall accomplish his grace upon thee, he shall guide thee into the right way, and shall powerfully protect thee; he hath delivered the hearts of the believers from fear, to augment their faith; he disposeth the forces of the Heavens and Earth, he knoweth all, and is most prudent. He shall make them that shall obey his Commandments, to dwell in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, wherein flow many rivers, and shall remit to them their offences, this is supream felicity; The Infidels, the wicked, the disobedient, and unjust, that have evill thoughts of God, shall be accursed of his divine Majesty, misery shal alwayes pursue them, &amp; his wrath be eternally upon them; he hath prepared for them the pains of Hell. God disposeth the powers of the Heavens and Earth, he is omnipotent and wise. We have sent thee to be witnesse of the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of those of the Nation, to proclaime to them the joyes of Paradise, and to preach to them the pains of hell, to the end they may believe in God, and in his Prophet; that they may praise him, honour him, and exalt his glory evening and morning; Such as shall obey thee, obey God; the hand of God is stronger then the hand of men; he that shall sin, shall offend against his own soul; and he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what he hath promised to God, shall have an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great reward.

Ye believed that the Prophet and True-believers should be slain when they fought for the Law of God; ye believed that they should never return to their houses. This opinion rejoyced your heart, but you were deceived, and were your selves destroyed with them that believed not in God, nor his Prophets, God hath prepared the fire of hell for Infidels; the Kingdome of the heavens and earth appertaineth to him, he punisheth and chastiseth whom he listeth, he is gracious &amp; mercifull. When ye shall go to the spoil, such as refused before to follow you to the sight, will say, permit us to go with you; they would pervert the Word of God. Say unto them, ye shall not follow us in this occasion. <hi>God</hi> hath not hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordained it; they will reply, certainly ye are envious, against us; on the contrary, they understand not the Law of <hi>God,</hi> except very few among them.

The blinde, the lame, and the sick, are not obliged to go to the war. He that shall obey <hi>God</hi> and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, shall dwell eternally in gardens, wherein flow many rivers; and he that shall disobey Gods Commandments, shall be punished for his disobedience. <hi>God</hi> accepted their action that repaired to thee under the tree, he knew what they had in their hearts, their confirmed he steps, &amp; gave them victory, he is omnipotent and wise. <hi>God</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed you great spoil, he gave it you, and delivered you from the hands of the people; this shall serve for a sign of his omnipotency to the true-lievers, he will conduct you in to the right way; none but you could have atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that conquest, he well knew that that was for none other, he is omnipotent: if the wicked fight you, they shall fly, they shall turn the back, and finde none to

Observe the Law of <hi>God</hi> against them, do as was heretofore commanded you; the Law of <hi>God</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no alteration; <hi>God</hi> hath delivered you from their hands, and delivered them into yours in the midst of <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> having given you victory over them; he beholdeth all their actions, they have despised the Commandments of his divine Majesty, and hindred you heretofore to go to the Temple of <hi>Mecca</hi>; they are at present prisoners; without the assistance of the true-believers that were within the City with you, ye had not known them, ye had trampled them under our foot without distinction, and had offended <hi>God</hi> without knowledg of your sin. <hi>God</hi> bestoweth his mercy on whom he pleaseth; had ye been separated from the unbelievers, we had severely punished them. When they were succoured of the ignorant, and had some advantage, <hi>God</hi> put his Prophet, and all the believers in a place of saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they had recourse to the word of force and vertue, wherein they did better then the Infidels, <hi>God</hi> knoweth all. Assuredly the dream of the Prophet of <hi>God</hi> was true, when he dreamed that ye were in the Temple of <hi>Mecca</hi> without fear, your hair shaven, and beards trimed; fear nothing, <hi>God</hi> knoweth what you know not; in lieu of this dream, he hath given you a great victory; he it is that hath sent you his Prophet, to teach you his Law, more salutary then all other Laws of the world. It is sufficient, that God is witnesse that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his Prophet and Apostle; it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth that the true believers who are with him, bear testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. <hi>God</hi> encreaseth his mercy towards those Infidels that convert; thou shalt see them worship <hi>God,</hi> humble themselves before his divine Majesty, and implore his grace; thou shalt know them by their aspect, they shall have in their countenance the marks of their zeal; it is so written in the old Testament and she Gospel; they are like a plant that produceth its leaves, that grows strong by little and little, and becommeth big, afterwards it taketh strength up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its roots, becometh a great tree, and the wood thereof serveth to make war against Infidels.

O ye that beleieve! when ye shall speak to the Prophet, speak not louder then he; cry not, as when ye talk among your selves, least ye render your good works vain and unprofitable, and know it not; God hath tryed the vertue of them that speak low in the presence of the Prophet, he shall pardon their sinns, and give them an exceeding great reward. They that call thee behind the Inclosures, know not what they do; had they attended untill thou hadst been towards them, they had done very well, God is gracious and merciful. O ye that believe! if any Infidel desireth to preach to you, distinguish the truth from a lye; if ye give credit to the ignorant, ye shall repent you.

God hath not to doe with them that obey Infidels, neither hath he need of any person, and praise is due to him in all places; peradventure he will establish for the future great amity between you and them that ye hate, he is omnipotent, gracious, and mercifull; he doth prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite you the conversation of them that fight not against you for his faith, and that expel you not from your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he doth not forbid you to do them justice, he loveth the just; He forbiddeth you to converse with them that fight against your faith; that drive you from your houses, and aide to expell you; he prohibiteth you to obey them, and to contract amity with them; such as obey them, shall be exceedingly too blame. O ye that beleeve in God! when the wives of your enemies shall throw themselves into your party, trie their conscience; if ye know them to be faithfull, and to believe in the Law of God, restore them not to the incredulous Infidels, it is not lawfull for them to know them, neither for the women to teach them; give them subsistance, ye shall not sin in espousing them: mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them not after the laws of unbelievers; demand of them what dowry they require, they shall demand of you what ye are willing to bestow on them; continue in accord, God so commandeth, he shall be your Judge at the day of Judgement, he knoweth all your actions, and is most wise. If your wives revolt to the party of unbelievers, and ye suffer any damage, ye shall repaire that damage to him that suffereth, out of the booty that ye shall conquer; feare God, and believe in the Law of his divine Majesty. O Prophet! when women shall desire to embrace thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with firm purpose to believe in one only God, not to steal, neither to commit adultery, neither to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their children, to lye, blaspheme, or be disobedient, receive them, implore pardon of God for them, he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and mercifull.

Beware of them, doubtlesse God will destroy them; how can they blaspheme against his Law? When it was said to them, Come to the Prophet, he shall beg pardon of God for your sins, they shook the head, and withdrew with pride; misery is upon them; whether thou implore pardon for them, or dost not implore it, God will not pardon them, he abhorreth the wicked.

When the time that they ought to tarrie shall be finished, retain, or dismisse them with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; ye shall take persons of your Religion, honest men, that shall be witnesses of your actions, depose with truth what ye have seen; it is so appointed to them that believe in God, and the day of Judgement.

What is above, is ordained of God; he shall pardon their sins, that have his fear before their eyes, and give them an exceeding great reward. Cause them that ye repudiate, to dwell in your houses, or neer to you, abuse them not; If they bee with ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If ye be not wealthy, you shall allow accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your power; God doth not enjoyn any one to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend more then his ability permitteth, he shall give you good after evill; how many have been the Cities that have heretofore disobeyed the Commandements of God, and of his Prophets?

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by the Pen, and by all that is written, that thou art not possessed of the Devill; through the grace of thy Lord; thou shalt have an infinite reward; God hath created thee, with a creation high, and most illustrious. Thou shalt hereafter know, and the Infidels likewise shall know one day, them among you that are ignorant. Certainly thy Lord knoweth them that are seduced, and them that follow the right way. Obey not the wicked, they desire thee to be more indulgent towards them, and themselves more milde towards thee; Obey not those infamous ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, those bablers, sinners, seducers, and wicked persons, full of treasures and children; When the Mysteries of faith are related to them, they say, that they are but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of antiquitie; we will put upon their noses a mark of shame, and ignominy; we have tryed them, as Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners, when they have resolved in the evening to cut off the morning following some fruits of their garden, for their refection, and have not said, if it please God; By night, which they slept, God sent fier into their gardens, that consumed them; in the morning they called [each other] and said, come to put order to your garden, if ye desire to gather the fruits; they believed the poore would enter they ran [to drive them away] and found their fruits black, and their gardens blasted: Then they said,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:29476:192"/>
we are seduced, we are sinners; one of them said that it was requisite to praise God; Then they said, praised be God, we are great sinners; they approached each other, and complained among themselves: They said, misery is upon us; we were in a great error, peradventure God will give us hereafter more then the value of what we have lost, we must beg his grace; thus God chastiseth on earth, whom he pleaseth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the torments of the other world are much more grievous: They that have his fear before their eyes, shall dwell in gardens full of delights. Shall I intreat the good like the wicked? How can ye judge it? have ye a book, wherein you reade what pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you? have we promised to you any content at the day of Judgement? Shall you have that day what ye have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to your selves? Ask of them, who will be surety for their belief? will their Idols, and companions be their surety! Let them cause them to come, if they be true: Be thou mindfull of the day when sins shall be detected, and the wicked shall be commanded to worship God, but they shall not be able to behold him, their eyes shall be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with fear, and their sight covered with shame. They are enjoyned in the world to worship his divine Majesty, but they refuse to perform it; I will punish them by little and little, when they shall least think of it; I will defer the punishment of their crimes, because my wrath is strong; Dost thou demand of men any recompence for thy preaching? are they charged with any expence? Have they in their power the book, wherein is the future, to write therein what they affirm? Attend the Judgement of thy Lord, and be not like him that was swallowed of the Whale. He invoked his Lord in his affliction; if his Lord had not sent him his grace, he should never have come upon earth; when he repented of his sin, his Lord pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and placed him in the number of the righteous.

Say to the people, I have received an inspiration, which some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils heard of me when I read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and that they said, we have heard the miraculous <hi>Alcoran</hi> read, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the right way; we believe in what it contains; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that God hath companions; we believe there is but one God, we believe not that he hath wives, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, our ignorant persons blaspheme against his divine Majesty, nevertheless we imagin that they could not do it. There are who require aid of the devils, and augment their confusion, because they say, that God will not cause any to rise again; some devils have said, we have been as high as heaven, and found it furnished with guards and stars, we staied in a place a little distant to hear; there is one star that watcheth them that hearken, and drives them away; we know not if God hateth the men that are upon earth, or if he will teach them the right way; but we are now in the number of them that believe in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his divine Majesty: they sayd, oh ye people! we were before in the way of error; we heretofore believed that God did not operate on earth, but no person, in whatsoever place he be, can avoid obeying his Will; we heard the book read that teacheth the right way;
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:29476:195"/>
we believe in what it contains; he that believeth in God, will not fear any misery or injustice: there be of us that are good, and that trust in God; others there are, who are wicked and impious: such as obey the Commandements of God, follow the right way, and the wicked shall be precipitated into the fire of hell.

to fortune, or after the barbarous custome of the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> sold him to the <hi>Ismalite</hi> Merchants, who expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him to sale in the Markets, he was purchased by <hi>Abdemonople,</hi> a wealthy Merchant; He after some observation, and experience of his wit and industry, withdrew him from the common drudgery of a slave, to employ him with his other factors in Commerce, and finding him apt for those affaires, gave him the conduct of his Camels into <hi>Syria, Aegypt, Persia,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. By which, in a short time, he became so expert in his Trade, that as be encreased the wealth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Master, so he gained his good will, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>At that time <hi>Heraclius</hi> being Emperor of the East, and the sea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mlesse coat of the Church torne by variety of Sects, and Heresies, the Bishops and Governors in <hi>Constantinople</hi> justly fearing divine vengeance, by reason of the <hi>Nestorian</hi> heresie, which with that of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> began afresh to infect their Clergie, deliberated on some Ecclesiasticall censure against them: When <hi>Sergins</hi> a Monke, and Sectary of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> conscious of his error, and dreading the punishment, fled secretly into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and entertainment with <hi>Abdemonople,</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> where finding slender hopes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating his infectious Heresie (the family being Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans) and lesse of overthrowing his opposites in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, he resolved to take revenge on Christianity it self, and to that effect began to practise on <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as a Subject prepared to receive the impression of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Abdemonople</hi> dyed, his riches being augmented through the care and industry of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> who having before insinuated into the favor of his Mistris <hi>Aijffa,</hi> by presents of rare toyes, procured in his Travels, by them, or through Sorcery (of which he was held guilty, and laboureth to purge himself in his <hi>Alcoran</hi>) so charmed her affection, that of her slave, he was advanced to be Lord both of her person, and fortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:29476:211"/>Being thus grown opulent, he sometime continued his trade, but then willing to take ease, as he had, during his voyages through severall Countries, been a See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and inquisitive concerning the diversity of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons professed through the universe, so now (though irresolute which to follow) he rejected all, as vain, and foolish, except Judaisme and Christianity, and approving the latter as the best, accordingly framed his life, assuming a specious forme of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony, which brod admiration in them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered his former education, and gave him a repute above his expectation. But this hasty fruit was soon corrupted, and with the touch of Ambition (like the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Sodom</hi>) soon vanished into stink and filthinesse.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Sergius,</hi> as subtile, as malicious, observing his disposition, and withall, after some discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two Religions, of both which he found him excellently ignorant, seeing it no difficulty to distill into him the poyson of his Herefic, easily perswaded him, That Jesus Christ was but man simply; that for the merit of his vertues he was held as Deified: that the sufferings of his death were but humane inventions; that he was transported from this life to an immortall, and glorious, by another way then that of Death: That there is but one God, in one Person; so that the Faith of the Christians is vain, and invented; and that of the <hi>Jewes</hi> too loose and leane, through their owne obstinacy. That the <hi>Arabians</hi> being a dull and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, inclining neither to the one nor the other, but all (as many as had been touched with the fame of his new sanctity) admiring his perfections; The <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> being likewise enemies to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the <hi>Christians</hi> at variance among themselves; He might in that juncture of affairs, assume the title of a Prophet sent from God, to disabuse the one and the other, and save the world by another Law. This Counsell of <hi>Sergius</hi> took the desired effect, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi> thoughts, before enflamed with his new gotten wealth, and fame, now entertained more ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:29476:212"/>
of being esteemed a Prophet, looking upon all other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Religion, and sanctity, as vile and abject.</p>
            <p>To this effect, on a sudden he retires to a solitary Cave, not far distant from <hi>Mecca,</hi> while <hi>Sergius</hi> proclaimed the vain perfections of his life, and filled the ears of the people with the noise of his deservings. The terme of two years expired, <hi>Mahomet</hi> again appears to the world, and as if newly returned from Oracles of Heaven, stileth himself a Prophet sent from God, who willing through his mercy, to withdraw him from that precipice of his everlasting ruine, and admonish him of his error, afflicted his body with the falling-sicknesse, which <hi>Mahomet</hi> instead of repenting, made an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to promove his wicked design. For his wife lamenting to see her self yoaked to one so diseased, and tormented with an hideous infirmity, be excused it, and easily wrought in her a beliefe, that being constrained frequently to converse with the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> his fraile body, unable to abide the splendor of his heavenly presence, fell into that distemper, and at the departure of the divine Ambassador, recovered its former conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His wife believing this, was not wanting to divulge the rare qualities of her husband, his admirable sanctity, and frequent converse with the Angell, which gained him the esteem of a Prophet in his own house, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>That this Infant-repute of his Holinesse might be the better strengthened, <hi>Mahomet</hi> thought it requisite to promulgate some Chapters of his <hi>Alcoran</hi> (as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance of his Commission) which as he saw occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he shaped (though ill-favouredly) to his designes, giving out that he received them from the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi> as the Counsells and precepts of God, who for that he had not saved men, either by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Psalmes of <hi>David,</hi> or the Gospell of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> did now promise them infallible Salvation by the means of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which though rudely, yet cunningly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, as complying with the loose humour of the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> enjoyning nothing strict or burthensome, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:29476:212"/>
all to liberty; as the sole means to allure them to a belief of it, induced first the Parents and allies of his wife, then the more ignorant and meaner sort to embrace it, and esteeme <hi>Mahomet</hi> as the Messenger of God sent to guide them into eternall felicity, and the enjoyment of Paradise, which the easier to ensnare them, he fained to be full of such pleasures as fall under sense, and a plentifull fruition of those delights, that in those more barren and desert parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly wanted.</p>
            <p>Having thus drawn to his devotion, a numerous, though vulgar party of the people, who in opinion of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Function were prompt to his obedience; he thought it altogether as easie to obtain a Kingdome, as he had found it not difficult to attain to the title of a Prophet; and to effect this, having before, under pretence of Reformation of Religion, gained many followers, while more stood as lookers on, not at all regarding that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy; he resolved to yoak to it that other concomitant in popular disturbances, liberty, proclaiming it to be the will of God, that all men should enjoy it, and that the Edict might be first obeyed in his own family, enfranchized his Slave, called <hi>Zeidi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bait, as it inhaunced his fame, so it added to his retinue: for as multitudes, affecting novelty, and a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of condition, daily added themselves to his party; so slaves from all parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> forsook their Masters, and fled to him as their Redeemer, and embraced his Law, as the means of their salvation. These through a fond conceit of his piety, ready to sacrifice their lives at his command, he divided into troops, and sent to rob the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans of Merchants that travelled through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, and by this means, having added to his treasure by spoil; and his retinue daily encreasing by a multitude of Fugitives and Vagabonds, who by reason of his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to act any villany, resorted to him; he at length took up thoughts of imploying them in the confirmation of his Law, which he knew to be the ready way to his establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that power to which he aspired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:29476:213"/>To this purpose he marcheth with his Troops towards <hi>Medina</hi> (the place of his birth and buriall) to preach in a Synagogue of Jewes there inhabiting. These lesse stupid then the <hi>Arabians,</hi> could not indure his impostures, and instead of believing, did handsomely beat him, and drive his train from the town. This repulse rather irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting then terrifying him, he drew all his force into the field, and assailed the Jewes in two severall conflicts; in one of which, by a wound on the face with a sword, that broke out his fore-teeth: He signed the Articles of his Law with his blood, and continued a long time as dead in a ditch; but being rescued by his Slaves, and recovered of his wound, he again fought and vanquished them, and converted their Synagogue into a Temple, for his own use.</p>
            <p>The fame of his exploits increasing, with the number of his Sectaries (to whom some Princes and eminent persons of the Countrey began to incline, giving him their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in marriage) awakened the <hi>Nobles</hi> of <hi>Mecca,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the family of <hi>Coreis,</hi> who wisely judging a new form of Religion, propagated by a new way, force of arms, must inevitably introduce a new Government, of which <hi>Mahomet,</hi> of base and obscure beginnings would be chief, as the Author, opposed themselves to his designs, expelled all such as seemed to favour him, out of the City, and severall times gave him battell; in which he so valiantly deported himself, that though he was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put to the worst, yet he more often prevailed; and giving freedome to such prisoners as would imbrace his Law, encorporated them into his Army, strengthning himself, and weakning his enemies. Being in fine a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Conqueror in the field, he assaulted the City of <hi>Mecca,</hi> took it, and after some slaughter of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his enemies, proclaimed impunity to all that would acknowledge him a Prophet of God, by whose favour (as he affirmed) and appointment, not by his own valour, he had attained to that honor. After this Proclamation, many for fear of present danger, and apprehension of future bondage, more out of ignorance imbraced his beliefe, and he injoyed the vaine felicity, to see
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:29476:213"/>
himself Generall of an Army, Lord of a vast Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to be esteemed, and reverenced as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
            <p>About that time <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperor, disposing himselfe rather to improve the Heresie of the <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelites,</hi> then to defend the Confines of the Empire, not onely permitted <hi>Mahomet</hi> to domineere in <hi>Arabia,</hi> but gave advantage to <hi>Cosroes</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> King, to invade his Dominions: but at length awakened by the alarmes of so puissant an enemy, levied a strong Army, and summoned the <note n="*" place="margin">

These motives raised them to a resolution of making defection, so that they elected <hi>Mahomet</hi> their Generall, who incontinently deprived the Emperor <hi>Heraclius</hi> of his Tribute, and his Officers (who were slaine in demanding it) of their lives. After this act, the whole Province, which that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> revolted, and the people generally esteeming the successe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi> armes (which he was diligent to imploy) as a sure testimony of the goodnesse of his Cause, embraced his Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heraclius</hi> having neglected to strangle this rebellion, in its birth, indeavoured to extinguish it, being now growne to considerable strength; and to that end sent an Army under the Conduct of <hi>Theodesius</hi> his Favorite;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:29476:214"/>
his Army was twice overthrowne, the Generall slaine, and the <hi>Mahometans</hi> pursuing their victories, tooke from the <hi>Greeks</hi> the Countries of <hi>Egypt, Syria;</hi> and other Provinces of <hi>Africa,</hi> where <hi>Mahomet</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased his Triumphs, and erected his Trophies.</p>
            <p>Being now growne impotent, rather through his inordinate life, then burthen of years, he retired full of glory, as a King and Prophet, to <hi>Mecca,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to end his dayes, having affirmed it in the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> to be the most holy City of the world, as that wherein stood the Temple of <hi>Abraham,</hi> built miraculously by Angells, to be the Sanctuary of all that repaire thither in Pilgrimage. And therefore it was, that when he had by his Armies taken the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> he durst not enter into it in person, lest by the delightfull and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile scituation of it, he should have been inticed to desert <hi>Mecca;</hi> and contradict his own Prophesie. His life now drawing to a period, a Plurisie surprized him; On the seventh day, for <hi>Crisis</hi> of his disease, he became fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique. <hi>Haly,</hi> one of his successors, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For he told his followers, that he should rise again the third day, and ascend to heaven. They observed this, and guarding his Corps four daies intire, with impatient expectation of his Resurrection, were at length compelled by reason of its putrifaction, to take him up, ond bury him at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi> where his Reliques are annually visited by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Pilgrims of his Religion.</p>

some years after the year of our Saviour 600. <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi> being Emperor at <hi>Constantinople, Sadinion</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome; Clotaire</hi> King of <hi>France, Viteric</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Edbald</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> He was of stature not tall, large si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, &amp; brown color, broad face, his head disproportioned to his Body: yet may we well imagine the beauty of his body, to surpasse that of his mind, which was full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, vicious, and cruell, never sparing any thing to advance his lust (in which he equalled himselfe to forty men) or to procure his revenge. He was (as himselfe confessed) altogether illiterate, and though by nature subtile, and quick witted, yet often pusled for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of delusive Miracles, to confirme the <hi>Arabians</hi> in their Belief. For he continually preached to them, that God had sent him to confirm his Law by force of Armes, and not by Miracles; yet the people instantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them, as signs of his Mission, he was constrained first to tell them of a certain voyage to Heaven, which was briefly thus. The Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> with threescore and ten pair of wings, came to him by night, as he was in bed with his wife <hi>Aijssa,</hi> told him God had sent for him, he going down with this Angell, found at his door an Heterogeneous beast, called <hi>Elborach,</hi> halfe Asse, halfe Mule, but much swifter then either: (for it would go as far at one step as the most quick-sighted could see) this Beast, or believer of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> would not let <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> mount him, unlesse he would first promise to pray for him, which the charitable Prophet did, and was in the twinkling of an eye brought by him to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> tyed the Beast with his girdle to a rock, and taking <hi>Mahomet</hi> on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, carried him to heaven-gate. They knocked, and the Porter understanding <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be there, instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened, and bade him welcome; In this first Heaven he saw Angels, of divers and monstrous shapes; some composed of fire and snow, others of fire alone, every of them diversly shaped; among the rest, one with the head of a Cock, whose feet touched one Heaven, and head ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (each Heaven being distant from the other, a voyage
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:29476:215"/>
of five hundred years) and when he crowes (which is his language) he moves the Cocks of the earth to crow: This Angell recommended him to another, he to a third, and so one to another, until he came to the Heaven, where God kept his residence. God curteously received him, asked him how his people did, how they entertained his Law, and familiarly laid his hand upon his shoulder, which was so cold, that it pierced to the marrow of his back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone. God had soon done with him, only telling him how often his people should make their prayers, which were so many, that as he was returning, in the fourth Heaven, <hi>Moses</hi> advised him to go back to God, and entreat him that fewer prayers might serve his turne, for his people were not able to make so many; which he did, and after many returnes, brought the number to five. This done, he went back to his <hi>Elborach,</hi> which in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought him to his house in <hi>Mecca,</hi> where he went to bed again to his wife, she not once dreaming her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would leave heaven for her company, or thinking he had been there; all this he performed in the tenth part of a night. The <hi>Turks</hi> at this day fondly believe this as a truth, but the <hi>Arabians</hi> of his time requiring him to do as much in their view, he (unwilling to take again so long a journey) replyed, Praised be God, I am man and an Apostle. He had other slights, which in sight of the people, by Art or Sorcery, he performed, and they stupidly believed, and entertained as miracles: as a Pigeon being by him taught to come and pick a pease out of his eare, he told them it was the holy Ghost that came to tell him what God would have him do; so an Oxe brought him a Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> upon his hornes, in a full assembly. He likewise perswaded them, that being at dinner at the house of one that pretended to be his friend (who had an intent to poison him, or he at least was so informed) a shoulder of mutton served in to the table, fore-warned him, that he should not eat of it; and though many were present, none but he heard or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the language of the mutton, and yet he permitted one of his deerest friends to eat of it, and die impoisoned.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:29476:215"/>
Such, and many of the like nature were his miracles: As the bowing of trees, shaken by some sudden gust of wind: the howling of Wolves, and braying of Asses, which is their language, desiring <hi>Mahomet</hi> to pray for them; and he Prophetically understanding, as religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously performed. His custome was often to inculcate into the ears of his Auditors, that God gave him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to fulfill his own desires in all things; and to that purpose introduceth God speaking to him. To thee O Prophet! It is permitted to lie with all women that are given thee, or thou dost purchase, thy Aunts and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and all good women that freely desire thy company, and this is lawfull for thee alone. His issue was one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, called <hi>Casfim,</hi> who died before him, and many daughters; <hi>Fatione</hi> the eldest (in high esteem at this day among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and honoured as the royall root of <hi>Aben Alabecy</hi>) was wife to <hi>Haly. Zeineb</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was married to <hi>Osmen,</hi> after son to <hi>Mahuvias,</hi> and perhaps to both successively, for they both succeeded in the Empire of <hi>Arabia;</hi> to her is attributed the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the other family of <hi>Aben Humeia. Imiaultim</hi> and <hi>Naphisse</hi> are diversly mentioned by the most faithful Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, some delivering them as his daughters, others as his neer kindred. On the Seal which he used, were ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven these words, <hi>Mahomet, Messenger of God.</hi> Heaven or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him to be a scourge for the punishment of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who in multitudes at that time had forsaken the truth, to follow the Sects and Heresies of the <hi>Arrians, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists, Nestorians,</hi> and others. The day of his death was no lesse prodigious, then the course of his life, a Comet resembling a sword, appearing at high noon, pointing from South to North, when it was behold the space of thirty daies, which that age interpreted to portend the fatall rising and spendor of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Empire.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I know the publishing of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> may be to some dangerous and scandalous, dangerous to the reader, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to the higher powers, who notwithstanding have cleared themselves by disliking the publishing, and questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the publishers thereof; but for the danger, I will deliver in these ensuing propositions my opinion, yet with submission to wiser judgements.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though it may be dangerous to such as like reeds are shaken, and like empty clouds carried about with every wind of doctrin, yet to staid &amp; solid Christians, the reading of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Heresies wilbe no more dangerous, then the reading of those errors which are recorded in Scripture, for in them are mentioned many damnable errors and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of the <hi>Egyptians, Cananites, Hittites, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> who denied Spirits, Angells, and the Resurrection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is there more in reading the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> then in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Errors of ancient and modern Heretikes? surely <hi>Tertullian, Irenaus, Epiphanius, Austin,</hi> and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were not of this opinion, who have left upon record to posterity, the damnable heresies of <hi>Arians, Eutychians, Nestorians, Macedonians,</hi> and others: and in the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> there are not such dangerous errors as among the <hi>Tetratheites, Angelites,</hi> and <hi>Theodosians,</hi> who held there were four Gods, or the <hi>Tritheites,</hi> who affirmed there were three, or the <hi>Gnosticks, Manicheans, Cerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Marcionites,</hi> who maintained there were two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Gods, the one good, the other bad, whereas the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> sets down there is but one true God; and although it denieth with <hi>Arius,</hi> the Divinity of Christ, yet it holds him a great Prophet; nor doth it speak so blasphemously of Christ as the <hi>Simonians,</hi> who held <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or the <hi>Ophites,</hi> and <hi>Manicheans,</hi> who said, the Serpent was Christ, or <hi>Menander,</hi> who affirmed himself to be Christ, and the Saviour of the world. Besides; are not the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresies of the modern <hi>Familists,</hi> who deny Christs
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:29476:217"/>
Divinity, making as many Christs, as there be illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elders in their Congregations? are not also the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies of the <hi>Socinians, Antitrinitarians, Adamites, Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etians, Antisabbatarians,</hi> and many others exposed to the view of all that will read them? why then may not the <hi>Alcoran</hi>? Besides, are men debarred from reading the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Poets? nay, are not many of them translated into our English tongue? as also the modern Histories of the East and West <hi>Indies,</hi> wherein are more damnable tenets then any in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and they who have read the <hi>Jewish Talmud,</hi> and <hi>Cabala,</hi> will find them as ridiculous pieces as the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If there were any lovelinesse, beauty, excellency, or any thing else in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> that might win the mind, and draw the affection after it, I should hold the reading of it dangerous, but whereas it is such a mishapen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed piece, I think the reading of it will confirm us in the truth, and cause us love the Scripture so much the more: for as a beautifull body is never more lovely then when she is placed neer a Black-moore, neither is truth more amiable then when it is beset with Errors. <hi>Opposita juxta se posita clariùs elucescunt,</hi> the Gem receives lustre from the foile, the starrs from the night, and fire is most scorching in Frost, even so by an Antiperistasis truth is fortified by error. Who can think that the sight of a Hob-Goblin, or deformed vizard should draw the child from the Nurse or brest of the Mother to embrace it, whereas the sight thereof will rather cause the child hold faster by the mother. The wise <hi>Spartans</hi> oft-times brought drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards into the room where their sons were, not that they should be induced thereby to love, but to abhorr drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, which they could not have done, had they not seen the unseemly and rude carriage, the undecent behaviour, and uncomposed gestures of the drunkard. When <hi>Zisca</hi> had destroyed the <hi>Adamits</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he preserved two alive that they might reveal to the world the wicked er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of that Sect: Who is so mad as to prefer the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a filthy Baboon, to his beautifull Mistresse, or the braying of an Asse to a consort of Musick? he deserves
<pb facs="tcp:29476:217"/>

            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> is translated into <hi>French</hi> and other vulgar Tongues, and the chief heads thereof by <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> in his <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> by <hi>Heilin</hi> in his <hi>Geography,</hi> &amp; by others into our own tongue without scruple or exception; and I pray you, why is the <hi>Arabick</hi> tongue, the language of that false Prophet, and in which he writ his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> so much learned and taught in Schools and Christian Universities, but that by it we may come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Mahomets</hi> La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. There is a kind of necessity we should know evill as well as good, falshood as well as truth, that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the one, and so much more love the other; he that hath smelled a stinking weed will smell with more delight the sweet Rose, he that reads the <hi>Alcoran</hi> will find it smell worse then <hi>Mahomets</hi> carkasse did, which after his death lay putrifying upon the ground, which his disciples
<pb facs="tcp:29476:218"/>
permitted for many daies together, hoping he would have been as good as his word, who made them a promise that he would rise again the third day; but at last finding he had forgot himself, and that his body smelling not so sweet as <hi>Alexanders</hi> did after his death, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bury it, or otherwaies the dogs who were beginning to bury him in their guts had saved them a labour, though Sugar be sweet in it self, yet it is much more sweet to him, that hath tasted <hi>Aloes</hi>; and though <hi>Italy</hi> in it self be a delicious Countrey, and garden of the world, yet it is much more delightfull, pleasant, and beautifull, to him who hath passed over the mountanous, craggy, and rugged Alps: Did not the Prodigall love the bread of his fathers house evermore the better after he had been fed on husks with swine? doubtlesse we shall find, that after we have fed a while upon the course husks of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> with the <hi>Arabian</hi> swine, we shall with much more eagernesse covet after the plenty of our Fathers house, exhibited to us in his Word, where we shall find the hidden Manna, the bread of Life, that came down from heaven.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Books of Palmistry, Phisiognomy, judiciall Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, Necromancy; and other superstitious and impious Arts have been permitted to come abroad, that men might see the vanity of those Arts, the knavery and wickednesse of the Artists, the foolishnesse of credulous people, who suffer themselves to be deluded by them, and the malice of Satan the arch-enemy of mankind, whose delight is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, delude, and destroy men: why then may not the <hi>Alcoran</hi> be read, that men may see the vanity, impiety, and foolishnesse of it, by which the world hath been so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeare cheated and abused?</p>
            <p n="8">8. They that learn Arts and Sciences, desire the knowledge, not only of the good things, but of the evill things also, and the abuse of them, to the end they may avoid them; there Logick speaks as well of sophisticall and fallacious syllogismes, as of demonstrative and topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; Ethicks treats of vices as well as of vertues; Naturall Philosophy handleth the natures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only of usefull and
<pb facs="tcp:29476:218"/>
beneficiall creatures, but also of hurtfull and venomous, as of Serpents; Physick speaks of poysons as well as of cures; Historians describe both the vertuous and vicious actions of Princes; in Divinity we learn, not only what God and good Angells are, but also what Sathan is, and his wicked Angells; in Navigation we must know, not only what places are Navigable, but also what are not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how shall we avoid Rocks, Quick-sands and Shelves if we know them not? even so Christian Religion permits not only the reading of Scripture, but also of hereticall and heathenish books, as is said, that we may know what to embrace, what to shun; therefore if you would know what be the damnable errors to be avoided by Christians, read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and you shall find in it the sink of all, or most part of ancient heresies.</p>
            <p n="9">9.

Of Blasphemic. 3. Of ridiculous Fables. 4. Of Lyes. First, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, he doth ordinarily say, and unsay the same thing; one while he tells us, that he was the first that ever entred into Paradise, and elsewhere he saies he found men and women there; sometimes he affirmes that <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> shall be saved by their own Religion, and sometimes again that none can be saved who embrace not his <hi>Alcoran</hi>; In one place fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Opinion of <hi>Origen,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Origenists,</hi> he affirmed that all the devills shall be saved; in another place he saith, only those devills shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved who hearken to, and obey his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Secondly, of Blasphemy, for he blasphemeth God, in saying that he prayeth for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> intimating hereby that he is inferiour to that God he prayeth to; he makes God also swear by Flies, Wormes, and such base creatures, as if he were their inferiour, whereas God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none greater then himself, swears only by himself; He blasphemes the Father, in saying he cannot have a Son, because he is not married, as if there were no other generation but what is carnall; he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asphemes the Son with <hi>Arius,</hi> in denying his Divinity; he blasphemes the Holy Ghost with <hi>Macedonius,</hi> affirming him to be the Creature of a creature; he blasphemes God also, in
<pb facs="tcp:29476:222"/>
making him the Author of his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> bragging that his name is written upon the Throne of God, in that he is the greatest of the Prophets, who hath more knowledge then all the men and Angels of the world: and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bragging words he uttereth of himself, by which we may see he is that little horn which sprung up among the ten horns of the great and terrible beast of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, destroying three of the <hi>Roman</hi> horns, to wit, the <hi>Asians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi>; this is the horn that hath many eyes, as being crafty and vigilant, but his mouth speaks proud things, in blaspheming and bragging, as we have heard. Thirdly, of ridiculous Stories, and which are more unsavory then the <hi>Golden Legend,</hi> or <hi>Lucians</hi> true Narrations; he tells us that he divided once the Moon, one half whereof fell into his lap, (this was not then the Man in the Moon, but the Moon in the Man) the other on the ground; these two pleces he fouldred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Perhaps in memory of this lying miracle, the <hi>Turks</hi> use it the half Moon for their Armes: He tells us of a great army of men and Angels raised by <hi>Salomon,</hi> but much hindred in their march by an army of Flies, which <hi>Salomon</hi> rebuked, where we have a witlesse conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Salomon</hi> and the fly; he tells you a strange story of <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, how there the Hog was generated of the Elephants dung, and a Rat of the Hogs dung, which gnawing a hole in the Ark, at which <hi>Noah</hi> was affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he touching the Lion on the forehead, out of whose brains leaped out a Cat, (as <hi>Minerva</hi> did out of <hi>Jupiters</hi>) which caused the Rat to run away: this is Philosophy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for a Hog. Fourthly, of Lies, for he belieth God, in making him author of his impiety and heresies; he belies Christ, in saying he was conceived by the smell of a Rose; he belyeth the Holy Ghost, in affirming that he inspired <hi>Mahomet</hi> to write the <hi>Alcoran</hi>; he belyeth the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> calling her the daughter of <hi>Amram,</hi> and sister of <hi>Moses,</hi> confounding her with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> whereas there were so many generations between; he belyeth the Gospel, in saying it is corrupted by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; he belyeth Christians, when he saith they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

many gods, and that they give to God a companion, when they acknowledg the Divinity of Christ; he bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in saying they make <hi>Elcazar</hi> a god; he belies the Patriarchs, in saying that <hi>Noah, Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> believed his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> being so many thousand yeers before he was born, or his <hi>Alcoran</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny existence: he belies also the Apostles, in making them his Schollers, who lived neer six hundred yeers before he was born. By all which we may see, who was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler of this <hi>Alcoran</hi>; not the God of Truth, but the Father of Lies; not Christ and his Apostles, whose weapons in propagating the Gospel, were powerfull preaching, miracles, and patience in suffering; not the sword, the chief means that <hi>Mahomet</hi> useth to force his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> an instrument forbid by Christ, but used by him who hath beene a murtherer from the beginning. But I will not take upon me the task of refuting the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> being already refuted by <hi>Cantacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenus, Richardus</hi> the Monk, <hi>Cusa</hi> the Cardinall, <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manstadius, Savanorolla,</hi> and others. I only thought good, upon intreaty of some learned and religious men, to annex this brief Caveat, that the Reader might be the better armed to encounter with any rub or difficulty be shall meet with in the reading thereof. But before I end, give me leave to cleare my self again in this point; that it is not my meaning all should have the liberty to read the <hi>Alcoran</hi> promiscuously. I know with the Apostle, that though all things be lawful, yet all things are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; there are children as well as men in understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: the nurse may use that knife which the child may not; and that sword which may without danger be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a sober man, cannot without danger be touched by a mad man: There are as well queasie as strong sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, and what is meat to the one, may be venome to the other. Though <hi>Mithridates</hi> could without hurt eat poyson, others may not presume to escape so; it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any to look upon a monster, but it is not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for conceiving women; that iron which an Estrich can digest, may destroy the stomack of other creatures:
