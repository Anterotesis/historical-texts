         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE are subject to nothing more than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness
of Blessings, unthankfulness
for Mercies, or to abuse or misuse them.
When <hi>Israel</hi> was delivered from <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
Slavery, they sang Gods Praise, but
soon forgot his great Goodness to them; in their distress
they cried unto God, but when he delivered them from
their Oppressors and Oppressions, they kicked against him;
when beyond their Faith or Hope they were freed from
their Captive state in <hi>Babylon,</hi> most of them contemned
that Mercy, and chose to continue under Servitude, and
only a few embraced that Liberty. I hope none of you
will be found to imitate them in that ungrateful Obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>That the Obligations God by his late merciful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the like kind hath laid upon you, and the sence
thereof, and of the Blessing you have received by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
most Gracious Declaration, may remain upon you,
and that you may consider what your Sufferings were, and
what you are delivered from, this seasonable Advice is
given to you, by one of your own Number, that now is,
and for about forty years hath been, a Member of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
Church, and purposeth so to continue unto his
death.</p>
            <p>Your Deliverance was from the Jaws of <hi>Destruction;</hi>
you are brought from <hi>Slavery,</hi> to a state of <hi>Liberty;</hi> the
Shackles of Conscience, and Bolts of your Prisons, are
knocked off, and you left free to Worship God in Truth,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39263:3"/>
without Fear; your Houses are no more rifled, nor your
Goods plundered, seized, or sold, nor your Persons, Wives,
Children, Relations, and Friends, crowded into nasty Goals,
on the Perjuries and false Informations of the Dregs of the
People, such who by Debaucheries violated all Bonds of
Conscience, and whose Trade it was to spoil you; Men
as compassionate as Ravenous Wolves, to whose insatiate
Avarice there were no bounds.</p>
            <p>You were not suffered to plead your own Cause, (the
<hi>Press</hi> being shut against you) a favour Heathens always
allowed; you were forced to bear all Injuries, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent:
If you <hi>complained,</hi> it increased your Punishment;
if <hi>silent,</hi> you were sullen; condemned, fined, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
without being heard, or knowing your Accusers,
and that too many times for supposed Crimes you were
not guilty of; ruined, banished, and destroyed, because
you were unwilling to be damned for violating your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
your worshipping of God as you judged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own appointment, was accounted a greater Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
than Adultery, Perjury, Atheism, or Blasphemy.
These were easily expiated; but no Attonement for Non-<hi>Conformity,</hi>
or for not coming to Church; though in many
Parishes in and about <hi>London,</hi> the Churches would not
hold one third part of the Parishioners.</p>
            <p>These Proceedings were accounted <hi>Legal,</hi> and your not
conforming reckoned <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> and such as deserved no
pity; nothing would evince the contrary, or that <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
was concerned therein; loss of all the Comforts of
this Life would not do it, and further Evidence you could
not give.</p>
            <p>This was your State and Condition, as to your Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Persecutions, from which your Deliverance was
extraordinary and unexpected; whereby you are at once
engaged under many Obligations, which if you fail to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
will lie as a Brand of Infamy upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:39263:3"/>
1. You are therefore to bless and adore God, for this
his great goodness and deliverance, the effect only of his
merciful bounty, to whom the praise is due, and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in a godly, peaceable, meek, circumspect, humble, and
fruitful conversation, That will bring Glory, not only to
his Name and Truth, but also to your Profession, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
in the Consciences of your Oppressors a Conviction,
That without any cause they unjustly persecuted you; be
not therefore wanting herein, least you provoke the Lord
thereby again to take this Blessing from you.</p>
            <p>2. Thankfully to acknowledge the Kings Benignity and
Compassion; his Grace was free, and that too after many
great provocations; nor were there wanting those that so
Misrepresented His Majesty, (which you too readily credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
as if he had been another <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Caligula,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Blood and Cruelty was in his Nature and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him; and at the same time you were Represented
as his most Implacable and Irreconcileable Enemies, drest
up in Bears Skins to be baited; and yet under these Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
without Petition or Intreaty, of his own Innate
Goodness and Clemency, he both pardoned, and freed you
from Merciless Oppressors, and from those Cruel Laws, the
Engins made use of to debauch your Consciences, deprieve
you of your Communion with God, and to make your
Lives bitter; a more seasonable mercy could not be given,
and if you are wanting in Thankfulness, Love, and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to His Majesty, you will justly be branded as the
most ungratefull and perfidious.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis Incumbent on you also as men and Christians,
to use your utmost Endeavours by all Lawful Ways and
Means to Extirpate all those <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Tests,</hi> that deprieve
you of this Freedom, or lay any Restraint on Conscience
in matters of Religion, you accounted it your duty (as
<hi>Daniel</hi> did) to break these Laws, when their keenest edge
was turned against you, judging it better to obey <hi>God</hi> then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39263:4"/>
               <hi>Men;</hi> and shall there now be the least hesitation in your
minds, as to the vacating of them? Can you desire again
to be in bondage, even whilst your Wounds are bleeding
fresh, and your Backs soar with the Lashes you received
from them? Will not all men brand your folly, that when
you have an opportunity to be free, and nothing but your
own remiss Inadvertancy can continue or renew your bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
you should be wanting to your selves herein? Who
will then pity you, if your Bonds are again repeated; and
can you expect otherwise, so long as these <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Tests</hi>
are in force, for they have not lost their <hi>Sting,</hi> nor your
Persecutors their <hi>Malice, Prejudice,</hi> and <hi>Revenge;</hi> are they
not the Children of their Fathers, that formerly drove
Thousands into the <hi>American Wilderness</hi> for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences?
are your Sufferings the first persecution by these
Laws? what then means the many <hi>Petitions</hi> and <hi>Apologies</hi>
against them, made by Dissenters in each Kings Reign since
they were first Enacted? Were there no Ministers <hi>Silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>
nor persons Executed, Banished, or Imprisoned before
your days? and if so, by what Laws? and who were the
Authors or Actors therein? And will you suppose they
will do so no more? and that too when those very men
whose pleasure was in your Ruine, do still rage like a Bear
bereaved of her Whelps, and curse you with bitter Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
because restrained from their Cruelty, and deprieved
of their Felicity, which with their debauchery, issued in
your destruction, whose wrath is so boyled into <hi>Envie,</hi>
that they cannot forbear their Threats, but set their Tongues
on mischief, even to the most undecent expressions of
His Majesty himself, for his Fatherly Compassions to you.</p>
            <p>4. Consider that when His Majesties Declaration of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
could no longer be prevented, but was published,
how many Stratagems and Contrivances were used, and
endeavours to deprieve you of the blessing and mercy
thereof; those that first Addrest His Majesty with Thanks
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39263:4"/>
for his Grace and Clemency therein, were (to deter others
from the like) stigmatized as the unworthiest of Men, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers
of the Liberties of the Nation; as if to accept Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
on the Kings Declaration, was to destroy all Law and
Property at once, when yet nothing was done therein but
what all Ages have Recognized, as His Majesties most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Right (which also in a little time will beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
be made most apparent) as to his Power in <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing</hi>
with all these <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Tests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When these Endeavours failed, and many followed that
good Example of <hi>Addressing</hi> His Majesty with Thanks
for His Declaration, and openly met in their Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Bless God for their Liberty, and Worshipped Him
according to their Consciences; Praying most heartily for
all Blessings for his Majesty: Then it was more than
whispered, That there were <hi>Snakes in the Grass;</hi> their
Indulgence would be like the Morning-Dew; it was but
a <hi>Scaffold</hi> to be taken down so soon as the Building of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
was Errected. The Provoked Church of <hi>England</hi>
would turn their <hi>Rods</hi> into Scorpions to all that accepted
this Liberty, of whom <hi>Lists</hi> were taken: that it was not
their Disposition to <hi>Persecute,</hi> but they were necessitated
thereunto, to comply with the <hi>Government,</hi> and so could
not <hi>help</hi> it; that they would do so no more; that it was
not safe to take away the <hi>Penal</hi> Laws and <hi>Tests,</hi> for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>Papists</hi> would be let into Parliament, and would
make what Laws they pleased to ruine the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Bull-work of the Protestant Religion; that those
Restraints and Penalties being removed, a great part of the
Nation would turn <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and could serve in
all Employments with Impunity; and Idoliters would be
Tollerated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For propagating these Jealousies, specious and invective
Reasons were drawn up and dispersed; with a report, that
Priests and Jesuits Preached in your Meetings (without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39263:5"/>
               <hi>where</hi> or <hi>when,</hi> or the Names of such Preachers);
supposing these endeavours might again be successful as
they had been in preventing the Dissenters Petitioning his
Majesty for their Liberty; and in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Il's
time, to the Rejecting his Declaration of Indulgence; which
gave him such provocation, as that it became an occasion
of his withdrawing his Tenderness and Clemency to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,
in that they were not true and steady to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and not be trusted, but consented to be as a <hi>Cats
paw</hi> to gratifie the humour and designs of those that sought
their ruine.</p>
            <p>5. All these suggestions, insinuations, and aspersion are
manifestly groundless and absurd; for if these <hi>Laws</hi> and
<hi>Tests</hi> be taken away, What then can abridge your Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
Men may (as you must expect they will) be <hi>angry</hi>
but they cannot <hi>hurt</hi> you: The Snake in the Grass, <hi>viz.</hi>
A Spirit of Persecution, may <hi>Hiss,</hi> but not <hi>Bite.</hi> The
Building will endure and stand as firm as a Rock, and the
Protestant Religion not shaken; all (but such as delight in
Mischief and Oppression) will rejoyce: See the Blessing and
Benefit of Liberty of Conscience! the Peace and Concord,
the Increase of Trade, and Prosperity to the whole Nation.
That the Foundation of the Government it self will as
soon be taken, as your Liberty infringed; so that you need
not fear the rage of any, or their threats of Scorpions.</p>
            <p>What danger can there be of <hi>Papists,</hi> or any other in
Parliament, when all Interests will be engaged against
such as shall attempt to Invade this Liberty? Besides, who
shall Elect such great numbers of Papists, and where will
they be Chosen? If it be supposed that they may sit by
undue Returns; that may also be prevented by the very
Act of Parliament that Repeals those <hi>Tests</hi> and Penal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
and such security provided for therein, as that it shall
not be in the power of any to infringe the Liberties of the
Nation, or of any sort of People therein; and that too by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39263:5"/>
more justifiable and safer methods than those <hi>Tests</hi> and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Statutes that have been the Burthen and Oppression of
the Nation; shutting out of Parliament and all places of
Trust, not only the <hi>Papists,</hi> but also <hi>all others,</hi> which are
not a few, that cannot conform to the Ceremonies of the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> and is it your Interest to be shut out
of all Trusts, and rendered <hi>useless</hi> (however otherwise
quallified) or that all <hi>Honours, Places,</hi> and <hi>Profits,</hi> should
be distributed only amongst one sort of men, many of
whom have been your Oppressors, and are not a little
provoked at your Liberty, and such as please themselves
with the hopes of Revenge?</p>
            <p>The Allegation, that their Persecuting was to comply
with the Government, and that they could not help it, is
manifestly absurd to all that knew his late Majesties Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
who, did he brow-beat for his Clemency, was he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
'twas to please the men of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
did he at any time give Directions for it, 'twas at the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
instance of their many-repeated irretating Addresses,
and false Representations made of the Dissenters. And his
present Majesty on his first access to his Government, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Indulgence granted by his Gracious Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in which he was opposed by the men of that Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Practice: However, they were not necessitated
thereunto, but acted therein freely, either out of Principle,
or against Conscience; and in neither Case are they again
to be trusted: for the same men will re-act the same thing
on the like occasion, if those Laws and Tests continue in
force.</p>
            <p>6. That Liberty of Conscience should bring in <hi>Popery,</hi>
is a Paradox not to be understood by any thinking man.
If Popery be the effect of preaching the Gospel, let Popery
come in: and if the Learning and Piety of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> with their Dignities, Honours, Livings, and Fat
of the Land, will not preserve it, and maintain those Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39263:6"/>
without Tests and Penal Statutes, her Canons of
Crueltie and Destruction domineering over other mens
Consciences, and inslaving the Nation to their Pride and
Avarice, let that Church fall, and no more pretend to be
such an Impregnable Fortress.</p>
            <p>7. That the Papists should be so increased by taking away
the Tests and Penalties of the Law in matters of Religion,
is not very probable, since hope of Preferment, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Favour, doth not now so prevail with many, though
men of that Perswasion serve in their Employments with
Impunity; but if it should have such effect, yet the Church
of <hi>England</hi> are no Losers, since thereby they are only freed
of such as would never be serviceable to them nor their
Interest, and at best but <hi>deceitful Friends,</hi> a noxious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in the Body, fit to be purged out.</p>
            <p>8. By tolerating <hi>Idolaters,</hi> I suppose is intended the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks, who now dwell amongst us, have <hi>by Law</hi>
equal Right with others to Protection and their Birth-rights,
bound by common Interest, as English-men, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
wish, and endeavour the Welfare of the Nation: and
after all this, must their Throats be cut, or they banished,
because of their different Sentiments in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Will not such usage justifie the Persecution of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
in other Countries, since there is no more difference
betwixt a Papist and a Protestant, than there is betwixt a
Protestant and a Papist? We cannot here practise and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it our selves, and yet condemn the same thing as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and cruel in others; nor can any suppose any Popish
Opinion worse than the Jews Execrations and Blasphemies
of our Saviour, and yet there's no scruple of tolerating
<hi>them:</hi> They are at worst but <hi>Tares,</hi> and by Christs dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
such are to grow <hi>with the Wheat,</hi> until the Harvest;
besides, it's the <hi>Angels,</hi> not men, that must weed them
out.</p>
            <p>9. Be true therefore to your own Interest; spare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39263:6"/>
Root nor Branch of those <hi>Tests</hi> nor <hi>Penal Statutes,</hi>
they are and always have been Snares, in which only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious
men, such as scrupled Impositions and humane
Inventions in the Worship of God, have been catched;
when <hi>Atheists,</hi> and men of debauched Consciences, have
not been bound by them. The Uniformity in Religion
inforced by them, hath ruined many <hi>thousands.</hi> Let them
do no more such Mischief, since the Church of Christ needs
no such Auxiliaries for its preservation; and <hi>Truth</hi> is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than <hi>Error,</hi> without such Coertion: Therefore let not
designing Surmises and Insinuations of Dangers, where
there are none, amuse your <hi>heads,</hi> nor <hi>weaken your hands.</hi>
Remember, that had <hi>Nehemiah</hi> been discouraged by the
like <hi>Threats</hi> and Surmises of <hi>Sambullat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> he had
never freed they Jews from their Oppression, nor provided
for their Safety, by finishing his building of the Walks and
City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remains one Suggestion more, which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prest as unanswerable, <hi>viz.</hi> That considering the King's
Principles, 'tis folly to suppose he granted his Indulgence to
Dissenters out of kindness, 'twas only to make Tools of
them; nor can they trust his Word, since 'tis a Maxim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Roman Catholicks, That Faith's not to be
kept with Hereticks; and such they account all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
and Dissenters.</p>
            <p>This will require a more distinct Answer than was given
to any other Suggestion; and therefore I shall be more
particular therein.</p>
            <p>Admitting this to be the Case, yet his Majesties Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
is such a Blessing, as calls for Thankfulness to God and
to the King; for thereby you have your present Liberty
and Freedom from all the Slavery and Oppression before-mentioned:
a Reprieve to a condemned man, present Ease
from accute Pains of Stone of Gout, are Mercies for which
men are thankful to God, and the Instrument by which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39263:7"/>
they obtain such Favors and Blessings (and surely your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is not of less value.) Will a condemned man reject
his Reprieve, because it's not yet a full Pardon, or any one
a present Relief, on supposition that the Stone or Gout may
12 months after return upon him? This is the worst that
can be imagin'd of your Case, as to your present Liberty.</p>
            <p>But suppose his Majesty granted this Indulgence out of
Design, and not out of Love to you, yet your Condition
thereby is not worse than it was; you are sure, by woful
experience, that your Persecutors hated you, and causelesly
sought your Ruine, the other can do no more; or is it less
grievous to be ruined by cruel merciless Protestant Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
than 'tis by Papists? Nor is this Suggestion made
out of Kindness or Friendship, but of Hatred, Mischief, and
Design, <hi>viz.</hi> That since they can no longer turn the Edge
of those Penal Laws against you to your Ruine, they create
Fears and Jealousies, to the end that thereby you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so Useless and Ungrateful, as to turn the King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
into Displeasure; and if this can be done, they have
gained their Point effectually, with an opportunity, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Threats, to turn their Rods into Scorpions.</p>
            <p>Do not too easily credit this Suggestion; yet make a
good and profitable use of it, make the best construction,
and take it as real, and carry it to his Majesty: accordingly
be not wanting in your Thankfulness, Love and dutiful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and Obedience to him, that so his Majesty may
have a full satisfaction that his Favours are not bestowed
on an Ungrateful and Obstinate People. And let this Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
become an Incitation to more Circumspection:
Hereby you will disappoint the Designs of your Enemies,
and so prevail on his Majesty, that if it could be supposed
that he was not yet real to you, he would become so; for
he is not impenitrable, nor is he uncapable of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Interest: and if he finds you men useful and
serviceable to a common Interest, and fit to be trusted, you
need not fear being made Tools of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:39263:7"/>
But since the Suggestion is made, if there's any Truth
therein, it becomes absolutely necessary, according to the
Advice already given, to take your first opportunity to
root out those Penal Statutes and Tests; that so they may
be no more the Instruments of Destruction, either in the
hand of the King, or any other that desires your Ruine;
until then, you are ruined by Law; and your Persecutors
justified therein: but when these Laws and Tests are abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
they will be as cautious therein, as they are in the
breach of any other Law, as to Theft or Murther. So
that your Security and Liberty is to be established in, and
by the vacating these Laws and Tests.</p>
            <p>For that part of the <hi>Suggestion,</hi> That there's no Trust
to be put in the King's Word, since Faith is not to be kept
with Heriticks: You have much more than His Majesty's
bare Word for your Liberty; Hath he not by his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
removed your Fears, and to his own satisfaction,
thereby errect his Throne in your Hearts? What else
means his Gracious Acceptance of the many Addresses of
Thanks presented to Him, for his Gracious Declaration;
and his Condescending, Obliging, and Gracious Answers
thereunto; his Dismissing out of his Service (how useful
soever) such as would not by any means be Reconciled
thereunto; and Trusting and Imploying those that are for
Establishing by Law, this Liberty; and Encouraging all to
concur with him therein; he desires and designs you should
not onely have his Word, but a <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for security
of Liberty of Conscience, as well as you have for your
Properties?</p>
            <p>If his Majesty did not intend as real, and as high a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for your Liberty, as he can give; he hath acted most
impolitickly: What need was there then of publishing, in
his Declaration, the Grounds and Reasons on which he
Granted his Indulgence? Which are so weighty, and such
as will abide the severest Test. Hath he not thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39263:8"/>
Himself, his Honour, and Glory, to the highest sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and obliquie, both at home and in all Nations, if he
Violates his Word? hath he not laid the greatest Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on Himself, to assure the whole World that he will be
true and steady thereunto? what need else was there of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
those Reasons, since a bare Indulgence without
them, might have served a Turn? or what reason is
there for his frequent solemn Promises to make it good?
why else is it a pleasing and delightful subject to him to be
commonly talking and discoursing of, and of the benefits
and blessings that will accrue thereby to the Nation?
These things, if not real, are inconsistent with a Prudent
Politick Prince, and below the common sentiments of an
ordinary man.</p>
            <p>Before we can imagine his Majesty is not fully resolved
to make good his Declaration, we must suppose him to be
a man that hath no Zeal for, nor Sense of his Religion, nor
for the men of his own Perswasion: And this cannot be
supposed by any that knows him, and how constant he is
at his Devotions, and how he adventured three Kingdoms
for his Religion, when Wind and Tide ran most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
against him: Would he but have Dissembled his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or quitted it or his Party, he might have been the
Darling of those Times; but he chose to run the greatest
risks and dangers, rather than not to appear what he was.
And shall we, after this, imagine he will have no regard to
his Word, nor provide for the safety of his Party, which
else so soon as he Dies, must be exposed to the uttermost
Ruine, and to the Rage and Fury of these Laws and Tests.</p>
            <p>We have also besides his Majesties Word, the highest
Security he can give for our Liberties; we have not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the particulars before mentioned, but also with his
Word, we have his Interest, which will not Lye: So that
if his Word were of no force, yet he is bound by Interest
to make it good. Doth not his Majesty know, that the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39263:8"/>
Dissenters are not a sort of Treacherous Cowardly Men;
Where's the instance that any of them ever betrayed their
Trust, or refused any Service they undertook, or were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto, how perilous so ever? Are they Droans that live
by the sweat of other mens Brows; or rather, are they
not painful and industrious, addicted to Trade and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories?
Is not a great part of the Trade of the Nation
managed by them, whereby the Poor are imployed, His
Majesties Customs and Revenues increased? Nor are they
an inconsiderable number of his Majesties Subjects; so
that to part with them, he must part with a great part of
his Strength and Treasure, in which his Glory and Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
consists: which happily was no small Consideration
with his Majesty, when he published his Declaration.
And this remains as an additional security unto his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Word; and so much the rather, because he hath A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
Neighbours who will readily embrace all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of increasing their numbers, especially such as bring
Wealth, Trade, and Manufactories with them: of which
they were in hopes, and so blew the Coals of our late Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
until his Majesty happily extinguished them by
his Healing Declaration, and thereby called home many
that on great incouragements were setling amongst them.</p>
            <p>Though some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks have asserted
that Maxim, <hi>That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks;</hi>
yet God forbid there should not be a Man of Truth found
amongst them; or that the Opinion of some should be
charged on all: What Principle or Party of men, can then
be Trusted? Are all the Church of <hi>England</hi> cruel merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Persecutors, because some of them are so (and that not a
few of them neither)? Are they all <hi>Socinians?</hi> And yet they
are greatly Belyed if there are not some such amongst
them. Are they all Debauched, or guilty of Adultery, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,
Blasphemy, and Murther? And yet there are such
to be found in that Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:39263:9"/>
Besides, His Majesty is not onely willing, but most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to put it beyond his power to break the Word and
Faith of his Declaration: What can he do (or is not ready
and willing to do) to give farther satisfaction herein? Let
any man rationally propound it, and let his Majesty refuse
the same, before this, or such like surmises be credited. Is
he not willing and desirous that an equal Liberty to all
should grow up with, and be twisted in his Government?
doth he not establish his Throne on that Basis? hath he
made any Limitations or Restrictions therein, to exclude
any for their Religious Sentiments? hath he ever solicited
any man to change his Opinion and become <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
to increase his Party? who, or where is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this kind? hath he ever Brow-beaten any man
for his Opinion? And I am confident he will most readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concur with his Parliament on the largest and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensivest
Terms for securing this Liberty: and then it will
not be in His, nor any other Man's power to break this
Faith, any more than it is to subvert the Government it
self: Shall all men be trusted on their bare Word; and
shall His Majesties solemn repeated Word and Promise
(that ought to be accounted Sacred) be no security, thô
real instances, strong and most weighty obligations are
conjoyned therewith. Where is that person of any Note
or Figure in the World, that would be so used for his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and benignity? The persons that make these, and
such like Suggestions, are unworthy of his Majesties Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
nor are there any but Ignorant, Wicked, and Maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men that will give them Entertainment.</p>
            <p>You have other Work incumbent on you, <hi>viz.</hi> Since
you have now full Liberty to Worship God without any
imposition on your Consciences, make Conscience to be
found in the constant Practice of his Worship; live not in
the neglect thereof, for that's a Contempt of the Mercy
God hath given you: Was the Truth and Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39263:9"/>
worth the adventuring all you had for? 'Tis not of
<hi>less Value</hi> because it now comes to you at a <hi>cheaper Rate:</hi>
Do not turn <hi>Scepticks,</hi> nor grow remiss in Religion; that's
the way to loose the Blessing of your Mercies; but whilst
you have Seasons and Opportunities, make Conscience to
improve them diligently.</p>
            <p>Hearken not to any Councels, nor give way to any
Passions that tend to stir up Quarrels, Contentions, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions;
this will deprive you of this Liberty, or of its
<hi>Blessing,</hi> to the gratifying of the Devil and your Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
who for carrying on such designs, will take on them
new <hi>Shapes,</hi> and deal by you, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did with
the <hi>Iews;</hi> cover their designed Malice with a Cloak of
pretended Charity and Friendship; your strength is in
Concord, and whilst you mind a <hi>Common Interest,</hi> your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
cannot hurt you.</p>
            <p>Let not an Imposing Spirit or Principle be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you; for that's a Persecution in its kind, as well
as Mulcts, Prisons, and Blood, but bear with, and forbear
each other, notwithstanding differences in Judgments, or
Incitations to the contrary; this is the Spirit of Christ,
and of his Gospel, to which you ought to be Reconciled;
for you profess to walk by Christ's Rule, To do to others,
as you would be done by; and not to censure and judge
others for differing sentiments; which will always be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
we come to the same degree and measure of Knowledge;
a State not to be expected on this side Heaven: Till then
let Charity (which is the Bond of your Perfection here)
knit you together in the pursuit of Holiness and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
Remembring always, That the Bond of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
binds all other <hi>Men</hi> as well as yours binds you:
And if it were grievous to you to be opprest herein by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
can it be easie to another to be in any respect so
opprest by you, that ought to be <hi>Friends?</hi> Will you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
your own professed Principles, to gratifie your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39263:10"/>
and your Lusts; and grieve your Friends to the
prejudice of your own Interests? When haply the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
contended for, may be some obstruse Notions, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
by the ablest and most learned. Consider that
since Conscience (though erronious) binds both to <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
and <hi>Practice;</hi> and acting contrary thereunto, is Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
its not possible that one Man's Conscience can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
or polluted simply by another Man's Principle or
Practice; otherwise to avoid Sin, we must sin against our
own Consciences, or by our Dictates, force other mens
Consciences; or sin wilfully to avoid the supposed guilt of
another Man's: let therefore that <hi>noble Principle</hi> be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and not in the least infringed.</p>
            <p>11. Consider that an <hi>Imposing Spirit,</hi> under which we
lately groaned, is the very Spawn and Spirit of Antichrist,
the Sourse of all Impiety and Cruelty; to which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Iniquity and Guilt of all the Bloud of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Apostles, Martyrs, and Millions of Christ's Servants;
What Wars, Confusions, and Disolations hath this Spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
made in the World? Robing it of its Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
bringing glorious Churches into confusion, wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and impoverishing mighty Monarchs and Kingdoms;
when, on the contrary, poor and contemptible <hi>States,</hi> by
cherishing this Principle of Liberty of Conscience, have
continued their Peace, and grown to greatness of Power and
Wealth.</p>
            <p>Shall we, that have wofully experienced the verity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
approve the contrary, or in any measure contract this
Guilt? Is that lawful, commendable, or a Vertue in you,
which is hateful, wicked, and abominable in others? Do
not justifie your Adversaries in all their Cruelties and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanities,
by making and imposing your Understanding
and Practice as a Guide or Measure for other men; for
thereby every one becomes a <hi>Dictator,</hi> for what's lawful for
one, is lawful for every man. Do not therefore, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39263:10"/>
of Conscience, multiply nor streighten the Terms of
Communion, nor make new Articles of Faith and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
let those Christ hath left in his Word suffice, lest
out of blind Zeal you turn, and keep out of the way, those
that Christ would have gathered and cherished.</p>
            <p>12. Finally, do not studie <hi>Revenge,</hi> for that appertains
to God; let not your Spirits boil up into Prejudice against
those that have injured you; give no opprobrious provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Expressions, that's uncomly for Christians; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
your Lord and Master <hi>reviled not again,</hi> but meekly
and patiently endured the <hi>Contradiction of Sinners;</hi> walk
as you have him for your Example; pray for your Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
as Christ did; forgive your wrongs; walk holily
to God, and righteously to men; live up to your Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
Hereby you will stop the mouth of <hi>Envy,</hi> and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
the Blessing of this day of your Liberty, and God will
continue your Tranquility.</p>

            <p>IT's not my Province, to enquire into the Times, Occasions, or
Reasons, on which the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Tests</hi> were made,
nor whether they are not (especially the <hi>Tests</hi>) against Gods
Word, the indispencible, immutable, and moral Law of God,
common Right, Iustice, Equity, and Law of the Land (though
this will be enquired into, and published;) only this is most
apparent, that by the Act by which the <hi>Test</hi> is established, the
Sacrament (the most sacred Gospel Ordinance of Christ) is
profanely made subservient to Carnal and Secular ends and
purposes, and designed to incapasitate his Majesty from having
any Servant about him (how useful or necessary soever) but
such as either in reality or hypocrisie conforms to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> or to reward any other for
any Service, though it should be the preservation of his Life,
Crown, or Kingdom; or to employ them in any Service, how
fit or important soever: whereby, in effect, he is rendered to
be King only of some part of his Subjects, and haply not of the
greatest part of them neither; nor can he advise in Council,
for his own Preservation, or common Good and Safety of his
Kingdom, with any other sort of men, nor dispense the Iustice
of the Nation by any other hands; whereby also it's in their
power, at any time, without comptrole, to impose what Terms
and Inconveniencies they please on the King and Kingdom,
and to make both his Majesty and all others truckle to them.
On this consideration, many are content to part with all the
<hi>Penal Laws,</hi> but struggle for the <hi>Test,</hi> as knowing that it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitates
them at any time to revive again those Laws, or to
make worse, if worse can be made, and to subject all men to
what state and condition they please: Therefore never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Nation free, but subjected to an Iron Yoke, and your
selves to be lashed with Scorpions for your Consciences, until
these <hi>Tests</hi> and <hi>Penal Statutes</hi> are abrogated, and thereby
both his Majesty and every body else absolutely freed from
them.</p>
