         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN HUMBLE
REMONSTRANCE
From His EXCELLENCY
Sir Thomas Fairfax,
and the Army under his Command:
Concerning the preſent ſtate of affairs,
in relation to themſelves and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
with their Deſires and preſent
Reſolutions thereupon.</head>
            <head type="sub">Preſented to the Commiſſioners at St. Albans, to be by them
humbly repreſented to the Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Deſires as Soldiers, in behalf of our ſelves and
other Soldiers that have faithfully ſerved the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in this Kingdom; as alſo our remaining
Diſ-ſatisfactions, in relation thereunto, may be
clearly collected out of our ſeveral Papers that
have been formerly preſented to the Parliament
concerning the ſame; to which particulars we
have not yet received any farther ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>In our laſt Repreſentation it may appear what our Deſires are, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58867:3"/>
members of the Commonwealth, in behalf of our ſelves and all
others, for the clearing, ſetling and ſecuring of the Rights, Liberties
and Peace of the Kingdom, for the juſtneſs, reaſonableneſs, neceſſity
and common concernment whereof unto all, we dare appeal to the
whole Kingdom and the world; yet we have hitherto received no
anſwer thereunto, nor can hear of no conſideration taken thereupon,
to put the things contained therein, into any way of reſolution or
diſpatch.</p>
            <p>We have ſince that, in purſuance of the firſt and ſecond heads of
our deſires in the ſaid repreſentation, delivered in a Charge againſt
divers perſons, Members of the Houſe of Commons, for divers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
and Practices, to the abuſe and diſhonor of the Parliament,
the inſufferable injury of the Army, the infringement of the Rights
and Liberties, both of Soldiers and Subjects, the breach or hazard
of the Peace of this Kingdom, and the hindring of the relief of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which, though the main things charged with
the miſchievous Deſigns, and further dangerous conſequences of
them; as alſo the conſtant and continued activity of all or moſt of
the perſons charged in relation to thoſe things, be for the moſt part
ſufficiently and notoriouſly known, eſpecially to the Parliament it
ſelf; yet we finde neither any thing done, upon what is ſo known,
nor any way reſolved on, or admitted by the Parliament, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of diſcovery of what is leſs evident unto them: But
rather (as if neither the things charged, nor the preſent ſad
effects, nor future ill conſequences thereof, were at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable)
the whole buſineſs ſeems to be ſlighted, paſt over, or
ſet aſide.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We did with theſe, deliver in another Paper (whereof here
is a Copy annexed) containing divers juſt and neceſſary things, which
we did deſire might be provided for, and done for the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the Premiſes, with more ſafety to our ſelves and the
Kingdom, and with more aſſurance or hopes of a timely and happy
iſſue.</p>
            <p>To which things deſired (which we think all men will judge
reaſonable, juſt and neceſſary) we have yet received no anſwer or
reſolution, nor can finde any conſideration at all had of them,
ſave that a moneths pay is ſent down for the Army (whileſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58867:3"/>
thoſe that have deſerted the Army receive at <hi>London</hi> much more)
and that ſome Votes have been paſſed for annulling the Orders of
the Committee (pretended) for Safety, about liſting of men and
drawing forces together; which Votes we finde rendred but vain
and illuſive, by the continued under-hand practices of thoſe whom
we have charged and their accomplices, in Liſting and engaging men
for a new War, and by a later days Votes not admitting that the
Forces ſo Liſted or engaged ſhould by publique Order be diſmiſs'd or
diſcharged, which with other things we cannot but attribute chiefly
to the prevalent influence of the ſame perſons.</p>
            <p>Now whereas we finde that our firſt Deſire in the Paper laſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
(for preſent ſuſpending the perſons impeached from ſitting
in the Houſe) is judged by ſome to be againſt the courſe and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Parliament, or of ill conſequence in the preſident of it, The
Charge being but general, and no partitular proof as yet produced
to render the proceeding Legal, we cannot but reminde the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</p>
            <p>1. That as the moſt and many things charged (with the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and conſequences of them) ſo the conſtant and continued acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of all or moſt of the perſons charged in relation thereunto, in
miſ-informing, delading, abuſing or ſurpriſing the Houſe, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
are ſufficiently known to the Parliament it ſelf; ſo as the Houſe
might, upon their paſt and preſent Cognizance of the ſame, moſt
juſtly proceed to ſuſpend them (as in many other caſes upon far leſs
occaſions, which never could have produced ſuch ſad effects to the
Kingdom) they have done many other of their Members meerly for
words ſpoken, or things moved in the Houſe (alleaged to be but
againſt Order or Cuſtom of the Houſe) and this without any Tryal,
Proof or Charge, but meerly upon the Houſes own Cogninance of
the things, as we could inſtance in many caſes ſince the Parliament
began.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas many of the things to which the Charge relates, are
things ſpoke, moved or done in the Houſe, ſo as we have yet no clear
way opened, particularly to charge or mention them, or to produce
Proofs to them, without ſome pretence againſt us of breach of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge;
and therefore (though we think no Priviledge ought to
protect evil men in doing wrong to particulars, or miſchie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58867:4"/>
Publique, yet) we have been hitherto ſo tender of Parliament Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
as that we have onely Remonſtrated the evil of ſuch things
done; and ſuppoſing the Houſe to have been (as we did and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and if way were open, without breach of Priviledge, ſhould
not doubt to prove it was) ſome ways miſ-informed, deluded, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,
or otherwiſe abuſed, in thoſe things by evil Members, we have
frequently in former Papers (before the Charge) put the Parliament
upon it (who without colour of breach of Priviledge might do it)
to finde out and diſcover who they were that had ſo abuſed them,
and to diſ-ingage the honor of Parliament from the evil practices
and Deſigns of ſuch Incendiaries.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the ſame difficulties or prejudices lie yet in our way (as
to the particular charging or proof of thoſe things againſt the
Members and the Parliament) though ſo often put upon it in our
former Papers, yet through the powerful intereſt of the perſons
guilty, hath not taken any cognizance, what Members or others
have ſo abuſed them, to draw the Parliament to ſuch diſhonor and
inconvenicnces, We cannot but again more fully and clearly aſſert
(as we have in former Papers, and ſhall yet more particularly, if
need be, remonſtrate) That divers things lately done and paſſed from
the Parliament againſt this Army (as particularly the Order for
ſuppreſſing the Petition) that high Declaration againſt it, and againſt
all that ſhould proceed in it, putting the faithful Servants of the
Parliament and the Kingdom out of the Protection of Law, and
expoſing them as Enemies to the State, &amp;c. to the forfeitures of the
Eſtates, Liberties, Life and all, but for going about in an humble,
peaceable and inoffenſive way, to deſire what was undenyable their
due, and dearly earned, and many other ſuch like proceedings, both
againſt the Army and others, do carry with them ſuch a face of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
Oppreſſion, Arbitraryneſs and Tyranny, as (we think) is not
to be paralleld in any former proceedings of the moſt Arbitrary
Courts againſt any private men, but hath brought in inſufferable
diſhonor upon the Parliamentary Authority and Proceedings
(which we are, and others ought to be deeply ſenſible of) hath tended
to diſoblige all men, eſpecially Soldiers from the ſame, to deſtroy all
juſt Freedom, either of Soldiers or Subjects, and hath conduced to
all other the ſad effects and worſe conſequences expreſſed in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58867:4"/>
Charge, and gives us and others cauſe to conclude, That thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
who have formerly acted and carryed on things in Parliament
for publique good, Right and Freedom, are now awed or over-born
by a prevailing party of men of other private Intereſts crept in, and
that neither we, nor any other can reaſonably expect Right, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Safety (as private men) or to have things acted in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for publique good, while the ſame parties continue there in the
ſame Power, to abaſe the Name and Authority of Parliament, to
ſerve and proſecute their private Intereſts and paſſions, and (under
the Priviledges of Parliament) to ſhelter themſelves under the
worſt of evils or miſchiefs they can do, though to the Ruine
of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We are in this caſe forced (to our great grief of heart) thus
plainly to aſſert, The preſent evil and miſchief, together with the
future worſe conſequences of the things lately done even in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
it ſelf (which are too evident and viſible to all) and ſo in
their proper colours, to lay the ſame at the Parliaments doors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Parliament ſhall be pleaſed, either of themſelves to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and rid the Houſes of thoſe that have any way miſinformed,
deluded, ſurprized, or otherwiſe abuſed the Parliament, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
preſſing and paſſing of ſuch foul things there; or ſhall open
to us and others ſome way how we may (regularly, and without the
ſcandal of breaking Priviledges, come to Charge and Peoſecute
thoſe particular perſons, that in truth have ſo abuſed the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as well as our ſelves) even for thoſe miſinformations, and
other evil and indirect Practiſes or Proceedings in Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they have abuſed the ſame, as in our ſaid Charge &amp; former Papers
is ſet forth. And here, if we may, we ſhould humbly offer it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
Whether it were not a neceſſary expedient for prevention
or remedy of ſuch evils in future, That in things ſo clearly deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the common Right and Liberties of the People, and the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Kingdom, there ſhould be a liberty for diſſenting Members
in the Houſe of Commons (as it is allowed in the Houſe of Peers)
to enter their diſſent, and thereby acquit themſelves from the guilt
or blame of what evils may enſue; that ſo the Kingdom may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
come to know who they are that perform their Truſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and who not. And this proviſion for future, as alſo our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58867:5"/>
Deſires for Remedy in the preſent caſes, as it were clearly good
and neceſſary, in the reſpects premiſed, ſo (we think) the ſame
may well be without farther prejudice or diſcouragement in any
other reſpects to ſucceding Members of Parliament: Provided
always, That no man ſhall be queſtioned or cenſured for any thing
ſaid or done in Parliament, any farther then to excluſion from that
Truſt, which is all that in the preſent caſe we ſhould deſire upon
any ſuch grounds.</p>
            <p>And that future liberty of entring the ſence, we do not here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
as a thing we any way inſiſt on to the prejudice of Parliament-Priviledges,
We only ofter that to conſideration (and that) from
good wiſhes to the Priviledges of Parliament, to render them more
laſting, by being leſs nocent; and indeed, whoever moſt adores or
tenders thoſe Priviledges, will beſt expreſs his zeal towards them,
in taking care they be not abuſed or extended to private wrongs
or publique miſchief; for we clearly finde, and always men may
ſee it, That Parliament-Priviledges, aſwel as Royal-Prerogatives,
may be perverted and abuſed, or extended to the deſtruction of
thoſe greater ends for whoſe protection and preſervation they were
admitted or intended (<hi>viz.</hi> The Rights and Priviledges of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and Safety of the whole) and in caſe it be ſo, the abuſe, evil or
danger of them is no leſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to be contended againſt; and a remedy
the<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>of no leſs to be endeavored then of the other.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Injuſtice in that particular of the Declaration
againſt the Army for their juſt and innocent Petition, may ſeem to
have been recompenſed in the late expunging thereof out of the
Journal books, We confeſs that hath been ſo in great meaſure, as to
the preſent or particular injury unto the Army therein; And we
cannot but acknowledge ſo far, That the Juſtice that lies in thoſe
Votes for expunging thereof, and for their own and the Armies par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
reparation, we ſhould never wiſh more, nor ſcarſe have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
on ſo much to any diſhonor of Parliament in future; we ſhould
rather have been ſatisfied with the Parliaments Declaring, how,
and by whom they had been miſinformed, ſurpriſed and otherwiſe
abuſed, in the framing, propoſal or paſſing thereof as it was, but
as to that particular, or any other of that nature, we ſay as
followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58867:5"/>
1. We never did, nor do value or regard our own injury, or repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in any compariſon to the conſequence of the one, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the other, or to the future ſecurity of the common right and
freedom of this Nation; and accordingly we do not account any repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
conſiderable that extends but to our ſelves in the preſent caſe, and
does not in ſome ſort ſecure our ſelves, and all others from danger of
the ſame or worſe injuries or oppreſſions (as private men) from the wil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
or paſſions of the ſame perſons that have offered and acted ſuch things
againſt us while an Army.</p>
            <p>2. We cannot but imagine and conſider (according to general report)
how the expunging of that Declaration was carryed and obtained;
and upon what grounds or intentions it was given way to; but had
thoſe that procured it been all for expunging it (and that freely) yet
how can we expect better, but that the ſame men who at one time
carryed ſuch a Declaration, and another time expunged it, may the
next day obtain the like or worſe (upon any occaſions wherein it may
ſerve their private ends or intereſts) if they continue in the ſame power
and ſway, and be let paſs in deluding and ſurpriſing the Parliament, as
they have done in the paſt particulars.</p>
            <p>3. The apparant diſhonour and prejudice brought upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in having ſuch a Declaration ſo paſſed, as they ſhould ſoon after
(without any alteration in the pretended ground of it) finde cauſe (for
ſhame of the world) to expunge (we think) ſhould engage thoſe
Members, in point of honour, to finde out and diſcover how and by
whom the Parliament had been abuſed, or otherwiſe brought into
ſuch an inconveniency, and the Parliament may in this ſee the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
(as by-ſtanders do the prevolence) of thoſe members that abuſed
the Parliament in that Declaration, who will and can make the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Parliament to lie under the diſhonour of it in a bare expunging
or retracting, rather then admit any conſideration, to acquit the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Parliamant, that will tend to fix the blame on thoſe particular
Members that had deſerved it: and this certainly would be admitted
and done, rather then to ſlight it over with a bare expunging, were not
ſome men more tender of and more ſwayed with ſuch conſiderations
and conſequences as may tend to the prejudice of Perſons, then ſuch as
tend to the general prejudice and diſhonour of Parliaments.</p>
            <p>4. As to thoſe particulars included in our Charge which depend on
things done without the Parliament, we are ready and ſhould moſt
willingly proceed to the particular charging and proving thereof, if
firſt (from the Juſtice of the Houſe in a preſent proceeding againſt the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58867:6"/>
perſons charged for thoſe things that are already known to the Houſe,
being done in it) we could finde encouragement to expect any good
iſſue upon thoſe other things; and did we not (on the contrary) finde,
that (notwithſtanding what is ſo known to the Houſe as before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt)
the ſame perſons continue in ſuch power and prevalency, both
in the Houſe and in all the Comittees of the higheſt truſt, as leaves lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hopes of Right or Satisfaction to the Army or Kingdom in other
things, and much leſſe in any juſt proceedings againſt themſelves, while
they continue Judg<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of their own and our Concernments: So as we
cannot (while they remain in the ſame power) expect any thing but
a continued perverting and making advantage of all things (and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of thoſe delays which a regular proceeding againſt them would
neceſſarily endure) altogether to our own and the Kingdoms preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
and danger, to diſable or weaken us for thoſe things which the
ſafety and ſe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ling the Rights, Liberties and Peace of the Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and to ſtrengthen themſelves by under-hand-practices and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
at home and abroad, the better to oppoſe us, and to engage
the Kingdom in a new War, thereby to accompliſh their deſires, or
at leaſt to ſave themſelves from Juſtice in a common Confuſion: We
ſay, Were it not for theſe and ſuch other conſiderations that leave little
hopes of Juſtice to our ſelves or the Kingdom (while they continue
in the ſame power) and render all delays dangerous, and deſtructive
to our ſelves and the Peace of the Kingdom, we ſhould be contented
that the buſineſſe concerning the Members we have charged ſhould be
ſaid aſide till thoſe other things were firſt ſetled which our Declaration
does propound for the common Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But finding things ſtill ſo carried, and that while they are Judges in
their own cauſes, they (with that party which they make) will do
what they pleaſe, and yet render it a breach of Priviledge to be amuſed
for it as they are, and we have before expreſt; we cannot, upon all
theſe Conſderations, and for all the Reaſons before expreſt, inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, that the Members charged may firſt be forthwith ſuſpended from
ſi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting in the Houſe, otherwiſe we cannot expect any fair proceeding
againſt them upon a more particular Charge, nor think there is any good
intended to our ſelves or the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>As to our deſires of having the Army preſently paid up equally with
thoſe that have deſerted it, we appeal to all men for the juſtice, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſſe
and neceſſity thereof. The Juſtice, in that the former ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
(for which thoſe Arrears are due) hath been (at leaſt) as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and diligently performed by the Army, as by thoſe late deſerters
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58867:6"/>
of it and in our preſent poſture (though they have appeared indeed
more officious or ſerviceable to the perſons or wills of particular
men then we, yet) we are ſure the Army is, and (we hope) will at laſt
appear to be more faithful to the true intereſt of Parliaments and the
Kingdom, (which we were at firſt called out and engaged for) then
they in diſerting the Army have hitherto appeared: For the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our deſires, though we have grounds to claim more then they,
or rather that they or ſome of them ſhould forfeit their arrears; yet we
ask for preſent but equal, nor ſhould we at preſent inſiſt on that ſo
much (as to Officers) if our ſouldiers were but firſt paid up) our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to inſiſt on that, is obvious to every man, and therefore (unleſs we
ſhould betray our own and the Kingdoms cauſe, we cannot but poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
inſiſt upon it, that the army ſhould forthwith be paid up (at
leaſt) equally to thoſe deſerters of it, which if denyed or delayed, we
ſhall be thereby enforced upon preſent ways of remedy, and right to the
Army therein.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Parliament hath lately ordered and publikely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that all that ſhall deſert the Army, ſhall have preſent ſatisfaction
in their arrears (the Officers three moneths pay, the ſouldiers all their
arrears, deducting for free quarter) which ſtill continues unrecalled;
we cannot but look upon it as a moſt cleer evidence of the continuing
mal<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce and prevalence of ours and the Kingdoms enemies; and we
muſt and do inſiſt upon it, that that Order or Declaration may forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
be publickly recalled; otherwiſe we cannot believe that any
thing but ruine and deſtruction is deſigned to our ſelves and all other
in the Kingdom, who every where call upon us not to disband, till we
ſee the Rights, Liberties, and Peace of the Kingdom ſetled, according to
the many Declarations by which we were firſt called forth, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to engage in the late war.</p>
            <p>Next, we cannot but take notice, that inſtead of granting or anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our deſires in the laſt paper, in order to the better and more ſafe
proceeding to a compoſure and ſettlement of all things, for the good
and peace of the Kingdom, and for prevention of any new war, the
Army being firſt commanded to forty miles diſtance from London;
his Majeſties perſon is demanded immediately to Richmond Houſe,
within eight miles of London, which as we cannot but impute it to the
prevailing intereſt of the ſame enemies to our and the Kingdoms peace,
ſo all men may eaſily diſcern (with us) how directly it tends (in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their former private deſignes upon the King ere he came from
<hi>Holdenby,</hi> to put his Majeſty within reach of thoſe mens power, who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58867:7"/>
have underhand liſted about London already, a very conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
both of Horſe and Foot, and are daily liſting and engaging more,
both there, and in many parts of the Kingdom, to ſerve their deſignes;
and therefore we appeal to all unengaged men, whether we can in this
give way to have the King put ſo far within thoſe mens power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving them the long ſought for advantage of his Majeſties Perſon;
whereby to embroil this Kingdom in a new and bloudy war, and to
ſtrengthen themſelves in their miſchievous deſignes, the better to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and eſtabliſh their facton and intended domination; ſo that in this
caſe we cannot but importune the Parliament (as they tender the peace
and ſafety of the Kingdom, and the avoiding of jealousies or worſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
in the Army) that they would reſume the conſideration
of that buſineſs concerning the Perſon of the King, and not propoſe any
place for Him neerer to London, then they would have the quarters of
the Army to be.</p>
            <p>And whereas (by the procurement of the ſame perſons, or others of
their party) there have been ſcandalous informations preſented to the
Houſes, and induſtriouſly publiſhed in print, importing as if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
were kept as a Priſoner amongſt us, and barbarouſly or uncivilly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
we cannot but declare, that the ſame and all other ſuggeſtions of
that ſort are moſt falſe and dangerous, &amp; abſolutely contrary, not onely
to our declared deſires, but alſo to our principles, which are moſt cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for a general right and juſt freedom to all men; and therefore upon
this occaſion we cannot but declare particularly, that we deſire the
ſame for the King and others of his party (ſo far as can conſiſt with
common right or freedom, and with the ſecurity of the ſame for future)
and we do cleerly profeſs, we do not ſee how there can be any peace to
to this Kingdom firm or laſting, without a due conſideration of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the rights, quiet, and immunity of His Majeſty, His Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and His late partakers; and herein we think that tender and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable
dealing (as ſuppoſing their caſes had been ours) and a ſpirit of
common love, and juſtice diffuſing it ſelf to the good and preſervation
of all, will make up the moſt glorious conqueſt over their hearts (if
God in mercy ſee it good) to make them and the whole people of the
land laſting friends.</p>
            <p>To draw to a Concluſion; ſince we can yet obtain no ſatisfaction or
anſwer to the things deſired, as before, but contrariwiſe finde all things
carried on by the prevailing intereſt of thoſe our enemies, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
and danger of our ſelves and the Kingdom, ſince (notwithſtanding
ſome Votes of Parliament againſt the late Orders of the Committee of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58867:7"/>
Safety for liſting of Forces, and notwithſtanding the earneſt deſires
and endeavours of the City, concurrent with our own, to have the
ſame prevented or remedied, yet) the ſaid Committee of Safety being
continued ſtill in the ſame power, we finde that by the appointment or
contrivance, and under the protection or countenance of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
whom we have charged, and their accomplices, there are ſtill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
practices under-hand to liſt and raiſe new Forces, and (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the diſcovery thereof to the Parliament from the City,
yet) the ſame perſons have prevailed ſo far in the Houſe, as not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the queſtion for diſcharging of them, but the ſame practiſes ſtill
continue, and with double diligence are enforced; ſince alſo divers
Forces (pretended to have been engaged for <hi>Ireland</hi>) are by the ſame
perſons ordered to Rend<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zvouze about <hi>Worceſter,</hi> there to lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a new Army; and to that purpoſe their Emiſſaries and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents
in all Counties are buſie and active to raiſe Forces for
then: And though for theſe things the Actors of them have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Publike Authority, yet they have ſome way ſuch countenance and
aſſurance to be juſtified in Parliament (if queſtioned for it) as that they
have the confidence to act openly: Since they have likewiſe their Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
or Agents in <hi>Scotland, France</hi> and other Countries, very active
to draw in Forraign Forces for their aſſiſtance: Since in the mean
time they are endeavouring by Spies and ſecret Agents in all our Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to inveigle and invite the Souldiers of this Army to deſert their
Officers and come to <hi>London,</hi> and for that purpoſe do improve the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of that Order or Declaration of Parliament aforementioned,
for ſatisfaction of Arrears to ſuch as ſhall deſert the Army; and we
finde they have the publike Purſe ſo much at their diſpoſal, as to make
good that and other their undertakings of that naturel, and yet ſuch as
have ſo deſerted the Army, and received their Arrears, are not diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
or diſperſt, but continued together in Bodies, and under Command,
in or neer the City (as in particular, ſome of Sit <hi>Robert Pye</hi>'s men,
Col. <hi>Grevis,</hi> Capt. <hi>Farmers,</hi> and others ſtill quirtered upon <hi>Kent:</hi> Since
like wiſe they have their Agents and Correſpondents labouring with
the King, to make Contracts with Him, to draw His Majeſtie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
and declare for them, or at leaſt to declare himſelf a priſoner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, whereby to ſtir up and engage his party againſt us: Since
in all theſe reſpects, we finde all dilatory ways (which they induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſly
deviſe) to be deſigned and made uſe of onely to our diſadvantage,
weakning and ruine, to the Kingdoms prejudice, and to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and ſtrengthening in their deſignes, the better to prepare for a
new War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:58867:8"/>
And laſtly, conſidering the multitudes of Reformadoes and other
Souldiers ſwarming about the City (whom the perſons we have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and their accomplices have at their beck to bring up to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
when they pleaſe) and that by their frequent tumultuous confluences
thither (beſetting and ſometimes blocking up the Parliament doors,
threatning and offering violence to the perſons of the moſt faithful Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-men)
the juſt freedom of Parliament ſeems to be taken away,
or at leaſt for the preſent abridged, inſomuch as thoſe Members who
have ſerved the Kingdom hitherto with moſt faithfulneſſe, diligence and
integrity for the Publike good, many of them dare ſcarce come to the
Houſe, or (if they do) they come in fear and peril of their lives; and
when they are there, are awed, diſcouraged, or diſabled from diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their Conſciences, or doing their duties to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe Conſiderations, we are clearly convinced and ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That both our Duty and Truſt for the Parliament and Kingdom,
calls upon us and warrants us, and an imminent neceſſity (for our own
and the Kingdoms ſafety, and preſervation of a new War) enforceth us
to make or admit no longer delays, but, upon thoſe foundations God
hath given us, with vigour and ſpeed to endeavour in ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way, the vindicating of Parliament-freedom from tumultuous
violence, the breaking of thoſe deſignes and preparations that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
threaten a preſent imbroilment of the Kingdom in more blood
and War, and a future perpetual enſlaving of it under Faction and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
and ſo (if God ſee it good) to put the Parliament into a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and capacity (with His Majeſties wiſhed and hoped concurrence)
to ſettle the Rights, Liberties and Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe grounds, and for all theſe ends premiſed, we ſhall be
enforced to take ſuch courſes extraordinary as God ſhall enable and
direct us unto, to put things to a ſpeedy iſſue, unleſſe by Thurſday night
next we receive aſſurance and ſecurity to our ſelves and the Kingdom,
for a more ſafe and hopefull proceeding in an ordinary way, by having
thoſe things granted which in order thereunto we have before inſiſted
upon, and ſhall here for more brevity and cleareneſſe, as followeth:</p>
            <p>1. That the Declaration inviting men to deſert the Army, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
their Arrears in caſe they doe ſo, be recalled and annulled.</p>
            <p>2. That the Army may be preſently paid up equally to thoſe that
have deſerted it.</p>
            <p>3. That his Majeſties coming to Richmond may be ſuſpended untill
things be better ſetled and compoſed; and in the mean time no place
may be appointed for his Majeſties Reſidence, that may be any neerer
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58867:8"/>
to London, then the Parliament will allow the Quarters of the Army
to be.</p>
            <p>4. That the Members charged may be forthwith ſuſpended or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred
from the Houſe.</p>
            <p>5. That thoſe that have deſerted the Army may be inſtantly diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and diſperſt, and receive no more of their Arrears, till the Army
be firſt ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>6. That both Parliament and City may be ſpeedily and effectually
freed from thoſe multitudes of Reformadoes and other ſouldiers before
mentioned, that flock together about London, by a ſpeedy diſpatch and
diſcharging of them from the City.</p>
            <p>7. That all ſuch Liſtings, or raiſings of new Forces, or drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of any (as is before mentioned) and all preparations towards
a new War, may be effectually declared againſt and ſuppreſt: as alſo all
invitations or indeavours to draw in forraign Forces.</p>
            <p>8. That the preſent perplexed affairs of the Kingdome, and theſe
concerning the Army, as alſo all the things deſired in our late Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
in behalf of the Kingdom, may be put into ſome ſpeedy way,
of ſettlement and compoſure.</p>
