            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

all parties pretend to, though never

and we may read it, Buy <hi>Truth,</hi> as afterward <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> &amp;c. Not
the Wiſdome: and ſo leave the word <hi>Truth</hi> in its juſt latitude.</p>
            <p>Here then is a point of Heavenly negotiation or Spirituall traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
which the Holy Ghoſt commendeth to all who deſire to make
a wiſe improvement of that ſhort ſpan of time allotted them in this
world, and to give up their account with joy.</p>
            <p>That ſenſe which one Expoſitour giveth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Pellican.</note> maketh this place paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell

though it be a truth cleerly held forth in Scripture, and may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
included in this Text as a part of the ſenſe, or inferred from it
as a conſequent, yet I conceive it is farre ſhort of the full and direct
meaning of the place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I concurre with thoſe who underſtand it thus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mercerus. Junius. Janſenius.</note> Get poſſeſſion of the
<hi>Truth</hi> whatſoever paines it coſt thee, whatever hazard it may lead thee
into, whatſoever loſſe or ſuffering it may bring upon thee. Sell it not:
Doe not part with it to gain a world, leave it not, loſe it not, for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
advantage under Heaven.</p>
            <p>In the words ye may eaſily ſee two Propoſitions, 1. An affirmative,
or precept, <hi>Buy Truth.</hi> Secondly, A negative, or prohibition, <hi>Sell
it not.</hi> In theſe obſerve 1. The Acts. 2. The Object: the
Act enjoyned in the precept or affirmative is, <hi>To buy,</hi> the Act for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
in the negative or prohibition, is, <hi>To ſell.</hi> The object is the
ſame in both, <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The precept and prohibition of theſe two Acts in reference to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112927:3"/>
the ſame object, are both of them abſolute and peremptory, we
are abſolutely commanded to buy <hi>Truth,</hi> peremptorily forbidden
to ſell it: and ſo the parts of the Text mutually give light each to
other, ſhewing that <hi>Truth</hi> muſt be ſo bought as never to be ſold:
that he who buyeth it, cannot overbuy it, that he who ſelleth it,
ſhall be ſure to underfell it. It can never bee bought too deare,
it can never be ſold at the true value. He that buyeth it at the higheſt
rate ſhall be an happy gainer, he that ſelleth it to the beſt advantage,
putteth it off with loſſe, he maketh a miſerable bargaine.</p>

               </label> But it may be ſaid, the parts of the Text ſeem rather to croſſe than
to cleer each other: for if there be no ſeller, there can be no buyers.
If the prohibition be obſerved, forbidding all to ſell, the precept
cannot be performed, commanding all to buy. 
<label type="milestone">

               </label> I anſwer, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

to buy, all men are forbidden to ſell: but they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to buy of men, who are forbidden to ſell, but of God,
who is the onely Proprietary of this rich treaſure, and doth not
impoſe this Law of not ſelling upon himſelfe.<note place="margin">

not prove bankrupts in the great day of account, a neceſſity lieth
upon them, and woe unto them if they buy not <hi>Truth.</hi> Let their
Ships ſeeme never ſo well fraighted, their Shops and Ware-houſe
never ſo richly furniſhed, yet if they want this pearl of great price,
they are broken and undone for ever. The fooliſh virgins had their
lampes, and it may be for a time made as faire a blaze in ſhew as

thoſe of the wiſe: but they wanted <hi>Truth:</hi> their oyl was ſpent, their
lamps were extinguiſhed, they went to buy when market was done,
they called and knocked when it was too late, the doore was ſhut.</p>
            <p>For the cleering and proofe of the point, and our more orderly
proceeding, I deſire you to conſider with me theſe four things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What this <hi>Truth</hi> is, which we are required to Buy?</item>
               <item>2. What it is to buy <hi>Truth?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Of whom it muſt be bought?</item>
               <item>4. The neceſſity of making this purchaſe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the 1. Of theſe, what this <hi>Truth</hi> is which we muſt buy, 1. There
is <hi>veritas rei,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Veritas rei.</note> or <hi>veritas in eſſendo,</hi> The truth of things, the truth of their
eſſence or being: and ſo all things that are, are truly the ſame which
they are, ſo gold is true gold, oppoſed to that which is falſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
but pretended to be gold. And this truth of things, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of things to the Divine intellect or knowledge of God. And
therefore (by the way) I conceive that thoſe lies are untruths which
are called <hi>mendacia iocoſa</hi> or <hi>officioſa,</hi> officiouslies, or lies in jeſt, if they
be ſuch as in no regard tend to our neighbours prejudice, are not ſo
fitly ranked under the 9. Command. as reduced to the firſt: becauſe
they contradict that <hi>Truth</hi> which is in the minde of God: for the
Lord in His infinite knowledge comprehendeth, and (as it were) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth
all <hi>truth:</hi> and every untruth uttered by men is either a deniall
of ſome Truth which God affirmeth, or an affirming of ſome falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
which God denyeth: and ſo no man can utter any falſhood
(though concerning matters of ſmall moment) but in ſo doing he
giveth God the lie. God His knowledge is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or originall
<hi>Truth:</hi> and the truth of things is their correſpondency thereunto, as
the truth of a copy is its correſpondency with the originall. For
<hi>Truth</hi> carrieth a reſpect to knowledge, <hi>omne verum eſt intelligibile,</hi>
every Truth is in a capacity to be underſtood, and the Truth of
things is their conformity to a right underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Now the truth of things may come under a two-fold Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
1. Metaphyſicall, 2. Morall: and in both of theſe it ſtill hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good, their truth is their Conformity to the knowledge of God.
For 1. God knoweth what every perſon, action or thing is, and ſuch
it truely is, as God knoweth it to be, and no other: and this I call
a Metaphyſicall Conſideration. Secondly, God knoweth what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
perſon, Action or thing ought to bee, and ſo farre as any of
theſe croſſe this knowledge of God, they are falſe in a morall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112927:4"/>
They are true in a Metaphyſicall apprehenſion, becauſe
they are ſuch as God knoweth them to be, but they are falſe in a
Morall notion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 6.</note> becauſe they are not ſuch as God knoweth they
ought to be. <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the Righteous,</hi> how? with
approbation. This is true: but I think there is more in it: The Lord
knoweth what is that good way wherein men are to walk: and the
way of the Righteous is ſutable to this knowledge of God, and ſo
the Lord knoweth it, that is, looketh upon it as an object con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to this knowledge of His; on the other ſide, He ſaith to
the wicked,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 12</note> 
               <hi>I know you not.</hi> I know what manner of perſons ye
ought to be, but ye are men of another ſhape, ye are not objects
conformed to this knowledge of Mine.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Veritas. Scientiae.</note> There is <hi>Veritas ſcientiae,</hi> or <hi>veritas in cognoſcendo,</hi> Truth
of knowledge, and that in the creature is twofold, 1. Speculative,
which is a conformity of the underſtanding to the nature of things,
when the underſtanding of man ſo judgeth of things as they are,
and the notions or conceptions of his minde are the very images
of thoſe things, this Conformity of his underſtanding to the
nature of things apprehended by him, is truth. Things are
true, as they agree with the knowledge of God: becauſe his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is the Fountaine of all truth, as his eſſence is the Fountain of
all being: But the knowledge of man is true becauſe it agreeth
with the nature of things. Secondly, The practicall truth of mans
knowledge is when together with a right apprehenſion of the true
nature of things in the underſtanding, there is a frame of heart and
affections toward thoſe things, ſutable to that apprehenſion, when
the underſtanding rightly judgeth of things good or evill, and the
will and affections are regularly guided by ſuch a right apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
loving, imbracing, deſiring, delighting in that which the
underſtanding rightly judgeth to be lovely, deſirable, &amp;c. Hating,
abhorring, ſhunning, &amp;c. According to that true intelligence which
the underſtanding giveth in of the nature of things or actions; then
there is a practicall truth in that mans knowledge. But when the
underſtanding rightly apprehendeth, and yet giveth way to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe
of the will and diſtempers of the affections, this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
though ſpeculatively true, is practically falſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Veritas Signi.</note> There is <hi>veritas ſigni,</hi> Truth of expreſſion, Speeches,
writings, geſtures, Actions, when truth poſſeſſeth the minde and
heart within and ſhineth out at the windowes (as it were) when a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112927:5"/>
mans words and converſation are the very image and Characters of
that truth which dwelleth in him, when hee knoweth and loveth
the truth, and ſpeaketh and walketh according to that truth which
he knoweth and loveth.</p>
            <p>Now then what is that truth which we muſt buy? 1. The true
knowledge of thoſe things which ſerve for the perfecting of the
inner, and for the ordering of the outward man: the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, of Chriſt, of the myſteries of grace, of the wayes
of God, of the power of godlineſſe, of the will of God in things
concerning the matter and manner of his worſhip, and in thoſe
things that belong to our Places, Callings, Relations, in
ordinary and extraordinary occaſions. Secondly, The Practicall
truth of theſe things, ſuch a frame of heart as ſuiteth with the
nature of theſe things rightly apprehended: which cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the poſſeſſion of the things themſelves. Thou muſt have God
dwelling in thee, thou muſt poſſeſſe Chriſt and be made one with
him, thy body and ſoule muſt become a temple of the Holy Ghoſt,
otherwiſe thou haſt not this Practicall, through, and effectuall
knowledge of God and Chriſt: thou haſt a ſhadow of the truth
rather then the truth it ſelfe. Thou muſt have the truth of all ſaving
Graces in thee, otherwiſe thou canſt not have an heart ſuited to a
right apprehenſion of Divine truth. Laſtly, thou muſt be ſo poſſeſt
of the truth as to ſpeak the truth from the heart, and to walk in
the truth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be enquired,<note place="margin">2. What it is to Buy <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </note> is, what it is to buy truth.</p>
            <p>To buy in generall, is, <hi>For a conſiderable value with conſent of the

maketh good what I ſaid before, we cannot buy truth too dear: all

And therefore, we may conclude, This buying is not of the nature

the price and the purchaſe, but rather ſuch as hath ſome remote

in ſincere love. No man buyeth truth, who doth not truly love it.

purchaſeth outward things, to diſpoſe of it at his pleaſure: thou
muſt not buy it as men were wont to buy ſlaves, to keep it in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,

give up thy ſelf to be ruled &amp; guided by the <hi>truth.</hi> Some (I beleeve)

and to controll, it will not ſuffer them to bee private when they
would: theſe would have <hi>truth</hi> enſlaved, and luſt predominant. But
to pretend to <hi>truth</hi> and not to allow it that Soveraignty which

ye are become ſuch indeed and in truth as the light diſcovereth thoſe

thou ſhalt be ſaved: there is a beame of <hi>truth:</hi> and then do we buy
this <hi>truth</hi> indeed, when we get that precious Faith of God his elect,
that Faith unfeigned which really uniteth the ſoul to Chriſt, taketh
root in him, draweth life and ſpirit from him, conformeth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth

thee a counterfeit ſtone inſtead of this precious Pearl: a falſe Faith,
a vaine fancy, an empty ſhadow of Faith: how many content

had for nothing? But if ever that caution be needfull, it is in this
caſe,<note place="margin">Caveat Emptor.</note> 
               <hi>Caveat Emptor,</hi> Let him that would buy <hi>truth,</hi> beware. It
is not in this caſe, as when a man would buy a thing to pleaſe a
childe, a ſlight toy of ſmall value will ſerve as well as a better: but
it is as if a man were to buy a ſhip to tranſport himſelfe, his whole
family and all his goods into a far-country: were it not the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of folly to venture all in a rotten veſſell for ſaving of charges,
rather then with greater coſt to provide a ſubſtantiall bottome? Oh
let us tremble to embark our ſouls (more precious then the world)
together with all our eternall hopes in a leaking ſhip of a rotten
faith, being to make ſo great a voyage, among ſo many dangerous
Rockes and ſands, through ſo many ſtormes and waves, which
were too much for the ſoundeſt Faith to breake through were

If thou doeſt, thou buyeſt a Kingdome, yea a Kingdome more

it, indeed, thou muſt have this Kingdome ſet up in thy heart.
Righteouſneſſe muſt reigne there, or Chriſt muſt reign there in

<hi>The Peace of God muſt rule in thy heart:</hi>

when ſin reigneth, the ſoul hath no peace with God, it may be in a

to be <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> there were differences about the obſervation of
<hi>Moſaicall</hi> Rites, and Ceremonies: this prejudice did not keepe the
faithfull <hi>from imbracing and holding faſt the truth of the Goſpell.</hi> In
<hi>Luthers</hi> time there were controverſies betweene thoſe who were
newly come out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> this prejudice did not ſo far prevaile
with the Godly, as to make them preferre their ſlaverie under <hi>Anti-Chriſt</hi>
above the ſweete yoake of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Let the unanimous and
full conſent of the Godly in many, and thoſe the moſt ſubſtantiall
parts of truth, encourage thee to buy the truth: let not their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
about few and leſſe materiall things diſcourage thee.

when the Lord calleth for it. And here obſerve that although truth
be alwaies alike precious in it ſelfe, yet at ſome time the purchaſe
of it is more coſtly then at other. Bread-Corne it is as good in it
ſelfe, and as neceſſary for the life of man at one time as at another,
yet ye know in ſome time of ſcarcity one buſhell may coſt as much
as three or foure in times of plenty; but whatever it coſt it muſt be
had, Men muſt live: ſo Truth hath its deare yeares, when thoſe that
will buy it, muſt give greater rates than ordinary: but whatſoever
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112927:12"/>
it coſt, it muſt be had, we muſt buy it, or elſe we periſh: Now we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
muſt alwayes give up our ſelves to God, that we may buy truth,
our underſtandings, wills, affections, our ſoules and bodies to his
guidance, ſoveraigne command and diſpoſing. And as it is ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32</note> 
               <hi>He that ſpared not his owne Son, but delivered him up for
us all: how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> ſo on our
part, he that ſincerely giveth up himſelfe to the Lord, to be wholly
his, how can he thinke any thing too dear when the Lord requireth
it? why did not the young man give up his poſſeſſions upon Chriſts
demand? becauſe he had not given up himſelfe. When the Lord
told <hi>Peter</hi> what he ſhould ſuffer for the truth, and by what death
he ſhould glorifie God, he queſtioneth about his Fellow-Diſciple,
(whether out of curioſity,<note place="margin">Joh. 21. 21, 22.</note> or ſome ſpice of envie, I know not) <hi>And
what ſhall this man doe? Jeſus ſaith unto him, If I will that he tarry
till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> If I will that he live till I come, and
call him in an ordinary way of viſitation, and that the Truth of the
Goſpell ſhall prove more coſtly to thee than to him, what doeth
that concerne thee? If both of yee give up your hearts to mee and
my truth, it is no great matter, whether it coſt you more or leſſe in
other regards. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Then yee muſt buy truth though it coſt yee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much of your treaſures, either to procure the meanes, or to
maintaine the cauſe, or to retaine the profeſſion and practice of
Truth. All theſe things muſt be looked upon as loſſe and dung in
compariſon of the excellency of Chriſts truth.<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 26.</note> 
               <hi>What is a man profited
if he ſhall gaine the whole world, and loſe his ſoule?</hi> and if he leave the
truth, he loſeth his ſoule. It may ſeeme the times are come upon
us, wherein the Lord will make diſcoveries, who they are that prize
this earthly droſſe above thoſe rich treaſures of his Kingdome. Let
us not ſay in our hearts, we could willingly purchaſe truth, if it
might be had at ſuch eaſie rates as our Fathers bought it. No, if we
will not buy it now at ſuch a price as it may be had, whatſoever it
be, neither would we have bought it then, though at a lower rate.
And thoſe who lived and died in thoſe times, and purchaſed truth
indeed, would have bought it at a farre higher rate, had it beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
of them. He that giveth up his heart to God for truth, will
never breake off for the price: he that doth not yeeld up his heart,
doth never truly buy, though he liveth in the cheapeſt times. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Be

any labour. What if any of you be forced to travell more
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112927:13"/>
miles than others? ſuch a reaſon doth not keepe people from Faires
and Markets: although the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant hath a longer voyage
to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> than the <hi>Portugals</hi> by many leagues, this doth not
make them give over trading. Though it coſt thee more paines in
reading, ſtudying, meditation, by reaſon of the ſlownes of thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
weakenes of judgment or memory; more ſtriving in
prayers, more fears, more labouring with thine own heart to bring
it in ſubjection unto truth, than it doth ſome other, let nothing beat
thee off, buy it whatſoever it may coſt thee. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Be content to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage

for matter of doctrine, worſhip, government, diſcipline, I doubt not

the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be conſidered: The two Tribes
and an halfe beyond <hi>Jordan</hi> built an Altar by the River:<note place="margin">Joſh. 22. 10. &amp;c.</note> tidings
came to the reſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who apprehended this as an Act ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

the Ordinances of his Worſhip. This was conceived a juſt ground
for a Warre: <hi>For the whole Congregation of the Children of Iſrael
gathered themſelves together at Shilo to goe up to warre againſt them.</hi>
But yet deſiring a peaceable accommodation, if it might be had
without prejudice to truth, they reſolve to treate with them, and
ſend <hi>Phineas</hi> a man of great eminencie, and ten Princes with him.
Theſe deale throughly in the buſineſſe, and preſſe it home upon
them: the Defendants make a free and candid declaration of their
intentions, ſhewing that <hi>this Altar was not erected for Burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
nor for Sacrifice, but onely for a Monument of their intereſt in
the God of Iſrael:</hi> whereupon both the Ambaſſadours and (at their
returne) the people were fully ſatisfyed. Now ſuppoſe this Altar
had beene built for ſacrifice, as was ſuſpected, and compare with
this the many hundred Altars (I beleeve) lately erected in this
Land, to the darkning at leaſt of thoſe great Truths of the Goſpel,
that Chriſt is the only Altar which ſanctifyeth all the offerings of
the faithfull, that His Sacrifice of himſelf once offered by Himſelf
is the onely Propitiation: adde hereunto the Idolatrous bowings
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112927:14"/>

many cauſes for a Warre againſt the Enemies of the truth in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
for one which Iſrael had, though that had beene ſuch as was
ſurmiſed. Oh, that the Lord would deliver our King from thoſe
that are Adverſaries of his Truth, and make him an Inſtrument to
execute His wrath upon the great whore, that ſo the Truth of God
might have a free paſſage through the ſeverall Regions of the
World. I have read of ſome Mariners who being toſſed on the ſea

may be conſidered whether thoſe be not more laviſhly prophane,
who being terrifyed with the ſtormes of warre, could be content
to make the ſacred Truth of God (more precious then all the
golden veynes in the bowells of the Earth) to ſerve in ſtead of

Of this ye have given reall demonſtration in your readines

that he may have rejoycing in himſelfe, and not in thoſe with
whom he joyneth in a good cauſe, nor by comparing himſelfe

1. The power of truth, 2. The ſpeciall engagements obligeing us
of this Age and Nation to purchaſe and promote it, 3. A ſerious

unlikely Propheſies of Scripture, have beene or ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
by the power of divine Truth: all the exceeding great

            <p>Yea this Power of truth what wonderfull alterations hath it

concurrence of ſecond cauſes, croſſe interferings and overthwart
interpoſings of inferiour Agents, holdeth a ſteady courſe towards
its full accompliſhment, and moveth on in a ſtreight line to its
finall period: where it arriveth moſt exactly in its owne proper
poynt of time. The Power of God his truth brought Iſrael out
of Egypt,<note place="margin">Exo. 12. 41</note>

occaſion in ſo high a degree to treaſure up wrath againſt their

Power of truth is ſtrong for all that embrace it, and labour to

and in the end crowne them with Glory. In a word, this

admirable conjuncture of providence, the Churches of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
ſhould be under perſecution, and the Churches in this Land
ſhould enjoy a ſhort breathing time of Peace, that ſo <hi>England</hi>

ſupplyed; from <hi>Germany</hi> Divines were called, both ſuch as were
Orthodox, and ſuch (it ſeemeth) who were tainted with the
<hi>Lutheran</hi> errour, one at leaſt, viz: <hi>Brentius</hi> a man noted to bee
much infected aſwell with that great errour of <hi>ubiquity,</hi> as that
of the <hi>Corporall preſence in the Sacrament,</hi> a perſon of eminent
authority for his Learning and manifold accompliſhments, and
one who had he accepted of the call,<note place="margin">Vocatus a rege Angliae Edvardo ampliſsimis promiſsioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. Mel: Ad: in vita, Brontii.</note> might have ſowed ſuch
ſeed in one or other of our Univerſities as might have overſpread
the Land, &amp; perhaps thoſe weeds which might have ſprang from
it, would not have been rooted out unto this day, eſpecially if
that be conſidered that our leading men <hi>Cramner, Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> were
ſuppoſed not to be wel informed in that point at that time. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
there was a gracious overruling providence of God in it,
diverting him, and moving him to decline ſo faire an offer, though
(it ſeemeth) hee was troubled to finde a place wherein to hide
his head with ſafety. On the other ſide the Lord was pleaſed to
incline the hearts of <hi>Martyr, Bucer</hi> and <hi>Phagius,</hi> three pious and
Orthodox Divines to accept the call. What were all our multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

deliverances in the Reigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> among the

now of late a wonderfull ſeries or large Catalogue of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
events brought about by the mighty hand of God; what
are all theſe (I ſay) but the glorious workings of our God for the
procuring and continuing unto us theſe precious opportunities
of buying <hi>truth?</hi> and therefore they ought to be mighty provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to our ſpirits not to neglect ſuch a price put into our
hands, unleſſe we will ſhew our ſelves of all people upon the
earth moſt unthankfull,<note place="margin">Joſh. 10. 12</note> and ſo moſt unexcuſable. Let me name
one of the laſt ſort: that as in the dayes of <hi>Joſh. The Lord hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the voice of a man, ſaying, Sun ſtand thou ſtill upon Gibeon, and
thou Moone in the valley of Aialon, and the Sun ſtood still in the midſt
of Heaven, and haſted not to go down about an whole day:</hi> ſo whereas
our Parliaments have formerly been made like fleeting meteors
or falling ſtars, giving ſome glimpſe of light and ſuddenly vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Lord ſhould now hearken to the cryes of His people,
and give us a fixed Parliament, like the Sunne ſtanding ſtill in
the midſt of Heaven, that ſo there might be time for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and eſtabliſhment of <hi>Truth</hi> and for the ſcattering of the
enemies of <hi>Truth.</hi>

at the laſt on the death-bed, in the day of judgement. How many
thouſands of gold and ſilver, yea of worlds (if they had them)
would the greateſt enemies or contemners of <hi>truth</hi> give at that
day, if then it might be had, if then they could purchaſe the ſaving
knowledge of God, of Chriſt, of the Goſpel, the Truth of
Faith, repentance, ſanctification? then a whole world for a
lamp full of this precious oyl. Certainly Truth is alwayes of the
ſame value, every whit as much worth now as it will be then:
But now men looke upon <hi>Truth</hi> as they do upon rich wares in a
dark-ſhop, and ſo undervalue it, whereas they take a full view
of the things of the world, and look upon them in the open Sun.
But then the Truth ſhall be fully diſcovered, men ſhall ſee ſuch
a light as they never ſaw, a glorious irradiation, and Divine
brightneſſe from the face of Chriſt, and Truth ſhall be exhibited
<hi>ſub dio,</hi> in the broad day-light in the cleer light of that Great
Day, to which the light which now we ſee by, is but as a twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

be of another minde when the pillars of the earth are trembling,
the heavens gathering together as a ſcroll, and paſſing away with
a great or hideous noiſe, the elements dropping or melting, the
earth and the works in it burnt up, if yee will ſeeke for that
wealth which now yee value above the Truth, ye muſt ſeek it in

ſee that this was but a blaſt, an empty breath when ye enjoyed it,
and then it will be nothing, yea, it will turn into ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion

truth will then ſhine forth in perfection, &amp; they that bought it at
the higheſt rate ſhall cleerly underſtand what a bleſſed advantage
they have made. Oh that now we could be wiſe for our ſouls! Let
us be content to begger our ſelves (if need be) that we may bee
rich. Give any thing to buy Truth. The time is ſhort (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaith) it remaineth then that thoſe which buy the things of
this world be as if they poſſeſſed not, as men ready to part with
them at any time, looking upon them as things that little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
them, carrying their hearts above them, keeping their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
weaned from them:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 30</note> but that thoſe who buy Truth, bee as
