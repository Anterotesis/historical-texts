            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV ſhall better vnderſtand the occaſion that induced the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> to write this Pſalme, if you will firſt remember cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine things written of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, in the Booke of <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and elſe-where.</p>
            <p>It was called, <hi>The Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Congregation,</hi> becauſe the people did aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together at it for the ſeruice of God: <hi>of Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> becauſe it carryed manifeſt euidences of Gods preſence amongſt them. It was portable, and all things belonging to it were ſo, becauſe the people themſelues had then no ſetled place of abode, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3948:4"/>
wandred like pilgrimes in the wildernes by the ſpace of fortie yeares.</p>
            <p>And ſome whiles after they came into the Land of Promiſe, it was carryed from place to place: being firſt pitched in Gilgall, <hi>Ioſu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 4. afterward in Silo, <hi>Ioſu.</hi> 18. From thence the Arke was brought into the campe of the Iſraelites, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. It was taken by the Philiſtimes, ſent back to Bethſhemeſh; and laſt of all, placed in Kiriath-iearim, not in any publicke ſeate, but in the houſe of <hi>Abinadab</hi> a priuate man. So little was the care and reſpect that <hi>Saul</hi> had to Religion, that the Arke of God was neglected, and not ſought vnto in his dayes. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>But good <hi>Dauid</hi> inlarged it, and with ſolempnitie of ioy brought it to Sion his owne Citie. Where firſt he put it within a tent or Tabernacle. For albeit God had foretold that he would not alwayes wander too and fro, but would finde out a place of reſt, where his Sanctuarie ſhould abide: that place being not yet reuealed to <hi>Dauid,</hi> he prouided curtaines and a tent, whereunto it had beene wonted almoſt a thouſand yeares.</p>
            <p>But when he vnderſtood that the Lord had choſen the hill of Sion to be an habitation for himſelfe, that there ſhould be his reſt for euer: and that the people with vnanimitie did willingly entertaine the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Religion in the ſame place. As he was abaſhed to dwell in a houſe of Cedar, and to leaue the Arke of God vnder Curtaines, and thereupon reſolued to build an houſe for God, till the charge thereof was committed ouer to <hi>Salomon</hi> his Sonne: ſo in teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3948:4"/>
of his owne gladneſſe, that Religion ſhould now grow to a ſetled certaintie, hee conceiued and writ this Pſalme.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the occaſion. which giueth vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; namely that the ſupreame power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of ſetling Religion; and the oeconomie or diſpoſition of the ceremonies thereof belongeth to the King. <hi>Dauid</hi> performed both moſt happily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controulement: and that could not haue wanted here, more then it did in his faire purpoſe of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temple, if the bounds of his vocation had beene exceeded in this, as they were in that.</p>
            <p>God requireth double ſeruice from Kings: one is of obedience, as they be men: the other of prouiſion, by reaſon of their office, and as they are Kings: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they muſt ſerue God extraordinarily aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, by making holy Lawes, not for the ciuill ſtate of their Kingdomes alone, but in matters alſo concerning diuine Religion, and government of the Church. If this were not an incident of the Royall office, the holy Ghoſt would not haue attributed the deformities of Religion, and miſ-gouernment of the Church to the want of a King. It is an vſuall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation in the Booke of Iudges, and the ordinary cenſure of the holy Ghoſt in thoſe caſes, <hi>Then there was no King in Iſrael.</hi> But how ſhould the want of a King occaſion diſorder in religion, if the rectifying of ſuch things were not within his verge and charge?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> here held it a part of his duetie, ſo did <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> his Sonne after him: and (leaſt any ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that theſe two were priuiledged for thoſe affaires
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3948:5"/>
by particular warrant,) ſo did <hi>Aſa:</hi> ſo did <hi>Ichoſaphat:</hi> ſo did <hi>Ezechias:</hi> ſo did <hi>Ioſias,</hi> as appeareth in the Bookes of Kings and Chronicles: ſo did <hi>Constantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperour: ſo did <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> ſo did <hi>Gratian:</hi> ſo did <hi>Iuſtinian:</hi> ſo did <hi>Charles</hi> the great, as the Eccleſiaſticall Stories teſtifie: ſo <hi>Eleutherius</hi> a Biſhop of Rome aduiſed <hi>Lucius</hi> to doe, that was King of Britaine about 150. yeares after Chriſt, and giueth this reaſon of his aduiſe; <hi>Quia Vicarius Dei estis in veſtro regno:</hi> you (ſaith the Biſhop of Rome vnto the King) may make Lawes for religion, becauſe you are Gods Lieutenant, Vicar, and Deputie within your owne Kingdome: ſo the municipal Lawes of our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome intendeth: for they account not the Prince a meere Ciuill or Eccleſiaſticall perſon, as they doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but mixt: by reaſon of the power that he hath in both.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Paul</hi> determineth of this point for the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, when hee willeth prayers to be made for Kings and men in authoritie, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty. And what meanes can wee haue from Kings for godlineſſe and honeſty? none verily but by their authoritie and power, whereby as Guardians of both Tables of the Law of God, they make Edicts for obſeruation of the one and other.</p>
            <p>Now to the Pſalme, which conſiſteth of three parts: the firſt expreſſeth <hi>Dauids</hi> ioy: the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the cauſes thereof: the third hath a praiſe of Ieruſalem, and a prayer for the ſame; my purpoſe is to treat of the two former.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:3948:5"/>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Part.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Dauids</hi> ioy teacheth vs that Gods children be not <hi>Stoiks:</hi> a kinde of Philoſophers that deſired to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affections. And further it informeth vs, that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe ſtandeth not in ſolempne or ſowre lookes. The moſt godly haue their affections: God planted them in man, when he ſtood in perfect integritie vnſtained with ſin. And Chriſt himſelfe was not without them.</p>
            <p>Then it is no part of holineſſe to ſhake off all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: but to ſubdew and temper the heate of them, when they are blowne with the bellowes of concupiſcence, that no flame be kindled againſt God, againſt our neighbours, againſt our ſelues, againſt our owne ſaluation: this is a ſpeciall kinde of godlineſſe, of pietie, of holineſſe, of Chriſtianitie.</p>
            <p>Take away ſorrow in afflictions, and all chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcipline ſhall proue vaine. Where will that godly ſorrow be that worketh repentance not to be repented of? Take away ioy in proſperitie, and no place will be left for thankes-giuing. Take away both, &amp; the Apoſtles rule muſt ceaſe, <hi>reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then the affection of Ioy is naturall, planted in our hearts by the Creator, of great vſe and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for performance of many good offices, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion followeth, that it cannot be but lawfull. Yet the corruption of our nature doth peruert many things that be good and lawfull, and by our abuſe we make them euill and vnlawfull. So we doe in this particular affection, when we ſtudie, when we ſpend our thoughts and time in chearing vp our owne hearts, without regard of our ſinnes, without regard of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3948:6"/>
of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> without all feeling and feare of Gods iudgements. In like ſort a great number peruert and change the nature of this affection, when they ſet their whole ioy and delight in circumuenting their brethren: others when they wallow in the mire of their owne filthineſſe and ſenſualitie: others in heapes of their riches with the foole in the Goſpell: in their ſurfets, drunkenneſſe, and exceſſiue riot, with the rich Glutton: in the venime and poyſon of their ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tongues, with <hi>Dauids</hi> Tyrant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. All theſe and ſuch like, are glad when they haue done euill, and reioyce in the worſt things: therefore wee will call their ioy carnall. Chriſt pronounceth a woe to them; <hi>Woe vnto you that laugh now, for you ſhall weepe: You paſſe your dayes in ioylities, and in a moment you ſhall goe downe into hell. Iob.</hi> 20. <hi>Momentaneum eſt quod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectat, aeternum vero quod cruciat.</hi> O remember that your pleaſures are but tranſitorie, and your torments euerlaſting.</p>
            <p>There is another kinde of ioy, called Spirituall, becauſe it proceedeth from the holy Ghoſt, and is reckoned amongſt the fruits of the Spirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. It is promiſed to the faithfull, <hi>Eſay</hi> 35. <hi>They ſhall obtaine ioy and gladneſſe, and ſorrow and mourning ſhall flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> The Apoſtles felt the fruit hereof, when they departed from the Councill reioycing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer rebuke for his name.

               </note> The firſt cauſe of his Ioy was, the readineſſe, the alacritie and chearefulneſſe that hee obſerued in the people, ſtirring vp one another, with a ſweete corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie or conſent, and encouraging themſelues with mutuall exhortations, to go into the houſe of the Lord. This good Prince knowing the manifold graces of God that be diſpenſed in the Church, reioyceth in ſpirit and heart to ſee his people inflamed with a deſire of that place where they might enioy them all.</p>
            <p>By this example hee doth teach and admoniſh vs to conceiue double ioy when God by his holy ſpirit doth not onely frame euery one of vs to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his word, but bringeth others alſo with vs into the ſame obedience, that wee may all hold a kinde of harmonie and fellowſhip in faith. Therefore if wee will be like <hi>Dauid,</hi> wee muſt ioy, wee muſt take a delight and pleaſure in the pietie of our brethren: and as euery one is firſt called, ſo to labour and ſtirre vp others to the like vocation. We ought to doe it, firſt in reſpect of Gods glory, which we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to aduance. And if God be to be glorified in all things of vs that are created for no other purpoſe: How carefull ſhould wee be to ſeeke his glory in the ſaluation of mankinde, the moſt pretious thing in the world, if you value it by the price? Or if the friends of the woman did reioyce with her, when ſhee found her groat, how much more worthily may we triumph in an holy and ſpirituall kinde of ioy at the finding of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3948:7"/>
that pretious groat which carryeth the ſtampe and Image of our heauenly King. Againe, this care is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended vnto vs in that charitie which wee are commanded to yeeld vnto our brethren. That char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vs with a ſpeciall care of their temporall liues, their name, and goods, doth impoſe a more holy care for their religion, faith, ſoules, ſaluation, and all things thereto belonging. Therefore I make that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note out of this place and example, that we ought to call vpon our brethren, and to exhort one another to the exerciſes of religion.</p>
            <p>Deſpiſe not this example, but imagine that theſe words be now no more the ſpeach of the Iſraelites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging one another, but of the holy Ghoſt, rowſing vs all to the like endeauour. <hi>We will goe into the houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The benefits that God diſpenſeth in his houſe are of ſuch conſequence that they may well breed in euery man a loue and liking of the Church.</p>
            <p>Whether you looke to the Tabernacle, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or the Church, God promiſeth his preſence and propitiation to euery one of them particularly. For the Tabernacle, he ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. <hi>They ſhall make me a ſanctuary, and I will dwell in the middeſt of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. <hi>I haue heard thy prayer and ſupplication that thou haſt made before mee. I haue hallowed this houſe, and my eyes, and my eares, and hart ſhall be there perpetually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Church, <hi>where two or three he gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in my name, I am in the midſt of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now where God is preſent and ready to help, what
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3948:7"/>
good thing can be, that is not there to be found? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is the fountaine of all goodneſſe, no good thing can be lacking where he dwelleth. There is peace, ioy, ſaluation, comfort, and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, where God is not preſent, no miſchiefe is wanting: nor anguiſh, nor affliction, nor heauineſſe, nor feare, nor the worme that dyeth not, nor the fire that cannot be quenched. How miſerably was <hi>Saul</hi> diſtreſſed when God left him? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. euen ſo are the godly, as oft as they are bereaued of of the Tabernacle, of the Temple, of the Church: becauſe they want Gods preſence, they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be in a kinde of hell. <hi>Woe is mee that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to dwell with</hi> Meſech, <hi>and to haue my habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongst the tents of Kedar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides Gods preſence in the Church wee haue Chriſt ther alſo our Mediator. Ther he exerciſeth the office of his headſhip: there he gouerneth, guideth, quickneth, and nouriſheth his members, and as a true head, communicateth his owne liuelihood, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe with them. Furthermore in the Church the holy Ghoſt is inſpired by the diſtribution and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his graces vpon the faithfull. Laſt of all, in the Church and holy aſſemblies, the power of Gods word and Sacraments is moſt effectuall.</p>
            <p>And if the Queene of Saba did account them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie which attended King <hi>Salomon,</hi> to heare his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: how much greater is their happineſſe, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the places where they heare wiſedome, not of man, but the heauenly wiſedome of Almightie God ſounding effectually in his word?</p>

            <p>What would you haue, that is not in it? Pleaſure? <hi>O taſte and ſee how ſweet and gracious the Lord is. The testimonies of the Lord are right, and reioyce the heart: more to be deſired then Gold, yea, then much fine gold, ſweeter alſo then hony and the hony combe.</hi>

If this be that one thing that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt ſaith is neceſſarie: then I beſeech you by the mercifulneſſe of God, and in the bowels of Ieſus Chriſt, that yee come to it henceforth with more preparation and diligence; heare it with more heede and attention; and practiſe it with more zeale and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, then you haue done formerly. <hi>And God the father of lights, from whom euery good and perfect gift commeth, bleſſe vs all with the grace of his holy ſpirit, that we may ſo doe indeed.</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3948:8"/>
of GOD doth increaſe it yet further. <hi>Leu.</hi> 17.5. <hi>The children of Iſrael ſhall bring their offrings (which they would offer abroad in the fields) and preſent them at the doore of the Tabernacle of the congregation, and he that faileth herein, that man ſhall be cut off from his people.</hi> The equitie of this law is great, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſtill: <hi>viz.</hi> that nothing be attempted in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God without ſpeciall direction, and warrant of his word Which equitie in this particular of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their offrings to the doore of the Tabernacle, is grounded vpon two reaſons, Firſt, that the Miniſters of the Altar might thereby haue a due proportion of maintenance. Secondly, that by theſe publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies the puritie of doctrine might be kept inviolate. As for the firſt, there is an honour due vnto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for their intertainment. <hi>Who goeth a warfare of the owne coſt? Who planteth a Vineyard and eateth not ſo the fruit thereof? Who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of his milke of the flocke?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which was commanded in the Law to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, was the Tenth part of all their increaſe: which being once ſequeſtred from priuate vſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the worſhip of God, may not, for any thing I ſee, be altered. For I take Tythes to be due to the Miniſters of the Word by the lawes of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: a matter that will be thought hard to proue. Yet firſt vnderſtand the errour of thoſe that ſuppoſe Tythes to haue drawen their originall from the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Law: and that being abrogated, they imagine Tythes alſo to ceaſe, or at leaſt to remaine by poſitiue law alone. Behold a double miſconceit: Firſt, Tythes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3948:9"/>
were payd amongſt Gods people long before any Law was giuen. As we read of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14. <hi>he gaue vnto Melchiſedech the tenth of all his ſpoyles.</hi> And <hi>Iacob</hi> vowed in Bethel, <hi>that hee would giue God the Tythe of all he had. Gen.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>Againe, in caſe the originall of Tythes had beene by the Leuiticall Law: yet Tythes need not ceaſe, as ſoone as that was abrogated. I hold this for a rule, that thoſe Lawes are perpetuall, which haue a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cauſe. But the Law of Tythes hath a perpetuall cauſe, namely, the entertainment and maintenance of the ſeruice of God: Therefore the Law of Tythes is perpetuall. Conſider againe what <hi>Abraham</hi> did? he gaue the tenth of all things. To whom? To <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> the Prieſt of the high God. When? Surely 400. yeares before GOD gaue any Law for Tythes. Whereupon I doe infer that this Law of Tythes was grauen in the heart of man before it was written in Tables: And ſo conſequently it was the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Elſe how came it to paſſe, that <hi>Iacob</hi> did vow, and <hi>Abraham</hi> did pay nothing but Tythes? What ſhould we thinke? That Tythes were payd by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and vowed by <hi>Iacob</hi> at all aduenture? And ſo they ſtumbled by chaunce vpon that which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward eſtabliſhed by Law? No, no: theſe Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches (though they were reuerend and holy men) gaue God no precedent to make his Law by: But God by a ſecret inſtinct moued theſe holy men to doe thoſe things before Law, which afterward he eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for Law. <hi>When the Gentiles hauing no Law, yet by nature doe the workes of the Law, are they not</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:3948:9"/>
(ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>a Law to themſelues?</hi> And why? becauſe they ſhew the worke of the Law written in their hearts. After this ſort he moued <hi>Iudah</hi> to giue ſentence againſt whoredome, before any Law was written to puniſh it. So he moued <hi>Noah</hi> to condemne <hi>Cham</hi> for his vnreuerend behauiour, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement was giuen to <hi>honour father or mother.</hi> So he moued <hi>Iacob</hi> to deteſt theft, and to challenge <hi>Laban</hi> for his wrongfull imputation, before the Law had ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſteale.</hi> And euen thus he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Abraham</hi> to pay Tythes to <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> the Prieſt of the high God, before the Law was ordayned to pay Tythes. And the Law ye know ordayned Tythes to be payd to the children of <hi>Leuie:</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi> payd Tythes to <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> whoſe Prieſthood was of another order, then the children of <hi>Leuie</hi> were: to giue vs to vnderſtand, that Tythes were due to all Prieſts, whether they were vnder the Law, afore the Law, or after the Law.</p>
            <p>Here me thinks, I heare ſome aske, how it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then, that Chriſt, that the Apoſtles of Chriſt, made no expreſſe mention of Tythes to be payd in the new Teſtament?</p>
            <p>The anſwere is eaſie, that whileſt Chriſt liued, the Prieſthood of the Law was not abrogated. And after it continued ſome ſpace in the Apoſtles time, vntill the diſſolution of that common-wealth: that the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ordayned of God himſelfe, might be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably buried. During which time, it was vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Chriſt or his Apoſtles, to ſnatch Tythes vnto themſelues, which by Law were yet ſetled in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3948:10"/>
Leuites. But after that legall Prieſthood was aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, then to whom Tythes belonged, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe declareth, not in words but by his fact &amp; deed. Vpon which I build the foundation of my argument, thus:</p>
            <p>That which Chriſt receiued in right of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the new Teſtament, is due to all the Miniſters that ſucceede him in the ſame. But Chriſt receiued Tythes in right of his Prieſthood of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Tythes therefore are due to all the Miniſters of the ſame. The aſſumption is proued in the 7. Chap. to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>And to ſay as the thing is,</hi> Leuie <hi>alſo which receiueth Tythes, payd Tythes in Abraham: For he was yet in the loynes of his father Abraham when Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech met him.</hi> The Apoſtles purpoſe in that place is to proue the Prieſthood of Chriſt greater then the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron.</hi> He proues it by two reaſons. 1. The leſſe is bleſſed of the greater. Chriſt in <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Leuie.</hi> Therefore <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Leuie</hi> are leſſe then Chriſt.</p>
            <p>His ſecond reaſon is drawne from the matter that I haue in hand. The leſſe payeth Tythe vnto the greater. <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of <hi>Leuie</hi> payd Tythes to Chriſt in <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Therefore <hi>Leuie</hi> did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſt to be greater Prieſt. How? becauſe <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie</hi> payd Tythes that were due to the Prieſt, into the hand of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> the figure of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Here two things are remarkable: Firſt, that Tythes were perpetually allotted to the Prieſt, elſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles argument had carried no great ſoliditie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> neither giueth the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3948:10"/>
nor receiueth Tythes in his owne name: but in the perſon and right of Chriſt. So as that which <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> did in figure, was in deed and truth done by Chriſt. It was Chriſt that gaue the bleſſing vnto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as wee may ſee by the efficacie thereof. It was Chriſt that receiued Tythes, as the Apoſtle doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; not wrongfully. He commanded in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar termes to giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars:</hi> In generall doctrine, to yeeld euery man his owne. Therefore no man can well imagine that hee would foreſtall, or intercept any others due, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his owne. By what right? Sure, not in the right of his Godhead, whereby the ſupreame domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all things reſteth in him. But by the title and in the right of his Prieſthood: for ſo the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth.</p>
            <p>You that be hearers may make this vſe of my ſpeech, that ſeeing Tythes were payd by <hi>Abraham,</hi> vowed by <hi>Iacob,</hi> preſcribed by the inſtinct of nature, before the Law: allotted to the Prieſts vnder the Law: continued ſince the Law: ſeeing the Church hath beene in iuſt and good poſſeſſion of them aboue 4000 yeares: ſeeing they were dedicated to the ſeruice of God: ſeeing they were deuoted vnto God: And the title or right, that man had before donation: doth by the act, and from any ſuch time of donation, remaine the proper poſſeſſion of God, vntill the worlds end, vnleſſe himſelfe renounce, or relinquiſh it. Yeeld your Tythes willingly, becauſe you cannot hold them from your Miniſters without impietie. In ſuch caſes the Lord loueth a cheerefull giuer: <hi>Et nos libenter accipimus
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3948:11"/>
beneficium quod profit danti. Nobis quidem in hoc bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facitis, ſed vobis melius. Beatius est dare, quam accipere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the entertainment of Miniſters, there is another reaſon for publique aſſemblies: that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of ſincere Doctrine might be kept inuiolable by that meanes from the corruption of Gentilitie, the poyſon of Hereſie, and the rage of Schiſme: whileſt the worſhip of God is not left arbitrarie, or volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but hath a preſcript forme from whence it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to decline. For that hath beene, and alwayes will be dangerous.</p>
            <p>It is noted for a ſpecial blemiſh and ſtaine amongſt the Iſraelites in the booke of Iudges; That euery one did what he thought good in his owne eyes, without regard of law, of order, of vniformitie in Church or common-wealth.</p>
            <p>And where lawes eyther be not at all, or want due execution: that our wauering mindes be not held in a conformitie: It is the eaſieſt thing in the world, for man vaine and curious by nature, and delighted with change, to fall into confuſion and groſſe ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Ieroboam</hi> be the example hereof, who had no ſooner withdrawne his followers from thoſe aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies that were appointed by better authoritie, but ſtraight-waies both himſelfe fell into Schiſme, and to Idolatrie: and wrapped all his adherents in the like offences. So the Scripture markes him out euerie where. <hi>Ieroboam that made Iſraell to ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let <hi>Ieroboam</hi> carry this marke alone, and let it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be found or felt in this Church. For if the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

            <p>Laſt of all, Antiquitie is brought for a note of the Church: and if that were a certaine or perpetuall euidence, then was the Church ancient as ſoone a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Behold the things that the Maiſter of the houſe commanded to be in his houſe: are not they true markes of the houſe? firſt, the ſincere doctrine of the Goſpell: ſecondly, the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments: thirdly, that forme of diſcipline (I meane not any certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for that was neuer yet proued) which may bring obedience to Chriſts commandements: let them that vnchurch vs ſo eaſily at their pleaſures, ioine iſſue with vs vpon theſe markes, and they ſhall ſee that we haue no cauſe through the grace of God to ſhun the triall.</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome hath the Word of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed contained in their Bibles, we deny it not: but as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith of certaine Heretiques,<note place="margin">In <hi>1.</hi> cap. Eſa.</note> ſo we ſay of it; <hi>Heretiques corrupt the truth of the Goſpel with their falſe conſtructions: and are like our worst kind of brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that make wine water, whereas cleane contrary, our Sauiour turned water into wine:</hi> ſo they haue the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but not truely expounded, nor taught ſincerely.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe they refer not their conſtructions to the glory of God, according to the rule of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>qui quaerit gloriam meam verax eſt:</hi> but the church of Rome attributing ſaluation to their owne merits, aduancing free-will, extenuating originall ſinne, &amp;c.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3948:13"/>
ſeeke not the glory of God, but their owne gaine: therefore they are not true.</p>
            <p>There is another reaſon of their vntrue conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: becauſe they interpret not the Scripture accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion of faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> willeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12 <hi>Let him that propheſieth do it according to the proportion of faith.</hi> As all gold was not holy, but that only which belonged to the temple: ſo euery ſenſe that is without compaſſe of Scripture, though it ſhine and gliſter with neuer ſo much ſharpnes of wit, yet is it not holy. By the ſame ſpirit that the Scriptures were written, by the ſame they muſt be interpreted and vnderſtood: this is the golden rule to know truth from error; Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be interpreted by Scripture; not alwayes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, not alwayes allegorically, not alwayes anago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically, not alwayes tropologically; but the darker places by thoſe that be more plaine or eaſie.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3948:14"/>
me onely in caſe of ſcandall: the other, as well out of offence, as in offence.</p>
            <p>Though I had <hi>Gyges</hi> ring, and liued without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolement of any eye, yet am I bound in conſcience to obey the poſitiue Lawes.

Iudge then whether authoritie is greater: the Myter, or the Scepter? Both theſe offices are now conioyned in Chriſt: and is he not greater in his Kingdome? He ſtands at the right hand of God as an aduocate and Prieſt: he ſitteth as a King. This puts a Scepter, the other giueth a Cenſer into his hand. His Prieſthood reacheth but to the Elect: his Kingdome iudgeth quicke and dead. He is ſweet in his Prieſthood, but in his kingdome, high, potent, and magnificall. This is enough for the falſhood of their conſtructions.</p>
            <p>Touching the Sacraments, which is the ſecond note, the Church of Rome doth no way rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter them: ſaue onely that it retayneth the eſſentiall forme of Baptiſme. Otherwiſe they prophane it moſt groſly, in applying it to dead and ſenſleſſe things. They mingle it with oyle, ſpettle, and ſalt, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done without ſacriledge. is not the element of water, which Chriſt inſtituted, ſufficient to repreſent his precious bloud for our regeneration, without theſe mixtures?</p>
            <p>The other Sacrament, namely the Supper of the Lord: the Church of Rome hath not onely defiled,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3948:15"/>
but quite altered, &amp; changed it into a curſed, and an abhominable Idol of their Maſſe: and ſo haue peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vtterly, and annihilated Chriſts holy inſtitution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For whereas two things be neceſſarie in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the ſigne, and the thing ſignified: In this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament they take away the ſignes for eſtabliſhing their tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which ſhould be diſtributed vnto others, they keepe onely to themſelues, and ſo make it a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate banquet, whereas it ſhould be a common feaſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They keepe the Cup from the people, which our Sauiour commanded to be giuen to all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, in the Lords Supper, he offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to vs: and they offer him to GOD the Father: which cannot be done but by his eternall ſpirit: nor without his death, that died but once for euer.</p>
            <p>Where theſe things are done; the Eſſentiall parts of the Sacrament is not kept: and therefore no Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, no Sacrament, but an horrible prophanation and plaine ſacriledge. Hereby it may appeare how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly they complaine of vs for Apoſtaſie &amp; forſaking of them. <hi>Nullus pudor est ad meliora tranſire.</hi> And if a man do leaue and depart from a particular Church in body, and yet forſake not the Communion &amp; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Apoſtles doctrine, nor the Sacraments rightly adminiſtred, but holdeth them with all other ſincere Churches: he cannot be Apoſtata.</p>
            <p>Our Rhemiſh Seminaries, ſay <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> &amp;c. came out of their Church, not they out of ours. And that is the Catholique Church which is forſaken. But the right Apoſtaſie is a falling away from the true
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3948:15"/>
Catholique and Apoſtolique Church of Chriſt, and that by reuolting from the Apoſtles doctrine, &amp; the communion of the Catholique faith. We departed from them vpon ſuch occaſion, and in ſuch ſort, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſometimes departed out of Egipt: or S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> from the Manicheis. <hi>De veſtris fuimus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian) nec mirum, fiunt enim non naſcuntur Chriſtiani.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of Rome is neither Catholique, nor Apoſtolique: and therefore by leauing it we incurre no Apoſtacie. Not Catholique becauſe it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as the Church of Alexandria, Milan, Epheſus, &amp;c. The Catholique Church is vniuerſall, and whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the faithfull be found. It is not pinned vp in one place, but diſpeirced farre and neere.</p>
            <p>Did the Goſpel begin at Rome? was it not brought from Ieruſalem, firſt to the Grecians, and after to the Romanes? So then that Church was not the firſt: and if there were a Catholique Church before Rome had any Church, I ſee no cauſe but there may be ſtill a Catholique Church without it.</p>
            <p>An Apoſtolique Church it is not, becauſe it reſteth not vpon the doctrine of the Apoſtles, but is fallen from it, defending inuocation of Saints, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles taught not: forbidding marriage againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Caueat. Anathematizing the Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Iuſtification by faith onely. Denying the faith, by aduancing of traditions, aboue the word. And therefore ſeeing we departed from that Church, where neither the word of GOD could be purely taught, the Sacraments adminiſtred, nor God rightly worſhipped: and haue forſaken that Church that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3948:16"/>
now it is: not that which once it was. The Church of Rome is rather guilty of Apoſtaſie, then we: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is fallen away from them from whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Goſpell, Faith, Religion, and their Church. Why hath the Citie of Rome forſaken her ſeauen hils, whereon that Citie was once built: and is now come downe to the plaine? Happily they will ſay that their Conduits and water courſes did faile them in thoſe hils, without which they could not well liue. Then let them yeeld vs the like libertie for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life: that they themſelues haue taken for their common water. That water of life began to faile them in the Church of Rome: They had broken all the Conduits and Pipes: they had ſtopped vp all. Veines, and had mingled the fountaines of water of life with mire and dirt: and ſo brought in a thirſt and hunger, not of bread and water, but of hearing the word of God. And was it not then time to leaue them?</p>
            <p>Let them refuſe their Synagogues, forſake their broken Cyſternes that will hold no water: returne to that true &amp; auncient faith that was renowned through the world: and we will giue them the right hands of fellowſhip. With ioy will wee ioyne together with them, and goe into the houſe of the Lord.</p>
            <p>If they will not: I call heauen and earth to record againſt them this day: that they are fallen from the Goſpell, from truth, from word, from Sacraments, from Religion, from the houſe of God, from God himſelfe. And all theſe our Churches ſtudie with great endeuour to maintaine in their perfect integrity.

O pray, pray, forget not to pray for that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inſtrument of GOD that hath eſtabliſhed theſe things amongſt vs by holy Lawes, and good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: Peace be within his walls, and plentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe within his Pallaces. Yea the God of peace and plenty bleſſe him, for theſe bleſſings that hee hath brought vpon vs, a thouſand, and ten thouſand fold, both here, and in the world to come.</p>
            <p>And beloued, ceaſe not to crie out vnto God to fill our hearts with praiſe, and our mouthes with thankes-giuing for theſe ineſtimable mercies. When Gods benefits are receiued with thankfulnes and due account, then hee doth multiply them exceedingly. Seeing then that all the enemies wee haue, cannot ſhew one point of doctrine maintained contrarie to the wholeſome forme ſet downe in the word, and proportion of faith: ſeeing they cannot iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our adminiſtration of the Sacraments. Let not theſe graces of God towards our Churches be extenuated by ſcornefull reproofes, or ſlaunderous Pamphlets: leaſt there follow queſtions, whether they be the houſes of God, or no? leaſt they be forſaken by fanaticall and giddie ſpirits, as if they were the Synagogues of Sathan.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the fruits that vnaduiſed whiſperings wil bring forth: and this vſe the enemie of mankinde hath made of them. They haue ſerued him, as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogie, an A B C, or introduction of Schiſme, of frenzie, of Anabaptiſticall confuſion.</p>
            <p>Two errors I haue obſerued that are the grounds, and occaſions of theſe enormities. The firſt, is an
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3948:17"/>
immoderate deſire of Chriſtian libertie. The ſecond, an importunate challenge of equalitie in gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</p>
            <p>As to the former, many are deceiued therein, and deceiue others: whileſt they ſet Chriſtian libertie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tenter-hookes, and ſtretch it further then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof will beare: ſeeking not onely a liberty of minde and conſcience in things indifferent, but a freedome alſo in their actions. Chriſtian libertie hath place in minde and conſcience alone: It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth it ſelfe if there be no burthen of merit, of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, of holineſſe, or pleaſing God vrged vpon the conſcience: that is the ſeate of Ieſus Chriſt, and if that be left free vnto him, Chriſtian libertie is ſafe and ſound. It reſpecteth nothing but that which is betweene God and thee. And is not this a goodly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, when we know that ſuch and ſuch things doe neither iuſtifie nor condemne vs afore God? If this content you not, vnleſſe you may haue freedome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in your actions to doe what you will: you haue left Chriſtian libertie, which reacheth not to our actions, and reſpecteth not that which is betweene thee, and thy neighbour: and thou act come to a licentious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie.</p>
            <p>This difference being obſerued, may appeaſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie controuerſies about indifferent things. Wherein if brethren will hold but that moderation which true Diuinitie teacheth, and retaine this freedome, our Chriſtian libertie in their conſciences, which is not infringed; and conforme their actions, that they doe not ouerthwart good order, to the diſturbance of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3948:17"/>
Church, and offence of the Magiſtrate: How ioyfully might we all goe vp into the houſe of the Lord, and ſing in the tune of Angels. <hi>Ecce quam bonum, &amp; quam iucundum habitare fratres in vnum?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as much therefore as God hath warranted the Magiſtrates authoritie in theſe caſes, and required our obeience: let vs no more thinke how to finde out pretences. <hi>Studia abeunt in mores.</hi> But if there be any conſolation in Chriſt, any comfort of loue, any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, any compaſſion and mercie, fulfill this ioy: that ye be like minded, hauing the ſame loue, being of one accord and iudgement, that nothing be done through contention, or vaine glory, but that in meekeneſſe of minde euery one eſteeme other better then himſelfe. That we may all with one way, and one heart, goe vp into the houſe of the Lord.</p>
            <p>As for equalitie, which is the other errour: when one aduiſed <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> to eſtabliſh it amongſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians, that ſo the leaſt and meaneſt might beare like ſway with the greateſt: The wiſe man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: that he which called for it ſhould begin it firſt at home in his owne houſe. And if all men be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to exclude paritie out of their priuate families: if men experienced in policie and gouernement, will not admit it into the common-wealth, becauſe that cannot be preſerued with equalitie, but by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and rule: Why are not men as ſenſible of the houſe of God, as of their owne houſes? or why ſhould equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that is found intollerable in all other ſocieties, be obtruded onely to the Church? Becauſe diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inequalitie of Paſtors cannot be proued by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3948:18"/>
Scripture. That is not ſo. There were diuers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors vnder the Law: but they were not equall. For there was one high Prieſt, as it were a tranſcendent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue them all. But his eminencie was to expreſſe the ſoueraignetie of Ieſus Chriſt: Then there were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of euery family of the Leuites: and that proues an inequalitie. Laſt of all, there were two ioyned with the high Prieſt, which are called rulers of the houſe of God, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 24.5.</p>
            <p>In the new Teſtament there was diſtinction and inequalitie betweene the Apoſtles themſelues, or elſe <hi>Paul</hi> would neuer haue called <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> chiefe and pillars of the Apoſtles.

Let vs haue but one heart, and one way, that wee may fill the Lords houſe with garlands of victories: that wee may beate our aduerſaries from humane merits, and bring them to the diuine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: from free-will, and the poſſibilities of Nature, to the grace of God: from traditions, to the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word: from elauation, adoration, circumge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, tranſubſtantiation of the Sacrament, to the commemoration of Chriſts death, and a ſweet frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof by faith.
