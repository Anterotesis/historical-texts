            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Shall not trouble thee, Reader, nor my self, with a long Apology for the publishing this Treatise. How demurely soever I should pretend to the contrary, I fear thou wilt still be apt to imagin, that I had a tolerable good opinion of it, before I ventur'd it to the Press; and truly I my self cann't well conceive, how any man should be over ambitious of being publickly laught at. If it be in any measure suited to the General Good, (for which I intended it,) I may at least expect thy pardon; but if upon the perusal thou shalt find it otherwise, I ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously acknowledge my self to have been mistaken. My Design in this Work is, to render the Rules of those excellent Arts, which the Title-page pretends to, so plain and obvious, as that they may be easily apprehended without the Assistance of a living Master. And if there were nothing new in the whole, but the perspicuity of the Principles, and easiness of the Method (which out of civility to my self I must deny) yet those alone are sufficient to vindicate me in this Publication; and I hope thou wilt not be angry, that I am a Well-wisher to thy Vnderstanding. For when I consider'd, that among the many good Books of this Nature, that are abroad in the
<pb facs="tcp:33857:4"/>
World (though written by Persons of greater knowledge than I dare pretend to) some were so learned and obscure, as not to be understood, unless by those who have already made a considerable proficiency in these things; others, so voluminous and prolix, that they fright the endeavours of such who cannot spend their whole time this way: I was willing, according to my abilities, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate both these inconveniences, and accordingly applied my self to the composure of something, which for its plainness and brevity might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to those of mean Capacities and small Leisure; and this Book is the result of those Contemplations. Whether I have accomplish'd my purpose or no, I make thee the Judge; requiring only that thou censure impartially of the Author and his Endeavours, without being offended that he is desirous to do thee a courtesie. I shall not here expatiate in the praise of the Arguments I treat of, nor give thee one line of Encomium: though out of the great affection I bear to these Arts, I find a strange inclination in my self to be rhetorical, yet I am resolv'd not to affront thee; for truly their usefulness and excellency is so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally known, that to tell thee of it as a new thing, were to suppose thee a Person of more than ordinary ignorance; only (as I said before) I must be so civil to my self too, as to inform thee, that (besides the <hi>Introduction</hi> to <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and the <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Interest,</hi> of which I challenge no more than thou shalt find thy self very willing to give me) that Part which concerns the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
<pb facs="tcp:33857:4"/>
of <hi>Solids, viz.</hi> the <hi>Prismoid, Cylindroid, &amp;c.</hi> is wholly new, and never before made publick. The bulk is bigger than at first by me intended; but to gratifie the Book-seller, the <hi>Vulgar Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick</hi> was an Appendix, though previous to the rest. But if one, or other, or all, prove either profitable or pleasant to thee, I am sufficiently oblig'd to subscribe,</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>ADdition,</hi> is a gathering or collecting of several Numbers or Quantities into one Sum, by placing all Numbers of like Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination under one another, carrying all above ten to the next place, as in these Examples.</p>
                        <gap reason="math">

There is likewise another kind of <hi>Addition,</hi> that is not of whole Quantities, wherein is necessary to be known the number of Parts the Integer or whole Number is divided into, as Pounds and Shillings, every Pound is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 20 Shillings, and one Shilling is divided into twelve Pence, one Penny into four Farthings.</p>
                        <p>Now being to add a Number of Pounds and Shillings together, they are thus set down with a small Line or Point between them.</p>

                        </gap>
                        <p>If these be added together, observe in casting up your Shillings, so many times as you have 20 in the Shillings, you must carry Unites to the Pounds, and set down the Remainder, being under 20, as in these Examples.</p>
                        <gap reason="math">

                        <p>In the first Example, I find in adding the Shillings together, they make 21, so I set down 1 and carry 1 Pound to the Pounds: In the second Example, I find among the Shillings 53, which is 2 Pounds 13 Shillings, so I set down 13 under the Shillings, and 2 to the Pounds.</p>
                        <p>

Any number of Shillings and Pence being to be added together, if your number of Pence amount to above 12, carry 1 to the Shillings, and set down the remainder under the Pence; if they make above 24, carry 2 Shillings, and set down the remainder, as before.</p>

                        <p>In the first Example, you carry one Shilling; in the second, two; and in the third, three.</p>
                        <p>In Addition of Pence and Farthings, carry so many times four as you find in the number of Farthings to the Pence, setting down the remainder under the Farthings, as in these Examples.</p>

By which Examples, the Learner may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that where the number to be subducted is greater than the number standing over it, I then borrow one from the next greater denomination, adding the remainder, if any be, to the lesser number before-mentioned, and setting them underneath those of like denomination with them.</p>
                        <p>The Proof of <hi>Subtraction</hi> is by adding the <hi>Subducend</hi> and <hi>Remainder</hi> together, and their Aggregate must always be equal to the <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> as you may see by the last Example.</p>
                        <p>I could here add many more Examples of Weight and Measure, but to the ingenious Practitioner I hope it will be enough, all other being wrought after the same manner, respect being had to the number of lesser denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contained in each greater.

                        <p>In the first Rank of this Table, you have an Arithmetical Progression from 1 to 12,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33857:16"/>
and also in the first Column toward the left hand downwards. This Table doth at first sight exhibit the Sum of any number, so often repeated as you shall require, provided the numbers do neither of them exceed 12.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Multiplication</hi> hath three Members, thus called, a <hi>Multiplicand,</hi> a <hi>Multiplicator,</hi> and a <hi>Product:</hi> The <hi>Multiplicand,</hi> is the number to be repeated; the <hi>Multiplicator,</hi> is the number of times the first is to be repeated; and the <hi>Product,</hi> is the Sum of the <hi>Multiplicand</hi> so often repeated. As for <hi>Example.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A Countrey-man sold 6 Bushels of Wheat for <hi>5 s.</hi> how many Shillings ought he to receive?</p>

                        <p>But by <hi>Multiplication</hi> it is done thus:</p>

Now if you look in the Table precedent, in the first Column find 5, then look in the first Rank for 6, and cast your Eye down to their Angle of meeting, and you will find 30 standing under 6 and against 5, I then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that 5 times 6 is 30; that is called the <hi>Product,</hi> and they will stand thus:</p>
                        <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <p>But when you have a number to multiply, greater than any in the Table, as for <hi>Example:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A Gentleman having forborn his Rent of a Farm, at <hi>157 l. per</hi> Quarter, for <hi>3</hi> Quarters, what ought he to receive?</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Multiplication</hi> will stand thus:</p>
                        <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <p>I then say, 3 times 7 is 21, I set down 1 and carry 2; then, 3 times 5 is 15 and 2 is 17, I set down 7 next the 1, and carry 1; saying, 3 times 1 is 3 and 1 is 4, as in the Example before-going; and the Product is 471 <hi>l.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>A Fraction or broken Number is always less than a Unite, as Pence are parts of a Shilling, and Shillings of a Pound; Inches of a Foot, and Minutes of an Hour, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>DIvision,</hi> both in whole Numbers and Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, is by young Practitioners found to be more difficult than any of the four Species; it will therefore require a little more industry in the Learner: But when once had, there will appear small difference between the Operation herein, as in any the precedent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Division</hi> is also constituted by three Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, and a fourth by accident, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend,</hi> a <hi>Divisor,</hi> and a <hi>Quotient:</hi> The fourth is a <hi>Remainder,</hi> which doth not always happen to be.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Dividend</hi> is the Number to be divided.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Divisor</hi> is the Number by which the other is to be divided.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Quotient</hi> is the Number found out by the Division.</p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Remainder</hi> is that which is left of the Dividend after the Division is ended, and is always less than the Divisor.</p>
                        <p>Example.</p>
                        <p>If 12 be to be divided by 4, then is 12 the Dividend, 4 the Divisor, and the Quotient will be 3.</p>
                        <p>If 13 be divided by 3, then 13 is the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend, 3 the Divisor, 4 the Quotient, and there will be a Remain, which is here 1.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:33857:31"/>
Decimal Fractions, or mixt Numbers, are divided after the same manner as whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are divided, only care must be had in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a true value to the Quotient. To perform which, observe well this General Rule.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>The first Figure in the Quotient is always of the same denomination with that Figure which stands (or is supposed to stand) over the Unity place in the Divisor.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>As to the manner of placing your Figures, and the way of dividing, there are many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by divers Writers of <hi>Arithmetick:</hi> The way of placing the Divisor under the Dividend, is the most apt for giving a value to the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; but the rasing of Figures, and repeating the Divisor so often, is found an inconvenience; which to avoid, observe the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
                        <p>Being to divide 2487.048 by 53.6, I place them in this order:</p>
                        <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <p>Then I consider if the Divisor were placed under the Dividend, the Unity place in the Divisor, here 3 would stand under the 8 in the Dividend, I then set a mark over the head of the 8, and conclude the first Figure in the Quotient to be of the same denomination with it, which is Tens, in whole Numbers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:33857:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                           </gap>
Having thus found the value of the first Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the Quotient, I proceed to the division, and inquire, how many times 5 in 24? I find 4; I then set 4 in the Quotient, and go back, multiplying the whole Divisor by that Figure, and subduct the Product out of the Dividend, placing the Remainder underneath as part of a new Dividend: Thus 4 times 6 is 24, from 27, and there remains 3, which I place under the 7; again, 4 times 3 is 12, and 2 that I borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is 14, from 18, and there remains 4, which I place under the <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, as in the Example; then 4 times 5 is 20, and 1 I borrowed is 21, from 24, and there remains 3, which I place under the 4. For my new Dividend, I bring down the next Figure, here a Cypher, and post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone it to the Remainder, and the Example will stand thus:</p>
                        <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <p>Then proceeding in my Division, I ask, how many times 5 in 34? finding 6 times, I then place 6 in the Quotient, and as before say, 6 times 6 is 36, from 40, and there remains 4, which I set down under the Cypher; then 6 times 3 is 18, and 4 I borrowed is 22, from 23,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33857:32"/>
and there remains 1, which I place under the 3; then 6 times 5 is 30, and 2 I borrowed is 32, from 34, and there will remain 2, which I place under the 4; then to this Remainder I bring down the next Figure in the Dividend, postponing it as I did the Cypher, and they will stand thus:</p>
                        <p>
                           <gap reason="math">

                           </gap>
I now inquire, how many times 5 in 21? and find 4 times, I then place 4 in the Quotient, and go on as before; there being yet a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I add a Cypher, and proceed as before; and find, upon the adding one Cypher, my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor greater than the Dividend, I place a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in the Quotient: Example.</p>
                        <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <p>Having placed a Cypher in the Quotient, I add another to the Dividend, and make it 800; and then inquire, how many times 5 in 8? finding once, I put 1 in the Quotient, working as before: Where note, So long as there is a Remainder, if you add Cyphers and work after this manner, you may have as many Decimals as you please.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:33857:32"/>
It doth often happen in Division, in decimal Fractions, or mixt Numbers, that the Unite place in the Divisor will stand beyond all the significant Figures in the Dividend, either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the right hand or toward the left; in which case, that you may the better find out the value of the first Figure in your Quotient (according to the precedent General Rule) add Cyphers to the right or to the left hand of the Dividend, till you come over the Unity place in the Divisor, and what value or denomination that place is of, that is the denomination of the first Figure in the quote; as in these</p>
                        <p>Examples.</p>

                        <p>If in Division in whole Numbers, there happen to be a Remainder, it is the Numerator of a Common Fraction, and the Divisor is the Denominator, and this Fraction is part of the quotient.</p>
                        <p>Example.</p>
                        <p>If you divide 66 by 8, the quotient will be 8 and 2/8, according to the way of Vulgar

                        <p>If you be to divide a whole by a decimal Number, cut off so many places by a mark, as there are Cyphers in the decimal Number: If 468 be divided by 10, the quote is 46.8; by 100, 4.68; and by 1000, quotes .468.</p>
                        <p>If a decimal Fraction, or a mixt Number, be to be divided by a decimal Number, remove your line or point so many places toward the left hand, as there are Cyphers in your decimal Number, supplying the vacant places with Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, if there be occasion: 69.5 divided by 10, is 6.95; by 100, it will be .695; by 1000, .0695; and by 10000, quotes .00695; &amp;c.</p>

                           <p>Again, having a decimal Eraction in the parts of a Pound, and its desired to know the value thereof in lesser denominations: Let it be the Fraction before found, <hi>viz.</hi> .890625: I seek in the Table of Fractions for the neerest to it,

and find .85, and against it 17 <hi>s.</hi> I then set .85 down, and subduct it from the other, and there remains .040625; I look over the Table again, and find the next neerest is .0375, against it 9 <hi>d.</hi> I subduct that; and find the Remainder .003125, stand against 3 Farthings.</p>

                        <p>THis Rule is called the <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause herein are three Numbers given, to find a fourth. It is also called the <hi>Rule of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi> for as the first is in proportion to the second, so is the third to the fourth: And the Converse.</p>
                        <p>This Rule is called the <hi>Golden Rule</hi> for its excellent use in the Solution of Questions of various kinds, and great advantage is made of it in almost all kind of Calculations Arithmetical.</p>
                        <p>

Two of the three Numbers given in every Rule of Proportion are of one denomination, and the third is of the same kind with the fourth sought; and one of the two Numbers that are of like <hi>species</hi> doth always ask the Question.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arithmeticians</hi> distinguish this Rule by two denominations, one they call the <hi>Direct,</hi> and the other the <hi>Inverse</hi> or <hi>Backer Rule of Three.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the three given Numbers of like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination in any Rule of Proportion is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor, the other remaining two are Multipliers. To find which of the forementioned Numbers is the Divisor, take these following Rules.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. If that Term to which the Question is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed be more than that of like denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and also requires more; or if it be less, and require less than the Term of like denomination; then that Term of like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to that which asketh the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is the Divisor, and the Question is in the <hi>Direct Rule of Three.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. If the Term which asketh the Question be more than that of like <hi>species,</hi> and requires less; or less, and requires more; then that Term which asketh the Question is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor, and the Question is in the <hi>Backer</hi> or <hi>Inverse Rule of Three.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Having by the precedent Rules discovered the Divisor, multiply the other two Numbers, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33857:38"/>
divide by the Divisor, your quote will be the Answer to the Question.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note,</hi> If any of the Numbers given be in several denominations, they must be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into one, either greater or lesser, as before directed.</p>
                        <p>Example.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest. 1.</hi> If <hi>12 1/2</hi> Yards of Taffaty cost <hi>5</hi> l. <hi>7</hi> s. <hi>9</hi> d. <hi>3</hi> q. what shall <hi>5 1/2</hi> Yards cost?</p>
                        <p>In this Example, of the three Numbers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there are two of like denomination, and they are 12 1/2 and 5 1/2, the latter of which is the Term which asketh the Question, known always by the words <hi>what</hi> or <hi>how much.</hi> And this Term is less than that of like kind with it self, and also requires less, therefore according to the precedent Rule, this Question is in the <hi>Golden Rule Direct.</hi> These three Numbers may be placed in what order you please, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you mistake not your Divisor, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the general way, being reduced into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimals, and of one <hi>species,</hi> they will stand thus:</p>

                        <p>Then, as before directed, multiply the second and third Numbers, and divide by the first, and the quotient exhibits the fourth Proportional or the Number sought.</p>

                        <p>Here the Term which asketh the Question is greater than the Term of like denomination, and requires more; therefore the Term of like denomination to the Term that asketh the Question is the Divisor.</p>

                        <p>Then for your second <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> take the other of the two Numbers to which the question is annexed, and let that ask the question; take also the Number of like kind, and the fourth Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber found in the first Calculation; judge which is your Divisor, and work accordingly; the last Quotient will be the sixth Number, or the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber sought.</p>

By the

subsequent Examples will it plainly appear, how useful such a Table to 1000 Roots would be in quadratique Equations, and in the Cubes also, which (were there incouragement given to the Sons of Art) I doubt not but some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Person would enrich the World there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; these being long since Calculated by Mr. <hi>Henry Briggs</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and given me by my honoured Friend, Mr. <hi>John Collins,</hi> his desire being to have them made more publick, and the conveniency of such a Table (before mentioned) shewn, by some Examples upon this.</p>

The manner of making this Table, is no more than adding one Term to the given num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Terms, and take half the Sum.</p>
                        <p>Example.</p>
                        <p>Is three four-months given, add 4 to 12, the Sum will be 16, half that Sum, <hi>viz.</hi> 8 months, is the equated Time of Payment.</p>
                        <p>This indeed is but an approximation, though near enough the truth for practice. That excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Accomptant Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> in a Sheet Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1665. hath taught a more exact way of Equation: <hi>Simple Interest, prop.</hi> 4. <hi>Compute</hi> (saith he) <hi>all the present worths, and then by proportion, if all those present worths did</hi> 1 l. <hi>amount to in the said time? From the result subtract an Vnite, the Remainder is the Interest of</hi> 1 l. <hi>for the time sought, which divide by the Interest of</hi> 1 l. <hi>for one Day, and the Quote is the Number of Days sought.</hi>
                        </p>

                     <p>The Answer 6 months.</p>
                     <p>It may here be expected that I should lay down the Construction of the Logarithms, having made use of them in these Calculations, but this being design'd a small <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> and there being large Volumns of that Subject in the World already, by several more learned Pens, I think it unnecessary to say any thing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33857:71"/>
further thereof, for as they are of excellent use, so are they easie to be had.</p>
                     <p>COmpound Interest <hi>Infinite,</hi> may be so called as it relates to divers equal Payments at equal times, but the number of those equal times are infinite, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> when an Estate in Fee-Simple shall be sold for ever. Now there being usually an interval of time, between the Purchasers Payment and the reception of his first Rent, be it yearly, half yearly, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly;</p>
                     <p>Any Question of this Nature may be wrought by the following Analogism:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>Putting V = the Rent (yearly or quarterly)</item>

Furthermore, if it be inquired how many years Purchase any Annuity is worth, putting R = the Ratio as before, and Y the number of Years, the Rule is:</p>

Again, if an Estate be offered at any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Years Purchase, and it be demanded what Rate of Interest the Purchaser shall have for his Money, the Rule is:</p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

                     <p>That is, Divide Unity by the number of Years propos'd, and the Quote exhibits the Ratio, less Unity.</p>
                     <p>Example.</p>
                     <p>An Estate is offered at 20 Years Purchase, what Rate of Interest shall the Purchaser then have?</p>

                     <p>There are many Tables of Compound In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest Printed in sundry Books for the valuation of Leases and Annuities, but they are generally made for yearly Payments, when indeed by the common and most usual Covenants in Leases the Tenant is obliged to pay quarterly; and in Le<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As Spheroidal,</p>
                     <p>As The Frustum of a Parabolical Spindle,</p>

                     <p>And forasmuch as the Dimensions must be the first thing known, before the Content can be found, I shall therefore shew the young Tyro, how by some of the Dimensions to find the rest, if any obstruction prohibit the taking of all.</p>

                           </list>
                           <p>And the Content of the whole Cask in Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons.</p>
                           <p>Then by the help of a Table of Area's of Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Circle, whose Area is Unity, and the Radius divided in the Ratio of 1.0000 Parts, say by the Rule of Proportion:</p>
                           <gap reason="math">
