         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and Priests of H. Church, whom neither the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crednesse

               <pb facs="tcp:100408:4"/>
neer a tye as the necessity of their own preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the midst of so apparent danger, it will
tye the <hi>Bishops</hi> hearts, and hands to the King
faster then all the tyes of Lay-Allegiance, (all the
Politicall tyes I mean,) all that are not precisely
religious, and obligations in the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>2. But the interest of the <hi>Bishops</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
with the prosperity of the <hi>King,</hi> besides
the interest of their own securitie; by the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of secular advantages. For they who
have their livelyhood from the <hi>King,</hi> and are in
expectance of their fortune from him are more
likely to pay a tribute of exacter duty, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whose fortunes are not in such immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
dependancy on His Majesty. <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi>
once gave a merry reason why Clerks advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Pope above a Councell, <hi>viz.</hi> because the
Pope gave spirituall promotions, but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
gave none. It is but the Common expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of gratitude, that a Patron Paramount shall
be more assisted by his Beneficiaries in cases of
necessity, then by those, who receive nothing
from him but the common influences of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100408:4"/>
3. But the <hi>Bishops</hi> duty to the <hi>King</hi> derives
it selfe from a higher fountaine. For it is one of
the maine excellencies in Christianity, that it
advances the State, and well being of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,
and Bodies Politique. Now then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of Religion the Reverend <hi>Bishops,</hi> whose
peculiar office it is to promote the interests of
Christianity, are by the nature and essentiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites
of their office bound to promote the
Honour and Dignity of <hi>Kings,</hi> whom Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
would have so much honour'd, as to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the just subordination of people to their
Prince, upon better principles then ever, no lesse
then their precise duty to God, and the hopes of
a blissefull immortality. Here then is <hi>utile, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum,</hi>
and <hi>necessarium,</hi> to tye <hi>Bishops</hi> in duty
to <hi>Kings;</hi> and a threefold Cord is not easily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of these obligations <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
payes three returnes of tribute to Monarchy.</p>
            <p>1. The first is the Duty of their people. For
they being by God himselfe set over soules,
judges of the most secret recesses of our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and the venerable Priests under them,


<pb facs="tcp:100408:5"/>
have more power to keep men in their duteous
subordination to the Prince, then there is in any
secular power, by how much more forcible the
impressions of the Conscience are, then all the
externall violence in the world. And this power
they have fairely put into act, for there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Protestant <hi>Bishop</hi> yet in Rebellion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he turn'd recreant to his Order, and it is the
honour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that all her
Children, and obedient people are full of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
against Rebells, be they of any interest, or
party whatsoever. For here (&amp; for it we thanke
God and good Princes) <hi>Episcopacy</hi> hath been
preserv'd in faire priviledges and honour, and
God hath blest and honour'd <hi>Episcopacy</hi> with
the conjunction of a loyall people. As if because
in the law of Nature the Kingdome and Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
were joyned in one person, it were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and consonant to the first justice, that Kings
should defend the rights of the Church, and the
Church advance the honour of <hi>Kings.</hi> And
when I consider that the first <hi>Bishop</hi> that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auctorated
was a Prince too, Prince, and <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> me thinks it was an ill <hi>Omen,</hi> that the


<pb facs="tcp:100408:5"/>
cause of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Bishop</hi> should be in
Conjunction ever after.</p>
            <p>2. A second returne that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> makes
to <hi>Royalty</hi> is that which is the Duty of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the paying tributes, and impositions. And
though all the <hi>Kings</hi> Leige people doe it, yet the
issues of their duty, and liberality are mightily
disproportionate if we consider their unequall
Number, and Revenues. And if Clergy-subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
be estimated according to the smallnesse
of their revenue, and paucity of persons, it will
not be half so short of the number, and weight
of Crownes from Lay Dispensation, as it does
farre exceed in the proportion of the Donative.</p>
            <p>3. But the assistance that the Kings of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
had in their Counsells, and affaires of
greatest difficulty, from the great ability of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
and other the Ministers of the Church, I
desire to represent in the words of K. <hi>Alvred</hi> to
<hi>Walfsigeus</hi> the <hi>Bishop,</hi> in an Epistle where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores
the misery of his owne age by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it with the former times, when the <hi>Bishops</hi>
were learn'd, and exercis'd in publike Counsels.

               <item>28 And these were a distinct order from the rest, p. 156</item>
               <item>29 To which the Presbyterate was but a degree, p. 160</item>

that was his Province. To shut up publick
Schooles, to force Christians to ignorance, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish,

vile, and dishonourable, these were his arts; and he
did the Divell more service in this finenesse of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining,
then all the open battery of the ten
great Rammes of persecution. But this would not

But therefore besides these he attempted by <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies</hi>
to rent the Churches bowels all in pieces; but
the good <hi>Bishops</hi> gathered up the scattered pieces
&amp; reunited them at <hi>Nice,</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>

however it is, <hi>Antichrist</hi> must come at last, and the

great declensions of Christianity. <hi>When ye heare of

            <p>For if <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall exalt himselfe above all

King be Christian, in very neer conjunction,) does
the work of <hi>Antichrist</hi> for him; especially if the
men, whom it most concernes, will but call to
mind, that the discipline, or Government, which
Christ hath instituted, is that Kingdome, by which
he governes all Christendome (so themselves have
taught us) so that, in case it be proved, that <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>
is <hi>that government,</hi> then they (to use their own

and then, either they leave the Church without a

            <p>We all wish, that our feares in this, and all things
else, may be vaine, that what we feare, may not
come upon us; but yet that the <hi>abolition of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>
is <hi>the fore-runner,</hi> and <hi>praparatory to the great
Apostacy,</hi> I have these reasons to shew, at least the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> probability. <hi>First,</hi> Because here is a concurse of
times; for now after that these times have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>last</hi> times, for 1600 years together, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation

of Christendome,</hi> may portend now in these times,
when we all expect <hi>Antichrist</hi> to be revealed is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of a jealous mans inquiry. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
if we consider the finall cause, was instituted
as an <hi>obstructive to the diffusion of Schisme and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy.</hi>

therefore if <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>division</hi> be destructive of


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100408:11"/>
each other, then <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is the best <hi>deletery</hi> in the
world for <hi>Schisme:</hi> and so much the rather because
they are <hi>in eâdem materiâ;</hi> for <hi>Schisme</hi> is a division
for things either personall, or accidentall, which are
matters, most properly the subject of government,
and there to be tryed, there to receive their first, and
last breath, except where they are starv'd to death
by a <hi>desuetude;</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is an Unity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
governing, and ordering persons, and things,
accidentall, and substantiall; and therefore a direct
confronting of <hi>Schisme,</hi> not only in the <hi>intention</hi> of
the author of it, but in the <hi>nature of the institution.</hi>
Now then, although <hi>Schismes</hi> alwaies will be, and
this by divine prediction (which clearly showes
the <hi>necessity</hi> of perpetuall Episcopacy, and the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
of its perpetuity, either by <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe
ordaining it, who made the prophecy, or by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
and <hi>Apostolick men</hi> at least, who knew the
prophecy:) yet to be sure, these divisions, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
shall be greater about, and at the time of the
<hi>Great Apostacy;</hi> for then, were not the houres turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into minutes, an universall ruine should seize all
Christendome [<hi>No flesh should be saved if those daies
were not shortned.</hi>] is it not next to an evidence of
fact, that this multiplication of <hi>Schismes</hi> must be
<hi>removendo prohibens?</hi> and therefore that must be by
<hi>invalidating Episcopacy,</hi> ordayn'd as the <hi>remedy</hi> and
<hi>obex of Schisme,</hi> either tying their hands behind
them, by taking away their <hi>coërcion,</hi> or by putting

The adversary of <hi>Christ</hi> and enemy of his
<hi>Spouse</hi> therefore persecutes the <hi>Bishop,</hi> that having
taken <hi>him</hi> away, he may without check pride him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the ruines of the <hi>Church;</hi> and a little after
speaking of them, that are enemies to Bishops, he
sayes, that, <hi>Antichristi jam propinquantis adventum
imitantur,</hi> their deportment is just after the guise of
<hi>Antichrist</hi> who is shortly to be revealed.</p>
            <p>But be this conjecture vaine, or not, the thing, of
it selfe is of deep consideration, and the <hi>Catholick
practise of Christendome for 1500 years is</hi> so insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
a prejudice against the enemies of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
that they must bring admirable evidence of
Scripture, or a cleare <hi>revelation proved by Miracles,</hi>
or a contrary <hi>undoubted tradition Apostolicall</hi> for
themselves, or else hope for no beliefe against the
prescribed possession of so many ages.</p>
            <p>But before I begin, mee thinks in this contestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

it? For if <hi>Episcopacy</hi> cannot make its title
good, they loose the benefit of their prescribed
possession. If it can; I feare they will scarce gain
so much, as the <hi>obedience</hi> of the adverse party by it,
which yet already is their due. It is very unequall;
but so it is ever, when <hi>Authority</hi> is the matter of the
Question. Authority never gaines by it; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the cause goe on its side, yet it looses <hi>costs,</hi>
and <hi>dammages;</hi> for it must either by faire condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to gain the adversaries', loose something of it
selfe, or, if it asserts it selfe to the utmost, it is but
where it was; but that seldome or never happens,
for the very questioning of any authority, <hi>hoc ipso,</hi>
makes a great intrenchment even to the very skirts
of its cloathing.</p>
            <p>But <hi>hûc deventumest.</hi> Now we are in, we must
goe over.</p>
            <p>FIrst then, that wee may build upon a Rock.<note place="margin">§. 1. Christ did institute a governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Church.</note>
               <hi>Christ</hi> did institute a <hi>government</hi> to order and
rule his Church by his authority, according to his
lawes, and by the assistance of the B. Spirit.</p>
            <p>1. If this were not true, how shall the Church
be governed? For I hope the adversaries of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
that are so punctuall to pitch all upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ground, will be sure to produce cleare Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
for so maine a part of Christianity, as is the
forme of the Government of Christs Church.
And, if for our private actions; and duties <hi>Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi>
they will pretend a text, I suppose, it will not
be thought possible, Scripture should make default


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100408:13"/>
in assignation of the <hi>publick Government,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as all lawes intend the publick, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
directly; the private, and the particular, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
only, and comprehension within the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>2. If Christ himselfe did not take order for a
government, then we must derive it from <hi>humane
prudence,</hi> and emergency of conveniences, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curse
of new circumstances, and then the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must often be <hi>changed,</hi> or else time must stand
still, and things be ever in the same state and possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Both the consequents are extreamely full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.
For if it be left to <hi>humane prudence,</hi>
then either the government of the Church is not in
immediate order to the good, and benison of soules,
or if it be, that such an institution, in such immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
order to eternity, should be dependant upon <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
prudence,</hi> it were to trust such a rich commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
in a cock-boat, that no wise Pilot will be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to doe. But if there be often <hi>changes</hi> in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
Ecclesiasticall (which was the other
consequent) in the publike frame I meane, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of it; either the certain infinity of Schismes
will arise, or the dangerous issues of publick incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
and innovation, which, in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is good for nothing, but to make men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
all; and, come the best that can come, there
will be so many <hi>Church-governments,</hi> as there are
<hi>humane Prudences.</hi>

flames; in these Christ did not promise perpetuall
assistance, for then it had been done, and still these
signes should have followed them that believe.
But we see they doe not. It followes then, that in
all the ordinary parts of power and office Christ did
promise to be with them to the end of the world,
and therefore there must remaine a power of giving
faculty, and capacity to persons successively for
the execution of that, in which Christ promised
perpetuall assistance. For since this perpetuall assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
could not be meant of abiding with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who in few years were to forsake the world, it
must needs be understood of their function, which
either it must be succeeded to, or else it was as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
as their persons. But in the extraordinary
priviledges of the Apostles they had no successors,
therefore of necessity a succession must be constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ordinary office of Apostolate. Now what
is this ordinary office? Most certainly since the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
(as is evident) was only a helpe for the
founding and beginning, the other are such as are
necessary for the perpetuating of a Church. Now
in clear evidence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence, these offices and powers
are <hi>Preaching, Baptizing, Consecrating, Ordaining,</hi>
and <hi>Governing.</hi> For these were necessary for the

            <p>2. S. <hi>Iames</hi> the Brother of our Lord is called an
Apostle, and yet he was not in the number of the

S. <hi>Iames</hi> was called an Apostle appears by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Galat. 19.</note> [<hi>But other Apostles saw I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

none of the twelve, appears also because among the
twelve Apostles, there were but two <hi>Iames's.</hi> The
sonne of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the sonne of <hi>Zebedee,</hi>
the Brother of <hi>Iohn.</hi> But neither of these was the

this S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates in making a distinct enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the appearances which Christ made after
the resurrection. First to <hi>Cephas,</hi> then to the twelve,
then to the 500. Brethren, then to <hi>Iames,</hi> then to all
the Apostles. So that here S. <hi>Iames</hi> is reckoned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
from the twelve, and they from the whole
Colledge of the Apostles, for there were (it seems)
more of that dignity then the twelve. But this will
also safely rely upon the concurrent testimony of

There S. <hi>Iames</hi> the Bishop of Ierusalem is called an

the Apostle of Iesus Christ, not of man, neither
by man, but by Iesus Christ. So, <hi>Peter</hi> an Apostle

               </gap>. <hi>The Apostles of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
Apostles, I say, in the Episcopall sence. They
were none of the twelve, they were not of <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
divine mission,</hi> but of <hi>Apostolike ordination,</hi> they
were actually Bishops as I shall shew hereafter. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
was Bishop of <hi>Crete,</hi> and <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi>
and these were the Apostles, for <hi>Titus</hi> came
with the <hi>Corinthian, Epaphroditus</hi> with the <hi>Colossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
liberality. Now these men were not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
called, <hi>Messengers</hi> in respect of these Churches <hi>send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them with their contributions. 1. Because they
are not called the Apostles of these Churches, to
wit, whose almes they carried, but simply <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
of the Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> of their own of which they
were Bishops. For if the title of [<hi>Apostle</hi>] had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100408:19"/>
to their mission from these Churches, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable
that there should be no terme of relation
expressed. 2. It is very cleare that although they
did indeed carry the benevolence of the severall
Churches,<note place="margin">Vers. 22.</note> yet S. <hi>Paul,</hi> not those Churches sent
them, <hi>And we have sent with them our Brother, &amp;c.</hi>
3. They are called <hi>Apostles of the Churches,</hi> not
going from <hi>Corinth</hi> with the mony, but before they
came thither from whence they were to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch't
in legation to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 23.</note> [<hi>If any enquire of
Titus. . . . or the Brethren, they are the Apostles of the
Church, and the glory of Christ.</hi>] So they were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
before they went to <hi>Corinth,</hi> not for their
being imployed in the transportation of their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
So that it is plaine, that their Apostolate being
not relative to the Churches whose benevolence
they carried, and they having Churches of their
own, as <hi>Titus</hi> had <hi>Crete, Epaphroditus</hi> had <hi>Philippi,</hi>
their Apostolate was a fixt residence, and superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency
of their severall Churches.</p>
            <p>BVt in holy Scripture the identity of the ordinary
office of Apostleship and Episcopacy,<note place="margin">§ 5. And office,</note> is clearer
yet. For when the holy Spirit had sent seaven letters
to the seaven <hi>Asian Bishops,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apocal. 2.</note> the <hi>Angell</hi> of the Church

little trying was needfull to discover their folly in

he could deserve but small commendations for the

the Apostles all were then dead, and he known

had not constituted Bishops in all the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100408:20"/>
joyfull at their power over Divells, wee heare
no more of them in the Gospell, but that
their Names were written in heaven. Wee are
likely therefore to heare of them after the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if they can but hold their owne. And so we doe.
For after the Passion the Apostles gathered them
together, and joyn'd them in Clericall commission
by vertue of Christs first ordination of them, for a
new ordination we find none in holy Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
before we find them doing Clericall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Ananias</hi> we read baptizing of <hi>Saul, Philip</hi> the

            <p>Here are plainly two offices of Ecclesiasticall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries.
<hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> so the Scripture
calls them.<note place="margin">§ 7. Giving to Apostles a power to doe some offices per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually necessary, which to others he gave not.</note> These were distinct, and not temporary,
but succeeded to, and if so, then here is clearely a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
institution of two Orders, and yet Deacons nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them. Here let us fix a while.</p>
            <p>1. THen; It is cleare in Scripture that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did some acts of Ministery which were
necessary to be done for ever in the Church, and
therefore to be committed to their successors, which


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100408:21"/>
acts the seventy Disciples or Presbyters could not
doe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

which the 72 did not, the case is knowne, <hi>Act.</hi>

to choose seaven men whom they might constitute

They did so, and set them before the twelue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
so they are specified and numbred <hi>vers. 2. cum</hi>
6. and when they had prayed, they lay'd their hands
on them. They, not the Disciples, not the 72 who
were there actually present, and seaven of them were
then ordayn'd to this Ministery, for they were not
now ordayn'd to be <gap reason="foreign">

which Number were those seaven ordained and set
over the widdowes. And the same is intimated by
S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
What dignity
had these seaven here ordained? of Deacons? No;
for this dispensation is made by <hi>Priests</hi> not <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons;</hi>
               <note place="margin">In hanc locu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>

               </gap>.
The name and dignity of these seaven was
no lesse, but even the dignity of Presbyters, only
for the time they were appointed to dispense the
goods of the Church for the good of the faithfull
people. Presbyters they were say S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
and <hi>Theophylact;</hi> of the number of the 72. saith <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius.</hi>
But however, it is cleare that the 72.
were present, for the whole multitude of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
was as yet there resident, they were not yet
sent abroad, they were not scattered with persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
till the Martyrdome of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> [but the
twelve called the whole multitude of the Disciples]
to them about this affaire. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. But yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
only did ordaine them.</p>
            <p>2. An instance paralell to this, is in the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of hands upon S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts. 13.</note> in the
first ordination that was held at <hi>Antioch.</hi> [Now
there were in the Church that was at <hi>Antioch</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Prophets and Teachers, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Manäen,</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
while <hi>these men</hi> were Ministring, the holy
Ghost said to <hi>them,</hi> separate me <hi>Barnabas</hi> and
<hi>Saul.</hi>] They did so, they [fasted, they prayed,
they laid their hands on them, and <hi>sent them away.</hi>
So they being <hi>sent forth by the holy Ghost,</hi> departed
into <hi>Seleucia.</hi>] This is the story, now let us make
our best on't. Here then was the ordination and
imposition of hands complete, and that was said to


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100408:22"/>
be done by the holy Ghost which was done by the
Prophets of <hi>Antioch.</hi> For <hi>they</hi> sent them away, and
yet the next words are, so they being sent forth by
the <hi>holy Ghost.</hi> So that here was the thing done, and
that by the Prophets alone, and that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Holy Ghost, and said to be his act.
Well! but what were these Prophets? They were
Prophets in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prophetas du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici genere intelligamus, &amp; futura di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes &amp; Scripturas revelantes. <hi>S. Ambros: in 1. Corinth.</hi> 12.</note> not such as
<hi>Agabus,</hi> and the daughters of <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangelist,
Prophets of prediction extraordinary, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of ordinary office and ministration, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
Prophets and Teachers and
Ministers. More then ordinary Ministers, for they
were Doctors or Teachers, and that's not all, for
they were Prophets too. This even at first sight is
more then the ordinary office of the Presbytery.
We shall see this cleare enough in S. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> where
the ordinary office of Prophets is reckoned before
Pastors, before Evangelists, next to Apostles, that
is next to such Apostles <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> there
expresses it, next to those Apostles to whom Christ
hath given immediate mission. And these are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Apostles too, Apostles <hi>secundi or dinis,</hi> none of
the twelve, but such as S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe. To be sure they
were such Prophets as S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for
they are reckoned in the number by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> for
here it was that S. <hi>Paul</hi> although he had immediate
vocation by Christ, yet he had particular ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to this Apostolate or Ministery of the Gentiles.
It is evident then what Prophets these were, they


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100408:22"/>
they were at the least more then ordinary Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and therefore they impos'd hands, and they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And yet to make the businesse up compleat, S.
<hi>Marke</hi> was amongst them, but he impos'd no hands,
he was there as the Deacon and Minister [<hi>vers.</hi> 5.]
but he medled not, S. <hi>Luke</hi> fixes the whole action
upon the Prophets, such as S, <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe was,
and so did the Holy Ghost too, but neither did S.
<hi>Marke</hi> who was an Evangelist, and one of the 72
Disciples (as he is reckoned in the Primitive Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Dorotheus</hi>) nor any of the
Colledge of the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Presbyters, that were
lesse then Prophets, that is, who were not more then
meere Presbyters.</p>
            <p>The summe is this: Imposition of hands is a duty
&amp; office necessary for the perpetuating of a Church,
<hi>ne Gens sit Vnius aetatis,</hi> least it expire in one age:
this power of imposition of hands for Ordination
was fix't upon the <hi>Apostles</hi> and Apostolike men,
and not communicated to the 72 <hi>Disciples</hi> or <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi>
for the Apostles, and Apostolike men, did so
<hi>de facto,</hi> and were commanded to doe so, and the 72
never did so, therefore this office and Ministery of
the <hi>Apostolate</hi> is distinct, and superiour to that of
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> and this distinction must be so continued
to all ages of the Church, for the thing was not
temporary but productive of issue and succession,
and therefore as perpetuall as the Clergy, as the
Church it selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100408:23"/>
2. THe Apostles did impose hands for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Baptized people,<note place="margin">§ 8. And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</note> and this was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
act of a power to be succeeded to, and yet
not communicated, nor executed by the 72, or any
other <hi>meere Presbyter.</hi> That the Apostles did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
Baptized people, and others of the inferiour
Clergie could not, is beyond all exception cleare in
the case of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Christians. <hi>Acts.</hi> 8. For
when S. <hi>Philip</hi> had converted, and Baptized the
Men of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Apostles sent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to
lay their hands on them that they might receive the
Holy Ghost. S. <hi>Philip</hi> he was an Evangelist, he was
one of the 72 Disciples,<note n="*" place="margin">S. Cyprian: ad Iubajan.</note> a Presbyter, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the same ministration that S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the poore Widdowes, yet he could not doe
this, the Apostles must and did. This giving of the
Holy Ghost by imposition of the Apostles hands,
was not for a miraculous gift, but an ordinary
Grace. For S. <hi>Philip</hi> could, and did doe miracles
enough, but this Grace he could not give, the
Grace of consigning or confirmation. The like case
is in <hi>Acts.</hi> 19. where some people having been
Baptized at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> confirmed them, giving
them the Holy Ghost by imposition of hands. The
Apostles did it; not the twelue only, but Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
men, the other Apostles. S. <hi>Paul</hi> did it. S. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
could not, nor any of the 72, or any other <hi>meere
Presbyters</hi> ever did it, that we find in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Yea; but this imposition of hands, was for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100408:23"/>
issue, for the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Christians received
the Holy Ghost, and spake with tongues and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied,
which effect because it is ceased, certainly
the thing was temporary and long agoe expired. 1.
Not for this reason to be sure. For extraordinary
effects may be temporary, when the function which
they attest may be eternall, and therefore are no
signes of an extraordinary Ministery. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
preaching was attended by Miracles, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
conversions of people [<q>ut in exordio, Apostolos divinorum signorum comitabantur effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
&amp; Spiritûs Sancti gratia, ità ut videres unâ
alloquutione integros simul populos ad cultum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae
religionis adduci, &amp; praedicantium verbis nonesse
tardiorem audientium fidem,</q>] as <note n="*" place="margin">lib: 3 hist: cap. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Eusebius</hi> tels
of the successe of the preaching of some Evangelists;
yet I hope preaching must not now cease because
no Miracles are done, or that to convert one man
now would be the greatest Miracle. The Apostles
when they curs'd and anathematiz'd a delinquent,
he dyed suddainly, as in the case of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi>
whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> slew with the word of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
and yet now although these extraordinary
issues cease, it is not safe venturing upon the curses
of the Church. When the Apostles did excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
a sinner, he was presently delivered over
to Sathan to be buffeted, that is, to be afflicted with
corporall punishments, and now although no such
exterminating Angels beat the bodyes of persons
excommunicate, yet the power of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I hope still remaines in the Church, and the


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100408:24"/>
power of the Keyes is not also gone: So also in the
power of <hi>confirmation,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">vide Augast. tract. 6. in 1. Epist. Iohan.</note> which however attended
by a visible miraculous descent of the Holy Ghost
in gifts of languages and healing, yet like other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
in respect of the whole integrity of Christian
faith, these miracles at first did confirme the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the faith for ever.</p>
            <p>Now then that this right of imposing hands for
confirming of baptiz'd people, was not to expire
with the persons of the Apostles, appeares from
these considerations.</p>
            <p>1. Because Christ made a promise of sending
<hi>Vicarium suum Spiritum,</hi> the Holy Ghost in his
stead; and this by way of appropriation is called <hi>the
promise of the Father;</hi> This was pertinent to all
Christendome. <hi>Effundam de spiritu meo super om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
carnem,</hi> so it was in the Prophecy. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is to you and to your Children <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<note place="margin">Act. 2. 39.</note> and <hi>to all</hi> them that are a
farre off, even to as many as the Lord shall call. So
it was in the first accomplishing. <hi>To all.</hi> And this
<hi>for ever,</hi> for [I will send the Holy Ghost unto you,
and he shall abide with you <hi>for ever</hi>] for it was <hi>in
subsidium,</hi> to supply the comforts of his desired pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and must therefore <hi>ex vi intentionis</hi> be rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
till Christ's comming againe. Now then this
promise being to be communicated <hi>to all,</hi> and that
<hi>for ever,</hi> must either come to us by <hi rend="sup">1</hi> extraordinary
and miraculous mission, or by <hi rend="sup">2</hi> an ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.
Not the first; for we might as well expect
the gift of Miracles. If the second (as it is most


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100408:24"/>
certaine so) then the mayne Question is evicted, viz:
that something perpetually necessary was in the
power of the Apostles, which was not in the power
of the inferiour Ministers, nor of any, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their Colleagues, to wit, <hi>Ministerium S.
Spiritûs,</hi> or the ordinary office of giving the holy
Ghost by imposition of hands. For this promise
was performed to the Apostles in <hi>Pentecost,</hi> to the
rest of the faithfull after Baptisme, <hi>Quod n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Serm. de Penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coste.</note> saith <hi>Eusebius Emissenus,</hi>
Now we find no other way of performing it, nor
any ordinary conveyance of the Spirit to all people,
but this; and we find that the H. Ghost actually was
given this way. Therefore the effect, to wit, the H.
Ghost being to continue forever, and the promise
of Universall concernement, this way also of it's
communication, to wit, by Apostolicall imposition
of hands, is also <hi>perpetuum ministerium,</hi> to be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to and to abide for ever.</p>
            <p>2 This Ministery of imposition of hands for
confirmation of baptized people is so farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a temporary Grace, and to determine with the
persons of the Apostles, that it is a fundamentall
point of Christianity, an essentiall ingredient to it's
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>position.<note place="margin">Hebr. 6. 2.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> is my Author. [Therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

on unto perfection, not laying againe the <hi>foundation</hi>
of Repentance from dead works, faith towards God,
the doctrine of baptisme, <hi>and of laying on of hands.</hi>


               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100408:25"/>
&amp;c. Here is imposition of hands reckoned as part
of the foundation and a principle of Christianity in
<hi>S. Pauls</hi> Catechisme. Now, imposition of hands
is used by Name in Scripture but for two Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi rend="sup">1</hi> For ordination, &amp; <hi rend="sup">2</hi> for this whatsover it is.
Imposition of hands for ordination does indeed
give the Holy Ghost, but not as he is that promise
which is called <hi>the promise of the Father.</hi> For the
Holy Ghost for ordination was given before the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension.
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 20. But the promise of the H. Ghost
the comforter [the <hi>Paraclete,</hi> I say, not the <hi>Orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or fountaine of Priestly order,</hi> that] was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
till the day of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> and besides, it was
promis'd to all Christian people, and the other was
given onely to the Clergy.</p>
            <p>* Adde to this, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> having laid this in
the foundation makes his progresse from this to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
(as he calls it) that is to higher mysteries,
and then his discourse is immediately of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
Evangelicall, which is Originally in Christ,
ministerially in the Clergy; so that unlesse we will
either confound the termes of his progresse, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
him to make the Ministery of the Clergy, the
foundation of Christs Priesthood, and not rather
contrary, it is cleare that by imposition of hands, S.
<hi>Paul</hi> meanes not ordination, and therefore confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
there being no other ordinary Ministery of
imposition of hands but these two specifyed in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture. For, as for benediction in which Christ
used the ceremony, and as for healing in which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi>
and the Apostles us'd it; the first is clearely


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100408:25"/>
no Principle or fundamentall point of Christianity;
and the Second is confessedly extraordinary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the argument is still firme upon it's first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>3. Lastly, the Primitive Church did <hi>de facto,</hi>
and beleiv'd themselves to be tyed <hi>de jure</hi> to use this
rite of Confirmation and giving of the Holy Ghost
after Baptisme.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells a story
of a young man whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had converted and

in the forequoted Epistle. Whence it is evident,

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100408:26"/>
only could doe it, I shall make evident in the
descent of this discourse. Here the Scene lies in
Scripture, where it is cleare that S. <hi>Philip,</hi> one of the
72. <hi>Disciples,</hi> as antiquity reports him, and an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist
and a <hi>Disciple,</hi> as Scripture also expresses
him, could not impose hands for application of the
promise of the Father, and ministeriall giving of
the holy Ghost, but the Apostles must goe to doe it;
and also there is no example in Scripture of any that
ever did it but an Apostle, and yet this is an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ministery which <hi>de jure</hi> ought, &amp; <hi>de facto</hi> alwaies
was continued in the Church. Therefore there
must alwaies be an ordinary office of Apostleship
in the Church to doe it, that is, an office above
Presbyters, for in Scripture they could never doe
it, and this is it which we call <hi>Episcopacy.</hi>
            </p>

<hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Austin.</hi> But however it is evident in


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100408:27"/>
Scripture, that the Apostles had such superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
over the inferior Clergy (Presbyters I mean
and Deacons) and a superiority of jurisdiction, and
therefore it is certain that Christ gave it them, for
none of the Apostles took this honour, but he that
was called of God as was <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Our blessed Saviour gave to the Apostles
<hi>plenitudinem potestatis.</hi> It was <hi>sicut misit me Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
&amp;c.</hi> As my Father sent, so I send. You, my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
whom I have chosen. This was not said to
Presbyters, for they had no commission at all given
to them by Christ, but at their first mission to
preach repentance, I say no commission at all, they
were not spoken to, they were not present. Now
then consider. Suppose that as <hi>Aërius</hi> did deny the
Divine institution of Bishops over the Presbyters
<hi>cum grege,</hi> another as confident as he should deny
the Divine institution of Presbyters, what proof
were there in all the holy Scripture to shew the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
institution of them as a distinct order from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
or Bishops. Indeed Christ selected 72. and
gave them commission to preach, but that commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was temporary and expired before the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion
for ought appeares in Scripture. If it be said
the Apostles did ordaine Presbyters in every City,
it is true, but not sufficient, for so they ordained
Deacons at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in all established Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and yet this will not tant' amount to an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Divine institution for Deacons, and how can
it then for Presbyters? If we say a constant Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
traditive interpretation of Scripture, does


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100408:27"/>
teach us, that Christ did institute the <hi>Presbyterate</hi>
together with <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and made the Apostles
Presbyters as well as Bishops; this is true. But then
1. We recede from the plain words of Scripture,
and rely upon tradition, which in this question of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy
will be of dangerous consequence to the
enimies of it, for the same tradition, if that be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
for good probation, is for Episcopall prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
over Presbyters, as will appeare in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel.
2. Though no use be made of this advantage,
yet to the allegation it will be quickly answered,
that it can never bee proved from Scripture, that
Christ made the Apostles Priests first, and then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
or Apostles, but only that Christ gave them
severall commissions, and parts of the office Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall,
all which being in one person, cannot by
force of Scripture prove two orders. Truth is, if
we change the scene of warre, and say that the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterate,</hi>
as a distinct order from the ordinary office
of Apostleship, is not of Divine institution, the
proof of it would be harder then for the Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> Especially if we consider
that in all the enumerations of the parts of Cleric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l
offices,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> there is no enumeration of <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Corinth. 12.</note> but
of <hi>Apostles</hi> there is; and the other members of the
induction are of guifts of Christianity, or par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of
the Apostolate, and either must inferre many more
orders, then the Church ever yet admitted of, or
none, distinct from the Apostolate, insomuch as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were Pastors, and Teachers, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
and Rulers, and had the guift of tongues, of


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100408:28"/>
healing, and of Miracles. This thing is of great
consideration, and this use I will make of it: That
either Christ made the 72 to be Presbyters, and
in them instituted the distinct order of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
as the ancient Church alwaies did believe, or
else he gave no distinct commission for any such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
order. If the second be admitted, then the
Presbyterate is not of <hi>immediate divine</hi> institution,
but of <hi>Apostolicall</hi> only, as is the Order of Deacons,
and the whole plenitude of power is in the order A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall
alone, and the Apostles did constitute
Presbyters with a greater portion of their own
power, as they did Deacons with a lesse. But if the
first be said, then the commission to the 72 Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being only of preaching that we find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
all the rest of their power which now they
have is by Apostolicall ordinance, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Apostles did admit them <hi>in partem solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudinis,</hi>
yet they did not admit them <hi>in plenitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
potestatis,</hi> for then they must have made them
Apostles, and then there will be no distinction of
order neither by <hi>Divine</hi> nor <hi>Apostolicall</hi> institution
neither.</p>
            <p>I care not which part be chosen, one is certain;
but if either of them be true, then since to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
only, Christ gave a <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that either the Presbyters have no power of
jurisdiction, as affixed to a distinct order, and then
the Apostles are to rule them by vertue of the order
and ordinary commission Apostolicall; or if they
have jurisdiction they doe derive it <hi>à fonte Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>


               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:100408:28"/>
and then the Apostles have superiority of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over Presbyters, because Presbyters on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have it by delegation Apostolicall. And that I
say truth (besides that there is no possibility of
shewing the contrary in Scripture, by the producing
any other commission given to Presbyters, then
what I have specified,) I will hereafter shew it to
have been the faith and practise of Christendome
not only that Presbyters were <hi>actually subordinate</hi>
to Bishops (which I contend to be the ordinary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Apostleship) but that Presbyters have no
Iurisdiction <hi>essentiall</hi> to their order, but <hi>derivative</hi>
only from Apostolicall preheminence.</p>
            <p>2. Let us now see the <hi>matter of fact.</hi> They that
can inflict censures upon Presbyters have certainly
superiority of Iurisdiction over Presbyters, for <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualis
aequalem coercere non potest,</hi> saith the Law.
Now it is evident in the case of <hi>Diotrephes a</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
and a Bishop <hi>Would be,</hi> that for his perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory
rejection of some faithfull people from the
Catholick communion without cause, and without
authority, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle threatned him in his
Epistle to <hi>Gajus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c.
Wherefore when I come I will remember him,</hi> and all
that would have been to very little purpose, if he
had not had <hi>coercitive</hi> jurisdiction to have punish't
his delinquency.</p>
            <p>3. Presbyters many of them did succeed the
Apostles by a new ordination, as <hi>Matthias</hi> succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Iudas,</hi> who before his new ordination was one
of the 72. as<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 1. hist. c 12. &amp; l. 2. c 9.</note>

               </note> S. <hi>Ierome</hi>


               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100408:29"/>
affirme, and in Scripture is expressed to be of the
number of them that went in and out with Iesus;
S. <hi>Clement</hi> succeeded S. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> S. <hi>Simeon
Cleophae</hi> succeeded S. <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> S. <hi>Philip</hi>
succeeded S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> &amp; diverse others of the
72, reckoned by <hi>Dorotheus, Eusebius,</hi> &amp; others of the
Fathers, did governe the severall Churches after the
Apostles death which before they did not. Now it
is cleare that he that receives no more power after
the Apostles, then he had under them, can no way be
said to succeed them in their Charge, or Churches.
It followes then, since (as will more fully appeare
anon) Presbyters did succeed the Apostles, that
under the Apostles they had not such jurisdiction as
afterwards they had. But the Apostles had the
same to which the Presbyters succeeded to, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
greater then the Presbyters had before they
did succeed. When I say Presbyters succeeded the
Apostles, I meane, not as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but by a new
ordination to the dignity of <hi>Bishops,</hi> so they succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and so they prove an evidence of fact, for a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of Iurisdiction in the Apostolicall Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
*** Now that this superiority of Iurisdiction
was not temporary, but to be succeeded in, appeares
from Reason, and from ocular demonstration, or of
the thing done.</p>
            <p>1. If superiority of Iurisdiction was necessary
in the ages Apostolicall for the regiment of the
Church, there is no imaginable reason why it
should not be necessary in succession, since upon the
emergency of Schismes and Heresies which were


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100408:29"/>
foretold should multiply in descending ages, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and superiority of jurisdiction, unity of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
and coërcion was more necessary then at
first, when extraordinary gifts might supply, what
now we expect to be performed by an ordinary
authority.</p>
            <p>2. Whatsoever was the regiment of the Church
in the Apostles times that must be perpetuall (not
so as to have<note n="*" place="margin">Vt puta, viduarum collegium, &amp; Diaconorum, &amp; coenobium fidelium. &amp;c:</note> 
               <hi>all</hi> that which was personall, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
but so as to have <hi>no other</hi>) for that, and that
only is of Divine institution which Christ commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Apostles, and if the Church be not now
governed as then, We can shew no Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for our government, which we must contend
to doe, and doe it too, or be call'd usurpers. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Apostles did governe the Church as Christ
commanded them, or not. If not, then they fayl'd
in the founding of the Church, and the Church is
not built upon a Rock. If they did (as most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they did) then either the same disparity of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
must be retayn'd, or else we must be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with an Unlawfull and unwarranted equality,
because not by that which only is of immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
institution; and then it must needs be a fine
government, where there is no authority, and where
no man is superiour.</p>
            <p>3. We see a disparity in the Regiment of
Churches warranted by Christ himselfe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Holy Ghost in fayrest intimation. I
meane the seaven Angel-Presidents of the seaven <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Churches. If these seaven <hi>Angels</hi> were seaven


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100408:30"/>
               <hi>Bishops,</hi> that is, Prelates or Governours of these
seaven Churches, in which it is evident and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
of all sides, there were many Presbyters, then
it is certaine that a Superiority of Iurisdiction was
intended by Christ himselfe, and given by him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as he is the fountaine of all power derived
to the Church; For Christ writes to these seaven
Churches, and directs his Epistles to the seaven Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of these Churches calling them Angels,
which it will hardly be suppos'd he would have
done, if the function had not been a ray of the Sunne
of righteousnesse, they had not else been Angels of
light, nor starres held in Christ's owne right hand.</p>
            <p>This is certaine, that the function of these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
(whatsoever it be) is a Divine institution. Let
us then see what is meant by these starres and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.<note place="margin">Revel. 1. vers. 20.</note>
[<hi>The seaven starres are the Angells of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Churches, and the seaven Candlesticks are the
seaven Churches.</hi>]</p>
            <p>1. Then it is evident, that although the Epistles
were sent with a finall intention for the edification
and confirmation of the whole Churches or people
of the Diocesse, with an [<hi>Attendite quid Spiritus
dicit Ecclesijs</hi>] yet the personall direction was not
to the whole Church, for the whole Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Candlestick,</hi> and the superscription of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
is not to the seaven <hi>Candlesticks,</hi> but to the
seaven <hi>starres</hi> which are the Angels of the seaven
Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> the lights shining in the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.
By the Angell therefore is not, cannot be
mean't the <hi>whole Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:100408:30"/>

His office therefore was <hi>Clericall,</hi> it was an Angel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Minister,
and this his office must make him the
guide and superiour to the Rest, even all the whole
Church, since he was charg'd with all.</p>
            <p>3. By the Angel is mean't a singular person, for
the reprehensions and the commendations respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
imply personall delinquency, or suppose
personall excellencyes. Adde to this that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
is singular, and of determinate number,
so that we may as well multiply Churches as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
for the seaven Churches had but seaven starres,
and these seaven starres were the Angels of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Churches. And if by seaven starres they may
meane 70 times seaven starres (for so they may if
they begin to multiply) then by one starre they
must meane many starres, and so they may multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Churches too, for there were as many Churches


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100408:31"/>
as starres, and no more Angels then Churches, and
it is as reasonable to multiply these seaven Churches
into 7000, as every <hi>starre</hi> into a <hi>Constellation,</hi> or
every <hi>Angel</hi> into a <hi>Legion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides the Exigency of the thing it selfe,
these seaven Angels are by Antiquity called the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Governours or Bishops of the seaven Churches,
&amp; their very names are commemorated. Vnto these
seaven Churches S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> saith <hi>Arethas,</hi>

               <note place="margin">lib. 4. cap. 26.</note> saith <hi>Eusebius.</hi>
These men were actually living when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ
his Revelation, for <hi>Melito</hi> writ his book <hi>de Paschate</hi>
when <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> was Proconsul of <hi>Asia,</hi> and
writ after the Revelation, for he writ a treatise of it,
as saith <hi>Eusebius.</hi> However, at least some of these
were then, and all of these about that time were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of these Churches, and the Angels S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
speakes of were such who had Iurisdiction over
their whole Diocesse, therefore these, or such as
these were the Angels to whom the Spirit of God
writ hortatory and commendatory letters, such
whom Christ held in his Right hand and fix'd them
in the Churches like lights set on a Candlestick that
they might give shine to the whole house.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Summe</hi> of all is this; that Christ did insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Apostles and Presbyters or 72 Disciples. To
the Apostles he gave a <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, for the
whole commission was given to them in as great


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100408:32"/>
and comprehensive clauses as were imaginable, for
by vertue of it, they received a power of giving the
Holy Ghost in confirmation, and of giving his grace
in the collation of holy Orders, a power of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and authority to governe the Church: and
this power was not <hi>temporary,</hi> but <hi>successive</hi> and
<hi>perpetuall,</hi> and was intended as an <hi>ordinary</hi> office in
the Church, so that the <hi>successors</hi> of the Apostles
had the same right and institution that the Apostles
<hi>themselves</hi> had, and though the <hi>personall</hi> mission
was not immediate, as of the Apostles it was, yet
the commission and institution of the <hi>function</hi> was
all one. But to the 72 Christ gave no commission
but of <hi>preaching,</hi> which was a very limited commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
There was all the immediate Divine instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Presbyterate as a distinct order, that can be
fairely pretended. But yet farther, these 72 the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
did admit <hi>in partem sollicitudinis,</hi> and by new
ordination or delegation Apostolicall, did give
them power of administring Sacraments, of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
sinners, of governing the Church in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
and subordination to the Apostles, of
which they had a capacity by Christs calling them
at first <hi>in sortem Ministerii,</hi> but the exercise, and
the actuating of this capacity they had from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
So that not by <hi>Divine</hi> ordination, or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi>
commission from Christ, but by <hi>derivation</hi>
from the <hi>Apostles</hi> (and therefore in minority and
subordination to them) the Presbyters did exercise
acts of order and jurisdiction in the absence of the
Apostles or Bishops, or in conjunction consiliary,


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100408:33"/>
and by way of advice, or before the consecration of
a Bishop to a particular Church. And all this I
doubt not, but was done by the direction of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, as were all other acts of Apostolicall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
and particularly the institution of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
order, <hi>viz.</hi> of Deacons. This is all that can
be proved out of Scripture concerning the commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
given in the institution of Presbyters, and this
I shall afterwards confirme by the practise of the
Catholick Church, and so vindicate the practises
of the <hi>present</hi> Church, from the common prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that disturbe us, for by this account, <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
is not only a <hi>Divine institution,</hi> but the <hi>only</hi> order
that derives <hi>immediately</hi> from Christ.</p>
            <p>For the present only,<note place="margin">In Lucae cap. 10.</note> I summe up this with that
saying of <hi>Theodoret</hi> speaking of the 72 Disciples.
<hi>Palmae sunt isti qui nut riuntur ac erudiuntur ab Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolis.
Nam quanquam Christus hos etiam elegit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
tamen duodecem illis inferiores, &amp; posteà illorum
Discipuli &amp; sectatores.</hi> The Apostles are the twelve
fountaines, and the 72 are the palmes that are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
by the waters of those fountaines. For
though Christ also ordain'd the 72, yet they were
inferior to the Apostles, and afterwards were their
followers and Disciples.</p>
            <p>I know no objection to hinder a conclusion; only
two or three words out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> are pretended
against the maine question, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that he,
although a Bishop, yet had no Apostolicall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelph.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I doe not command
this as an Apostle, (for what am I, and what is my


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100408:33"/>
Fathers house, that I should compare my selfe with
them) but as your fellow souldier and a Monitor.</hi>
But this answers it selfe, if we consider to whom he
speakes it. Not to his own Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> for
there he might command as an Apostle, but to the
<hi>Philadelphians</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> might not, they were no part of
his Diocesse, he was not <hi>their</hi> Apostle, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he did not equall the Apostles in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
extraordinary, in their personall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and in their universall jurisdiction, therefore
he might not command the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> being
another Bishops charge, but admonish them with
the freedome of a Christian Bishop, to whom the
soules of all faithfull people were deare and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
So that still Episcopacy and Apostolate may
be all one in <hi>ordinary office,</hi> this hinders not, and I
know nothing else pretended, and that Antiquity is
clearely on this side, is the next businesse.</p>
            <p>For, hitherto the discourse hath been of the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Divine institution</hi> of Episcopacy, by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
derived from <hi>Scripture;</hi> I shall only adde two
more from <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ 10. So that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are successors in the office of Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tenent of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and so passe on to <hi>tradition

            </p>
            <p>1. THE beliefe of the primitive Church is, that
Bishops are the ordinary successors of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and Presbyters of the 72, and therefore
did believe that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is as truly of <hi>Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
as the <hi>Apostolate,</hi> for the ordinary office
both of one and the other is the same thing. For

to Presbyters, and not onely of <hi>Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi>
but indeed the <hi>onely</hi> order which can
clearely show an <hi>immediate Divine</hi> commission for
it's power and authority (as I have proved of the
function Apostolicall) then those which doe suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Apostles in the ordinary office of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
have the same institution and authority the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
had, as much as the successors of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
have with the first Presbyters, and perhaps
more.</p>
            <p>For in the Apostolicall ordinations, they did
not proceed as the Church since hath done. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had the whole Priesthood, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the Ecclesiasticall power and all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Now they in their ordayning assistant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
did not in every ordination give a distinct
order, as the Church hath done since the Apostles.
For they ordayned some to distinct offices, some
to particular places, some to one part, some to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of Clericall imployment, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> who
was an Apostle yet was ordain'd by imposition of
hands to goe to the Churches of the Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
so was <hi>Barnabas:</hi> S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and
<hi>Cephas</hi> to the Circumcision, and there was scarce
any publike designe or Grand imployment but the
Apostolike men had a new ordination to it, a new
imposition of hands as is evident in the Acts of the
Apostles. So that the Apostolicall ordinations of
the inferiour Clergy were onely a giving of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
commissions to particular men to officiate such
parts of the Apostolicall calling as they would


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100408:37"/>
please to imploy them in. Nay sometimes their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations
were onely a delivering of Iurisdiction
when the persons ordayned had the order before, as
it is evident in the case of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts, 13.</note> Of
the same consideration is the institution of <hi>Deacons</hi>
to spirituall offices, and it is very pertinent to this
Question. For there is no Divine institution for
these rising higher then Apostolicall ordinance; and
so much there is for Presbyters as they are now
authoriz'd; for such power the Apostles gave to
Presbyters as they have now, and sometimes more,
as to <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and diverse others, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were more then meere Presbyters as the word
is now us'd.</p>
            <p>* The result is this. The office and order of a
Presbyter is but part of the office and order of an
Apostle, so is a Deacon, a lesser part, so is an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,
so is a Prophet, so is a Doctor, so is a helper,
or a Surrogate in Government, but these will not be
called orders, every one of them will not I am sure,
at least not made distinct orders by Christ, for it was
in the Apostles power to give any one or all these
powers to any one man, or to distinguish them into
so many men, as there are offices, or to unite more
or fewer of them. All these I say, clearely make not
distinct orders, and why are not all of them of the
same consideration? I would be answered from
Grounds of Scripture. For there we fix as yet.</p>
            <p>* Indeed the Apostles did ordaine such men,
and scattered their power at first, for there was so
much imployment in any one of them, as to require


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100408:38"/>
one man for one office; but a while after they united
all the lesser parts of power into two sorts of men
whom the Church hath since distinguished by the
Names of Presbyters and Deacons, and called them
two distinct orders. But yet if we speak properly &amp;
according to the Exigence of Divine institution,
there is <hi>Vnum Sacerdotiam,</hi> one Priesthood appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Christ, and that was, the commission given
by Christ to his Apostles, and to their Successors
precisely, and those other offices of Presbyter and
Deacon are but members of the Great Priesthood,
and although the power of it, is all of Divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
as the power to baptize, to preach, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate,
to absolve, to Minister, yet that so much of
it should be given to one sort of men, so much lesse
to another, that is onely of Apostolicall ordinance.
For the Apostles might have given to some onely a
power to absolve, to some onely to consecrate, to
some onely to baptize. We see that to Deacons
they did so. They had onely a power to baptize
and preach, whether all Evangelists had so much
or no, Scripture does not tell us.</p>
            <p>* But is to some men they had onely given
a power to use the Keyes, or made them officers
spirituall to restore such as are overtaken in a fault,
and not to consecrate the Eucharist, (for we see
these powers are distinct, and not relative and of
necessary conjunction, no more then baptizing and
consecrating) whether or no had those men who
have only a power of absolving or consecrating res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively,
whether (I say) have they the order of a


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100408:38"/>
Presbyter? If yea, then now every Preist hath two
orders besides the order of Deacon, for by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Consecration he hath the power of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and what is he then by his other power? But if
such a man ordayn'd with but one of these powers
have not the order of a Presbyter, then let any man
shew me where it is ordayned by Christ, or indeed
by the Apostles, that an order of Clerks should be
constituted with both these powers, and that these
were called Presbyters. I only leave this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
            <p>* But all the Apostolicall power we find insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by Christ, and we also find a necessity, that all
that power should be succeeded in, and that all that
power should be united in one order, for he that
hath the highest, <hi>viz.</hi> a power of ordination, must
needs have all the other, else he cannot give them to
any else, but a power of ordination I have proved
to be necessary and perpetuall.</p>
            <p>So that, we have cleare evidence of the Divine
institution of the perpetuall order of <hi>Apostleship,</hi>
mary for the <hi>Presbyterate</hi> I have not so much either
reason or confidence for it, as now it is in the
Church; but for the Apostolate, it is beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
And to this Bishops doe succeed. For
that it is so, I have proved from Scripture, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
[<hi>no Scirpture is of private interpretation</hi>] I
have attested it with the Catholike testimony of
the Primitive Fathers, calling Episcopacy, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolate,
and Bishops successors of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and of all the Apostles in general in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100408:39"/>
offices in which they were Superior to the 72,
the Antecessors of the Presbyterate.</p>
            <p>One objection, I must cleare. For sometimes
Presbyters are also called Apostles, and Successors
of the Apostles, as in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in S.
<hi>Hierome.</hi> I answer.</p>
            <p>1. They are not called <hi>Successores Apostolorum</hi>
by any <hi>dogmaticall</hi> resolution or interpretation of
Scripture, as the Bishops are in the examples above
alleaged; but by <hi>allusion,</hi> and participation at the
most. For true it is that they succeed the Apostles
in the offices of baptizing, consecrating, and absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>in privato foro,</hi> but this is but part of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
power, and no part of their office as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were superiour to Presbyters.</p>
            <p>2. It is observeable that Presbyters are never
affirmed to succeed in the power and regiment of
the Church, but in subordination, and derivation
from the Bishop, and therefore they are never said
to succeed <hi>in Cathedris Apostolorum,</hi> in the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Sees.</p>
            <p>3. The places which I have specifyed, and
they are all I could ever meete with, are of peculiar
answer. For as for <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epistle to the
Church of <hi>Trallis,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Idem ferè habet in Epist. ad <hi>Magnes:</hi> &amp; <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens.</hi>
               </note> he calls the Presbytery or
company of Priests, the Colledge, or combination
<hi>of Apostles.</hi> But here S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> as he lifts up the
Presbyters to a comparison with Apostles, so he
also raises the Bishop to the similitude and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
with God. <hi>Episcopus typum Dei Patris om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium gerit,
Presbyteri verò sunt conjunctus Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100408:39"/>
caetus.</hi> So that although Presbyters grow
high yet they doe not overtake the Bishops, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
who also in the same proportion grow
higher then their first station. This then, will doe
no hurt.</p>
            <p>As for S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> he indeed does say that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
succeed the Apostles, but what Presbyters
he means, he tells us, even such Presbyters as were
also Bishops, such as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was, who
call themselves Presbyters,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 43.</note> his words are these. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptereà
eis qui in Ecclesiâ sunt Presbyteris abandire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet
his qui successionem habent ab Apostolis, qui
cum Episcopatus successione charisma veritatis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

               <note place="margin">Cap. 44<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after, <hi>Tales Presbyteros nutrit Ecclesia, de quibus
&amp; Propheta ait, &amp; dabo Principes tuos in pace, &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopos
tuos in Iustitiâ.</hi> So that he gives testimony
for us, not against us. As for S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> the third
man, he in the succession to the honour of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolate
joynes Presbyters with Bishops, and that's
right enough, for if the Bishop alone does succeed
<hi>in plenitudinem potestatis Apostolicae ordinariae,</hi> as I
have proved he does, then also it is as true of the
Bishop together with his <hi>consessus Presbyterorum.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 13.</note>
               <hi>Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri habeant in exemplum Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
&amp; Apostolicos viros, quorum honorem possidentes,
habere nitantur &amp; meritum,</hi> those are his words,
and inforce not so much as may be safely granted,
for <hi>reddendo singula singulis,</hi> Bishops succeed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and Presbyters Apostolick men, and such
were many that had not at first any power Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall,


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100408:40"/>
and that's all that can be inferred from this
place of S. <hi>Hierome.</hi> I know nothing else to stay me,
or to hinder our assent to those authorities of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I have alleadged, and the full voyce of traditive

was the President of this Synod, which considering

            <p>And now all is well if after all this <hi>Timothy</hi> doe

be sufficient to catch at to support a drowning cause,
and though neither pertinent nor true, yet shall be
laid in the ballance against all the evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Catholick antiquity. But [<hi>doe the work of
an Evangelist</hi>] (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) therefore it is cleare
S. <hi>Timothy</hi> was no Bishop. No, was not? That's
hard. But let us try however.</p>
            <p>1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, those are the next
words, <hi>fulfill thy Deaconship.</hi> And therefore he was
no Bishop? As well this as the other, for if <hi>Deacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
doe not exclude <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> why shall his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>Evangelist</hi> exclude it? Or why may not his
being a <hi>Deacon</hi> exclude his being an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> as


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100408:49"/>
well as his being an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> exclude his being a
<hi>Bishop?</hi> Whether is higher, a Bishoprick, or the
office of an Evangelist? If a Bishops office be higher,
and therefore cannot consist with an Evangelist,
then a Bishop cannot be a Priest, and a Priest cannot
be a Deacon, and an Evangelist can be neither, for
that also is thought to be higher then them both.
But if the office of an Evangelist be higher, then as
long as they are not disparate, much lesse destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of each other, they may have leave to consist
in subordination. For as for the pretence that an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist
is an office of a <hi>moveable imployment,</hi> and
a Bishoprick of <hi>fixt residence,</hi> that will be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by and by.</p>
            <p>2. All the former discourse is upon suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, implyes the <hi>office of a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
and so it may as well as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> other phrase
implyes S. <hi>Timothy</hi> to be an <hi>Evangelist.</hi> For if we
marke it well it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doe <hi>the
worke,</hi> not <hi>the office</hi> of an Evangelist. And what's
that? We may see it in the verses immediatly going
before,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And
if this he the work of an Evangelist which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
would have <hi>Timothy</hi> performe, <hi>viz.</hi> to preach, to
be instant in season, and out of season, to reprove,
to rebuke, to exhort, there is no harme done, a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
may, nay he must doe all this.</p>
            <p>3. Consider we what an <hi>Evangelist</hi> is, and
thence take our estimate for the present. 1. He that
writes the story of the Gospell is an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> so


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100408:50"/>
the Greek Scholiast calls him. And in this sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
S. <hi>Timothy</hi> was not an Evangelist, but yet if
he had, he might have been a Bishop, because <hi>S.
Mark</hi> was an Evangelist to be sure, and perhaps as
sure that he was a Bishop; sure enough; for they are
both delivered to us by the Catholick testimony of
the Primitive Church, as we shall see hereafter, so
farre as concernes our Question. But then again;
an Apostle might be an Evangelist, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> was,
and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was, and the Apostolicall dignity is as
much inconsistent with the office of an Evangelist,
as Episcopall preheminence, for I have proved
these two names <hi>Apostle,</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> to signify all one
thing.<note place="margin">In 4. Ephes.</note> 2. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> gives another exposition of
[<hi>Evangelists.</hi>] <hi>Evangelistae Diaconi sunt sicut fuit
Philippus. S. Philip</hi> was one of the leaven, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Deacons,</hi> and he was also a <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
and yet an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> and yet a Presbyter in it's
proportion is an office of as necessary residence as
a Bishop, or else why are Presbyters cry'd out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so bitterly in all cases, for <hi>non-residence,</hi> and
yet nothing hinders, but that S. <hi>Timothy,</hi> as well as
S. <hi>Philip,</hi> might have been a Presbyter and an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist
together, and then why not a Bishop too,
for why should a Deaconship, or a Presbyterate
consist with the office of an Evangelist, more then a
Bishoprick? 3. Another acceptation of [<hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list</hi>]
is also in <hi>Eusebius.</hi>

in <hi>Scythia,</hi> S. <hi>Trophimus,</hi> S. <hi>Denis,</hi> S. <hi>Marke,</hi> and
many more. By the way only, according to all these
acceptations of the word [<hi>Evangelist</hi>] this office
does not imply a perpetuall motion. Evangelists
many of them did travell, but they were never the
more Evangelists for that, but only their office was
writing or preaching the Gospell, and thence they
had their name.</p>
            <p>4. The office of an Evangelist was but <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and take it in either of the two senses of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
or <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> which are the only true and


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100408:51"/>
genuine, was to expire when Christianity was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
every where, and the office of Episcopacy, if it
was at all was to be succeeded in, and therefore in
no respect could these be inconsistent, at least, not
alwaies. * And how S. <hi>Paul</hi> should intend that
<hi>Timothy</hi> should keep those rules he gave him, [<hi>to
the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>]<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 14</note> if the office
for the execution of which he gave him the rules,
was to expire long before, is not so easily imagined.
For if S. <hi>Paul</hi> did direct him in a temporary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
office, then in no sense, neither in person, nor
in succession could those rules of S. <hi>Paul</hi> be kept till
Christs coming, to wit, to judgement. But if he
instructed <hi>him</hi> in the perpetuall office of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
then it is easy to understand that S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave
that caution to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to intimate that those his
directions were <hi>not personall,</hi> but for his successors
in that charge, to which he had ordained him, <hi>viz.</hi>
in the sacred order and office of Episcopacy.</p>
            <p>5. Lastly, After all this stirre, there are some
of the Fathers, that will by no means admit S. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
to have been an Evangelist. So S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>
so <hi>Theophylact,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Ephes. 4.</note> so the Greek Scholiast, now though
we have no need to make any use of it, yet if it be
true, it makes all this discourse needlesse, we were
safe enough without it; if it be false, then it selfe we
see is needlesse, for the allegation of S. <hi>Timothy's</hi>
being an Evangelist, is absolutely impertinent,
though it had been true.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>TItus</hi> was also made a Bishop by the Apostles.<note place="margin">§15. S. Titus at Crete.</note>

to Rule the house of God. 5. The reason why


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100408:52"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> appointed him to ordaine these Bishops in
Citties is in order to coercitive jurisdiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
[<hi>many unruly and vaine talkers were crept in,
vers.</hi> 10.] and they were to be silenced <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Their mouths must be stopped.</hi> Therefore they
must be such Elders as had superiority of jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over these impertinent Preachers, which to a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi>
Presbyter, either by Divine or Apostolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
no man will grant, and to a <hi>Colledge</hi> of
Presbyters S. <hi>Paul</hi> does not intend it, for himselfe
had given it singly to <hi>S. Titus.</hi> For I consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titus</hi> alone had coercitive jurisdiction before he
ordayn'd these Elders, be they Bishops, be they
Presbyters. The Presbyters which were at <hi>Crete</hi>
before his comming had not Episcopall power, or
coercitive jurisdiction, for why then was <hi>Titus</hi>
sent? As for the Presbyters which <hi>Titus</hi> ordayn'd,
before his ordayning them, to be sure they had no
power at all, they were not Presbyters. If they had
a coercitive jurisdiction afterwards, to wit, by their
ordination, then <hi>Titus</hi> had it before in his owne
person, (for they that were there before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
had not, as I shewed) and therefore he must
also have it still, for he could not loose it by ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
others, or if he had it not before, how could
he give it unto them whom he ordain'd? For <hi>plus
juris in alium transferre nemo potest, quàm ipse habet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howsoever it by then, to be sure, <hi>Titus</hi> had it in
his owne person and then it followes Undeniably,
that either this coercitive jurisdiction was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the Church (which would be either to


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100408:53"/>
suppose men impcccable, or the Church to be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to all the inconveniences of Schisme and tumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
factions without possibility of releife) or if it
was necessary, then because it was in <hi>Titus</hi> not as a
personall prerogative, but a power to be succeded
to; he might ordaine others, he had authority to
doe it, with the same power he had himselfe, and
therefore since he alone had this coërcion in his
owne person, so should his Successors, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a single Presbyter, could not have it over his
brethren by the confession of all sides, nor the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Presbyters which were there before his
comming had it not, for why then was <hi>Titus</hi> sent
with a new commission, nor those which he was to
ordaine if they were but meere Presbyters could
not have it, no more then the Presbytes that were
there before his comming, it followes that those
Elders which S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent <hi>Titus</hi> to ordaine being
such as were to be constituted in opposition and
power over the false Doctors and prating Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and with authority to silence them, (as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the first chapter of that Epistle) these Elders
(I say) are verily, and indeed such as himselfe call's
Bishops in the proper sense, and acceptation of the
word.</p>
            <p>6. The <hi>Cretan</hi> Presbyters who were there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
S. <hi>Titus</hi> comming, had not power to ordaine
others, that is, had not that power which <hi>Titus</hi> had.
For <hi>Titus</hi> was sent thither for that purpose, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to supply the want of that power. And now,
because to ordaine others was necessary for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100408:53"/>
and succession of the Church, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
new generations are necessary for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the world, and meere Presbyters could not doe
it, and yet this must be done, not onely by <hi>Titus</hi>
himselfe, but after him, it followes undeniably that
S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent <hi>Titus</hi> to ordaine men with the same
power that himselfe had, that is with more then his
first <hi>Cretan</hi> Presbyters, that is Bishops, and he
meanes them in the proper sense.</p>
            <p>7. That by <hi>Elders in severall Cityes</hi> he meanes
Bishops is also plaine from the place where they
were to be ordained, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>In populous Cityes, not in village Townes,</hi>
For no Bishops were ever suffered to be in village
Townes, as is to be seene in the Councell of<note n="a" place="margin">cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
of<note n="b" place="margin">can. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and S.<note n="c" place="margin">Epist. 87. ad Episc. Afric.</note> 
               <hi>Leo,</hi> the Cityes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe at least highly intimate that the persons to
be ordain'd were not meere Presbyters.</p>
            <p>The issue of this discourse is, that since <hi>Titus</hi>
was sent to <hi>Crete</hi> to ordaine Bishops, himselfe was
a Bishop to be sure, at least. If he had ordain'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Presbyters, it would have prov'd that. But this
inferres him to be a <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> forasmuch as he
was Bishop of <hi>Crete,</hi> and yet had many suffragans
in subordination to him, of his owne constitution,
and yet of proper diocesses. However, if this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
concludes nothing peculiar, it frees the place
from popular prejudice and mistakes, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of <hi>Episcopus,</hi> and <hi>Presbyter;</hi> and at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
his being a Bishop, if not a great deale
more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:100408:54"/>
Yea; but did not S. <hi>Titus</hi> ordaine no <hi>meere Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters?</hi>
yes most certainely. But, so he did <hi>Deacons</hi>
too, and yet neither one nor the other are otherwise
mentioned in this Epistle but by consequence and
comprehension within the superior order. For he
that ordaines a Bishop, first makes him a <hi>Deacon,</hi>
(and then he obtaines <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a good degree</hi>) and
then a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and then a <hi>Bishop.</hi> So that these
inferior orders are presuppos'd in the authorizing
the Supreame, and by giving direction for the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of Bishops, he sufficiently instructs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
orders in their deportment, insomuch as
they are probations for advancement to the higher.</p>
            <p>2. Adde to this, that he that ordaines Bishops
in Cityes sets there <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ordinem generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum
Patrum,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> calls Episcopacy, and
therefore most certainely with intention, not that it
should be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Manus Mortua,</hi> but, to produce
others, and therefore Presbyters and Deacons.</p>
            <p>3. S. <hi>Paul</hi> made no expresse provision for vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
and yet most certainely did not intend to
leave them destitute, and therefore he tooke order
that such ordinations should be made in Cityes
which should be provisionary for Villages, and
that is, of such men as had power to ordaine and
power to send Presbyters to what part of their
charge they pleased. For since Presbyters could
not ordaine other Presbyters, as appeares by S.
<hi>Paul's</hi> sending <hi>Titus</hi> to doe it there, where, most
certainely, many Presbyters before were actually
resident, if Presbyters had gone to Villages they


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100408:54"/>
must have left the Cityes destitute, or if they staid
in Cityes the Villages would have perished, and at
last, when these men had dyed both one and the
other, had beene made a prey to the wolfe, for there
could be no sheapheard after the decay of the first
generation.</p>
            <p>But let us see further into S. <hi>Titus</hi> his commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and letters of orders, and institution.<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 10.</note> [<hi>A man
that is an heretick after the first and second admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
reject.</hi>] Cognisance of hereticall pravity, and
animadversion against the heretick himselfe is most
plainely concredited to S. <hi>Titus.</hi> For first he is to
admonish him, then to reject him upon his pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
from the Catholike communion. <hi>Cogere autem

            <p>But I need not specifie any more particulars, for

            <p>And now I know not what objection can fairely
be made here; for I hope S. <hi>Titus</hi> was no <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,</hi>
he is not called so in Scripture, and all Antiquity
calls him a Bishop, and the nature of his offices, the
eminence of his dignity, the superiority of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the cognisance of causes criminall, and the
whole exigence of the Epistle proclaime him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
But suppose a while <hi>Titus</hi> had been an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,
I would faine know who succeeded him? Or
did all his office expire with his person? If so, then
who shall reject Hereticks when <hi>Titus</hi> is dead? Who


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100408:55"/>
shall silence factious Preachers? If not, then still
who succeeded him? The Presbyters? How can that
be? For if they had more power after his death then
before, and govern'd the Churches which before
they did not, then to be sure their government in
common, is not an Apostolicall Ordinance, much
lesse is it a Divine right, for it is postnate to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both.
But if they had no more power after <hi>Titus</hi> then
they had under him, how then could they succeed
him? There was indeed a dereliction of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but no succession. The succession therefore
both in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> and also in the other
Cities was made by singular persons, not by a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
for so we find in the <gap reason="foreign">

that in <hi>Gnossus</hi> of <hi>Crete, Pinytus</hi> was a most

enough.</p>

saying that the Apostles did ordaine Bishops
in all Churches, that the succession of Bishops

was the only argument to prove their Churches
Catholick, and their adversaries who could not
doe so, to be Hereticall; This also is very evident,
and of great consideration in the first ages while
their tradition was cleare, and evident, and not so
bepudled as it since hath been with the mixture of
Hereticks, striving to spoile that which did so much
mischiefe to their causes.</p>

this succession of Bishops from the Apostles ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
must of it selfe be a very certain thing, when
the Church made it a maine probation of their
faith; for the books of Scripture were not all gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

then, since this was a main pillar of their Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>viz.</hi> a constant reception of it from hand to

chaire, till wee come to the very Apostles that did
ordain them, this (I say) being their proof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it could not be more certain then the thing
to be proved, which in that case was a Divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
yet to them it was more evident as being
matter of fact, and known almost by evidence of
sense, and as verily believed by all, as it was by any

We can reckon those who from the Apostles untill now
were made Bishops in the Churches;</hi> and of this we
are sure enough, if there be any faith in Christians.</p>
            <p>THE summe is this.<note place="margin">§ 19. So that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy is at least an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:</note> Although we had not proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the immediate Divine institution of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
power over Presbyters and the whole flock,
yet Episcopacy is not lesse then an Apostolicall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
and delivered to us by the same authority
that the observation of the <hi>Lord's day</hi> is. For, for
that in the new Testament we have no precept,<note place="margin">of the same authority with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other points ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</note> and
nothing but the example of the Primitive Disciples
meeting in their <hi>Synaxes</hi> upon that day, and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
they did on the saturday in the Iewish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
but yet (however that at <hi>Geneva,</hi> they
were once in meditation to have chang'd it into a
Thursday meeting to have showne their Christian
liberty) we should think strangely of those men that
called the <hi>Sunday-Festivall</hi> lesse then an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ordinance, and necessary now to be kept holy
with such observances as the Church hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>* Baptisme of infants is most certainly a holy
and charitable ordinance, and of ordinary necessity
to all that ever cryed, and yet the Church hath
founded this rite upon the tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
and wise men doe easily observe that the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi>
can by the same probability of Scripture
inforce a necessity of communicating infants upon
us, as we doe of baptizing infants upon them, if we


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100408:59"/>
speak of immediate Divine institution, or of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
Apostolicall recorded in Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a great Master of <hi>Geneva</hi> in a book he writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> was forced to fly to Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
traditive ordination, and therefore the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Bishops, must be served first, as having fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
plea, and clearer evidence in Scripture, then the
baptizing of infants, and yet they that deny this,
are by the just <hi>anathema</hi> of the Catholick Church,
confidently condemn'd for Hereticks.</p>
            <p>* Of the same consideration are diverse other
things in Christianity, as the Presbyters consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Eucharist; for if the Apostles in the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
did represent the whole Church, Clergy
and Laity, when Christ said [<hi>Hoc facite, Doe this</hi>]
then why may not every Christian man there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
doe that which the Apostles in the name of
all were commanded to doe? If the Apostles did
not represent the whole Church, why then doe all
communicate? Or what place, or intimation of
Christ's saying is there in all the foure Gospells, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
[<hi>Hoc facite, id est, benedicite</hi>] to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and extending [<hi>Hoc facite, id est, accipite &amp;
manducate</hi>] to the Laity? This also rests upon the
practise Apostolicall and traditive interpretation of
H. Church, and yet cannot be denied that so it
ought to be, by any man that would not have his
Christendome suspected.</p>
            <p>* To these I adde the communion of Women,
the distinction of bookes Apocryphall, from Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
that such books were written by such Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100408:60"/>
and Apostles, the whole tradition of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it selfe, the Apostles Creed, the feast of <hi>Easter</hi>
(which amongst all them that cry up the <hi>Sunday-Festivall</hi>
for a <hi>Divine institution,</hi> must needs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
as <hi>Caput institutionis,</hi> it being that for which
the Sunday is commemorated.) These and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others of greater consequence (which I dare
not specify for feare of being misunderstood) rely
but upon equall faith with this of Episcopacy
(though I should wave all the arguments for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Divine ordinance) and therefore it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
it should be ranked amongst the <hi>Credenda</hi> of
Christianity, which the Church hath entertained
upon the confidence of that which we call <hi>the faith
of a Christian,</hi> whose Master is truth it selfe.</p>
            <p>VVHat their power and eminence was,<note place="margin">§ 20. And was an office of power and great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</note> and

in his time a Presbyter did not governe in common,
but because he conceived it was fit he should be
joyn'd in the common regiment and care of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
therefore he asserted it as much as he could;
And therefore if S. <hi>Hierome</hi> had thought that this
difference of the power of ordination, had been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
customary, &amp; by actuall indulgence, or incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or positive constitution, and no matter of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and originall right, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> was not so
diffident but out it should, come what would have
come. And suppose S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> in this distinct
power of ordination had intended it onely to be a
difference in <hi>fact,</hi> not in <hi>right</hi> (for so some of late
have muttered) then S. <hi>Hierome</hi> had not said true
according to his owne principles, for <hi>[Quid facit
Episcopus exceptâ ordinatione quòd Presbyter non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat?]</hi>
had beene quickly answered, if the Question
had onely beene <hi>de facto;</hi> For the Bishop governed


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100408:62"/>
the Church alone, and so in Iurisdiction was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then Presbyters, and this was by custome, and in
fact at least, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> saies it, and the Bishop tooke
so much power to himselfe, that <hi>de facto</hi> Presbyters
were not suffered to doe any thing <hi>sine literis Episco,
palibus, without leave of the Bishop,</hi> and this S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
complain'd of;<note place="margin">Ad Nepotian. &amp; de 7. ordin. Eccles.</note> so that <hi>de facto</hi> the power of
ordination was not the onely difference: That then
(if S. <hi>Hierome</hi> sayes true) being the onely difference
betweene Presbyter and Bishop, must be meant <hi>de
jure,</hi> in matter of right, not <hi>humane positive,</hi> for
that is coincident with the other power of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which <hi>de facto,</hi> and at least by a humane right
the Bishop had over Presbyters, but <hi>Divine,</hi> and
then this identity of Bishop and Presbyter by S. <hi>Hierom's</hi>
owne confession cannot be meant in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of order, but the Episcopacy is by Divine
right a superiour order to the Presbyterate.</p>
            <p>* Adde to this that the arguments which <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
uses in this discourse are to prove that <hi>Bishops</hi>
are sometimes called <hi>Presbyters.</hi> To this purpose
he urges <hi>Act.</hi> 20. And <hi>Philippians</hi> 1. and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and some others, but all
driving to the same issue. To what? Not to prove
that Presbyters are sometimes called Presbyters;
For who doubts that? But that Bishops are so may
be of some consideration and needes a proofe,
and this he Undertooke. Now that they are so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
must needes inferre an <hi>identity</hi> and a <hi>disparity</hi> in
severall respects. An <hi>identity,</hi> at least of <hi>Names,</hi> for
else it had beene wholly impertinent. A <hi>disparity,</hi>


               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:100408:62"/>
or else his arguments were to prove <hi>idem affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
de eodem,</hi> which were a businesse next to telling
pins. Now then this disparity must be either in <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
or <hi>jurisdiction.</hi> By the former probation it is
sure that he meanes the <hi>orders</hi> to be <hi>disparate;</hi> If
<hi>jurisdiction too,</hi> I am content, but the former is most
certaine, if he stand to his owne principles.</p>
            <p>This identity then which <hi>S. Hierome</hi> expresses of
Episcopus and Presbyter, must be either in Name
or in Iurisdiction. I know not certainely which he
meanes, for his <hi>arguments conclude onely for the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity
of Names,</hi> but his <hi>conclusion is for identity of
jurisdiction, &amp; in communi debere Ecclesiam regere,</hi>
is the intent of his discourse. If he meanes the first,
viz: that of <hi>Names,</hi> it is well enough, there is no
harme done, it is <hi>in confesso apud omnes,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
nothing (as I shall shew hereafter) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he intends (so farre as may be guess'd by his
words) a parity and concurrence of jurisdiction, this
must be consider'd distinctly.</p>
            <p>1. Then; in the first founding of Churches the
Apostles did appoint Presbyters, and inferiour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
with a power of baptizing, preaching, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
and reconciling <hi>in privato foro,</hi> but did not
in every Church at the first founding it, constitute a
Bishop. This is evident in <hi>Crete,</hi> in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Where no <hi>Bishops</hi> were constituted there the
<hi>Apostles</hi> kept the <hi>jurisdiction in their owne hands
[There comes upon me</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul) daily the care or
Supravision of all the Churches]</hi> Not <hi>all absolutely,</hi>


               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:100408:63"/>
for not all of the Circumcision, but <hi>all of his charge,</hi>
with which he was once charged, and of which he
had not exonerated himselfe by constituting Bishops
there, for of these there is the same reason. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

charges the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and therefore of this

authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. For ought appeares in Scripture, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
never gave any <hi>externall,</hi> or <hi>coercitive jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in publike, and criminall causes,</hi> nor yet <hi>power to
ordaine Rites or Ceremonies, or to inflict censures, to
a Colledge of meere Presbyters.</hi> * The contrary
may be greedily swallowed, and I know not with
how great confidence, and prescribing prejudice;
but there is not in all Scripture <hi>any commission from
Christ, any ordinance or warrant from the Apostles to
any Presbyter, or Colledge of Presbyters without a
Bishop, or expresse delegation of Apostolicall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

Presbyters might be <hi>surrogati in locum Episcopi ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentis,</hi>
but never had any <hi>ordinary jurisdiction</hi> given

            </p>

1. There was a <hi>Presbytery</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but they
had a <hi>Bishop alwayes,</hi> and the <hi>Colledge of the Apostles
sometimes,</hi> therefore whatsoever act they did, it was
in conjunction with, and <hi>subordination to the Bishop</hi>
&amp; <hi>Apostles.</hi> Now it cannot be denyed both that the
<hi>Apostles</hi> were <hi>superiour</hi> to all the <hi>Presbyters in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
and also had power alone to governe the
Church. I say they had power to governe alone,
for they had the government of the Church alone
before they ordayn'd the first <hi>Presbyters,</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there were any of capacity to joyne with them,
they must doe it themselves, and then also they must
retaine the same power, for they could not loose it
by giving Orders. Now if they had a <hi>power of sole
jurisdiction,</hi> then the <hi>Presbyters</hi> being in some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
acts in conjunction with the <hi>Apostles</hi> cannot
challenge a right of governing as affixed to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they onely <hi>assisting in subordination,</hi> and <hi>by
dependency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This onely by the way; In <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
were some thing more then ordinary, and
were not meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the present, and limited
sense of the word. For <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and
<hi>Silas [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> Chiefe men amongst the

of <hi>Apostolicall power</hi> and authority, <gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">in Act. Apost.</note> For truth is,
that diverse of them were ordain'd <hi>Apostles</hi> with an

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100408:64"/>
they also might together with the twelve, <hi>exire in
totum mundum.</hi> * So that in this <hi>Presbytery</hi> either
they were more then meere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> men of <hi>Apostolicall power,</hi> and
they might well be in conjunction with the twelve,
and with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> they were of equall power, not
by vertue of their <hi>Presbyterate,</hi> but by their <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi>
or if they were but meere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is certaine, and proov'd, and confess'd that
the Apostles had power to governe the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
this their taking meere <hi>Presbyters in partem
regiminis,</hi> was a voluntary act, and from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
was derived to other Churches, and then it
is most true, that <hi>Presbyteros in communi Ecclesiam
regere,</hi> was rather, <hi>consuetudine Ecclesiae,</hi> then <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicae
dispositionis veritate,</hi> (to use S. <hi>Hierom's</hi> owne
expression) for this is more evident then that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
doe <hi>eminere caeteris,</hi> by <hi>custome</hi> rather then
<hi>Divine institution.</hi> For if the Apostles might rule
the Church alone, then that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were
taken into the Number was a voluntary act of the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> and although fitting to be retain'd where
the same reasons doe remaine, and circumstances
concurre, yet not necessary because not affixed to
their Order; not, <hi>Dominicae dispositionis veritate,</hi>
and not laudable when those reasons cease, and there
is an emergency of contrary causes.</p>
            <p>2. The next <hi>Presbytery</hi> we read of is at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
but there we find no <hi>acts</hi> either of <hi>concurrent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13.</note> or
<hi>single jurisdiction,</hi> but of <hi>ordination</hi> indeed we doe,
and that performed by such men as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was, and


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100408:64"/>
               <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for they were two of the <hi>Prophets</hi> recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> but I doe not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them to be called <hi>Presbyters</hi> in that place, to be
sure they were not meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> as we now Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the word, as I proved formerly.</p>
            <p>3. But in the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> there was a
Colledge of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and they were by the Spirit
of God called <hi>Bishops,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> and were appointed by him
to be Pastors of the Church of God. This must
doe it or nothing. <hi>In quo spiritus S. posuit vos Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos,</hi>
In whom the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> hath made you <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi>
There must lay the exigence of the argument,
and if we can find who is meant by [Vos] we shall,
I hope, gaine the truth. * S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent for the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
or <hi>Elders</hi> to come from <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Miletus,</hi>
and to them he spoke. * * It's true, but that's not
all the <hi>[vos],</hi> For there were present at that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>Sopater,</hi> and <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> and <hi>Secundus,</hi> and
<hi>Gaius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20. 4.</note> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Tychicus,</hi> and <hi>Trophimus;</hi>
And although he sent to <hi>Ephesus</hi> as to the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,
and there many Elders were either accidentally,
or by ordinary residence, yet those were not all
Elders of that Church, but of all <hi>Asia,</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sense, the lessar <hi>Asia.</hi> For so in the preface of
his Sermon S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates <hi>[ye know that from the
first day I came into Asia after what manner I have
beene with you at all seasons]</hi> His whole conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Asia</hi> was not confin'd to <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">vers. 18.</note> and yet
those <hi>Elders</hi> who were present were witnesses of it
all, and therefore were of dispersed habitation, and
so it is more clearely infer'd from vers. 25. <hi>And


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100408:65"/>
now behold I know that</hi> YE ALL AMONG WHOM I
HAVE GONE <hi>preaching the Kingdome of God</hi> &amp;c: It
was a travaile to preach to all that were present, and
therefore most certainly they were inhabitants of
places very considerably distant.</p>
            <p>Now upon this ground I will raise these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>1. If there be a confusion of Names in Scripture,
particularly of <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for, on one side, and granted on all sides,
then where both the words are used, what shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the signification? For whether (to instance
in this place) shall <hi>Presbyter</hi> limit <hi>Episcopus,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus</hi>
extend <hi>Presbyter?</hi> Why may not <hi>Presbyter</hi>
signify one that is verily a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as <hi>Episcopus</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
a meere <hi>Presbyter?</hi> For it is but an ignorant
conceit, where ever <hi>Presbyter</hi> is named, to fancy it
in the proper and limited sense, and not to doe so
with <hi>Episcopus,</hi> and when they are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
rather to believe it in the limited and present
sense of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> then in the proper and present
sense of <hi>Episcopus.</hi> So that as yet we are indifferent
upon the termes. These men sent for from <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
of the Church, but at <hi>Miletus, Spiritus S. posu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
vos Episcopos,</hi> there they are called <hi>Bishops</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseers.
So that I may as well say here were <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called Bishops,</hi> as another may say, here were
<hi>meere Presbyters.</hi> * And least it be objected in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of my affirmative, that they could not be <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
because they were of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> there never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100408:65"/>
but one <hi>Bishop in one Church.</hi> I answer, that in
the <hi>Apostles</hi> times this was not true. For at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
there were many at the same time that had <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall,</hi>
and <hi>Apostolicall authority,</hi> and so at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och;</hi>
as at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and
<hi>Silas,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and at <hi>Rome,</hi> at the same time <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
and <hi>Linus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> but yet but one of them
was <hi>fixt,</hi> and <hi>properly the Bishop of that place.</hi> But
2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> All these were not of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but the <hi>Elders</hi> of
all <hi>Asia,</hi> but some from other countries as appears
<hi>vers.</hi> 4. So that although they were all <hi>Bishops,</hi> wee
might easily find <hi>distinct Diocesses</hi> for them, without
incumbring the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
incumbency. Thus farre then we are upon
even termes, the community of compellations used
here, can no more force us to believe them all to be
meere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> then <hi>Bishops</hi> in the proper sense.</p>
            <p>2. It is very certain that they were not all meer
<hi>Presbyters</hi> at his fare-well Sermon, for S. <hi>Timothy</hi>
was there, and I proved him to be a <hi>Bishop</hi> by abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
testimony, and many of those which are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>v.</hi> 4. were companions of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in his
journey, and imployed in mission <hi>Apostolicall</hi> for the
founding of Churches, and particularly, <hi>Sosipater</hi>
was there, and he was <hi>Bishop of Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
of <hi>Chalcedon in Bythinia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vbi suprà.</note> as <hi>Dorotheus</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>

for so is witnessed by the suffragans of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
in their Epistle to <hi>S. Leo.</hi> But without all
doubt here were <hi>Bishops</hi> present as well as <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>


               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:100408:66"/>

S. <hi>Paul</hi> making hast to keep his Pentecost at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>

spoke, and to these indeed the Holy Ghost had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited
his Church to be fed, and taught with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall
supravision, but in the mean while here is no
commission of power, or jurisdiction to Presbyters
distinctly, nor supposition of any such praeexistent
power.</p>
            <p>3. All that S. <hi>Paul</hi> said in this narration, was
spoken in the presence of them all, but not to them
all. For that of <hi>v.</hi> 18. [<hi>ye know how I have been with

all the Presbyters that came from <hi>Ephesus</hi> and the

the <hi>Beraean,</hi> or to <hi>Aristarchus</hi> the <hi>Thessalonian,</hi>
but to <hi>Tychicus,</hi> and <hi>Trophimus,</hi> who were <hi>Asians</hi> it
might be addressed. And for that of <hi>v.</hi> 25. [<hi>yee all
among whom I have gone preaching shall see my face
no more,</hi>] this was directed only to the <hi>Asians,</hi> for
he was never more to come thither; but <hi>Timothy</hi>
to be sure, saw him afterwards, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent for
him, a litle before his death, to <hi>Rome,</hi> and it will not


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100408:66"/>
be supposed he neglected to attend him. So that if
there were a conjunction of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi>
at this meeting, as most certainly there was, and of
<hi>Evangelists,</hi> and <hi>Apostolicall men</hi> besides, how shall
it be known, or indeed with any probability suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that, that clause of <hi>vers. 28. Spiritus S. posuit

<hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Feeders;</hi> and then it belongs either to
the <hi>Bishops</hi> alone, or to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with, and subordination to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> for to the
meer <hi>Presbyters</hi> it cannot be proved to appertaine,
by any intination of that place.</p>
            <p>5. How and if these <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which came
from <hi>Ephesus</hi> and the other parts of <hi>Asia</hi> were made
<hi>Bishops</hi> at <hi>Miletus?</hi> Then also this way all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will be removed. And that so it was is more then
probable; for to be sure, <hi>Timothy</hi> was now entring,
and fixing upon his See; and it was consonant to the
practise of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the exigence of the thing
it selfe, when they were to leave a Church to fixe a
<hi>Bishop</hi> in it; for why else was a <hi>Bishop</hi> fixt in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
so long before in other Churches, but because


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100408:67"/>
the <hi>Apostles</hi> were to be scattered from thence, and
there the first bloudy field of <hi>Martyrdome</hi> was to
be fought. And the case was equall here, for S. <hi>Paul</hi>
was never to see the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> any more,
and he foresaw that ravening wolves would enter
into the folds, and he had actually plac'd a <hi>Bishop</hi> in
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> and it is unimaginable, that he would not
make equall provision for other Churches, there
being the same necessity from the same danger, in
them all, and either S. <hi>Paul</hi> did it now, or never; and
that about this time the other sixe <hi>Asian</hi> Churches
had <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> set in their candlesticks, is
plain, for there had been a succession in the Church
of <hi>Pergamus, Antipas</hi> was dead, and S. <hi>Timothy</hi> had
sate in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and S. <hi>Polycarpe</hi> at <hi>Smyrna</hi> many
years before S. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ his Revelation.</p>
            <p>6. Lastly, that no jurisdiction was in the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine
Presbyters,</hi> except a delegate, and subordinate,
appeares beyond all exception, by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> establishing in the person of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
power of coercitive jurisdiction over <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and ordination in him alone, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of any in commission with him, for ought
appeares either there, or else-where.</p>
            <p>* 4. The same also in the case of the <hi>Cretan
Presbyters</hi> is cleare. For what power had they of
Iurisdiction? For that is it, we now speak of. If
they had none before S. <hi>Titus</hi> came, we are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
at <hi>Crete.</hi> If they had, why did S. <hi>Paul</hi> take it
from them to invest <hi>Titus</hi> with it? Or if he did not,
to what purpose did he send <hi>Titus</hi> with all those


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100408:67"/>
powers before mentioned? For either the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Crete</hi> had jurisdiction in causes criminall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to <hi>Titus</hi> after his coming, or they had not. If
they had, then what did <hi>Titus</hi> doe there? If they
had not, then either they had no jurisdiction at all,
or whatsoever it was, it was in subordination to
him, they were his inferiours, and he their ordinary
Iudge and Governour.</p>
            <p>5. One thing more before this be left, must be
considered concerning the Church of Corinth, for
there was power of excommunication in the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>
when they had no Bishop, for they had none
of diverse yeares after the founding of the Church,
and yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> reprooves them for not ejecting the
incestuous person out of the Church.</p>
            <p>* This is it that I said before, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
kept the jurisdiction in their hands where
they had founded a Church, and placed no Bishop.
For in this case of the Corinthian incest the <hi>Apostle</hi>
did make himselfe the sole Iudge.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 3.</note> [<hi>For I verily as
absent in body but present in spirit have judged alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>]
and then secondly,<note place="margin">V. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the Church
of <hi>Corinth</hi> commission and substitution to proceed
in this cause [<hi>In the name of our Lord Iesus Christ,
when ye are gathered together, and</hi> MY SPIRIT, that
is, <hi>My power, My authority,</hi> for so he explaines
himselfe, MY SPIRIT, WITH THE POWER OF
OUR LORD IESVS CHRIST, <hi>to deliver him over
to Satan.</hi> And 3. As all this power is delegate, so
it is but declarative in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for S. <hi>Paul</hi>
had given sentence before, and they of Corinth


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100408:68"/>
were to publish it. 4. This was a commission gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the whole assembly, and no more concernes
the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> then the people, and so some have
contended; but so it is, but will serve neither of their
turnes, neither for an <hi>independant Presbytery,</hi> nor a
<hi>conjunctive popularity.</hi> As for S. <hi>Paul's</hi> reprooving
them for not inflicting censures on the peccant, I
have often heard it confidently averred, but never
could see ground for it. The suspicion of it is <hi>v.</hi> 2.
[<hi>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned,
that he that hath done this deed might be</hi> TAKEN
AWAY FROM AMONG YOU] <hi>Taken away.</hi> But by
whom? That's the Question. Not by them, to be
sure. For TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU, implies that
it is by the power of another, not by their act, for
no man can take away any thing from himselfe.
He may <hi>put it away,</hi> not <hi>take it,</hi> the expression had
been very imperfect if this had been his meaning.
* Well then: In all these instances, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
Antioch, Ephesus, Crete,</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> (and these
are all I can find in Scripture of any consideration
in the present Question) all the jurisdiction was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
in the <hi>Apostles</hi> while there was no <hi>Bishop,</hi>
or in the <hi>Bishop</hi> when there was any; And yet that
the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were joyned in the ordering Church
affaires I will not deny, to wit, by voluntary as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
them, <hi>in partem sollicitudinis,</hi> and by dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of power <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> or <hi>Episcopall,</hi> and by
way of assistance in acts deliberative, and consilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
though I find this no where specified but in the
Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where I prooved that the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100408:68"/>
were men of more power then meere <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
men of <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority. But here lies the
issue, and straine of the Question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Presbyters</hi> had no jurisdiction in causes crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and pertaining to the publick regiment of the
Church, by vertue of their order, or without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
substitution, and delegation. For there is not
in all Scripture any commission given by <hi>Christ</hi> to
meere Presbyters, no divine institution of any
power of regiment in the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> no constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Apostolicall,</hi> that meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> should either
alone, or in conjunction with the <hi>Bishop</hi> governe
the Church; no example in all Scripture of any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
inflicted by any meere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> either upon
Clergy or Laity; no specification of any power that
they had so to doe; but to Churches where Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of <hi>Presbyters</hi> were resident, Bishops were
sent by <hi>Apostolicall ordination;</hi> not only with power
of imposition of hands, but of excommunication,
of taking cognisance even of causes, and actions of
<hi>Presbyters</hi> themselves, as to <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi>
the Angell of the Church of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> and there is
also example of delegation of power of censures
from the <hi>Apostle</hi> to a Church where many <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
were fix't, as in the case of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent
before specified, which delegation was
needlesse, if coercitive jurisdiction by censures had
been by divine right in a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or a whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them.</p>
            <p>Now then, returne we to the consideration of S.
<hi>Hieromes</hi> saying: The Church was governed (saith


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100408:69"/>
he) <hi>communi Presbyterorum consilio,</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Counsell of the Presbyters. But,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Quo jure</hi> was this? That the <hi>Bishops</hi> were
Superiour to those which were then called <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
by <hi>custome</hi> rather then <hi>Divine disposition</hi> S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
affirmes; but that <hi>Presbyters</hi> were joyned with
the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> at first, by what right was
that? Was not that also by <hi>custome</hi> and condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
rather then by <hi>Divine</hi> disposition? S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
does not say but it was. For he speakes onely of
matter of fact, not of right, It might have beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
though <hi>de facto</hi> it was so in some places.</p>
            <p>* 2. [<hi>Communi Presbyterorum consilio</hi>] is true in
the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where the Elders were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall</hi>
men, and had <hi>Episcopall authority</hi> and
something superadded, as <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> and
<hi>Silas,</hi> for they had the authority and power of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
and an unlimited <hi>Diocesse</hi> besides, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>Silas</hi> was fixt upon the See of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
But yet even at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they actually had a <hi>Bishop,</hi>
who was in that place superiour to them in Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and therefore does clearely evince, that the
common-counsell of <hi>Presbyters</hi> is no argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the superiority of a <hi>Bishop</hi> over them.</p>
            <p>* 3. [<hi>Communi Presbyterorum consilio</hi>] is also
true, because the Apostles call'd themselves <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
as S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in their Epistles. Now
at the first, many <hi>Prophets,</hi> many <hi>Elders</hi> (for the
words are sometimes us'd in common) were for a
while resident in particular Churches, and did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
in common; As at <hi>Antioch</hi> were <hi>Barnabas,</hi>


               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:100408:69"/>
and <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Manaën,</hi> and <hi>Paul.
Communi horum Presbyterorum consilio</hi> the Church
of <hi>Antioch</hi> for a time was governed; for all these
were <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in the sense that S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> were, and the Elders of the Church of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* 4. Suppose this had beene true in the sense
that any body please to imagine, yet this not being
by any divine ordinance, that Presbyters should
by their Counsell assist in externall regiment of the
Church, neither by any intimation of Scripture, nor
by affirmation of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> it is sufficient to stifle
this by that saying of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
               <note place="margin">in Ephes. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Postquàm omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
locis Ecclesiae sunt constitutae, &amp; officia ordinata,
alitèr composita res est quàm caperat.</hi> It might be so
at first <hi>de facto,</hi> and yet no need to be so neither
then, nor after. For at first <hi>Ephesus</hi> had no <hi>Bishop</hi>
of it's owne, nor <hi>Crete,</hi> and there was no need, for S.
<hi>Paul</hi> had the supra-vision of them, and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and
other of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but yet afterwards S. <hi>Paul</hi>
did send <hi>Bishops</hi> thither; for when themselves were
to goe away, the power must be concredited to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
And if they in their absence before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
of a <hi>Bishop</hi> had intrusted the care of the
Church with <hi>Presbyters,</hi> yet it was but in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the Apostles, and by substitution, not by
any ordinary power, and it ceased at the presence
or command of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> or the sending of a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
to reside.<note place="margin">Epist. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</note>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So S. <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
being absent from his Church upon a businesse of


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100408:70"/>
being persecuted, he writ to his <hi>Presbyters,</hi> Doe
you feed the flock amongst you, till God shall shew
you who shall be your Ruler, <hi>viz.</hi> My Successor.
No longer. Your commission expires when a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
comes.</p>
            <p>* 5. To the conclusion of S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> discourse,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Bishops</hi> are not greater then <hi>Presbyters</hi> by
the truth of divine disposition; I answer, that this is
true in this sense, <hi>Bishops</hi> are not by Divine disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
greater then all those which in Scripture are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> such as were the Elders in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> such as were they of <hi>Antioch,</hi> such
as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all, and yet all
of them were not <hi>Bishops</hi> in the present sense, that is
of a fixt and particular Diocesse, and Iurisdiction.
* 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> meaning is also true in this sense,
[<hi>Bishops by the truth of the Lords disposition are not
greater then Presbyters,</hi>] viz. <hi>quoad exercitium actûs,</hi>
that is, they are not tyed to exercise jurisdiction
solely in their owne persons, but may <hi>asciscere sibi
Presbyteros in commune consilium,</hi> they may dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
jurisdiction to the Presbyters; and that they did
not so, but kept the exercise of it only in their owne
hands in S. <hi>Hieromes time,</hi> this is it, which he saith
is rather by custome, then by Divine dispensation,
for it was otherwise at first, viz. <hi>de facto,</hi> and might
be so still, there being no law of God against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation
of power Episcopall. * As for the last
words in the objection, [<hi>Et in communi debere Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam
regere,</hi>] it is an <hi>assumentum of</hi> S. <hi>Hieromes
owne;</hi> for all his former discourse was of the identity


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100408:70"/>
of Names, and common regiment <hi>de facto,</hi> not <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
and from <hi>a fact</hi> to conclude with a <hi>Debere,</hi> is a
<hi>Non sequitur,</hi> unlesse this <hi>Debere</hi> be understood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the exigence of the former arguments,
that is, THEY OUGHT, not by <hi>Gods law,</hi> but in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the practise <hi>Apostolicall;</hi> to wit, when things
are as they were then, when the Presbyters are such
as then they were; THEY OUGHT, for many conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and in Great cases, not by the necessity of a
Divine precept.</p>
            <p>* And indeed to doe him right he so explaines
himselfe, [<hi>Et in communi debere Ecclesiam regere,
imitantes Moysen qui cùm haberet in potestate solus
praeesse populo Israel, septuaginta elegit, cum quibus
populum judicaret.</hi>] The Presbyters ought to Iudge
in common with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> for the <hi>Bishops</hi> ought
to imitate <hi>Moses,</hi> who might have rul'd alone, yet
was content to take others to him, and himselfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to rule in chiefe. Thus S. <hi>Hierome</hi> would have
the <hi>Bishops</hi> doe, but then he acknowledges the right
of sole jurisdiction to be in them, and therefore
though his Councell perhaps might be good then,
yet it is necessary at no time, and was not followed
then, and to be sure is needlesse now. * For the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which S. <hi>Hierome</hi> uses to prove this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
what ever it is, I have and shall else where
produce, for they yeeld many other considerations
then this collection of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lesse then the equality of the offices of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
and <hi>Presbyterate.</hi> The same thing is <hi>per omnia</hi>
respondent to the paralell place of<note n="a" place="margin">In 1. Tim. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:100408:71"/>
It is needlesse to repeat either the objection, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>* But however this saying of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and the
paralell of S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> is but like an argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an Evident truth, which comes forth upon a
desperate service, and they are sure to be kill'd by
the adverse party, or to runne upon their owne
Swords; For either they are to be understood in the
senses above explicated, and then they are imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
or else they contradict evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Catholike antiquity, and so are false, and

            <p>I end this argument of tradition Apostolicall
with that saying of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in the same place.

for they are both <hi>ad idem,</hi> and speake of Elders of

            <p>* 3. Although <hi>Bishops</hi> be called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> yet
even in Scripture names are so distinguished, that
meer <hi>Presbyters</hi> are never called <hi>Bishops,</hi> unlesse it
be in conjunction with <hi>Bishops,</hi> and then in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
addresse, which, in all faire deportments, is
made to the more eminent, sometimes <hi>Presbyters</hi>
are, or may be comprehended. This observation if
it prove true, will clearely show, that the confusion
of names of <hi>Episcopus,</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> such as it is in
Scripture, is of no pretence by any intimation of
Scripture, for the indistinction of offices, for even
the names in Scripture it selfe are so distinguished,
that a meere <hi>Presbyter</hi> alone is never called a <hi>Bishop,</hi>
but a <hi>Bishop</hi> an <hi>Apostle</hi> is often called a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as
in the instances above. But we will consider those
places of Scripture, which use to be pretended in
those impertinent arguings from the identity of
Name, to confusion of things, and shew that they
neither enterfere upon the maine Question, nor this
observation. * <hi>Paul and Timotheus to all the saints
which are in Christ Iesus which are at Philippi, with


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100408:74"/>
the Bishops and Deacons.</hi> I am willinger to choose
this instance, because the place is of much considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the whole Question, and I shall take this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to cleare it from prejudice and disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <q>* By <hi>Bishops</hi> are here meant <hi>Presbyters,</hi> because
* many <hi>Bishops</hi> in a Church could not be, and yet
* S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks plurally of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the
* Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and therefore must meane
* meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> * so it is pretended.</q>
            <p>1. Then; By [<hi>Bishops</hi>] are, or may be meant the
whole superior order of the clergy, <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Priests,</hi> and that he speaks plurally, he, may besides
the <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Church, comprehend under their
name the <hi>Presbyters</hi> too; for why may not the name
be comprehended as well as the office, and order,
the inferiour under the superiour, the lesser within
the greater; for since the order of <hi>Presbyters</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in the <hi>Bishops</hi> order, and is not only inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
in it, but derivative from it; the same name
may comprehend both persons, because it does
comprehend the distinct offices and orders of them
both. And in this sense it is (if it be at all) that
<hi>Presbyters</hi> are sometimes in Scripture called <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* 2. Why may not [<hi>Bishops</hi>] be understood
properly; For there is no necessity of admiitting
that there were any meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> at all at the
first founding of this Church, It can neither be
proved from Scripture, not antiquity, if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed:
For indeed a <hi>Bishop</hi> or a company of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100408:75"/>
men</hi> as there were at <hi>Antioch,</hi> might doe all that
<hi>Presbyters</hi> could, and much more. And conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that there are some necessities of a Church
which a <hi>Presbyter</hi> cannot supply, and a <hi>Bishop</hi> can,
it is more imaginable that there was no <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
then that there was no <hi>Bishop.</hi> And certainely it is
most unlikely, that what is not expressed, to wit,
Presbyters should be onely meant, and that which
is expressed should not be at all intended.</p>
            <p>* 3. [<hi>With the Bishops</hi>] may be understood in
the proper sense, and yet no more <hi>Bishops</hi> in one
<hi>Diocesse</hi> then one, of a fixt residence; for in that
sense is S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and the fathers to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in their commentaries on this place,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Chrys. in 1. Phil.</note> affirming
that one Church could have but one <hi>Bishop;</hi> but then
take this along, that it was not then unusuall in such
great Churches, to have many men who were tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
residentiaries, but of an <hi>Apostolicall</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall</hi>
authority, as in the Churches of <hi>Ierusalem,
Rome, Antioch,</hi> there was as I have proved in the
premises. Nay in <hi>Philippi</hi> it selfe, If I mistake not,
as instance may be given, full, and home to this
purpose. <hi>Salutant te Episcopi Onesimus, Bitus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
Polybius, &amp; omnes qui sunt Philippis in Christo,
unde &amp; haec vobis Scripsi,</hi> saith <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epistle
to <hi>Hero</hi> his Deacon. So that many <hi>Bishops</hi> (we see)
might be at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and many were actually there
long after S. <hi>Paul's</hi> dictate of the Epistle.</p>
            <p>* 4. Why may not [<hi>Bishops</hi>] be meant in the
proper sense? Because there could not be more <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
then one, in a <hi>Diocesse.</hi> No? By what law? If


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100408:75"/>
by a constitution of the Church after the <hi>Apostles</hi>
times, that hinders not, but it might be otherwise
in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. If by a Law in the <hi>Apostles</hi>
times, then we have obtained the main question by
the shift, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> did ordain that there
should be one, and but one <hi>Bishop</hi> in a Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is evident they appointed many <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
And then let this objection be admitted how
it will, and doe its worst, we are safe enough.</p>
            <p>* 5. [<hi>With the Bishops</hi>] may be taken distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
for <hi>Philippi</hi> was a <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
<hi>Bishopricks</hi> under it, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the
Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> wrote also to all the daughter
Churches within its circuit, and therefore might
well salute many <hi>Bishops,</hi> though writing to one <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis,</hi>

And I thinke it will easily be shewen in Scripture,

as the other; for [<hi>Diaconus</hi>] is not in Scripture any
more appropriated to the inferiour Clergy, then
<hi>Episcopus</hi> to the Superiour, nor so much neither.
For <hi>Episcopus</hi> was never us'd in the <hi>new Testament</hi>
for any, but such, as had the care, regiment, and
supra-vision of a Church, but <hi>Diaconus</hi> was used
generally for all Ministeries.</p>
            <p>But yet supposing that <hi>Presbyters</hi> were included
under the word <hi>Episcopus,</hi> yet it is not because the

is of the more principall, and the <hi>Presbyter</hi> is also
comprehended, for his conjunction, and involution
in the Superiour, which was the principall observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

be sure it is but a vaine dreame that because <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

<hi>Bishop,</hi> when as it may be comprehended under <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
as a part in the whole, or the inferiour, within the


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100408:77"/>

office of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> and something more) or else it
may be as well intended in the word [<hi>Deacons,</hi>]
and rather then the word, [<hi>Bishop</hi>] 1. Because [<hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>]

in the Plurall, and so liker to comprehend the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

                  </gap>,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> describes the office of
a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and sayes not a word more either of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi>

office of <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
as well as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> too in

It will, it must be so, if this argument were
any thing else but an aëry and impertinent nothing.</p>
            <p>After all this yet, it cannot be showne in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

nay an <hi>Apostle</hi> is called a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as in the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

of Names is onely in descension, by reason of the
involution, or comprehension of <hi>Presbyter</hi> within
(<hi>Episcopus</hi>), but never in ascension, that is, an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi>
or a <hi>Bishop,</hi> is often called <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>

<hi>&amp;c. What is the Bishop, but he that hath
all authority and rule? What is the Presbytery, but a
sacred Colledge, Counsellors and helpers or assessors
to the Bishop? what are Deacons</hi> &amp;c: So that here is
the reall, and exact distinction of dignity, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
of Name, and intimation of office. The
<hi>Bishop</hi> is above all, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> his helpers, the
<hi>Deacons</hi> his Ministers, <gap reason="foreign">

But this is of so known, so evident a truth, that it
were but impertinent to insist longer upon it. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:100408:80"/>
1. Although it was so that <hi>Episcopus,</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi>
were distinct in the beginning after the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
death, yet sometimes the names are used pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously,
which is an evidence, that confusion of
names is no intimation, much lesse an argument for
the parity of offices, since themselves, who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
though indeed very seldome, confound the
names, yet distinguish the offices frequently, and
dogmatically.<note place="margin">Epist, ad He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Where by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he
means the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> so
indeed some say, and though there be no necessity
of admitting this meaning, because by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he
may mean the suffragan <hi>Bishops of Syria,</hi> yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be fairely admitted, for himselfe their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
was absent from his Church, and had delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> Episcopall jurisdiction to rule
the Church till hee being dead another Bishop
should be chosen, so that they were <hi>Episcopi Vicarii,</hi>
and by representment of the person of the Bishop
and execution of the Bishops power by delegation
were called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and this was done least the
Church should not be only without a Father, but
without a Guardian too; &amp; yet what a Bishop was,
and of what authority no man more confident and
frequent then <hi>Ignatius.</hi> * Another example of this
is in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> speaking of the youth whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
had converted and commended to a Bishop. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi>
whose story this was, proceeding in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
saies, <gap reason="foreign">

by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here S. <hi>Clement</hi> means not the


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100408:80"/>
               <hi>Order,</hi> but <hi>age</hi> of the Man, as it is like enough he
did, for a little after, he calls him [<gap reason="foreign">

so it is just as in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> in descent
and comprehension, for this Bishop also was a

of Episcopall power, for so it is in the allegation of
<hi>Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That this name <hi>Episcopus</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
to be appropriate to the supreame order of the
Clergy, was done with faire reason and designe.
For this is no fastuous, or pompous title, the word
is of no dignity, and implies none but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
to the just and faire execution of its offices.
But <hi>Presbyter</hi> is a name of dignity and vene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ation,
<hi>Rise up to the gray head,</hi> and it transplants the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

            <p>* But now of late, especially in those places
where <hi>Bishops</hi> are exauctorated, and no where else,
that I know, but amongst those men that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
designes, the word [<hi>Pastor</hi>] is given to Parish
Priests against the manner and usage of Ancient
Christendome; and though Priests may be called
<hi>Pastors</hi> in a limited, subordinate sense, and by way
of participation (just as they may be called <hi>Angels,</hi>
when the <hi>Bishop</hi> is <hi>the Angell,</hi> and so <hi>Pastors</hi> when
the <hi>Bishop</hi> is <hi>the Pastor,</hi> and so they are called <hi>Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

simply,<note place="margin">Epist. 11.</note> or <hi>Pastores Ecclesiae</hi> for above 600
yeares in the Church, and I think 800 more. And
therefore it was good counsell which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave,
to avoid <hi>vocum Novitates,</hi> because there is never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
affectation of New words contrary to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
voice of Christendome, but there is some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
in the thing too, to make an innovation: and of
this we have had long warning, in the New use of
the word [<hi>Pastor</hi>].</p>
            <p>

because there were not three Bishops, therefore he
procur'd two, and a Priest of <hi>Ostia</hi> to supply the
place of the third, that three, according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<hi>Apostolicall,</hi> and Canons of <hi>Nice, Antioch,</hi> and

make faire this ordination, and to reconcile it to the
Councell of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> and the others before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
who if ask't would declare it to be invalid.
* But certainly as the Canons did command three
to impose hands on a <hi>Bishop,</hi> so also they comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that those three, should be three <hi>Bishops,</hi> and
<hi>Pelagius</hi> might as well not have had three, as not

three <hi>Bishops;</hi> and better, because, so they were <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>

the <hi>Nicene Canon</hi> is as much exact, in requirng the
capacity of the person, as the Number of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers.
But let them answer it. For my part, I
beleive that the imposition of hands by <hi>Andreas,</hi>
was no more in that case then if a lay man had done
it; it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and though the ordination was
absolutely Un canonicall, yet it being in the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of Necessity, and being done by two Bishops
according to the Apostolicall Canon, it was valid
<hi>in naturâ rei,</hi> though not <hi>in formâ Canonis,</hi> and the
addition of the Priest was but to cheate the Canon,
and cozen himselfe into an impertinent beleife of a
Canonicall ordination.<note place="margin">Can. 6. Concil. Sardic.</note>

of Ecclesiasticall Ministrations.</hi> Since then <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>
hath a new <hi>ordination,</hi> and a distinct <hi>power</hi> (as I


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100408:93"/>
shall shew in the descent) it must needs be a distinct
<hi>order,</hi> both according to the Name given it by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and according to the nature of the thing in
the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nitions of the Schoole.</p>
            <p>There is nothing said against this but a fancy of
some of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> obtruded indeed
upon no grounds; for they would define order to be
<hi>a speciall power in relation to the Holy Sacrament,</hi>
which they call <hi>corpus Christi naturale;</hi> and <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>
indeed to be a distinct power in relation <hi>ad cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
Christi Mysticum,</hi> or the regiment of the
Church, and ordayning labourers for the harvest,
and therefore not to be a distinct order.</p>
            <p>But this to them that consider things sadly, is true
or false according as any man list. For if these men
are resolved they will call nothing an <hi>order</hi> but
what is a <hi>power</hi> in order to consecration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
who can help it? Then indeed, in that sense,
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> is not a distinct order, that is, a <hi>Bishop</hi> hath
no new power in the consecration of the Venerable
Eucharist, more then a <hi>Presbyter</hi> hath. But then
why these men should only call this power [<hi>an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>]
no man can give a reason. For, 1. in Antiquity
the distinct power of a Bishop was ever called an
Order, and I think, before <hi>Hugo de</hi> S. <hi>Victore,</hi> and
the <hi>Master of the Sentences,</hi> no man ever deni'd it
to be an <hi>order.</hi> 2. According to this rate, I would
faine know how the office of a <hi>Sub-deacon,</hi> and of an
<hi>Ostiary,</hi> and of an <hi>Acolouthite,</hi> and of a <hi>Reader,</hi> come
to be distinct <hi>Orders;</hi> for surely the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath as
much power in order to consecration <hi>de Novo,</hi> as


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100408:94"/>
they have <hi>de integr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And if I mistake not; that the
<hi>Bishop</hi> hath a new power to ordaine <hi>Presbyters</hi> who
shall have a power of consecrating the Eucharist, is
more a new power in order to consecration, then all
those inferiour officers put together have in all, and
yet they call them Orders, and therefore why not
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> also, I cannot imagine, unlesse because
they will not.</p>
            <p>*** But however in the meane time, the denying
the office and degree of Episcopacy to be a new
and a distinct order is an Innovation of the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of some in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without all
reason, and against all antiquity. This onely by
the way.</p>
            <p>The Enemies of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> call in aide from all

to man, and this a <hi>Presbyter</hi> hath as well as a
<hi>Bishop,</hi> is it likely that a <hi>Bishop</hi> should by <hi>Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
be so much Superiour to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> who
by the confession of all sides communicates with a
<hi>Bishop</hi> in that which is his highest power? And
shall issues of a lesser dignity distinguish the <hi>Orders,</hi>
and make a <hi>Bishop</hi> higher to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Greater raise up a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
poise of a <hi>Bishop?</hi> Upon this surmise the <hi>men of
the Church of Rome,</hi> would inferre an identity of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>


               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:100408:94"/>
though a disparity of <hi>degree,</hi> but the <hi>Men of
the other world</hi> would inferre a parity both of order
and degree too. The first are already answered in
the premises. The second must now be serv'd.</p>
            <p>1. Then, whether power be greater, of <hi>Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
Priests, or <hi>Consecrating</hi> the Sacrament is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Question; possibly, it may be of some
danger; because in comparing Gods ordinances,
there must certainely be a depression of one, and
whether that lights upon the right side or no, yet
peradventure it will not stand with the consequence
of our gratitude to God, to doe that, which in
Gods estimate, may tant' amount to a direct Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing;
but however it is vnprofitable, of no
use in case of conscience either in order to faith, or
manners, and besides, cannot fixe it selfe upon any
basis, there being no way of proving either to be
more excellent then the other.</p>
            <p>2. The Sacraments, and mysteries of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
if compared among themselves, are greater,
and lesser in severall respects. For since they are all
in order to severall ends, that is, productive of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
effects, and they all are excellent, every rite,
and sacrament in respect of its own effect, is more
excellent then the other not ordain'd to that effect.
For example. Matrimony is ordain'd for a means to
preserve chastity, and to represent the mysticall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ and his Church, and therefore in these
respects is greater then baptisme, which does nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But<note n="*" place="margin">The Nicen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Creed.</note> baptisme is for remission of sinnes and
in that is more excellent then Matrimony; the


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100408:95"/>
same may be said for ordination, and consecration,
the one being in order to Christs naturall body (as
the Schooles speak) the other in order to his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
body, and so have their severall excellencies
respectively; but for an absolute preheminence of
one above the other, I said there was no <hi>basis</hi> to fixe
that upon, and I believe all men will find it so that
please to try. But in a relative, or respective excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
they goe both before, and after one another.
Thus Wooll, and a Iewell, are better then each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for wooll is better for warmth, and a jewell
for ornament. A frogge hath more sense in it, then
the Sunne; and yet the Sunne shines brighter.</p>
            <p>3. Suppose <hi>consecration</hi> of the Eucharist were
greater then <hi>ordaining Priests,</hi> yet that cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but that the <hi>power of ordaining</hi> may make <hi>a
higher and distinct order,</hi> because the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining,
hath in it the power of consecrating and
something more; it is all that which makes the
<hi>Priest,</hi> and it is something more besides, which
makes the <hi>Bishop.</hi> Indeed if the Bishop had it not,
and the Priest had it, then supposing consecration
to be greater then ordination, the Priest would not
only equall, but excell the Bishop, but because the
Bishop hath that, and ordination besides, therefore
he is higher both in Order, and Dignity.</p>
            <p>4. Suppose that <hi>Consecration</hi> were the greatest
Clericall power in the world, and that the Bishop,
and the Priest, were equall in the great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st power,
yet a lesser power then it, superadded to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's,
may make a distinct <hi>order,</hi> and superiority.


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100408:95"/>
Thus it was said of the sonne of Man. <hi>Constituit
eum paulò minorem Angelis, he was made a little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the Angels.</hi> It was but a little lower, and yet
so much as to distinguish their Natures, for he took
not upon him the NATURE <hi>of Angells, but the seed
of Abraham.</hi> So it is in proportion between Bishop,
and Priest; for though a Priest communicating in
the greatest power of the Church, <hi>viz. consecration</hi>
of the venerable Eucharist, yet differing in a lesse is
<hi>paulò minor Angelis, a little lower then the Bishop, the
Angell of the Church,</hi> yet this little lower, makes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
order, and enough for a subordination. * An
Angell, and a man communicate in those great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of spirituall essence, they both discourse,
they have both election, and freedome of choice,
they have will, and understanding, and memory,
impresses of the Divine image, and loco-motion,
and immortality. And these excellencies are (being
precisely considered) of more reall and eternall
worth, then the Angelicall manner of moving so in
an instant, and those other formes and modalities
of their knowledge and volition, and yet for these
superadded parts of excellency, the difference is no
lesse then specificall. If we compare a Bishop and a
Priest thus, what we call difference in nature there,
will be a difference in order here, and of the same
consideration.</p>
            <p>5. Lastly it is considerable, that these men that
make this objection, doe not make it because they
think it true, but because it will serve a present turne.
For all the world sees, that to them that deny the


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100408:96"/>
reall presence, this can be no objection; and most
certainly the <hi>Anti-episcopall</hi> men doe so, in all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and then what excellency is there in the power
of consecration, more then in ordination? Nay is
there any such thing as consecration at all? This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
would be considered from their principles. But I
proceed.</p>
            <p>One thing only more is objected against the
maine Question. If <hi>Episcopacy</hi> be a distinct order,
why may not a man be a Bishop that never was a
Priest, as (abstracting from the lawes of the
Church) a man may be a Presbyter that never was a
Deacon, for if it be the impresse of a distinct chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
it may be, imprinted <hi>per saltum,</hi> and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
as it is in the order of a Presbyter.</p>
            <p>To this I answere, It is true if the powers and
characters themselves were independant; as it is in all
those offices of humane constitution, which are
called the inferior orders; For the office of an <hi>Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louthite,</hi>
of an <hi>Exorcist,</hi> of an <hi>Ostiary,</hi> are no way
dependant on the office of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and therefore a
man may be Deacon, that never was in any of those,
and perhaps a <hi>Presbyter</hi> too, that never was a <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
as it was in the first example of the <hi>Presbyterate</hi>
in the 72. <hi>Disciples.</hi> But a <hi>Bishop</hi> though he have
a distinct character, yet it is not disparate from
that of a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but supposes it <hi>ex vi ordinis.</hi> For
since the power of ordination (if any thing be) is
the distinct capacity of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> this power suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
a power of <hi>consecrating</hi> the Eucharist to be in
the <hi>Bishop,</hi> for how else can he ordaine a <hi>Presbyter</hi>


               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:100408:96"/>

Yes; for they had <hi>Episcopall</hi> Ordination at

not to invade the territories of their neighbour.
The tenth Canon of the Councell of Antioch
clears this part. The words are these as they are

there was some particular reason for the involving

but the Citty <hi>Presbyters</hi> might not ordaine,
neither with, nor without licence; for they are in the
Canon only by way of parenthesis, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

This onely,</p>
            <p>In diverse cases of Transgression of the Canons,


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100408:100"/>
Clergy men were reduc'd to lay communion, either
being suspended, or deposed; that is, from their place
of honour, and execution of their function, with, or
without hope of restitution respectively; but then
still they had their order, and the Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd

pronounced void, and no more, and therefore
may be rescinded by the Counter-mand of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
power; A Councell at most may doe it, and
therefore without a Councell, a probable necessity
will let us loose. But to this the answer is evident.</p>
            <p>1. The expressions in the severall cases are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall,
&amp; of diverse issue, for in case of those nullities
which are meerely Canonicall, they are expressed
as then first made, but in the case of ordination by a
<hi>Non-Bishop,</hi> they are onely declared voy'd <hi>ipso facto.</hi>
And therefore in that decree of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> against
<hi>Sinetitul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,
IRRITAM EXISTIMARI <hi>manûs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positionem,
to be esteem'd as null,</hi> that is, not to have
Canonicall approbation, but is not declared null,


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100408:101"/>
               <hi>in Naturâ rei,</hi> as it is in the foregoing instances.</p>
            <p>2. In the cases of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Chalcodon,</hi> the
decree is <hi>pro futuro,</hi> which makes it evident that
those nullities are such as are made by Canon, but
in the cases of <hi>Colluthus,</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> there was
declaration of a past nullity and that before any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
was made; and though Synodall declarations
pronoun'd such ordinations invalid, yet none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
so for the future, which is a cleare evidence,
that this nullity, viz: in case of ordination by a <hi>Non-Presbyter,</hi>
is not made by Canon, but by Canon *de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
to be invalid in the nature of the thing.</p>
            <p>3. If to this be added, that in antiquity it was
dogmatically resolved that by the Nature, and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Order of <hi>Bishops;</hi> ordination was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to them, then it will also from hence be
evident, that the nullity of ordination without a
<hi>Bishop</hi> is not dependant upon positive constitution,
but on the exigence of the institution. ** Now
that the power of ordination was onely in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi>
even they, who to advance the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> were
willing enough to speake lesse for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> give
testimony; making this the proper distinctive cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance
of a <hi>Bishop</hi> from a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> that the <hi>Bishop</hi>
hath power of ordination, the <hi>Presbyter</hi> hath not.

Ordination is the proper, and peculiar function of
a <hi>Bishop;</hi> and therefore not given him by positive
constitution of the Canon.</p>
            <p>4. No man was call'd an heretick for breach of
Canon, but for denying the power of ordination to
be proper to a <hi>Bishop: Aërius</hi> was by <hi>Epiphanius,
Philastrius,</hi> and S. <hi>Austin</hi> condemn'd, and branded
for heresie, and by the Catholike Church saith <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius.</hi>
This power therefore came from a higher
spring, then positive and Canonicall Sanction.
But now proceed.</p>
            <p>The Councell held in <hi>Trullo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Can. 37.</note> complaining that
the incursion of the barbarous people upon the

               </gap>, <hi>according to the

as</hi> DID BELONG TO THE BISHOP; and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of the Canon they are permitted in such cases,
<hi>ut &amp; diversorum Clericorum ordinationes canonicè
faciant, to make Canonicall ordinations of Clergy-men.</hi>
Giving of Orders is proper, it belongs to a <hi>Bishop.</hi>
So the Councell. And therefore <hi>Theodoret</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
that place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> [<hi>by the laying on the
hands of the Presbytery</hi>] interprets it of <hi>Bishops;</hi> for
this reason, because <hi>Presbyters</hi> did not impose hands.
* There is an imperfect Canon in the <hi>Arausican</hi>

               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:100408:102"/>
those things that are not done, but by <hi>Bishops,</hi> they
were decreed still to be done by <hi>Bishops,</hi> though he
that was to doe them regularly, did fall into any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
whatsoever, yet <hi>non sub praesentiâ suâ Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteros

are clearely by this Canon some things suppos'd to
be proper to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> to the action of which
<hi>Presbyters</hi> must in no case be admitted. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
what they are, are not specified in the Canon,
but are nam'd before, viz: <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
for almost the whole Councell was concerning
them, and nothing else is properly the <hi>agendum E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopi,</hi>
and the Canon else is not to be Understood.
* To the same issue is that circum-locutory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,

it <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, all the whole
Clergy was against it, yet the <hi>Bishop</hi> did ordaine
him, and then certainely searce any conjunction of


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100408:102"/>
the other Clergy can be imagined; I am sure none
is either expressed or intimated. For it was a rul'd
case, and attested by the Uniforme practise of the
Church, which was set downe in the third Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Can. 45.</note> 
               <hi>Episcopus vnus esse potest per quem
dignatione Divinâ Presbyteri multi constitui possunt.</hi>
This case I instance the more particularly, because
it is an exact determination of a <hi>Bishops</hi> sole power
of ordination. <hi>Aurelius</hi> made a motion, that, if a
Church wanted a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to become her <hi>Bishop,</hi>
they might demand one from any <hi>Bishop.</hi> It was
granted; But <hi>Posthumianus</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> put this case.
<hi>Deinde qui vnum habuerit, numquid debet illi ipse
vnus Presbyter auferri? How if the Bishop have but
one Priest, must his Bishop part with him to supply the
necessity of the Neighbour widdow-Church?</hi> Yea,
that he must. But how then shall he keepe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
when he hath never a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to assist him?
That indeed would have beene the objection now,
but it was none then. For <hi>Aurelius</hi> told them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there was no inconvenience in it, for though a
<hi>Bishop</hi> have never a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> no great matter, he
can himselfe ordaine many (and then I am sure, there
is sole ordination) but if a <hi>Bishop</hi> be wanting to a
Church, he is not so easily found.</p>
            <p>** Thus it went ordinarily in the stile of the
Church, ordinations were made by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and
the ordainer spoken of as a single person.<note place="margin">Cap. 19.</note> So it is in
the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, the Councell of<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Antioch,</hi> the
Councell of<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 2. &amp; 6.</note> 
               <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and S. <hi>Ierome</hi> who wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:100408:103"/>
If thou speake (saith he) of <hi>Paulinianus,</hi>
he comes now and then to visit us, not as any of
your Clergy, but <hi>ejus à quo ordinatus est, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's
who ordain'd him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* So that the issue of this argument is this. The
<hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>rules</hi> of the <hi>Ancient
Councells</hi> appropriate the ordination of <hi>Bishops</hi> to
<hi>Bishops,</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> to one <hi>Bishop,</hi> (for I never
find a <hi>Presbyter</hi> ordain'd by two <hi>Bishops</hi> together,
but onely <hi>Origen</hi> by the <hi>Bishops of Ierusalem,</hi> and
<hi>Caesarea) Presbyters</hi> are never mention'd in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with <hi>Bishops</hi> at their ordinations, and if alone
they did it, their ordination was pronounced inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and void <hi>ab initio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* To these particulars adde this, that <hi>Bishops</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
were punished if ordinations were <hi>Vncanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi>
which were most vnreasonable if <hi>Presbyters</hi>
did joine in them, and were causes in conjunction.
But unlesse they did it alone, we never read that they
were punishable; indeed <hi>Bishops</hi> were <hi>pro toto, &amp;
integro,</hi> as is reported by <hi>Sozomen</hi> in the case of
<hi>Elpidius, Eustathius, Basilius of Ancyra,</hi> and <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
Thus also it was decreed in the second, and sixt
Chapters of the <hi>Councell of Chalcedon,</hi> and in the
<hi>Imperiall constitutions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Novell: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir. 6. &amp; 1. 23. cap. 16.</note> Since therefore we neither
find <hi>Presbyters</hi> join'd with <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>commission,</hi> or
<hi>practise,</hi> or <hi>penalty</hi> all this while. I may inferre
from the premises the same thing which the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Hispal</hi> expresses in direct, and full sentence,
<hi>Episcopus Sacerdotibus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap: 6.</note>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100408:103"/>
may give the <hi>Priestly</hi> honour, he alone is not
suffer'd to take it away. * This Councell was held
in the yeare 657,<note place="margin">Can: 2, &amp; 3.</note> and I set it downe here for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to show that the decree of the fourth <hi>Councell
of Carthage</hi> which was the first that licensed <hi>Priests</hi>
to assist <hi>Bishops in ordinations</hi> yet was not obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the West; but for almost 300 yeares after,
ordinations were made by <hi>Bishops alone.</hi> But till
this Councell no pretence of any such conjunction,
and after this Councell sole ordination did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in the West for above 200 yeares together;
but for ought I know, ever since then, it hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
that although <hi>Presbyters</hi> joyne not in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> yet of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> they doe;
but this is onely by a positive subintroduced consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
first made in a <hi>Provinciall of Africa,</hi> and in
other places received by insinuation and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of practise.</p>
            <p>* I know not what can be said against it. I onely
find a peice of an objection out of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who
was a Man so complying with the Subjects of his
Diocesse, that if any man, he was like to furnish us
with an Antinomy.*<note place="margin">Epist. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Hunc igitur (Fratres Dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctissimi)

<hi>Bishops</hi> will be found in the ordination of one to
an inferiour order, which because it was (as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
before) against the practise of Christendome,
will not easily be admitted to be the sense of S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
But if he means <hi>Presbyters</hi> by [<hi>Collegae</hi>] then sole


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100408:104"/>
ordination is invalidated by this example, for <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
join'd with him in the ordination of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that it matters not whether by his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues
he means one, or the other, for <hi>Aurelius</hi> the
Confessor who was the man ordain'd, was ordain'd
but to be a Reader, and that was no <hi>Order of Divine
institution,</hi> no gift of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and therefore
might be dispensed by one, or more; by Bishops, or
Presbyters, and no way enters into the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this question concerning the power of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
those orders which are gifts of the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> and of <hi>divine ordinance;</hi> and therefore, this,
although I have seen it once pretended, yet hath no
validity to impugne the constant practise of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
antiquity.</p>
            <p>But then are all ordinations invalid which are
done by meere <hi>Presbyters</hi> without a <hi>Bishop?</hi> What
think we of the reformed Churches?</p>
            <p>1. For my part I know not what to think. The
question hath been so often asked with so much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
and prejudice; and we are so bound by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
interest to approve all that they doe, that wee
have disabled our selves to justify our owne. For
we were glad at first of abettors against the Errors
of the Romane Church, we found these men zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in it, we thank'd God for it (as we had cause)
and we were willing to make them recompence, by
endeavouring to justify their ordinations; not
thinking what would follow upon our selves. But
now it is come to that issue, that our own <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>


               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:100408:104"/>
is thought not necessary, because wee did not
condemne the ordinations of their <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Why is not the question rather, what we
think of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> then what we think
of the <hi>reformed Churches?</hi> Did the Primitive
Councells, and Fathers doe well in condemning
the ordinations made by meere <hi>Presbyters?</hi> If they
did well, what was a vertue in them, is no sinne in
us. If they did ill, from what principle shall wee
judge of the right of ordinations? since there is no
example in Scripture of any ordination made but
by <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>Presbytery</hi> that
impos'd hands on <hi>Timothy,</hi> is by all antiquity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
either of the office, or of a Colledge of
<hi>Presbyters;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it to be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
made by his owne hands, as appeares by
comparing the two epistles to <hi>S. Timothy</hi> together;
and may be so meant by the principles of all sides,
for if the names be confounded, then <hi>Presbyter</hi> may
signify a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and that they of this <hi>Presbytery</hi>
were not <hi>Bishops,</hi> they can never prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where all men grant that the Names are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
            <p>* So that whence will men take their estimate
for the rites of ordinations? From <hi>Scripture?</hi> That
gives it alwayes to <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> (as I have
proved) and that a <hi>Priest</hi> did ever impose hands for
ordination can never be showne from thence. From
when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> then? From <hi>Antiquity?</hi> That was so farre
from licensing ordinations made by <hi>Presbyters</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
that <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the primitive Church did


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100408:105"/>
never joyne with <hi>Bishops</hi> in Collating holy Orders
of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacon,</hi> till the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Councell of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi>
much lesse doe it alone, rightly, and with
effect. So that, as in <hi>Scripture</hi> there is nothing for
<hi>Presbyters</hi> ordaining, so in <hi>Antiquity</hi> there is much
against it; And either in this particular we must
have strange thoughts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
or not so faire interpretation of the ordinations of
reformed <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> But for my part I had rather
speake a truth in sincerity, then erre with a glorious
correspondence.</p>
            <p>But will not necessity excuse them who could not
have orders from Orthodoxe <hi>Bishops?</hi> shall we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinne against our consciences by suscribing to
hereticall, and false resolutions <hi>in materiâ fidei,</hi> or
else loose the being of a Church, for want of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
ordinations?</hi> * Indeed if the case were just thus
it was very hard with the good people of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine
Churches; but I have here two things to
consider.</p>
            <p>1. I am very willing to beleive that they would
not have done any thing either of error, or suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but in cases of necessity. But then I consider that
<hi>M. Du Plessis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">de Eccles. cap. 11.</note> a man of honour, and Great learning
does attest, that at the first reformation there were
many <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> and <hi>Cardinalls</hi> in <hi>Germany, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> that joyn'd in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whom they might, but did not imploy in their
ordinations; And what necessity then can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in this case, I would faine learne that I might
make their defence. But, which is of more, and


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100408:105"/>
deeper consideration; for this might have been done
by inconsideration, and irresolution, as often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in the beginning of great changes, but, it is their
constant and resolved practise at least in <hi>France,</hi> that
if any returnes to them they will reordayne him by
their <hi>Presbytery,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Danaeus part. 2. Isagog; lib. 2. cap. 22. Perron. repl. fol: 92. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press. 1605.</note> though he had before <hi>Episcopall</hi>
Ordination, as both their friends and their enemies
beare witnesse.</p>
            <p>2. I consider that necessity may excuse a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
delinquency; but I never heard that necessity
did build a Church. Indeed no man is forc'd for
his owne particular to committ a sinne, for if it be
absolutely a case of necessity, the action ceases to be
a sinne; but indeed if God meanes to build a Church
in any place, he will doe it by meanes proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that end; that is, by putting them into a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of doing, and acquiring those things which
himselfe hath required of necessity to the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Church. * So that, supposing that Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by a <hi>Bishop</hi> is necessary for the vocation of
<hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> (as I have proved it is) and
therefore for the founding, or perpetuating of a
Church, either God hath given to all Churches op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
and possibility of such Ordinations, and
then, necessity of the contrary, is but pretence and
mockery, or if he hath not given such possibility,
then there is no Church there to be either built, or
continued, but the Candlestick is presently remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>There are diverse stories in <hi>Ruffinus</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.<note place="margin">Ecclesihist: lib. 10. cap. 9. per Ruffinum.</note>

Moses</hi> refus'd to be ordayn'd by him that was an
<hi>Arrian.</hi> So did the reform'd Churches refuse or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations
by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> communion.
But what then might they have done? Even the
same that <hi>Moses</hi> did in that necessity; <hi>compulsus est

orders from the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran

<hi>Catholike,</hi> and <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If an ordinary necessity will not excuse this, will
not an extraordinary calling justifie it? Yea, most
certainely, could we but see an ordinary proofe for
an extraordinary calling, viz: an evident prophecy,
demonstration of Miracles, certainety of reason,
clarity of sense, or any thing that might make faith
of an extraordinary mission.</p>
            <p>But shall we then condemne those few of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches whose ordinations alwaies have
beene without <hi>Bishops?</hi> No indeed. That must not
be. They stand, or fall to their owne Master. And


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100408:107"/>
though I cannot justifie their ordinations, yet what
degree their Necessity is of, what their desire of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall</hi>
ordinations may doe for their personall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
and how farre a good life, and a <hi>Catholike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife</hi>
may leade a man in the way to heaven, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the formes of externall communion be not
observ'd) I cannot determine. * For ought I know,
their condition is the same with that of the Church
of <hi>Pergamus</hi> [<hi>I know thy works, and where thou
dwellest, even where Sathans seate is, and thou heldest
fast my</hi> FAITH, <hi>and hast not denied my Name; Nihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lominus
habeo adversus te pauca, some few things I

Canonicall ordinations is a defect which I trust
themselves desire to be remedied; but if it cannot
be done, their sinne indeed is the lesse, but their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
the Greater. * I am sure I have said sooth, but
whether or no it will be thought so, I cannot tell;
and yet why it may not I cannot guesse, unlesse they
only be impeccable, which I suppose will not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be thought of them, who themselves thinke, that
all the Church possibly may faile. But this I would
not have declar'd so freely, had not the necessity of
our owne Churches requir'd it, and that the first
pretence of the legality, and validity of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
beene boyed up to the height of an absolute
necessity; for else why shall it be called Tyranny in
us to call on them to conforme to us, and to the
practise of the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> and yet in them be
called a good and a holy zeale to exact our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100408:107"/>

schisme between the <hi>Latine,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches,<note place="margin">vide Anasta. biblioth. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. in Can. 8. Synodi.</note>
and it was upon this occasion too. For when the
<hi>Bulgarians</hi> were first converted, the <hi>Greekes</hi> sent
Presbyters to baptize, and to confirme them. But
the <hi>Latins</hi> sent againe to have them re-confirmed,
both because (as they pretended) the Greekes had
no jurisdiction in <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> nor the <hi>Presbyters</hi> a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of <hi>order</hi> to give <hi>confirmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The matters of fact, and acts Episcopall of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
are innumerable, but most famous are
those confirmations made by S. <hi>Rembert</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Brema,</hi>
               <note place="margin">vide Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. lib. 2. S. Bernard. in vitâ S Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae. Surium. tom. 1. in Febr.</note> and of S. <hi>Malchus</hi> attested by S. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
because they were ratified by miracle, saith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
story. I end this with the saying of S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
Exigis ubi scriptum sit? In Actibus Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.
Sed etiamsi Scripturae authoritas non subesset,</hi>
               <note place="margin">dial. adv. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer.</note>
               <hi>totius orbis in hanc partem consensus instar praecepti
obtineret. If you aske where it is written? (viz.</hi> that
Bishops alone should confirme) <hi>It is written in the
Acts of the Apostles</hi> (meaning, by precedent, though
not expresse precept) <hi>but if there were no authority of
Scripture for it, yet the consent of all the world upon
this particular is instead of a command.</hi> *** It was
fortunate that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath expressed himselfe
so confidently in this affaire, for by this we are
arm'd against an objection from his own words, for
in the same dialogue, speaking of some acts of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall</hi>
priviledge and peculiar ministration, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> he saies, it was <hi>ad honorem
potius Sacerdotii quàm ad legis necessitatem. For the
honour of the Priesthood, rather then for the necessity
of a law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:100408:110"/>
To this the answer is evident from his own
words: That <hi>Bishops</hi> should give the Holy Ghost in
confirmation, is written in the Acts of the <hi>Apostles;</hi>
and now that this is reserved rather for the honour
of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> then a simple necessity in the nature of
the thing makes no matter. For the question here
that is only of concernment, is not to what end this
power is reserved to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> but by whom it
was reserved? Now S. <hi>Hierome</hi> saies it was done <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud
Acta,</hi> in the Scripture, therefore by Gods Holy
Spirit, and the end he also specifies, <hi>viz.</hi> for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that sacred order, <hi>non propter legis necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
not that there is any necessity of law,</hi> that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
should be administred by the <hi>Bishop.</hi> Not
that a Priest may doe it, but that, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
there argues, the Holy Ghost being already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in baptisme, if it happens that <hi>Bishops</hi> may not
be had (for he puts the case concerning persons in
bondage, and places remote, and destitute of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>)
then in that case there is not the absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of a Law, that Confirmation should be had
at all. A man does not perish if he have it not; for
that this thing was reserved to a <hi>Bishops</hi> peculiar mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
was indeed an honour to the function,
but it was not for the necessity of a Law tying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in all cases actually to acquire it. So that this
[<hi>non necessarium</hi>] is not to be referred to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
ministration, as if it were not necessary for him
to doe it when it is to be done, not that a Priest may
doe it if a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> may not be had, but this <hi>non neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>
is to be referred to confirmation it selfe; so that


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100408:110"/>
if a <hi>Bishop</hi> cannot be had, confirmation, though
with much losse, yet with no danger, may be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
This is the summe of S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> discourse, this
reconciles him to himselfe, this makes him speak
conformably to his first assertions, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to his arguments, and to be sure, no expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
can make these words to intend that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the power of confirmation to <hi>Bishops,</hi>
is not done by the spirit of God, and then let the
sense of the words be what they will, they can doe
no hurt to the cause; and as easily may we escape
from those words of his, to <hi>Rusticus Bishop of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona.

of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> for else he becomes an <hi>Antistrephon,</hi>

But,</p>
            <p>1. The passage is suspitious, for it interrupts a
discourse of S. <hi>Ambrose's</hi> concerning the Primitive
Order of election to the <hi>Bishopricke,</hi> and is no way
pertinent to the discourse, but is incircled with a
story of a farre different consequence, which is not
easily thought to have beene done by any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and intelligent Author.</p>
            <p>2. But suppose the clause is not surreptitious,
but naturall to the discourse, and borne with it, yet
it is matter of fact, not of right, for S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
approves, nor disproves it, and so it must goe
for a singular act against the Catholike practise and
Lawes of Christendome.</p>
            <p>3. If the whole clause be not surreptitious, yet
the word [<hi>Consignant</hi>] is, for <hi>S. Austin</hi> who hath
the same discourse, the same thing, viz: of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> tels this story of the Act and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Presbyters in Alexandria,</hi> and all <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
almost in the other words of his Master S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
but he tells it thus, <hi>Nam &amp; in Alexandriâ &amp; per to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Aegyptum si desit Episcopus,</hi>

               <hi>Consecrat Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</hi>
So that it should not be <hi>consignat,</hi> but <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat;</hi>
for no story tells of any confirmations done
in <hi>Aegypt</hi> by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but of consecrating the


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100408:111"/>
Eucharist in cases of <hi>Episcopall</hi> absence, or commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I shall give account in the Question of Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
that was indeed permitted in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and
some other places, but Confirmation never, that we
can find else where, and this is too improbable to
beare weight against evidence and practise <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall,</hi>
and foure <hi>Councells,</hi> and 16 ancient <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Fathers,</hi> testifying that it was a <hi>practise</hi> and a
<hi>Law of Christendome</hi> that <hi>Bishops</hi> onely should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
and not Priests, so that if there be no other
scruple, this Question is quickly at an end.</p>
            <p>** But S. <hi>Gregory</hi> is also pretended in objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for he gave dispensation to the Priests of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,
vt baptizatos Vguant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">lib. 3. eist p. 26.</note> to aneale baptized
people. Now anointing the forehead of the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
person, was one of the solemnityes of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
so that this indulgence does arise to a power
of Confirming; for <hi>Vnctio</hi> and <hi>Chrismatio</hi> in the
first <hi>Arausican Councell,</hi> and since that time <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
Chrismatis</hi> hath beene the vsuall word for
confirmation. But this will not much trouble the
buisinesse.</p>
            <p>Because it is evident that he meanes it not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
but of the Chrisme in those times by the
rites of the Church us'd in baptisme. For in his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               <hi>Epistle</hi> he forbids Priests to anoynt baptized people,
now here is precept against precept, therefore it
must be understood of severall anoyntings, and so
<hi>S. Gregory</hi> expounds himselfe in this 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Epistle,
Presbyteri baptizatos infantes signare bis in fronte
Chrismate non praesumant. Presbyters may not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100408:112"/>
baptised people twice,</hi> once they might; now
that this permission of anoynting was that which
was a ceremony of baptisme, not an act of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
we shall see by comparing it with other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</hi>
*In the collection of the Orientall Canons by
<hi>Martinus Bracarensis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Can. 52.</note> It is decreed thus, [<hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
praesente Episcopo non</hi> SIGNET <hi>infantes, nisi forte
ab Episcopo fuerit illi praeceptum. A Priest must not
signe infantes without leave of the Bishop if he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Must not signe them</hi>] that is with Chrisme in
their foreheads, and that in baptisme; for the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstant
Canons doe expressly explicate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
it; for they are concerning the rites of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and this in the midst of them. And by the
way this may answer S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his [<hi>Presbyteri
consignant absente Episcopo</hi>] in case it be so to be
read; for here wee see a consignation permitted to
the presbyters in the Easterne Churches to be used
in baptisme, in the absence of the Bishop, and this
an act of indulgence and favour, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
and of use to <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> his purpose of
advancing the Presbyters, but yet of no objection in
case of confimation. * And indeed [<hi>Consignari</hi>]
is us'd in Antiquity for any signing with the Crosse,
and anealing. Thus it is us'd in the first <hi>Arausican
Councell</hi> for <hi>extreame Vnction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Can. 2</note> which is there in case
of extreame necessity permitted to <hi>Presbyters: Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticos

&amp; benedictione</hi> CONSIGNARI <hi>placet. Consig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd</hi>
is the word, and it was clearly in extreame Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100408:112"/>
for that rite was not then ceased, and it
was in anealing a dying body, and a part of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
and so limited by the sequent Canon and not
to be fancyed of any other consignation. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.<note place="margin">Can. 20.</note>
*** The first Councell of <hi>Toledo</hi> prohibites
any from making Chrisme, but <hi>Bishops</hi> only, and
takes order, <hi>ut de singulis Ecclesiis ad Episcopum an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Chrisma ab Episcopo destinatum ad diem Paschae pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
occurrere;</hi> that the Chrisme be fetch't by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acons
from the <hi>Bishop</hi> to be us'd in all Churches.
But for what use? why, it was <hi>destinatum ad diem
Pascbae</hi> sayes the <hi>Canon,</hi> against the Holy time of
<hi>Easter,</hi> and then, at <hi>Easter</hi> was the solemnity of
publike baptismes, so that it was to be us'd in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
And this sense being premised, the <hi>Canon</hi>
permits to <hi>Presbyters</hi> to signe with Chrisme, the
same thing that <hi>S. Gregory</hi> did to the <hi>Priests of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia.
Statutum verò est, Diaconum non Chrismare,

enough, yet it is somthing clearer in the first

Consigning with oyntment was us'd in baptisme,
and it is as evident that this Chrismation was it
which <hi>S. Grogory</hi> permitted to the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> not
the other, for he expressely forbad the other and
the exigence of the <hi>Canons,</hi> and <hi>practise of the

            </p>
            <p>By the way; some, that they might the more
clearly determine <hi>S. Gregory's</hi> dispensation to be
only in baptismall Chrisme, read it, [<hi>Vt baptiz an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos

Thomas,</hi> but it is needlesse to be troubled with that,
for <hi>Innocentius</hi> in the decretall now quoted useth the
word [<hi>Baptizatos</hi>] and yet clearly distinguishes
this power from the giving the Chrisme in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>I know no other objection, and these wee see
hinder not but that having such evidence of fact in
Scripture of confirmations done only by <hi>Apostles,</hi>
and this evidence urged by the Fathers for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church, and the power of cofirmation
by many Councells, and Fathers <hi>appropriated</hi> to

are not only Doctors teaching their owne opinion,

attest it as done by a Catholike consent; and no

power <hi>Apostolicall</hi> in the <hi>Originall, Episcopall</hi> in

have them all one in office with Presbyters, as at
first they were in Name; and they had need bath
up to the Chinne; but some stand shallower, and
grant a little distinction, a precedency perhaps for
order sake, but no preheminence in reiglement, no
superiority of Iurisdiction; Others by all meanes
would be thought to be quite thorough in behalfe
of <hi>Bishops</hi> order, and power such as it is, but call for
a reduction to the primitive state, and would have
all Bishops like the Primitive, but because by this

the more primitive the testimonies are, the greater
exaction of obedience to Bishops; for it happened in
this, as in all other things; at first, Christians were
more devout more pursuing of their duties, more
zealous in attestation of every particle of their
faith; and that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is now come to so low an
ebbe, it is nothing, but that it being a great part of
Christianity to honour, and obey them, it hath the

you, which the Bishop mislikes, for all such things
are wicked, and in enemity with God.</q> * But it seems
S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was mightily in love with this precept,
for he gives it to almost all the Churches he writes
to. Wee have already reckon'd the <hi>Trallians,</hi> and

is to be understood according to the sense of
the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> to be in all things of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

he gives a charge to S. <hi>Polycarpe</hi> their <hi>Bishop;</hi> that he
also look to it, that nothing be done without his
leave. <hi>Nihil sine</hi> TUO ARBITRIO <hi>agatur, nec item

               <hi>Vedelius,</hi> a man who is no waies to be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

who reckon the first seven out of which I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

now I will make this use of it; Those men that call
for reduction of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to the Primitive state,
should doe well to stand close to their principles,
and count that the best <hi>Episcopacy</hi> which is first; and
then consider but what S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> hath told us for
direction in this affaire, and see what is gotten in
the bargaine. For my part, since they that call for
such a reduction hope to gaine by it, and then
would most certainly have abidden by it, I think it
not reasonable to abate any thing of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his
height, but expect such subordination and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the <hi>Bishop</hi> as he then knew to be a <hi>law of
Christianity.</hi> But let this be remembred all along,

there is no Government at all, or the <hi>Laity</hi> must

say there is no Government, is to leave the Church
in worse condition then a tyranny. To say that the
Laity should governe the Church, when all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
Ministeries are committed to the Clergy,
is to say, Scripture means not what it saies; for it is


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100408:118"/>
to say, that the Clergy must be <hi>Praepositi,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

spirit called Presidents or Prelates, and that it is not
in them who are called so. * In the mean time if
the Laity in matters Spirituall are inferior to the
Clergy, and must in things pertaining to the Soule
be rul'd by them, with whom their Soules are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted;
then also much rather they must obey those
of the Clergy, to whom all the other Clergy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are bound to be obedient. Now since by the
frequent precept of so many Councells, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Deacons and Presbyters must submit in
all things to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> much more must the Laity,
and since the <hi>Bishop</hi> must rule in chiefe, and the
Presbyters at the most can but rule in conjunction,

have power of inflicting censures both upon the

of the Generall Councells of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of

and hath power of censures, and therefore a

            <p>This thing only by the way; in all these <hi>Canons</hi>
there is no mention made of any <hi>Presbyters assistant</hi>

            <p>* Now we may see these Canons attested by

the man whom I would choose in all the world to

if he reserves the Superiority of jurisdiction to the

they ought to have ask'd the <hi>Bishops</hi> leave, <hi>Sicut

authority over them; for tyranny is the excesse of
power, &amp; authority is the subject matter of rigour,

for a spirituall end, <hi>viz</hi> the regiment of the Church,
and the good of soules, and therefore only those
things which are in this order are of Episcopall cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance.
And what things are those?</p>
            <p>1. Then, it is certaine that since Christ hath
pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>essed, his Kingdome is not of this world, that

            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Qui regna dat Coelestia.</hi> So the Church
us'd to sing. Whatsoever therefore the secular tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
did take cognisance of before it was Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
the same it takes notice of after it is Christ'ned.
And these are; all actions civill, all publike violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of justice, all breach of Municipall lawes. These
the Church hath nothing to doe with, unlesse by the


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100408:127"/>
favour of Princes and common-wealths it be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to them <hi>in honorem Dei &amp;</hi> S. <hi>Matris Ecclesiae;</hi>
but then when it is once indulged, that act which
does annull such pious vowes, is just contrary to that
religion which first gave them, and then unlesse
there was sinne in the donative, the ablation of it is
<hi>contra honorem Dei &amp;</hi> S. <hi>Matris Ecclesiae.</hi> But this
it may be is impertinent.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Bishops</hi> ALL, comes in after this; And
he is judge of all those causes which Christianity
hath brought in upon a new stock, by it's <hi>new distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Principles.</hi> I say, by it's <hi>new Principles;</hi> for
there where it extends justice, and pursues the lawes
of nature, there the secular tribunall is also extended
if it be Christian; The <hi>Bishop</hi> gets nothing of that:
But those things which Christianity (as it prescinds
from the interest of the republike) hath introduc'd
all them, and all the causes emergent from them the
<hi>Bishop</hi> is judge of. Such are causes of <hi>faith, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Sacramentals, subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of inferiour Clergy to their Superiour, censures,
irregularities, Orders hierarchicall, rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
liturgyes, and publike formes of prayer,</hi> (as is
famous in the Ancient story of <hi>Ignatius</hi> teaching
his Church the first use of <hi>Antiphona's</hi> and <hi>Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">tripart. hist. lib. 10. cap. 9.</note> and thence was deriv'd to all Churches of
Christendome) and all such things as are in imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
dependance of these, as <hi>dispensation</hi> of Church
<hi>Vessels,</hi> and <hi>Ornaments,</hi> and <hi>Goods,</hi> receiving and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Patrimony of the Church, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is of the same consideration, according to the


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100408:128"/>
41 <hi>Canon of the Apostles. Praecipimus ut in potestate
suâ Episcopus Ecclesiae res habeat. Let the Bishop
have the disposing the goods of the Church;</hi> adding
this reason. <hi>Si enim animae hominum pretiosae illi
sint credita, multò magis eum oportet curam pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
gerere. He that is intrusted with our pretious
soules, may much more be intrusted with the offertoryes
of faithfull people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. There are some things of a mixt nature; and
something of the secular interest, and something of
the Ecclesiasticall concurre to their constitution, and
these are of double cognisance: the secular power,
and the Ecclesiasticall doe both in their severall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
take knowledge of them. Such are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquencyes
of Clergy-men, who are both Clergy,
and subjects too; <hi>Clerus Domini,</hi> and <hi>Regis subditi;</hi>
and for their delinquencyes which are <hi>in materiâ
justitiae</hi> the secular tribunall punishes as being a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
of that right which the State must defend,
but because done by a person who is a member of
the sacred hierarchy, and hath also an obligation of
speciall duty to his <hi>Bishop,</hi> therefore the <hi>Bishop</hi> also
may punish him; And when the commonwealth
hath inflicted a penalty, the <hi>Bishop</hi> also may impose
a censure, for every sinne of a Clergy-man is two.
But of this nature also are the convening of Synods,
the power whereof is in the <hi>King,</hi> and in the <hi>Bishop</hi>
severally, insomuch as both the Church and the
commonwealth in their severall respects have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
interest; The commonwealth for preservation
of peace and charity, in which religion hath the


<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100408:128"/>
deepest interest; and the Church, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of faith. And therefore both Prince and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
have indicted Synods in severall ages, upon the
exigence of severall occasions, and have severall
powers for the engagement of Clericall obedience,
and attendance upon such solemnities.</p>
            <p>4. Because Christianity is after the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and is a capacity superadded to it, therefore
those things which are of mixt cognisance are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>King;</hi> The <hi>Supremacy</hi> here is his, and so it
is in all things of this nature, which are called [<hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi>]
because they are <hi>in materiâ Ecclesiae, ad
finem religionis,</hi> but they are of a different nature,
and use from things [<hi>Spirituall</hi>] because they are
not issues of those things which Christianity hath
introduc'd <hi>de integro,</hi> and are separate from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the commonwealth in it's particular capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
for such things only, are properly spirituall.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Bishops</hi> jurisdiction hath a compulsory
deriv'd from Christ only, <hi>viz.</hi> infliction of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
by excommunications, or other <hi>minores plagae</hi>
which are in order to it. But yet this internall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsory
through the duty of good Princes to God,
and their favour to the Church, is assisted by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
arme, either superadding a temporall penalty
in case of contumacy, or some other way abetting
the censures of the Church, and it ever was so since
commonwealths were Christian. So that ever since
then, Episcopall Iurisdiction hath a double part; an
externall, and an internall; this is deriv'd from
Christ, that from the King, which because it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100408:129"/>
in all acts of Iurisdiction, therefore it is, that
the King is supreme of the Iurisdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that
part of it which is the externall compulsory.</p>
            <p>* And for this cause we shall sometimes see the
Emperour, or his Prefect, or any man of consular
dignity sit Iudge when the Question is of Faith, not
that the Prefect was to Iudge of that, or that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
were not; But in case of the pervicacy of a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
heretick who would not submitt to the power
of the Church, but flew to the secular power for
assistance, hoping by taking sanctuary there, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the favour of the Prince: In this case the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
also appealed thither, not for resolution, but
assistance, and sustentation of the Church's power.
* It was so in the case of <hi>Aëtius</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi>
the Prefect,<note place="margin">Tripart. hist. lib. 5. c. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Constantius</hi> being Emperour. For,
all that the Prefect did, or the Emperour in this case,
was by the prevalency of his intervening authority
to reconcile the disagreeing parties, and to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

matters of faith, for they despayring of their cause

            <p>And now upon this occasion, I have faire oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity


<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100408:130"/>
to insert a consideration, The <hi>Bishops</hi> have
power over all causes emergent in their diocesses;
all, (I meane) in the sense above explicated; they
have power to inflict censures, excommunication is
the highest, the rest are parts of it, and in order to it.
Whether or no must Church-censures be used in all
such causes as they take cognisance of, or may not
the secular power find our some externall compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory
in stead of it, and forbid the Church to use ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
in certaine cases?</p>
            <p>1. To this, I answer, that if they be such cases in
which by the law of Christ they may, or such in
which they must use excommunication, then, in
these cases no power can forbid them. For what
power Christ hath given them, no man can take
away.</p>
            <p>2. As no humane power can disrobe the Church
of the power of excommunication; so no humane
power can invest the Church with a lay Compulso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For if the Church be not capable of a <hi>jus gladij,</hi>
as most certainly shee is not, the Church cannot
receive power to put men to death, or to inflict
lesser paines in order to it, or any thing above a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary
penance, I meane in the formality of a
Church-tribunall, then they give the Church what
shee must not, cannot take. I deny not but Clergy
men are as capable of the power of life and death,
as any men; but not in the formality of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
A Court of life and death, cannot be an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
tribunall; and then if any man, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Men should perswade the Church not to


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100408:131"/>
inflict her censures upon delinquents, in some cases
in which shee might lawfully inflict them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to give her another compulsory; they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Church-consistory, and erect a very secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Court, dependant on themselves, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to be appeal'd to from themselves, and so
also to be prohibited as the Lay-Superiour shall see
cause for. * Whoever therefore should be consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to any such permutation of power, is <hi>traditor

of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour for the choice
of a Successor to <hi>Auxentius</hi> in the See of <hi>Millayne,</hi>

that we who rule the Kingdome may sincerely submitt

* And since all power is deriv'd from Christ,
who is a King, and a Priest, and a Prophet, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

* So that the King hath a Supreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
power in causes of the Church, ever since his
Kingdome became Christian, and it consists in all
things, in which the Priestly office is not precisely
by Gods law imployed for regiment, and cure of
soules, and in these also, all the externall compulso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and jurisdiction in his owne. For when his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
became Christian Subjects, himselfe also upon
the same termes becomes a Christian Ruler, and in
both capacities he is to rule, viz: both as Subjects,
and as Christian Subjects, except only in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
issues of Sacerdotall authority. And therefore


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100408:132"/>
the Kingdome, and the Priesthood are excelled by
each other in their severall capacities. For superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is usually expressed in three words, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>It was a famous contestation that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> had

were so distinct, that they made no intrenchment

the communion to <hi>Theodosius,</hi>

was a wonderfull concurrence of piety in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and resolution and authority in the <hi>Bishop.</hi>
But he was not the first that did it; For <hi>Philip</hi> the

never been more errour in the managing Church-censures,
then in the foregoing instances, the
Church might have exercised censures, and all the
parts of power that Christ gave her, without either
scandall or danger to her selfe, or her penitents.
But when in the very censure of excommunication
there is a new ingredient put, a great proportion of
secular inconveniences, and humane interest, when
excommunications, as in the Apostles times they
were deliverings over to Satan, so now, shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverings

over to a forraine enemy, or the peoples
rage; as then, to be buffeted, so now to be deposed,
or disinterest in the allegeance of subjects; in these
cases, excommunication being nothing like that
which Christ authorized, and no way cooperating
toward the end of its institution, but to an end of
private designes, and rebellious interest, <hi>Bishops</hi>
have no power of such censures, not is it lawfull to
inflict the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, things remaining in that consistence, and
capacity. And thus is that famous saying to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood

This use only I make of it. Although Christ hath
given great authority to his Church in order to the
regiment of soules, such a power, <hi>quae nullis poterit

a proper cognisance, <hi>viz. things spirituall,</hi> and the
emergencies, and consequents from those things
which Christianity hath introduced <hi>de novo,</hi> and
superadded, as things totally disparate from the
precise interest of the Common-wealth; And this
I the rather noted, to show how those men would
mend themselves that cry downe the tyranny (as

is heavier then the loynes, nay then the whole body
of <hi>Episcopacy;</hi> but it seldome happens otherwise,
but that they who usurpe a power, prove tyrants in
the execution, whereas the issues of a lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

            <p>BUT I must proceed to the more <hi>particular</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of <hi>Episcopall</hi> Iurisdiction.<note place="margin">§ 37. Forbidding Presbyters to officiate without E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall license,</note> The whole
power of Ministration both of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments

in the <hi>Presbyters</hi> by <hi>commission</hi> and <hi>delegation,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they might not exercise any ordinary
ministration without license from the <hi>Bishop.</hi> They
had power and capacity by their order to Preach,
to Minister, to Offer, to Reconcile, and to Baptize.
They were indeed acts of order, but that they
might not by the law of the Church exercise any of
these acts, without license from the <hi>Bishop,</hi> that is an
act or issue of jurisdiction, and shewes the superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

            <p>* I doe not here dispute the matter of <hi>right,</hi> and
whether or no the Presbyters might <hi>de jure</hi> doe any

no <hi>de facto</hi> it was permitted them in the primitive
Church? This is sufficient to show, to what issue
the reduction of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to a primitive consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
will drive; and if I mistake not, it is at least a
very probable determination of the question of
<hi>right</hi> too. For who will imagine that <hi>Bishops</hi> should
at the first in the calenture of their infant devotion,
in the new spring of Christianity, in the times of
persecution, in all the publike disadvantages of state
and fortune, when they anchor'd only upon the
shore of a Holy Conscience, that then they should
have thoughts ambitious, incroaching, of usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and advantages, of purpose to devest their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of an authority intrusted them by Christ, and
then too when all the advantage of their honour
did only set them upon a hill to feele a stronger
blast of persecution, and was not, as since it hath
been, attested with secular assistance, and faire argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

estimate, and ten thousand reall disadvantages. This

The place is of great consideration, and carries in
it its own objection and its answer. <q>The Bishop
hath the right of giving baptisme. Then after him,

Presbyters and Deacons, but not without the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Bishop. (So farre the testimony is
clear) and this is <hi>for the honour of the Church.</hi>
               </q> *
But does not this intimate it was only by <hi>positive</hi>
constitution, and neither by <hi>Divine</hi> nor <hi>Apostolicall</hi>
ordinance? No indeed. It does not. For it might
be so ordained by Christ or his Apostles <hi>propter ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norem
Ecclesia;</hi> and no harme done. For it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
for the Church, that her Ministrations
should be most ordinate, and so they are when they
descend from the superior to the subordinate. But
the next words doe of themselves make answer,
[<hi>Otherwise lay-men have right to baptize</hi>] That is,
<hi>without the consent of the Bishop Lay-men can doe it
as much as Presbyters and Deacons.</hi> For indeed bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
conferred by Lay-men is valid and not to bee
repeated, but yet they ought not to administer it,
so neither ought <hi>Presbyters</hi> without the <hi>Bishops</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense:
so saies <hi>Tertullian,</hi> let him answer it. Only the
difference is this, Lay-men cannot <hi>jure ordinario</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a leave or commission to make it lawfull in
them to baptize any; Presbyters and Deacons may,
for their order is a capacity or possibility. ** But

<hi>exercise</hi> this without designation of a particular
charge either temporary or fixt. And therefore it
is, that a <hi>Presbyter</hi> may not doe these acts without
the <hi>Bishops</hi> leave, because they are actions of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and suppose a congregation to whom they must

he have a Chrysome Child, or a Catechumen;
So that <hi>all</hi> of the Diocesse being the <hi>Bishop's</hi> charge,

Not that the <hi>Bishop</hi> did license the acts precisely of

him a subject to whom he might apply these rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

of the Diocesse is in the <hi>Bishop,</hi> he cannot exonerate
himselfe of it, for it is a burden of Christs impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,

might doe it, I doe not say <hi>without leave,</hi> but I say
they had leave given them, when the <hi>Bishop</hi> sent
them to officiate in a Village with ordinary or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
residence; as it is to this day, when the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
institutes to a particular charge, he also gives
power <hi>hoc ipso,</hi> of officiating in that place. So that
at first when they did officiate in places by <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
missions,</hi> then they were to have leave, but this <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense</hi>
was also <hi>temporary;</hi> but when they were fixt
upon <hi>ordinary charges</hi> they might not officiate
without leave, but then they had an <hi>ordinary leave</hi>
given them <hi>in traditione subditorum,</hi> and that was
done <hi>in subsidium Muneres Episcopalis,</hi> because it
was that part of the <hi>Bishops</hi> charge, which he could
not personally attend for execution of the <hi>Minor</hi>
offices, and therefore concredited it to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
but if he was present, a <hi>new leave</hi> was necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as the <hi>power</hi> alwaies was in the <hi>Bishop,</hi> so now
the <hi>execution</hi> also did returne to him when he was
there in person, himselfe if he listed, might offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate.</p>
            <p>All this is excellently attested in the example of
S. <hi>Austin,</hi> of whom <hi>Possidonius</hi> in his life reports
that being but a <hi>Presbyter, Valerius</hi> the Bishop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Greek borne, and not well spoken in the Latin
tongue, and so unfit for publike orations, <hi>eidem
Presbytero (viz.</hi> to <hi>Austin) potestatem dedit coram
se in Ecclesiâ Evangelium praedicandi, ac frequentis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simè
tractandi contra.</hi> USUM <hi>quidem, &amp;</hi> CONSUE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUDINEM
<hi>Africanarum Ecclesiarum. He gave leave
to Austin then but Presbyter, to preach in the Church,


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100408:140"/>
even while himselfe was present, indeed against the</hi>
VSE <hi>and</hi> CUSTOME <hi>of the African Churches.</hi> And
for this act of his he suffered soundly in his report.
* For the case was thus. In all <hi>Africa</hi> ever since the
first spring of the <hi>Arian</hi> heresy, the Church had
then suffered so much by the preaching of <hi>Arius</hi> the
<hi>Presbyter,</hi> that they made a Law not to suffer any
<hi>Presbyter</hi> to preach at all, at least in the <hi>Mother
Church,</hi> and in the Bishops presence. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

(saith <hi>Socrates.</hi>)<note place="margin">Lib. 5. c. 22.</note>
               <hi>Thence came this Custome in the African Churches.</hi>
But because <hi>Valerius</hi> saw S. <hi>Austin</hi> so able, and
himselfe for want of Latin so unfit, he gave leave to
<hi>Austin</hi> to preach before him, against the <hi>Custome</hi> of
the <hi>African</hi> Churches. But he addes this reason for
his excuse too; it was not indeed the custome of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
but it was of the Orientall Churches. For so
<hi>Possidonius</hi> proceeds, <hi>sed &amp; ille vir venerabilis, ac
providus, in orientalibus Ecclesiis id ex more fieri sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi>
in the Levant it was usuall for <hi>Bishops</hi> to give
Presbyters leave to preach, <hi>dummodò factitaretur à
Presbytero quod à se Episcopo impleri minimè posse
cernebat,</hi> which determines us fully in the businesse.
For this leave to doe offices was but there to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
where the Bishop himselfe could not fulfill the
offices, which showes the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
charges, whether of temporary mission, or fixt
residence, to be but Delegates, and Vicars of the
Bishop admitted <hi>in partem Sollicitudinis,</hi> to assist
the Bishop in his great charge of the whole Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:100408:140"/>
Against this it is objected out of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Rustic. Narbon. dist. 95. can. Ecce ego.</note> and
it is recorded by <hi>Gratian, Ecce ego dico praesentibus

may minister Sacraments in presence of the Bishop.</hi>
So <hi>Gratian</hi> quotes it indeed, but S. <hi>Hierome</hi> saies
the expresse contrary, unlesse we all have false co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.
For in S. <hi>Hierome</hi> it is not [<hi>Ecce ego dico</hi>] but
[<hi>Nec ego dico.</hi>] He does not say it is lawfull for Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
to officiate in the presence of their <hi>Bishop.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> is angry at <hi>Rusticus Bishop of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona</hi>
because he would not <hi>give leave</hi> to Presbyters
to preach, nor to blesse &amp;c. This, perhaps it was
not well done, but this makes not against the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
discourse; for though it may be fit for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to give leave, the Church requiring it still
more and more in descent of ages, and multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christians, and Parishes, yet it is cleare that
this is not to be done without the Bishops leave, for
it is for this very thing that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Rusticus,</hi> to show he did amisse, because he
would not give his Presbyters license. * And this
he also reprehends in his epistle <hi>ad Nepotianum, Pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simae
consuetudinis est in quibusdam Ecclesiis tacere
Presbyteros, &amp; praesentibus Episcopis non loqui.
That Presbyters might not be suffered to preach in
presence of the Bishop, that was an ill custome,</hi> to wit,
as things then stood, and it was mended presently
after, for Presbyters did preach in the Bishops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
but it was <hi>by license from their Ordinary.</hi> For
so <hi>Possidonius</hi> relates, that upon this act of <hi>Valerius</hi>


               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:100408:141"/>
before mentioned, <hi>Posteà currente &amp; volante hujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi
famâ, bono praecedente exemplo,</hi> ACCEPTA AB
EPISCOPIS POTESTATE <hi>Presbyteri nonnulli coram
Episcopis, populis tractare caeperunt verbum Dei.</hi> By
occasion of this precedent it came to passe, that
some Presbyters did preach to the people in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
presence, having first obtain'd faculty from
the Bishop so to doe. And a little after it became a
custome from a generall faculty and dispensation
indulged to them in the second Councell of <hi>Vase.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Now if this evidence of Church practise be not
sufficient to reconcile us to S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> let him then
first be reconciled to himselfe, and then we are sure
to be help'd. For in his dialogue against the <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferians,</hi>
his words are these, <hi>Cui si non exors quaedam

            <p>** This whole discourse showes clearely not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Bishops to be superiour in jurisdiction, but

severall manner of election; Presbyters and inferior

lastly, because of late, strong outcries are made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
severall pretensions, amongst which the people
make the biggest noise, though of all, their title to
election of Clerks be most empty, therefore let us
consider it upon all its grounds.</p>

there can be no hurt done by the objection, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
since clearely and indubiously the election of
<hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> was in the <hi>Apostles</hi> owne
persons (<gap reason="foreign">

it to others that were <hi>Bishops,</hi> as in the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before reckoned. Thus the case stood in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>2. In the practice of the Church it went accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the same law, and practice <hi>Apostolicall.</hi> The
People did not, might not choose the Ministers of
holy Church.<note place="margin">Gan. 13.</note> So the Councell of <hi>Laodicea, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
The people must not choose those
that are to be promoted to the Priesthood.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
extends to their Non-election of all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Clergy, <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters.</hi> But who
then must elect them? The Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
that, for in 16 and 17 Canons the Councell
forbids any promotion of Clerks to be made, but
by the Bishop of that Church where they are first
ordayned, which clearely reserves to the <hi>Bishop</hi> the
power of retayning, or promoting all his Clergy.</p>
            <p>* 3. All Ordinations were made by <hi>Bishops</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
(as I have already prooved.) Now let this be
confronted with the practice of Primitive Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that no Presbyter might be ordain'd <hi>sine
titulo</hi> without a particular charge, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
custome, and at last grew to be a law in the


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100408:144"/>
Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and we shall perceive that
the ordainer was the onely chooser; for then to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
a Presbyter was also to give him a charge;
and the Patronage of a Church was not a lay inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
but part of the <hi>Bishops</hi> cure, for he had
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the care of the
Churches in all the Diocesse;</hi> as I have already showne.
And therefore when S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of Christendome,<note place="margin">Epist. 61. &amp; 62.</note> had specified some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ordinations or election of Presbyters by <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
as how himselfe was made Priest by <hi>Paulinus,</hi>

thing is evident and notorious; And there is scarce


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100408:145"/>
any example in Antiquity of either Presbyters, or
people choosing any Priest, but only in the case of

shewed elsewhere.</p>
            <p>4. In election of <hi>Bishops</hi> (though not of Priests)
the Clergy and the people had a greater actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and did often intervene with their silent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
suffrages, or publike acclamations. But first;
This was not necessary. It was otherwise among
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and in the case of <hi>Timothy,</hi> of <hi>Titus,</hi> of
S. <hi>Iames,</hi> of S. <hi>Marke,</hi> and all the Successors whom
they did constitute in the severall chayres. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. This
was not by law, or right, but in fact only. It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Canon of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Councell, and the

            <p>Against this discourse S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is strongly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.<note place="margin">Epist. 68.</note>

must have a good report of all men</hi>] that is indeed a
divine institution, and that to this purpose, and for
the publike attestation of the act of election and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
the peoples presence was required, appeares
clearely by S. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> discourse in this Epistle.
For what is the <hi>divine authority</hi> that he mentions?
It is only the example of <hi>Moses</hi> whom God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to take the Sonne of <hi>Eleazer</hi> and cloath him
with his Fathers robes <hi>coram omni Synagogâ, before
all the congregation.</hi> The people chose not, God
chose <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> consecrated him, and the
people stood, and look'd on; that's all that this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can supply. * Iust thus <hi>Bishops</hi> are, and ever
were ordayn'd, <hi>non nisi sub populi assistentis conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ,
in the sight of the people standing by;</hi> but to what
end? <hi>Vt plebe praesente detegantur malorum crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
vel bonorum merita praedicentur.</hi> All this while
the election is not in the people, nothing but the


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100408:146"/>
publike testimony, and examination, for so it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<hi>&amp; sit ordinatio justa &amp; legitima quae omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
suffragio, &amp; judicio fuerit examinata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>** But S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath two more proof's whence
we may learne either the sense, or the truth of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.
The one is of the <hi>Apostles</hi> ordayning the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Deacons (but this we have already examin'd,)
the other of S. <hi>Peter</hi> choosing S. <hi>Matthias</hi> into the
<hi>Apostolate;</hi> it was indeed done in the presence of the
people. * But here it is considerable that at this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
of S. <hi>Matthias</hi> the Number of the persons
present was but 120, of which eleven were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and 72 were Disciples and Presbyters, they
make up 83, and then there remaines but 37 of the
Laity, of which many were women, which I know
not yet whether any man would admitt to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of an <hi>Apostle,</hi> and whether they doe or doe
not, the Laity is a very inconsiderable Number if
the matter had beene to be carried by plurality of
voices; so that let the worst come that is imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the whole businesse was in effect carried by the
Clergy, whom in this case we have no reason to
suspect to be divided, and of a distinct, or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
interest.* 2. Let this discourse be of what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
it will, yet all this whole businesse was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
and extraordinary; For though the <hi>Apostles</hi>
nam'd two Candidates yet the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> chose
them by particular revelation. And yet for all this,
it was lawfull for S. <hi>Peter</hi> alone to have done it
without casting lots. <hi>An non licebatipsi [Petro] e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere?

<hi>Chrysostome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now, if S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> meanes more then the
presence of the people for suffrage of publike testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
&amp; extends it to a suffrage of formall choice,
his proofes of the divine authority are invalid, there
is no such thing can be deduc'd from thence, and
then this is his <hi>complying so much with the people</hi>
(which hath beene the fault of many a good man)
may be reckon'd together with his <hi>rebaptization.</hi>
But truth is, he meanes no more then suffrage of
testimony, viz: That he who is to be chosen <hi>Bishop</hi>
be for his good life a man of good fame, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of before God and all the people, and this is all
the share they have in their election. * And so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
himselfe summes up the whole businesse and
tells us of another <hi>jus Divinum</hi> too. [<hi>Propter quod

<q>It is most diligently to be observed, for there
is a Divine tradition, and an Apostolicall ordinance
for it, and it is us'd by us and almost by all Churches,
that all the Bishops of the Province assemble to the


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100408:147"/>
making of right ordinations, and that a Bishop be
chosen in the face of the people who best know their
life and conversation.</q>
               </hi>] So that the <hi>Bishops</hi> were
to make the formall election, the people to give their
judgement of approbation <hi>in this particular,</hi> and so
much as concern'd the exemplary piety, and good
life of him that was to be their <hi>Bishop.</hi> Here we see
in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is a <hi>jus Divinum</hi> for the <hi>Bishops</hi> choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a Collegue, or a Brother-<hi>Bishop,</hi> as much as
for the presence of the people, and yet the presence
was all. And howsoever the people were present
to give this testimony, yet the election was cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and that by <hi>Divine tradition,</hi> and
<hi>Apostolicall observation</hi> saith S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> And thus
it was in all Churches almost.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Africa</hi> this was,<note place="margin">Epist. 120. lib. 3. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerd.</note> and so it continued till after

should be present, and give acclamation, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary
approbation; but to the formall election
of the Clergy, made by enumeration of votes and
subscription, the people never were admitted.</p>
            <p>5. Although that in times of persecution, at first,
and to comply with the people who were in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to be sweetned, to make them with easier ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
swallow the bitter pill of persecution, and also
to make them more obedient to their <hi>Bishop,</hi> if they

(as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> expresses this case,) it
was ordinary to doe so in many Churches.</p>
            <p>7. The manner of election in many Churches was
various, for although indeed the Church had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it, and given power to the Bishops to make
the election, yet in some times and in some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
the Presbyters, or the Chapter, chose one out
of themselves. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> saies they alwaies did
so in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from S. <hi>Markes</hi> time to <hi>Heraclas</hi>
and <hi>Dionysius.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Ephes. 4.</note> * S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saies that at the first,

one dyed so the next senior did succeed him.</hi> In both
these cases no mixture of the peoples votes.</p>
            <p>8. In the Church of <hi>England</hi> the people were

first becoming Christian to this very day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to take it from the Clergy, in whom it alwaies
was by permission of Princes, and to interest the
people in it, is to recede <hi>à traditionibus Majorum,</hi>
from the religion of our forefathers, and to INNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATE
in a high proportion.</p>
            <p>9. In those Churches where the peoples suffrage


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100408:149"/>
(by way of testimony, I meane, and approbation)
did concurre with the Synod of <hi>Bishops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in the
choyce of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> the people at last according to
their usuall guise grew hot, angry, and tumultuous,
and then were ingaged by divisions in religion to
Name a <hi>Bishop</hi> of their own sect; and to disgrace
one another by publike scandall, and contestation,
and often grew up to Sedition, and Murder; and
therefore although they were never admitted, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
where themselves usurped) farther then I have
declared, yet even this was taken from them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
since in tumultuary assemblies, they were apt
to carry all before them, they knew not how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between power, and right, they had not
well learn'd to take deniall, but began to obtrude
whom they listed, to swell higher like a torrent
when they were check'd; and the soleship of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which by the Ancient Canons was in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
they would have asserted wholly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

seditions and tumults, the Fathers decreed that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100408:149"/>
should be chosen by the authority of the Bishops of
the Province.</hi> And he addes that in the election of
<hi>Damasus</hi> 137 men were slaine, and that sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

            <p>Truth is, the Nomination of <hi>Bishops</hi> in Scripture
was in the <hi>Apostles</hi> alone, and though the Kindred
of our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> were admitted to the choyce
of <hi>Simeon Cleophae,</hi> the Successor of S. <hi>Iames</hi> to the
Bishoprick of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> witnesses;<note place="margin">lib. 3. hist. cap. 11.</note> it was
<hi>propter singularem honorem,</hi> an honorary, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
priviledge indulged to them for their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity
and relation to our Blessed Lord the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of all benison to us; and for that very reason
<hi>Simeon</hi> himselfe was chosen <hi>Bishop</hi> too. Yet this
was <hi>praeter regulam Apostolicam.</hi> The rule of the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> and their precedents were for the sole right
of the <hi>Bishops</hi> to choose their Colleagues in that
Sacred order. * And then in descent, even before
the <hi>Nicene Councell</hi> the people were forbidden to
meddle in election, for they had no authority by
Scripture to choose; by the necessity of times and
for the reasons before asserted they were admitted
to such a share of the choyce as is now folded up in
a peice of paper, even to a testimoniall; and yet I
deny not but they did often take more as in the
case of <hi>Nilammon, quem cives elegerunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tripart. hist. lib. 10. c. 14.</note> saith
the story out of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> they chose him alone,
(though God took away his life before himselfe
would accept of their choyce) and then they
behav'd themselves oftentimes with so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency,


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100408:150"/>
partiality, faction, sedition, cruelty, and
Pagan basenesse that they were quite interdicted it,
above 1200 yeares agone. * So that they had their
little in possession but a little while, and never had
any due, and therefore now, their request for it is no
petition of right,<note place="margin">vide dist. 63. per tot. Gratian.</note> but a popular ambition and a
snatching at a sword to hew the Church in peices.</p>
            <p>But I thinke I need not have troubled my selfe
halfe so farre, for they that strive to introduce a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
election, would as faine have <hi>Episcopacy</hi> out,
as popularity of election let in. So that all this of
popular election of <hi>Bishops,</hi> may seeme superfluous.
For I consider, that if the peoples power of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Bishops</hi> be founded upon <hi>Gods law,</hi> as some men
pretend from S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (not proving the thing
from Gods law, but Gods law from S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>)
then <hi>Bishops</hi> themselves must be by <hi>Gods law:</hi> For
surely God never gave them power to choose any
man into that office which himselfe hath no way
instituted. And therefore I suppose these men will
desist from their pretence of <hi>Divine right of popular
election,</hi> if the Church will recede from her <hi>divine
right of Episcopacy.</hi> But for all their plundering, and
confounding, their bold pretences have made this
discourse necessary.</p>
            <p>IF we adde to all these foregoing particulars the
power of making lawes to be in <hi>Bishops,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ 41. Bishops onely did Vote in Councells and neither Presbyters, nor People.</note> nothing
else can be required to the making up of a spirituall
Principality. Now as I have shewne that the <hi>Bishop</hi>
of every Diocesse did give lawes to his owne


<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100408:150"/>
Church for particulars, so it is evident that the lawes
of Provinces and of the Catholike Church, were
made by conventions of Bishops without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
or concurrence of Presbyters, or any else
for sentence and decision.</p>
            <p>The instances of this are just so many as there are
Councells. S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> reprehending <hi>Constantius</hi>
the <hi>Arian</hi> for interposing in the Conciliary deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations

it is true, unlesse where God himselfe hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
the care of others in a body, as he hath in
the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and will require the soules of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

whom he hath set over us. And therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of Councells pertains to all,<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> and is
handled by all, not in diffusion but in representation.
For, <hi>Ecclesia est in Episcopo, &amp; Episcopus in Ecclesiâ,</hi>
(saith <hi>S. Cyprian) the Church is in the Bishop (viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 69.</note>
by representment) <hi>and the Bishop is in the Church</hi>
(<hi>viz.</hi> as a Pilot in a ship, or a Master in a family, or
rather as a steward, and Guardian to rule in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
absence) and for this reason the <hi>Synod</hi> of the

               <hi>Nicene Bishops</hi> is called (in <hi>Eusebius) conventus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis

not that the whole Church was there present
in their severall persons, but was there represented
by the Catholike <hi>Bishops,</hi> and if this representment
be not sufficient for obligation to all, I see no reason
but the Ladyes too, may vote in Councells, for I
doubt not, but they have soules too.</p>
            <p>But however, if this argument were concluding
in it selfe, yet it looses its force in <hi>England,</hi> where
the Clergy are bound by Lawes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and
yet in the capacity of Clergy-men are allowed to
choose neither Procurators to represent us as Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,

where the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and ELDERS did meet together
to DETERMINE of the question of circumcision.

for all that were not of the number of the twelve,
<hi>Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors,</hi> and <hi>Doctors.</hi> And
then secondly, it is <hi>none at all,</hi> because <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> are signally, and by name reckoned as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the Synod, and one of them Prolocutor, or
else both. So that such Presbyters may well define
in such conventuall assemblies. 3. If yet there were
any difficulty latent in the story, yet the Catholick

BRETHREN, that is, all the <hi>Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,</hi>

of the Churches? There is nothing either in words,
or circumstances to contradict this. If it be ask'd
who then are meant by Elders, if by [<hi>Brethren</hi>] S.
<hi>Luke</hi> understands these Church officers? I answer,
that here is such variety, that although I am not
certain which officers he precisely comprehends
under the distinct titles of Elders, and Brethren, yet
here are enough to furnish both with variety, and
yet neither to admit <hi>meere Presbyters</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
acceptation of the word, nor yet the <hi>Laity

out the last appellative sufficiently. But however
without any further trouble it is evident, that this
word [<hi>Brethren</hi>] does not distinguish the Laity
from the Clergy. [<hi>Now when they heard this, they
were pricked in their hearts, and said unto</hi> PETER,

But these things are too known to need a multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of instances.</p>
            <p>The summe is this. The question was, whether
or no, and how farre the <hi>Bishops</hi> had <hi>Superiority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Presbyters</hi> in the Primitive Church. Their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and practice have furnished us with these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
The power of Church goods, and the sole
dispensation of them, and a propriety of persons
was reserved to the Bishop. For the Clergy, and
Church possessions were in his power, in his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration:
the Clergy might not travaile without
the Bishops leave: they might not be preferred in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Diocesse without license of their own Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop:
in their own Churches the Bishop had sole
power to preferre them, and they must undertake
the burden of any promotion if he calls them to it:
without him they might not baptize, not conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
the Eucharist, not communicate, not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
penitents, not preach; not onely, not without
his ordination, but not without a speciall faculty
besides the capacity of their order: The Presbyters
were bound to obey their Bishops in their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and canonicall impositions, even by the decree
of the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, and the doctrine of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and the constitution of S. <hi>Clement,</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the Councell of <hi>Arles, Ancyra,</hi> and <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
and many others: The Bishops were declared to
be <hi>Iudges</hi> in ordinary of the Clergy, and people of
their Diocesse by the concurrent suffrages of almost
2000 holy Fathers assembled in <hi>Nice, Ephesus,
Chalcedon,</hi> in <hi>Carthage, Antioch, Sardis, Aquileia,


<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100408:156"/>
Taurinum, Agatho,</hi> and by the Emperour, and by the
<hi>Apostles;</hi> and all this attested by the constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Bishops of the Primitive Church infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
censures upon delinquents, and absolving
them as they saw cause, and by the dogmaticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the old Catholicks declaring in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
and appellatives of the <hi>Episcopall</hi> function
that they haye supreme, and universall spirituall
power, (<hi>viz.</hi> in the sense above explicated) over all
the Clergy and Laity of their Diocesse, as, [<q>that they are higher then all power, the image of God, the figure of Christ, Christs Vicar, President of the
Church, Prince of Priests, of authority incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unparalell'd power,</q>] and many more, if all this be witnesse enough of the superiority of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall</hi>
jurisdiction, we have their depositions, wee
may proceed as we see cause for, and reduce our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy
to the primitive state, for that is truly a
reformation [<hi>id Dominicum quod primum, id hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticum
quod posterius</hi>] and then we shall be sure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy
will loose nothing by these unfortunate
contestations.</p>
            <p>BUT against the cause,<note place="margin">§ 43. Their Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction was over many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, or Parishes,</note> it is objected <hi>super totam
Materiam,</hi> that Bishops were not Diocesan, but
Parochiall, and therefore of so confin'd a jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that perhaps our Village, or Citty Priests shall
advance their Pulpit, as high as the Bishops throne.</p>
            <p>* Well! put case they were not Diocesan, but
parish Bishops, what then? yet they were such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
as had Presbyters, and Deacons in subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100408:157"/>
to them, in all the particular advantages of the
former instances.</p>
            <p>2. If the <hi>Bishops</hi> had the Parishes, what cure had
the <hi>Priests?</hi> so that this will debate the <hi>Priests</hi> as
much as the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and if it will confine a <hi>Bishop</hi> to
a <hi>Parish,</hi> it will make that no <hi>Presbyter</hi> can be so much
as a <hi>Parish-Priest.</hi> If it brings a <hi>Bishop</hi> lower then
a Diocesse, it will bring the <hi>Priest</hi> lower then a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi>
For set a <hi>Bishop</hi> where you will, either in a
<hi>Diocesse,</hi> or a <hi>Parish,</hi> a <hi>Presbyter</hi> shall still keep the
same duty and subordination, the same distance
still. So that this objection upon supposition of the
former discourse, will no way mend the matter for
any side, but make it farre worse, it will not advance
the Presbytery, but it will depresse the whole hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
and all the orders of H. Church.</p>
            <p>* But because, this trifle is so much used amongst
the enimies of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> I will consider it in little,
and besides that it does no body any good advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
I will represent it in it's <hi>fucus</hi> and show the
falsehood of it.</p>
            <p>1. Then. It is evident that there were <hi>Bishops</hi>
before there were any distinct Parishes. For the first
division of Parishes in the West was by <hi>Evaristus,</hi>
who lived almost 100 years after Christ, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Rome into seven parishes,</hi> assigning to every
one a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> So <hi>Damasus</hi> reports of him in the
Pontificall book. <hi>Hic titulos in urbe Româ divisit
Presbyteris, &amp; septem Diaconos ordinavit qui custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirent
Episcopum praedicantem propter stylum veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.
He divided the Parishes, or titles in the City of


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:100408:157"/>
Rome to Presbyters.</hi> The same also is by <hi>Damasus</hi>
reported of <hi>Dionysius</hi> in his life, <hi>hic Presbyteris Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesias

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> &amp; dioeceses
constituit. Marcellus</hi> increased the number in the
yeare 305. <hi>Hic fecit caemiterium viâ Salariâ, &amp; 25
Titulos in urbe Roma constituit quasi dioeceses propter
baptismum, &amp; poenitentiam multorum qui converte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur

He made a Sepulture, or caemitery for the buriall
of Martyrs, and appointed 25. Titles or Parishes:</hi> but
he addes [<hi>quasi Dioeceses</hi>] as it had been diocesses,
that is, distinct and limited to Presbyters, as dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were to <hi>Bishops;</hi> and the use of parishes which he
subjoynes, cleares the businesse; for he appointed
them onely <hi>propter baptismum, &amp; poenitentiam mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
&amp; sepulturas, for baptisme, and penance, and
buriall;</hi> for as yet there was no preaching in Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
but in the Mother-Church. Thus it was in
the West.</p>
            <p>* But in <hi>Aegypt</hi> we find Parishes divided some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
sooner then the earliest of these, for <hi>Eusebius</hi>
reports out of <hi>Philo</hi> that the Christians in S. <hi>Markes</hi>
time had severall Churches in <hi>Alexandria.</hi>

But even before this, there were <hi>Bishops.</hi> For in
Rome there were <hi>fowre Bishops</hi> before any division
of Parishes, though S. <hi>Peter</hi> be reckon'd for none.
And before Parishes were divided in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> S.
<hi>Marke</hi> himselfe who did it was the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time S. <hi>Iames</hi> was <hi>Bishop of Ierusalem,</hi> and


<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100408:158"/>
in diverse other places where <hi>Bishops</hi> were, there
were no distinct Parishes of a while after <hi>Evaristus</hi>
time, for when <hi>Dionysius</hi> had assign'd Presbyters to
severall Parishes, he writes of it to <hi>Severus Bishop of

and publike and great assemblies drew danger upon

their publike offices could not be perform'd with so

            <p>Well then! The case is thus. Parishes were not
divided at first, therefore to be sure they were not of
Divine institution. Therefore it is no divine institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that a Presbyter should be fixt upon a Parish,
therefore also a Parish is not by Christs ordinance
an independant body, for by Christs ordinance there
was no such thing at all, neither absolute, nor in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
neither; and then for the maine issue, since
<hi>Bishops</hi> were before <hi>Parishes</hi> (in the present sense)


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100408:158"/>
the <hi>Bishops</hi> in that sense could not be Parochiall.</p>
            <p>* But which was first of a private congregation,
or a Diocesse? If a private congregation, then a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
was at first fix't in a private congregation, and so
was a Parochiall <hi>Bishop.</hi> If a <hi>Diocesse</hi> was first, then
the Question will be, how a Diocesse could be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Parishes, for what is a Diocesse but a jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over many Parishes?</p>
            <p>* I answer, it is true that DIOCESSE and PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RISH
are words us'd now in contradistinction; And
now, a Diocesse is nothing but the multiplication of
of many Parishes: <hi>Sed non fuit sic ab initio.</hi> For at
first, a <hi>Diocesse was the Citie and the Regio suburbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caria,</hi>
the neighbouring townes, in which there was
no distinction of Parishes: That which was a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in the secular sense, that is, a particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
or division of secular prefecture, that was the
assignation of a <hi>Bishops</hi> charge. * <hi>Ephesus, Smyrna,

regiment. And it was so upon great reason, for
when the regiment of the Church was extended just
so as the regiment of the Common-wealth, it was
of lesse suspition to the secular power, while the
Church regiment was just fixt together with the
politicall, as if of purpose to shew their mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
and it's owne subordination. ** And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, there was in it a necessity; for the subjects
of another Province, or Diocesse could not either
safely, or conveniently meete where the duty of the


<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100408:159"/>
Common-wealth did not ingage them; but being all
of one prefecture, and Diocesse, the necessity of
publike meetings in order to the Common-wealth
would be faire opportunity for the advancement of
their Christendome. And this, which at first was a
necessity in this case, grew to be a law in all, by the
sanction of the Councell of<note n="*" place="margin">Can. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>

<hi>Let the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Church, follow the order and guise of the
Common-wealth, viz.</hi> in her regiment, and prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecture.</p>
            <p>* But in the moderne sense of this division a
Bishops charge was neither a <hi>Parish,</hi> nor a <hi>Diocesse,</hi>
as they are taken in relation; but a Bishop had the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
care of all the Christians which he by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or his Presbyters had converted, and he also
had the charge of indeavouring the conversion of
all the Country. So that although he had not all the
Diocesse actually in communion and subjection, yet
his charge, his Diocesse was so much. Iust as it was
with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> to whom Christ gave all the
world for a Diocesse, yet at first they had but a smal
congregation that did actually obey them.</p>
            <p>And now to the Question. Which was first, a
particular congregation or a Diocesse? I answere,
that a <hi>Diocesse</hi> was first, that is, the <hi>Apostles</hi> had a
charge before they had a congregation of converts;
And S. <hi>Marke</hi> was sent <hi>Bishop</hi> to <hi>Alexandria</hi> by S.
<hi>Peter</hi> before any were converted. * But ordinarily
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when they had converted a City or


<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100408:159"/>
Nation, then fix't <hi>Bishops</hi> upon their charge, and
there indeed the particular congregation was before
the <hi>Bishop's</hi> taking of the <hi>Diocesse;</hi> But then, this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Nation although it was not the <hi>Bishops Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi>
before it was a particular congregation, yet it
was part of the <hi>Apostles Diocesse,</hi> and this they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited
to the <hi>Bishops</hi> respectively.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> was ordain'd by the Prophets at <hi>Antioch,
Apostle</hi> of the Uncircumcision; All the Gentiles
was his Diocesse, and even of those places he then
received power which as yet he had not converted.
So that, absolutely, a diocesse was before a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
congregation. But if a <hi>diocesse</hi> be taken colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
as now it is, for a multitude of <hi>Parishes</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under one <hi>Bishop,</hi> then one must needes be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
20, and a particular congregation before a dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse;
but then that particular congregation was
not a parish, in the present sense, for it was not a part
of a Diocesse taking a Diocesse for a collection of
Parishes; but that particular Congregation was the
first fruits of his Diocesse, and like a Graine of
Mustard-seed that in time might, and did grow up
to a considerable height, even to a necessity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
titles, and parts of the Diocesse, assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
severall parts, to severall Priests.</p>
            <p>2. We see that the Primitive <hi>Bishops,</hi> before the
division of parishes, had the City, and Country; and
after the division of parishes, had them all under his
jurisdiction, and ever, even from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times
had severall provinces (some of them I meane)
within their limits and charges. * The 35 <hi>Canon</hi> of


<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100408:160"/>
the <hi>Apostles</hi> gives power to the <hi>Bishop</hi> to dispose
only of those things

               </gap>, <hi>which are under his Diocesse &amp; the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

a <hi>Primitive Bishop</hi> was <hi>a Diocesan.</hi>

by their owne argument, for to be sure they had

&amp;c. <hi>The Bishops of every province must know that

* Alexandria</hi> was a <hi>Metropoliticall See</hi> long

            <p>These are enough to shew that in the Primitive
Church there were <hi>Metropolitan Bishops.</hi> Now
then either <hi>Bishops</hi> were <hi>Parochiall,</hi> or no: If no, then
they were <hi>Diocesan;</hi> if yea, then at least many of
them were <hi>Diocesan,</hi> for they had (according to

* But I have stood too long upon this impertinent
trifle, but as now a dayes it is made, the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it is materiall to the maine Question. Only
this I adde; That if any man should trouble the
world with any other fancy of his owne, and say
that our <hi>Bishops</hi> are nothing like the Primitive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Primitive Church had
onely two townes in their charge, and no more, and
each of these townes had in them 170 families, and
were bound to have no more, how should this man
be confuted? It was just such a device as this in
them that first meant to disturbe this Question, by
pretending that the <hi>Bishops</hi> were onely <hi>parochiall,</hi>
not <hi>diocesan,</hi> and that there was no other <hi>Bishop</hi> but
the <hi>Parish-Priest.</hi> Most certainely, themselves could


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:100408:164"/>
not beleive the allegation, onely they knew it would
raise a dust. But by God's providence, there
is water enough in the Primitive fountaines to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
it.</p>
            <p>ANother consideration must here be interpos'd
concerning the intervening of Presbyters in
the regiment of the severall Churches.<note place="margin">§. 44. And was ayded by Presbyters but not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred.</note> For though
I have twice already showne that they could not
challenge it of right either by Divine institution,
or <hi>Apostolicall</hi> ordinance, yet here also it must be
considered how it was in the practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, for those men that call the <hi>Bishop</hi> a
Pope, are themselves desirous to make a Conclave
of Cardinalls too, &amp; to make every Diocesse a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Consistory.</p>
            <p>1. Then, the first thing we heare of Presbyters
(after Scripture I meane, for of it I have already
given account) is from the testimony of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">in Epist. ad Titum. cap. 1.</note>
               <hi>Antequam studia in religione fierent, &amp; diceretur in
populis ego sum Pauli &amp;c: communi Presbyterorum
consilio Ecclesiae gubernabantur. Before factions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
in the Church, the Church was govern'd by the
common Counsell of Presbyters.</hi> Here S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes it of the time before Bishops were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in particular Churches, or after Bishops
were appointed. If, <hi>before Bishops were appointed,</hi>
no hurt done, the Presbyters might well rule in
common, before themselves had a ruler appointed
to governe both them and all the diocesse beside.<note place="margin">Epist. ad Antioch.</note>
For so S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> writing to the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi>


               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:100408:165"/>
exhorts the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to feed the flock untill God

               <hi>whom he would
make their ruler.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 21.</note> And S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaking of <hi>Ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusa</hi>
and some other women that had made defail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
in time of persecution, and so were put to
penance, <hi>praeceperunt eas Praepositi tantispèr sic esse,
donec Episcopus constituatur.</hi> The <hi>Presbyters,</hi> whom
<hi>sede vacante</hi> hee <hi>praeter morem suum</hi> calls <hi>Praepositos,</hi>
they gave order that they should so remaine till the
Consecration of a <hi>Bishop.</hi> * But, if S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
meanes this saying of his, <hi>after Bishops were fixt,</hi> then
his expression answers the allegation, for it was but
<hi>communi</hi> CONSILIO <hi>Presbyterorum,</hi> the IUDICI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>UM
might be solely in the <hi>Bishop,</hi> he was the IUDGE,
though the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were the COUNSELLORS.
For so himselfe addes, that upon occasion of those
first Schismes in <hi>Corinth,</hi> it was DECREED <hi>in</hi> ALL
THE WORLD, <hi>vt omnis Ecclesiae cura ad unum
pertineret,</hi> all the care of the <hi>diocesse</hi> was in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi>
and therefore all the <hi>power,</hi> for it was unima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
that the burden should be laid on the <hi>Bishop,</hi>
and the <hi>strength</hi> put into the hands of the <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
* And so S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> stiles them, [<gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Assessors, and Counsellors to the
Bishop.</hi> But yet if we take our estimate from <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
The Bishop</hi> is THE RULER, <hi>without him though
all concurr'd, yet nothing could be done, nothing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted;
The Bishop was Superiour in</hi> ALL POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER

            <p>This generall account is sufficient to satisfie the
allegations out of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> epistles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the whole Question. But for the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> epistle,
there is something of peculiar answer. For first, It
was a case of publike concernement, and therefore
he would so comply with the publike interest as to
doe it by publike counsell, 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, It was a necessity of
times that made this case peculiar. NECESSITAS
TEMPORUM <hi>facit ut non temerè pacem demus,</hi> they
are the first words of the next epistle, which is of the
same matter; for if the <hi>lapsi</hi> had been easily, and
without a publike and solemne triall reconcil'd, it
would have made Gentile Sacrifices frequent, and
Martyrdome but seldome, 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, The common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> here said he would expect,


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100408:167"/>
was the Councell of the Confessors, to whom for
a peculiar honour it was indulged that they should
be interested in the publike assoyling of such peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
who were overcome with those feares which
the Confessors had overcome. So that this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
an act of positive, and temporary discipline,
and as it is no disadvantage to the power of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi>
so to be sure, no advantage to the <hi>Presbyter.</hi>
* But the clause of objection from the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>epistle</hi>
is yet unanswer'd, and that runs something higher,
. . . . <hi>tamen ad consultum vestrum eos dimisine videar
aliquid temerè praesumere.</hi> It is called presumption
to reconcile the penitents without the advice of those
to whom he writ. But from this we are fairely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
by the title. <hi>Cypriano, &amp; Compresbyteris
Carthagini consistentibus; Caldonius, salutem.</hi> It was
not the epistle of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to his Presbyters, but of
<hi>Caldonius</hi> one of the <hi>suffragan Bishops of Numidia</hi> to
his <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and now, what wonder if he call it
presumption to doe an act of so publike conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
without the advise of his <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> He
was bound to consult him by the <hi>Canons Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi>
and so he did, and no harme done to the present
Question, of the <hi>Bishops sole</hi> and <hi>independant power,</hi>
and unmixt with the conjunct interest of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
who had nothing to doe beyond <hi>ministery,
counsell,</hi> and <hi>assistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In all Churches where a <hi>Bishops</hi> seat was,
there were not alwayes a Colledge of Presbyters,
but only in the greatest Churches; for sometimes
in the lesser Cities there were but two, <hi>Esse oportet,

               <note place="margin">In 1. Timoth. 3.</note> So S. <hi>Ambrose, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
there was but one in a Church. Posthumianus</hi> in

<hi>Hippo</hi> had but one. <hi>Valerius</hi> was the Bishop, and
<hi>Austin</hi> was the Priest; and after him <hi>Austin</hi> was the
Bishop, &amp; <hi>Eradius</hi> the Priest. Sometimes not one, as
in the case <hi>Aurelius</hi> put in the same Councell now
cited, of a Church that had never a Presbyter to be
consecrated <hi>Bishop</hi> in the place of him that dyed; &amp;
once at <hi>Hippo</hi> they had none, even then when the
people snatch'd S. <hi>Austin</hi> and carried him to <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
to be ordain'd. In these cases I hope it will not be
denied but the Bishop was <hi>Iudge alone,</hi> I am sure he
had but little company, sometimes none at all.</p>
            <p>4. But suppose it had been alwaies done that
Presbyters were consulted in matters of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and possibility of Scandall, for so S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>
intimates,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Ecclesia seniores habuit sine quorum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silio nihil
gerebatur in Ecclesiâ</hi> (understand, in these
Churches where Presbyteries were fixt) yet this
might be necessary, and was so indeed in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
at first, which in succession as it prov'd trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to the Presbyters; so unnecessary and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the <hi>Bishops.</hi> At first I say it might be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
For they were times of persecution, and
temptation, and if both the Clergy and people too
were not comply'd withall in such exigence of
time, and agonies of spirit, it was the way to make


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100408:168"/>
them relapse to Gentilisme; for a discontented spirit
will hide it selfe, and take sanctuary in the reedes
and mud of <hi>Nilus,</hi> rather then not take complacence
in an imaginary security and revenge. 2. As yet
there had been scarse any <hi>Synods</hi> to determine cases
of publike difficulty, and what they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from publike decision, it was fitting they
should supply by the maturity of a Consiliary assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and deliberation. For although, by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>
of the <hi>Apostles, Bishops</hi> were bound twise a yeare
to celebrate <hi>Synods,</hi> yet persecution intervening,
they were rather twice a yeare a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>a dispersion then a Synod.</hi> 3. Although <hi>Synods</hi> had
been as frequently conven'd as was intended by the
Apostles, yet it must be length of time, and a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
experience that must give opportunity and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to give generall rules for the emergency of all
particulars, and therefore till the Church grew of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome considerable age, a fixt standing Colledge of
Presbyters was more requisite then since it hath
been, when the frequency of Generall Councells,
and Provinciall Synods, and the peace of the
Church, and the innumerable volumes of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and Decretalls of Bishops, and a digest of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Constitutions, hath made the personall
assistance of Presbyters unnecessary. 4. When ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
requir'd not their presence and Counsell,
their own necessity requir'd that they should attend
their severall cures. For let it be considered; they
that would now have a Colledge of Presbyters as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the Bishop whether they think of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100408:169"/>
For either they must have Presbyters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
without a title, which I am sure they have
complain'd of these threescore years, or else they
must be forc'd to <hi>Non-residence.</hi> For how else can
they assist the Bishop in the ordinary, and daily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
of the Church, unlesse either they have
no cure of their own, or else neglect it? And as for
the extraordinary, either the Bishop is to consult his
<hi>Metropolitan,</hi> or he may be assisted by a <hi>Synod,</hi> if
the <hi>Canons</hi> already constitute doe not aide him, but
in all these cases the <hi>Presbytery</hi> is impertinent.</p>
            <p>5. As this assistance of Presbyters was at first
for necessity, and after by Custome it grew a Law;
so now <hi>retrò,</hi> first the necessity fail'd, and then the
desuetude abrogated the <hi>Law,</hi> which before, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
had established.<note place="margin">Vbi suprà.</note> [<hi>quod quâ negligentiâ ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soleverit
nescio</hi>] saith S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> he knew not how
it came to be obsolete, but so it was, it had expired
before his time. Not but that Presbyters were still
in Mother-Churches (I meane in Great ones) <hi>In
Ecclesiâ enim habemus Senatum nostrum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Isaiae. 3.</note> 
               <hi>actum Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterorum,
we have still</hi> (saith S. <hi>Hierome) in the
Church our Senate, a Colledge, or Chapter of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
(he was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) but they
were not consulted in Church affaires, &amp; matter of
jurisdiction, that was it, that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> wondred
how it came to passe. And thus it is to this day. In
our Mother Churches we have a Chapter too, but
the Bishop consults them not in matters of ordinary
jurisdiction, just so it was in S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his time, and
therefore our Bishops have altered no custome in


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100408:169"/>
this particular, the alteration was pregnant even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the end of the fowre generall. Councells, and
therefore is no violation of a <hi>divine right,</hi> for then
most certainly a contrary provision would have
been made in those conventions, wherein so much
sanctity, and authority, and Catholicisme and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
discipline were conjunct; and then besides, it
is no innovation in practice which pretends so faire
antiquity, but however it was never otherwise then
voluntary in the Bishops, and positive discipline in
the Church, and conveniency in the thing for that
present, and Councell in the Presbyters, and a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Presbyters persons, and a disturbance of
their duties when they came to be fixt upon a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
charge.</p>
            <p>* One thing more before I leave. I find a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
of the Councell of <hi>Hispalis</hi> objected.<note place="margin">Can. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Episcopus
Presbyteris solus honorem dare potest, solus autem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
non potest. A Bishop may alone ordaine a Priest,
a Bishop may not alone depose a Priest.</hi> Therefore in
censures there was in the Primitive Church a
necessity of conjunction of Presbyters with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
in imposition of <hi>censures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* To this I answer, first it is evident, that hee
that can give an honour, can also take it away, if any
body can; for there is in the nature of the thing no
greater difficulty in pulling downe, then in raising
up. It was wont alwaies to be accounted easier;
therefore this Canon requiring a conjunct power
in deposing Presbyters is a positive constitution of
the Church, founded indeed upon good institution,


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100408:170"/>
but built upon no deeper foundation, neither of
nature or higher institution, then its own present
authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that's enough, for we are not now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of</hi> divine right, <hi>but of</hi> Catholick and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
practice. <hi>To it therefore I answer, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
hand required to pull downe a Presbyter, was
not the Chapter, or Colledge of Presbyters, but a
company of Bishops, a</hi> Synodall sentence, <hi>and</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,

            <p>But how if the <hi>Bishop</hi> himselfe be a heretick, or

Assumpsit autem Ecclesia, &amp;</hi> IN TOTO
MUNDO ASSENSUS FACTUS EST, <hi>antequam esset
Aërius, &amp; qui ab ipso appellantur Aëriani.</hi> And the
good Catholike Father is so angry at the heretick
<hi>Aërius,</hi> that he thinks his name was given him by
Providence, and he is call'd <hi>Aërius, ab aërijs spiriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
pravitatis,</hi> for he was possessed with an uncleane
spirit, he could never else been the inventer of such
hereticall pravity. S. <hi>Austin</hi> also reckons him in the
accursed roll of hereticks, and adds at the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Catalogue, that he is NO CATHOLIKE
CHRISTIAN that assents to any of the foregoing
Doctrines, amongst which, this is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall.
<hi>Philastrius</hi> does as much for him.</p>
            <p>But against this it will be objected. first, That
heresies in the Primitive Catalogues are of a large
extent, and every dissent from a publike opinion,
was esteemed heresie, 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, <hi>Aërius</hi> was called here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
for denying prayer for the dead. And why
may he not be as blamelesse in equalling a Bishop,
and a Presbyter, as in that other, for which he also
is condemn'd by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and S. <hi>Austin.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, He
was never condemn'd by any Councell, and how
then can he be called heretick?</p>
            <p>I answer; that dissent from a publike, or a received
opinion was never called heresie, unlesse the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
truth was indeed a part of Catholike doctrine.


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100408:174"/>
For the Fathers many of them did so, as S. <hi>Austin</hi>
from the <hi>Millenary</hi> opinion; yet none ever reckon'd
them in the Catalogues of hereticks; but such things
only set them downe there, which were either dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
opposite to Catholike beliefe, though <hi>in mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rticulis,</hi> or to a holy life. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, It is true that
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Austin</hi> reckon his denying pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for the dead to be one of his owne opinions, and
hereticall. But I cannot help it if they did, let him
and them agree it, they are able to answer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
But yet they accused him also of Arianisme;
and shall we therefore say that Arianisme was no
heresie, because the Fathers call'd him heretick in
one particular upon a wrong principall? We may
as well say this, as deny the other. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, He was not
condemned by any Councell. No. For his heresie
was ridiculous, and a scorne to all wise men; as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
observes, and it made no long continuance,
neither had it any considerable party. * But yet this
is certaine, that <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Philastrius,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
call'd this opinion of <hi>Aërius</hi> a <hi>heresie</hi> and against
the Catholike beliefe. And themselves affirme that
the Church did so; and then it would be considered,
that it is but a sad imployment to revive old here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
and make them a peice of the New religion.</p>
            <p>And yet after all this, if I mistake not, although
<hi>Aërius</hi> himselfe was so inconsiderable as not to be
worthy noting in a Councell, yet certainly the one
halfe of his error is condemn'd for heresie in one of
the foure <hi>Generall Councells, viz.</hi> the first Councell
of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100408:175"/>
We call all them hereticks whom the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church hath condemn'd, and whom we shall
anathematize. Will not <hi>Aërius</hi> come under one of
these titles for a condemn'd heretick? Then see for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

and make conventicles apart from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.

the Holy Sacrament, for that could not be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
without a Priest, and he not ordain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Bishop? True, but therefore they, while they
had a Bishop, got a great deale of bread consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and kept a long time, and when Easter came,
cutt it into small bitts, or crummes rather, to make it
goe the farther, and gave it to their people. And
must we doe so too? God forbid. But how did
they when all that was gone? For crummes would
not last alwaies. The story specifies it not, but yet I
suppose they then got a Bishop for their necessity to


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100408:176"/>
help them to some more Priests, and some more

got a <hi>Bishop,</hi> but this they would seldome have, and
never but when their necessity drave them to it. But
was this all the inconvenience of the want of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops?</hi>
No. <hi>For every man</hi> (saith <hi>Nicephorus</hi>)
might doe what he list, &amp; if he had a mind to it, might
put his fancy into the Creed, and thence came innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
troopes of Schismaticks and Hereticks. So
that this device was one simple heresie in the root,
but it was forty heresies in the fruit, and branches;
clearely proving that want of <hi>Bishops</hi> is the cause of
all Schisme, &amp; recreant opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that are imaginable.</p>
            <p>

Clement.</p>
            <p>IT seemes then we must have <hi>Bishops.</hi> But must we
have Lord <hi>Bishops</hi> too? That is the question now,
but such an one as the Primitive piety could never
have imagined. For, could they, to whom <hi>Bishops</hi>


               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:100408:177"/>
were placed in a right and a true light, they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and saw them to be the Fathers of their
soules, the <hi>Guardian of their life and manners</hi> (as
King <hi>Edgar call'd S. Dunstan</hi>) the guide of their
consciences, the instruments and conveyances of all
the Blessings heaven uses to powre upon us, by the
ministration of the holy Gospell; would they, that
thought their lives a cheap exchange for a free, and
open communion with a Catholick <hi>Bishop;</hi> would
they have contested upon an aëry title, and the
imaginary priviledge of an honour, which is farre
lesse then their spirituall dignity, but infinitely lesse
then the burden, and charge of the soules of all
their Diocesse? Charity thinks nothing too
much, and that love is but little, that grutches at the
good words a <hi>Bishoprick</hi> carries with it.</p>
            <p>However; let us see whether titles of honour be
either unfit in themselves to be given to <hi>Bishops,</hi> or
what the guise of Christendome hath been in her
spirituall heraldry.</p>
            <p>1. S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epistle to the Church of
<hi>Smyrna</hi> gives them this command. <hi>Honora Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum
ut Principem Sacerdotum, imaginèm Dei refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentem.
Honour the Bishop as the image of God, as the</hi>
PRINCE OF PRIESTS. Now since honour, and
excellency are termes of mutuall relation, and all
excellency that is in men, and things, is but a ray of
divine excellency; so farre as they participate of
God, so farre they are honourable. Since then the
Bishop carries the impresse of God upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and bears <hi>Gods image,</hi> certainly this participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100408:177"/>
of such perfection makes him very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And since <hi>honor est in honorante,</hi> it is not enough
that the <hi>Bishop</hi> is honourable in himselfe, but it tells
us our duty, we must honour him, we must doe him
honour: and of all the honours in the world, that of
words is the cheapest, and the least.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the honour due to the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>

The Bishop is Christ's vicegerent, and therefore he is
to be obeyed, knowing that whether it be honour, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
that is done to the Bishop, it is done to Christ, and
so to God.</hi> * And indeed what is the saying of our
blessed Saviour himselfe? <hi>He that despiseth you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth mee.</hi>
If <hi>Bishops</hi> be Gods Ministers and in
higher order then the rest, then although all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance,
and disgrace done to the Clergy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon Christ, yet what it done to the <hi>Bishop</hi> is
farre more, and then there is the same reason of the
honour. And if so, then the Question will prove but
an odde one; even this, whether Christ be to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
or no, or depressed to the common estimate
of Vulgar people? for if the Bishops be, then he is.
This is the condition of the Question.</p>
            <p>2. Consider wee, that all Religions, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
all Christianity did give titles of honour to
their <hi>High-Priests,</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> respectively. * I
shall not need to instance in the great honour of the
Priestly tribe among the Iewes, and how highly
Honourable <hi>Aaron</hi> was in proportion. Prophets
were called [<hi>Lords</hi>] in holy Scripture. [<hi>Art not
thou</hi> MY LORD <hi>Elijah?</hi>] said <hi>Obed Edom</hi> to the
Prophet. [<hi>Knowest thou not that God will take</hi> THY
LORD <hi>from thy head this day?</hi>] said the children in
the Prophets Schooles. So it was then. And in the

New Testament we find a Prophet HONOURD eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, but in his own Country. And to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
and Presidents of Churches greater titles of
honour given, then was ever given to man by secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
complacence and insinuation. ANGELS,<note place="margin">Apocal. 1.</note> and

            <p>Indeed our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> in the case of the two

so. But what of the other, the prohibition runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
for all, as is evident in the severall places of the

FATHER? let an answer be thought upon for these,


<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100408:179"/>
and the same will serve for the other also without
any sensible error. It is not the word, it is <hi>the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
seeking of a temporall principality as the issue of

It is no Principality that the Apostles have,
but it is a Ministery; a Ministery in chiefe, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of which Ministration must governe, and wee
must obey. They must governe not in a <hi>temporall</hi>

<hi>spirituall,</hi> not for honour to the Rulers, so much as
for benefit and service to the subject. So S. <hi>Austin.

And all this is intimated in the Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
visions, where the regiment of Christ is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
by the face of a man; and the Empire of the
world, by Beasts. The first is the regiment of a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
the second of a <hi>King.</hi> The first spirituall, the
other secular. And of the Fatherly authority it is
that the Prophet saies, Instead of <hi>Fathers</hi> thou
shalt have <hi>Children,</hi> whom thou maist make <hi>Princes</hi>
in all lands. This (say the Fathers) is spoken of the
Apostles and their Successors the Bishops, who may
be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Princes or Rulers of Churches,

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100408:181"/>

of the Presbyters, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Reformed
Churches will acquit themselves? How will their
<hi>Superiority</hi> be reconciled to the place, though it be
but <hi>temporary?</hi> For is it a sinne, if it continues, and
no sinne if it lasts but for a weeke? or is it lawfull to
sinne, and domineere, and Lord it over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
for a weeke together? * But suppose it were,
what will they say, that are perpetuall Dictators?
<hi>Calvin</hi> was perpetuall president; and <hi>Beza,</hi> till <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>

* But beyond all this how can the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which is a fixt lasting body rule and governe in
causes Spirituall and Consistoriall, and that over all
<hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> and people, and that for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
For is it a sinne in <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to doe so, and not
in the <hi>Presbytery?</hi> If it be lawfull here, then <hi>Christ
did not interdict it to the Apostles,</hi> for who will
think that a Presbytery shall have leave to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere,
and (as they call it now a dayes) to Lord it
over their Brethren, when a Colledge of Apostles
shall not be suffered to governe? but if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
may governe, then we are brought to a right
understanding of our <hi>Saviours</hi> saying to the sonnes
of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> and then also, their successors, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
may doe the same.</p>
            <p>If I had any further need of answer or escape, it
were easy to pretend, that this being a particular
directory to the Apostles, was to expire with their
persons.<note place="margin">De Vnitat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> So S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> intimates. <hi>Apostoli pari fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>êre

indeed this may be concluding against the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

pertinent to impugne Episcopall authority. For
<hi>inter se</hi> they might be equall, and yet Superiour to
the Presbyters, and the people.</p>
            <p>Lastly, [<hi>It shall not be so with you</hi>] so Christ said,
<hi>non designando officium,</hi> but <hi>Sortem; not their duty,
but their lot;</hi> intimating that their future condition
should not be honorary, but full of trouble, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,

that I said, seeking temporall Principality to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

to Christian women, but that they should doe so
too? And is it imaginable that such an Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
compellation as Christ allowes every woman to
give to her husband, a Mechanick, a hard-handed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisan,
he would forbid to those eminent pillars of

to Bishops.</hi> The good <hi>Patriarch</hi> was angry surely
when he said so. * For my owne particular, I am
confident that my Lords the Bishops doe so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
any fastuous, or pompous title, that were not
the duty of their people in it, they would as easily
reject them, as it is our duties piously to use them.
But if they still desire appellatives of honour, we
must give them, they are their due, if they desire
them not, they deserve them much more. So that
either for their humility, or however for their works
sake we must [<hi>highly honour them that have the rule

to himselfe in power, and authority. But then
also they went further. For they thought whom
God had intrusted with their soules, they might
with an equall confidence trust with their personall
actions, and imployments of greatest trust.</p>
            <p>For it was Great Consideration that they who
were <hi>Antistites religionis</hi> the <hi>Doctors,</hi> and great
<hi>Dictators</hi> of Faith and conscience, should be the
composers of those affayres in whose determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a Divine wisdome, and interests of conscience
and the authority of religion were the best ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>
            <p>But, it is worth observing how the Church and
the Common-wealth did actions contrary to each
other, in pursuance of their severall interests. The
Common-wealth still enabled <hi>Bishops</hi> to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance
of causes, and the confidence of their owne
people would be sure to carry them thither where
they hop'd for faire issue, upon such good grounds
as they might fairely expect from the Bishops abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
authority, and religion; But on the other
side, the Church did as much decline them as shee
could, and made sanctions against it so farre as shee
might without taking from themselves all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities


<pb n="352" facs="tcp:100408:185"/>
both of doing good to their people, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
the secular arme to their owne assistance.
But this we shall see by consideration of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>1. It was not <hi>in Naturâ rei</hi> unlawfull for <hi>Bishops</hi>
to receive an office of secular imployment. S. <hi>Paul's</hi>
tent-making was as much against the calling of an
<hi>Apostle,</hi> as sitting in a secular tribunall is against the
office of a <hi>Bishop.</hi> And it is hard, if we will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that to the conveniences of a Republike which
must be indulged to a private, personall necessity.
But we have not S. <hi>Paul's</hi> example onely, but his
rule too,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> according to Primitive exposition. [<hi>Dare
any of you having a matter before another goe to law
before the Vnjust, and not before the Saints? If then
ye have judgements of things pertaining to this life,
set them to judge who are least esteemed in the
Church</hi>] who are they? The Clergy I am sure,
now adayes.<note place="margin">In hunc Iocum.</note> But S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also thought that to
be his meaning seriously. Let the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the
Church be the <hi>Iudges.</hi> For by [<hi>least esteemed</hi>] he
could not meane the most ignorant of the Laity,
they would most certainly have done very strange
justice, especially in such causes which they Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not. No, but set them to judge who by their
office are Servants, and Ministers of all, and those
are the <hi>Clergy</hi> who (as <hi>S. Paul's</hi> expression is)
<hi>Preach not themselves, but Iesus to be the Lord, and
themselves your servants for Iesus sake. Meliùs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
apud Dei Ministros agere causam.</hi> Yea but S.
<hi>Paul's</hi> expression seemes to exclude the Governours


<pb n="353" facs="tcp:100408:185"/>
of the Church from intermedling. [<hi>Is there not one
wise man among you that is able to Iudge betweene his
Brethren?</hi>] Why Brethren, if Bishops and Priests
were to be the Iudges, they are Fathers? The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is not worth the noting, but onely for <hi>S.
Ambrose</hi> his answer to it. <hi>Ideò autem Fratrem Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
eligendum dicit, quià adhuc Rector Ecclesiae illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
non erat ordinatus. S. Paul</hi> us'd the word [<hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren]
for as yet a Bishop was not ordained amongst
them of that Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vide etiam August. de opere Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach. ca. 29.</note> intimating that the <hi>Bishop</hi> was
to be the man, though till then, <hi>in subsidium</hi> any
prudent Christian man might be imployed.</p>
            <p>2. The Church did alwaies forbid to Clergy-men
A VOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION of ingagements
in REBUS SAECULI.<note place="margin">Can. 7. Latin.</note> So the sixth Canon of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi>

Not domestick. But how if they come on him by
Divine imposition, or accident? That's nothing,
if he does not assume them; that is, by his volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

imployment be an act of obedience, indeed it is
trouble to him, but no sinne. But if he seekes it, for
it selfe, it is ambition. In this sense also must the
following Canon be understood. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100408:186"/>
Church offices are to be avoided. For a Clergy
man must not be covetous, much lesse for covetise
must he neglect his cure. To this purpose is that of
the second Councell of <hi>Arles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Can. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Clericus turpis lucri
gratiâ aliquod genus negotiationis non exerceat.</hi> But
nor here, nor at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> is the prohibition abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
nor declaratory of an inconsistence and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity;
for, for all this, the <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Clerk</hi> may doe
any office that is <hi>in piâ curâ.</hi> He may undertake <hi>the
supravision of Widdowes,</hi> and <hi>Orphans.</hi> And though
he be forbid by the Canon of the <hi>Apostles</hi> to be a
<hi>guardian</hi> of <hi>pupills,</hi> yet it is expounded here by this
Canon of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> for a voluntary seeking it is
forbidden by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but here it is permitted
only with, <hi>si fortè leges imponant,</hi> if the Law, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
commands him, then he may undertake it.
That is, if either the Emperor commands him, or if
the <hi>Bishop</hi> permits him, then it is lawfull. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such command or license it was against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Apostles. And therefore S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did
himselfe severely punish <hi>Geminius Faustinus,</hi> one

of the Testament of <hi>Geminius Victor:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 66.</note> he
had no leave of his <hi>Bishop</hi> so to doe, and for him of
his own head to undertake that which would be an
avocation of him from his office, did in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi>
Consistory, deserve a censure. 3. By this Canon of
<hi>Chalcedon,</hi> any Clerk may be the <hi>Oeconomus</hi> or
steward of a Church, and dispense her revenue if the
<hi>Bishop</hi> command him. 4. He may undertake the
patronage, or assistance of any distressed person that

needs the Churches ayde.<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Synod. Roman. sub Sylvestr. c. 4. Concil. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. c. 26. &amp; Zonar. ibid.</note> From hence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that all secular imployment did not <hi>hoc ipso</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
a Clergy-man from his necessary office and
duty; for some secular imployments are permitted
him, <hi>all causes of piety, of charity, all occurrences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

of Church revenues, and dispensation of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall

by the <hi>Canons Apostolicall,</hi> and then considering
how many possessions were deposited first at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
feet, and afterwards in the Bishops hands,
we may quickly perceive that a case may occurre in
which something else may be done by the Bishop
and his Clergy besides prayer and preaching. <gap reason="foreign">

and Orphans, thence he provides for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and in one word, he takes care of all indigent, and
necessitous people.</hi> So it was in <hi>Iustin Martyrs</hi> time


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100408:187"/>
and all this, a man would think, requir'd a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
portion of his time, besides his studies and
prayer and preaching.</p>
            <p>This was also done even in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times,
for first they had the provision of all the Goods,
and persons of the <hi>coenobium,</hi> of the Church at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
This they themselves administred till a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
arose, which might have prov'd a Scandall;
then they chose seven men, men full of the holy
Ghost, men that were Priests, for they were of the
70 <hi>Disciples</hi> saith <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and such men as
Preached, and Baptized, so S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and S. <hi>Philip,</hi>
therefore to be sure they were Clergy-men, and
yet they left their preaching for a time, at least aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the height of the imployment, for therefore
the Apostles appointed them, that themselves
might not leave the word of God and serve Tables;
plainly implying that such men who were to serve
these Tables, must leave the Ministery of the word,
in some sense or degree, and yet they chose Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and no harme neither, and for a while them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had the imployment. I say there was no
harme done, by this temporary office, to their
Priestly function and imployment. For to me it is
considerable. If the calling of a Presbyter does not
take up the whole man, then what inconvenience
though his imployment be mixt with secular allay.
But if it does take up the whole man, then it is not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>afe for any Presbyter ever to become a <hi>Bishop,</hi>
which is a dignity of a farre greater burden, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
more then a Man's all, if all was requir'd to


<pb n="358" facs="tcp:100408:188"/>
the function of a Presbyter. But I proceed.</p>
            <p>4. The Church prohibiting secular imployment
to Bishops and Clerks, doe prohibite it, onely <hi>in
gradu impedimenti officii Clericalis;</hi> and therefore
when the offices are supplyed by any of the Order,
it is never prohibited but that the personall abilities
of any man may be imployed for the fairest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
either of Church, or Common-wealth. And
therefore it is observeable that the Canons provide
that the Church be not destitute, not that such a
particular Clerke should there officiate. Thus the
Councell of <hi>Arles</hi> decreed,<note place="margin">Apud Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard lib. 2. decret. cap. 99.</note> 
               <hi>ut Presbyteri</hi> SICUT
HACTENUS FACTUM EST, INDISCRETE <hi>per di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versa non
mittantur loca . . . ne fortè propter eorum
absentiam, &amp; animarum pericula, &amp; Ecclesiarum in
quibus constituti sunt, negligantur officia.</hi> So that
here we see, 1. That it had been usuall to send
Priests on Embassyes [<hi>sicut hactenus factum est</hi>]
2. The Canon forbids the <hi>indiscreet</hi> or <hi>promiscuous</hi>
doing of it; not that men of great ability &amp; choyce
be not imployed, but that there be discretion, or
discerning in the choyce of the men. <hi>viz.</hi> that such
men be chosen whose particular worth did by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the legation, make compensation for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from their Churches; and then I am sure there
was no indiscretion in the Embassy, <hi>quoad hoc</hi> at
least; for the ordinary offices of the Church might
be dispensed by men of even abilities, but the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
affaires of both states require men of an
heightned apprehension. 3. The Canon only took
care that the cure of the soules of a Parish be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquished,


<pb n="359" facs="tcp:100408:188"/>
for so is the title of the <hi>Canon, Ne Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri
causâ legationis per diversa mittantur loca, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ
animarum relictâ.</hi> But then if the cure be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by delegation, the feares of the Canon are
prevented.</p>
            <p>* In pursuance of this consideration the Church
forbad Clergy-men to receive honour,<note place="margin">Part. 2. Act. 15. Can. 7.</note> or secular
preferment; and so it is expressed where the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
is made. It is in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.

anathematizari,</hi> they must not turne <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or enter upon any worldy dignity to make them
leave their function, which for the honour of God they
have first chosen:</hi> for then, it seemes, he that tooke
on him military honours, or secular prefectures, or
consular dignity, could not officiate in holy Orders,
but must renounce them to assume the other; It was
in obstruction of this abuse that the Canon directed
its prohibition, <hi>viz.</hi> in this sence clearely, that a
Clerk must not so take on him secular offices, as to
make him <hi>redire in saeculum,</hi> having put his hand to
the plow, to look back, to change his profession, or
to relinquish the Church, and make her become a
Widdow. The case of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish,
and cleare this businesse. <hi>Ecce reliquimus
omnia,</hi> was the profession of their Clericall office.


<pb n="360" facs="tcp:100408:189"/>
S. <hi>Matthew</hi> could not returne to his trade of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
at all, for that would have taken him from his
Apostolate. But S. <hi>Peter</hi> might and did returne to
his nets, for all his <hi>reliqui omnia.</hi> Plainly telling us
that a SECULAR CALLING, a CONTINUED
FIX'D ATTENDANCE on a businesse of the world
is an impediment to the Clericall office, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
but not a temporary imployment or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
            <p>5. The Canons of the Church doe as much
forbid the cares of houshold, as the cares of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
imployment to Bishops. So the fourth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Carthage</hi> decrees.<note place="margin">Can. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Vt Episcopus nullam rei fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaris
curam adse revocet, sed lectioni, &amp; orationi,
&amp; verbi Dei praedicationi tantummodò vacet.</hi> Now
if this Canon be confronted with that saying of S.
<hi>Paul</hi> [<hi>He that provides not for them of his own hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
is worse then an infidell</hi>] it will easily informe
us of the Churches intention. For they must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> But yet so provide as not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their imployment, or else they transgresse the
Canon of the Councell; but this caveat may be as
well entred, and observed in things Politicall, as
Oeconomicall.</p>
            <p>Thus farre we have seene what the Church hath
done in pursuance of her owne interest, and that
was that she might with sanctity, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction,
tend her Grand imployment; but yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cases did occurre in which she did canonically
permitt an alienation of imployment, and revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some persons from an assiduity of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall


<pb n="361" facs="tcp:100408:189"/>
attendance, as in the case of the seven set over
the widdowes, and of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and all
the <hi>Apostles</hi> and the <hi>Canon of Chalcedon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us see how the Common-wealth also
pursued her interest, and because shee found <hi>Bishops</hi>
men of Religion and great trust, and confident abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
there was no reason that the Common-wealth
should be disserv'd in the promotion of able men to
a <hi>Bishops throne.</hi> * Who would have made recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to the Emperour for depriving him of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
his prefect, if Episcopall promotion had made

the service of Kings, or else propounds them as the
fittest men in the world to doe them service. For if
onely men of great abilities are fit to serve Kings,
surely as great abilities are required to inable a man
for the service of God in so peculiar manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximation.
He then that is fit to be a <hi>Bishop,</hi> is
most certainly fit for the service of his King. This
is the sence of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his discourse.</p>
            <p>For consider. Christianity might be suspected
for a designe; and if the Church should choose the


<pb n="362" facs="tcp:100408:190"/>
best, and most pregnant Understandings for her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and then these men become incapable of
ayding the Republike, the promotion of these men,
would be an injury to those Princes whose affayres
would need support. * The interest of the Subjects
also is considerable. For we find by experience,
that no authority is so full of regiment, and will so
finely force obedience, as that which is seated in the
Conscience; And therefore <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> made
his lawes, and imposed them with a face of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
solemnity. For the people are stronger then
any one Governour, and were they not awed by
Religion, would quickly <hi>miscere Sacra prophanis,</hi>
jumble heaven and earth into a miscellany, and
therefore not onely in the Sanction of lawes, but in
the execution of them, the <hi>Antistites religionis</hi> are
the most competent instruments; and this was not
onely in all religions that ever were, and in ours
ever till now, but even now we should quickly find
it, were but our <hi>Bishops</hi> in that Veneration, and
esteeme that by the law of God they ought, and
that actually they were in the Calenture of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
devotion, and that the Doctors of Religion
were ever even amongst the most barbarous and
untaught Pagans.</p>
            <p>Upon the confidence of these advantages, both
the Emperours themselves when they first became
Christian allowed appeales from secular tribunalls

the issues of justice, and religion. * I say this was
done as soone as ever the Emperours were Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Before this time, <hi>Bishops,</hi> and Priests (to be
sure) could not be imployed in state affayres, they
were odious for their Christianity; and then no
wonder if the Church forbad secular imployment
in meaner offices, the attendance on which could by
no meanes make recompense for the least avocation
of them from their Church imployment. So that
it was not onely the avocation but the sordidnesse
of the imployment that was prohibited the Clergy
in the Constitutions of holy Church. But as soone
as ever their imployment might be such as to make
compensation for a temporary secession, neither
Church nor State did then prohibite it; And that
was as soone as ever the Princes were Christian, for
then immediately the <hi>Bishops</hi> were imployed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary
negotiations. It was evident in the case of
S. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> For the Church of <hi>Millaine</hi> had him
for their <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the Emperour had him one of
his prefects, and the people their judge in causes of
secular cognisance. For when he was chosen Bishop
the Emperour who was present at the election cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

It was almost the businesse of every day to

examples there are of the concurrence of the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
office, and a secular dignity or imployment.
Now then Consider. * The Church did not,
might not challenge any secular honour, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
by vertue of her Ecclesiasticall dignity
precisely. 2. The Church might not be ambitious,
or indagative of such imployment. 3. The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e's
interest abstractly considered was not promoted
by such imployment, but where there was no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way of compensation was interrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd.
4. The Church (though in some cases shee
was allowed to make secession, yet) might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
her owne charge, to intervene in anothers
ayd. 5. The Church did by no meanes suffer her
Clerks, to undertake any low secular imployment,
much more did shee forbid all sordid ends, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
designes. 6. The Bishop, or his Clerks
might ever do any action of piety, though of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
burden. Clerks were never forbidden to reade
Grammer, or Philosophy to youth, to be Masters
of Schooles, of Hospitalls, they might reconcile
their Neighbours that were falne out, about a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
trespasse, or reall action, and yet since now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
a Clergy-man's imployment and capacity is
bounded within his Pulpit, or reading deske, or
his study of Divinity at most, these that I have reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
are as verily secular as any thing, and yet no
law of Christendome ever prohibited any of these


<pb n="366" facs="tcp:100408:192"/>
or any of the like Nature to the Clergy, nor any
thing that is ingenuous, that is fit for a Scholler,
that requires either finenesse of parts, or great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or overruling authority, or exemplary piety. 7.
Clergy-men might do any thing that was imposed
on them by their Superiours. 8. The Bishops, and
Priests were men of Great ability and surest confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for determinations of Iustice, in which, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was ever the strongest binder. And therefore
the Princes and People sometimes forc'd the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
from their owne interest to serve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
&amp; in it they serv'd themselves directly,
and by consequence too, the Church had not only a
sustentation from the secular arme, but an addition
of honour, and secular advantages, and all this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by precedent of Scripture, and the practice
of the Primitive Church, and particularly of men
whom all succeeding ages have put into the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Saints. * So that it would be considered,
that all this while, it is the kings interest, and the
Peoples that is pleaded, when we assert a capacity
to the <hi>Bishops</hi> to undertake charges of publike trust.
It is no addition to the calling of <hi>Bishops.</hi> It serves
the <hi>King,</hi> it assists the republike, and in such a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thory,
and almost a surfet of Clergy-men as this age
is supplied with, it can be no disservice to the
Church, whole dayly offices may be plentifully
supplyed by Vicars, and for the temporary avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some few, aboundant recompence is made
to the Church (which is not at all injured) by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
an occasion of indearing the Church, to
those whose aide shee is.</p>

know how to comply with oppressed people, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
designes of peace, and publike security; It is
their office to instruct the King to righteousnesse,
by their sanctity to be a rule to the Court, and to
diffuse their exemplary piety over the body of the
Kingdome, to mixe influences of religion with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
of state, to make them have as much of the
dove as of the serpent, and by the advantage of
their religious authority to restraine the malignity

* The whole Epistle is worth transcribing, But I
shall content my selfe with this summary of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which are acquir'd both to policy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by the imployment of Bishops in Princes
Courts. <hi>Istis me diantibus mansuescit circa simplices

imployed in Princes Councells, <hi>then the rigor of
Lawes is abated, equity introduced, the cry of the poore

of the Church are conserved, the peace of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
labour'd for, pride is depressed, religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth,
the devotion of the Laity multiplies, and
tribunalls are made just, and incorrupt, and mercifull.</hi>
Thus farre <hi>Petrus Blesensis.</hi> * These are the effects


<pb n="369" facs="tcp:100408:193"/>
which though perhaps they doe not alwaies fall
out, yet these things may in expectation of reason
be look'd for from the Clergy, their principles and
calling promises all this, <hi>&amp; quia in Ecclesiâ magis
lex est, ubi Dominus legis timetur, meliùs dicit apud
Dei Ministros agere causam. Faciliùs enim Dei ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more

               <note place="margin">In 1. Corinth. 6.</note> (saith S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>)
and therefore certainly the fairest reason in
the world that they be imployed. But if personall
defaillance be thought reasonable to disimploy the
whole calling, then neither Clergy nor Laity
should ever serve a Prince.</p>
            <p>And now we are easily driven into an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of that saying of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Timoth. 2. 4.</note> [<hi>No man that
warreth entangleth himselfe with the affaires of this
life.</hi>] For although this be spoken of all Christian
people, and concernes the Laity in their proportion
as much as the Clergy, yet nor one, nor the other
is interdicted any thing that is not a direct hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to their owne precise duty of Christianity.
And such things must be par'd away from the frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Laity, as well as the long robe of the
Clergy. But if we should consider how little we
have now left for the imployment of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> I am
afraid a <hi>Bishop</hi> would scarce seem to be a necessary
function, so farre would it be from being hindered
by the collaterall intervening of a Lay-judicature.
I need not instance in any particulars; for if the
judging matters and questions of religion be not
left alone to them, they may well be put into a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall


<pb n="370" facs="tcp:100408:194"/>
imployment, to preserve them from suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of doing nothing.</p>
            <p>I have now done with this; only intreating this
to be considered. Is not the King <hi>fons utrius<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                  </expan> juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis?</hi>
In all the senses of Common-law, and
externall compulsory he is. But if so, then why
may not the King as well make <hi>Clergy-Iudges,</hi> as
<hi>Lay-Delegates?</hi> For (to be sure) if there be an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
in the Clergy of medling with secular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
there is the same at least in the Laity of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with Church affaires. For if the Clergy be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the affaires of the World, then the Laity are
under the affaires of the Church; or else, if the
Clergy be incapable of Lay-businesse, because it is
of a different and disparate nature from the Church,
does not the same argument exclude the Laity from
intervening in Church affaires? For the Church dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
no more from the common-wealth, then the
common-wealth differs from the Church. And now
after all this, suppose a King should command a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
to goe on Embassy to a forraine Prince, <hi>to be a
Commissioner in a treaty of pacification,</hi> if the <hi>Bishop</hi>
refuse, did he doe the duty of a Subject? If yea, I
wonder what subjection that is which a <hi>Bishop</hi> owes
to his Prince, when hee shall not be bound to obey
him in any thing but the saying, and doing of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to which he is obliged, whether the Prince
commands him yea or no. But if no, then the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
was tyed to goe, and then the calling makes
him no way incapable of such imployment, for no
man can be bound to doe a sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:100408:194"/>
BUt then did not this imployment,<note place="margin">§. 50. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were inforced to delegate their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and put others in substituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</note> when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
were great, and extraordinary, force the
<hi>Bishops</hi> to a temporary absence? And what remedy
was there for that? For the Church is not to be left
destitute, that's agreed on by all the <hi>Canons.</hi> They
must not be like the <hi>Sicilian Bishops</hi> whom <hi>Petrus
Blesensis</hi> complains of, that attended the Court, and
never visited their Churches, or took care either of
the cure of soules, or of the Church possessions.
What then must be done? The <hi>Bishops</hi> in such cases
may give delegation of their power, and offices to
others, though now adaies they are complain'd of
for their care. I say, for their care; For if they may
intervene in secular affaires, they may sometimes
be absent, and then they must delegate their power,
or leave the Church without a Curate. *** But
for this matter the account need not be long. For
since I have proved that the whole Diocesse is <hi>in
curâ Episcopali,</hi> and for all of it, he is responsive to
God Almighty, and yet, that instant necessity and
the publike act of Christendome hath ratified it,
that Bishops have delegated to Presbyters so many
parts of the Bishops charge as there are parishes in
his Diocesse, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is pretended for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation
of Episcopall charge, is no lesse then the
act of all Christendome. For it is evident at first,
Presbyters had no distinct cure at all, but were in
common assistant to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and were his emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
for the gaining soules in Citty, or Suburbs;
But when the <hi>Bishops</hi> divided parishes, and fixt the


<pb n="372" facs="tcp:100408:195"/>
Presbyters upon a cure, so many Parishes as they
distinguished, so many delegations they made; And
these we all believe to be good both in law, and
conscience. For the <hi>Bishop per omnes divinos ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
propriae hierarchiae exercet mysteria</hi> (saith S. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. hierdr. 6. 5.</note>)
he does not doe the offices of his order by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
onely, but by others also, for all the inferior
orders doc so operate, as by them he does his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
offices.</p>
            <p>* But besides this grand act of the <hi>Bishops</hi> first,
and then of all Christendome in consent, we have
faire precedent in S. <hi>Paul;</hi> for he made delegation of
a power to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the incestuous person. It was a plain delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for he commanded them to doe it, and gave
them his <hi>own spirit,</hi> that is, his <hi>own authority;</hi> and
indeed without it, I scarce find how the delinquent
should have been delivered over to Satan in the sense
of the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Church, that is, <hi>to be buffeted,</hi> for
that was a miraculous appendix of power Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>* When S. <hi>Paul</hi> sent for <hi>Timothy</hi> from <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Timoth. 4. v. 9. &amp; 12.</note> he sent <hi>Tychicus</hi> to be his <hi>Vicar.</hi> [<hi>Doe thy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

               </gap>, sometimes for

are but like Sophoms to prove that two and two

the Moderne <hi>Aërians</hi> and <hi>Acephali</hi> doe wholly
mistake their own advantages. For whatsoever they
object out of antiquity for the white, and watry
colours of lay-Elders is either a very misprison of
their allegations, or else clearly abused in the use of
them. For now adayes they are only us'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

antiquity, for the men with whose Heifers

               <hi>&amp;c. let the Elders that rule well, be
accounted worthy of double honour, especially they
that labour in the word &amp; doctrine. especially they.</hi>—therefore
all Elders doe not so. Here are two sorts
of Elders, Preaching Ministers, and Elders not
Preachers. Therefore <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> and yet all are
governours.</p>
            <p>1. But why therefore <hi>Lay-Elders?</hi> Why may
there not be diverse Church-officers, and yet but
one, or two of them the Preacher? [<hi>Christ sent me
not to Baptize but to Preach</hi>] saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
yet the commission of [<hi>baptizate</hi>] was as large as
[<hi>praedicate</hi>] and why then might not another say,


<pb n="380" facs="tcp:100408:199"/>
Christ sent me not to <hi>Preach,</hi> but to <hi>Baptize,</hi> that is,
in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> sense, not so much to doe one, as to doe
the other, and if he left the ordinary ministration of
Baptisme, and betook himselfe to the ordinary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Preaching, then to be sure, some Minister
must be the ordinary Baptizer, and so, not the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
for if he might be both ordinarily, why was
not S. <hi>Paul</hi> both? For though their power was
common to all of the same order, yet the execution
and dispensation of the Ministeries was according
to severall gifts, and that of Prophecy, or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was not dispensed to all in so considerable a
measure, but that some of them might be destin'd to
the ordinary execution of other offices, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the guift of Prophecy was the greatest, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
was the office, and therefore the sense of the
words is this, <hi>that all Presbyters must be honour'd,
but especially they that Prophecy, doing that office
with an ordinary execution and ministery.</hi> So no
Lay-Elders yet. Adde to this, that it is also plain
that all the Clergy did not Preach. <hi>Valerius Bishop
of Hippo</hi> could not well skill in the Latine tongue
being a Greek borne, and yet a Godly <hi>Bishop,</hi> and
S. <hi>Austin</hi> his Presbyter preach'd for him. The same
case might occurre in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. For then
was a concurse of all Nations to the Christian <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxes,</hi>
especially in all great Imperiall Citties, and
<hi>Metropolitans,</hi> as <hi>Rome, Antioch, Ierusalem, Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
and the like. Now all could not speak with
tongues, neither could all Prophecy, they were
particular guifts given severally, to severall men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed


<pb n="381" facs="tcp:100408:199"/>
to minister in Church-offices. Some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed,
some interpreted; and therefore is is an
ignorant fancy to think that he must needs be a
Laick, whosoever in the ages <hi>Apostolicall</hi> was not a
Preacher.</p>
            <p>2. None of the Fathers ever expounded this
place of <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> so that we have a traditive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of it in prejudice to the pretence of our
new office.</p>
            <p>3. The word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is never used in the new
Testament for a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> if a Church officer be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
If it be said, it is used so here, that's the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and must not be brought to prove it selfe.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Presbyter</hi> that is here spoken of must be
maintain'd by Ecclesiasticall revenue, for so S. <hi>Paul</hi>
expounds [<hi>honour</hi>] in the next verse. <hi>Presbyters
that rule well must be honoured &amp;c. For it is written,
thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that
treadeth out the corne.</hi> But now, the Patrons of this
new devise are not so greedy of their <hi>Lay-Bishops</hi> as
to be at charges with them, they will rather let
them stand alone on their own rotten leggs, and so
perish, then fixe him upon this place with their
hands in their purses. But it had been most fitting
for them to have kept him, being he is of their own
begetting.</p>
            <p>5. This place speaks not of divers persons, but
divers parts of the Pastorall office, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

honour, especially them that disregarding their

not two sorts of Counsellors, but two parts of

            <p>6. All Ministers of H. Church did not preach,

(said <hi>Socrates) A Presbyter does not Preach in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,
the Bishop only did it.</hi> And then the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is easily understood. For labouring in the
word does not signify, only making Homilies or
exhortations to the people, but whether it be by
word, or writing, or travelling from place to place,
still, the greater the sedulity of the person is, and
difficulty of the labour, the greater increment of
honour is to be given him. So that here is no Lay-Elders;
for all the Presbyters S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, are
to be honoured, but especially those who take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
pains in propagating the Gospell. For
though all preach, (suppose that) yet all doe not
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, take such great pains in it, as is intimated in,

               </gap>. For <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is to take bodily labour, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:100408:200"/>
And so it is likely S. <hi>Paul</hi> here means. Honour the
good Presbyters, but especially them that travell
for disseminating the Gospell. And the word is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
so used in Scripture. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
I have travelled in the word more then
they all. Not that S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached more then all
the Apostles, for most certainly, they made it their
businesse as well as he. But he travelled further and
more then they all for the spreading it. And thus it
is said of the good Woman that travelled with the
Apostles, for supply of the necessities of their diet
and houshold offices, [<hi>they laboured much in the
Lord.</hi>] <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the word for them too. So it is said
of <hi>Persis,</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> of <hi>Tryphaena,</hi> of <hi>Triphosa.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> And
since these women were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Apostolicall men and Evangelists, the
men also travelled to, and preach'd, and therefore
were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that is travellers in the word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Epist. cap. 3.</note>
[<hi>We ought therefore to receive such</hi>] (saith S. <hi>Iohn</hi>)
intimating a particular reception of them, as being
towards us of a peculiar merit. So that the sense of
S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be this also, All the Rulers of the
Church, that is, all <hi>Bishops, Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Apostolick
men, are to be honoured,</hi> but especially them who,
besides the former ruling, are also <hi>travellers in the
word, or Evangelists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. We are furnished with answere enough to
infatuate this pretence for <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> from the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
draught</hi> of the new discipline. For they have
some that <hi>Preach only,</hi> and some that <hi>Rule, and
Preach too,</hi> and yet neither of them the <hi>Lay-Elder,
viz.</hi> their <hi>Pastors,</hi> and <hi>Doctors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:100408:201"/>
8. Since it is pretended by themselves in the
Question of Episcopacy, that Presbyter, and Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus
is all one, and this very thing confidently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
in defiance of Episcopacy, why may not
<hi>Presbyteri</hi> in this place signify [<hi>Bishops?</hi>] And
then either this must be <hi>Lay-Bishops</hi> as well as <hi>Lay-Presbyters</hi>
or else this place is to none of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
            <p>9. If both these offices of RULING and
PREACHING may be conjunct in one person, then
there is no necessity of distinguishing the Officers
by the severall imployments, since one man may
doe both. But if these offices cannot be conjunct,
then no <hi>Bishops</hi> must preach, nor no preachers be of
the Consistory (take which government you list)
for if they be, then the offices being united in one
person, the inference of the distinct officer, the <hi>Lay-Elder,</hi>
is impertinent. For the meaning of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
would be nothing but this. All Church-Rulers
must be honour'd, Especially for their preaching.
For if the offices may be united in one person (as it
is evident they may) then this may be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within the other, and only be a vitall part and of
peculiar excellency. And indeed so it is, according
to the exposition of S. <hi>Chrysostome, and Primasius,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>They rule well, that spare nothing for
the care of the flock.</hi> So that this is the generall
charge, and preaching is the particular. For the
work in generall they are to receive double honour,
but this of preaching, as then preaching was, had a


<pb n="385" facs="tcp:100408:201"/>
particular excellency, and a plastick power to forme
men into Christianity, especially it being then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
with miracles.</p>
            <p>But the new office of a <hi>Lay-Elder,</hi> I confesse I
cannot comprehend in any reasonable proportion,
his person, his quality, his office, his authority, his
subordination, his commission hath made so many
divisions and new emergent Questions: and they,
none of them all asserted either by Scripture or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
that if I had a mind to leave the way of
God and of the Catholick Church, and runne in
pursuit of this meteor, I might quickly be amused,
but should find nothing certain but a certainty of
being misguided. Therefore if not for conscience
sake, yet for prudence, <hi>bonum est esse hic,</hi> it is good
to remaine in the fold of Christ, under the guard,
and supravision of those sheapheards Christ hath
appointed, and which his sheep have alwaies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>For I consider this one thing to be enough to
determine the Question. [<hi>My sheep</hi> (saith our
blessed Saviour) <hi>hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> my voice, if a stranger, or a
thiefe come, him they will not heare</hi>] Clearly thus.
That Christ's sheep heare not the voice of a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nor will they follow him, and therefore those
sheapheards whom the Church hath followed in all
ages, are no strangers, but Sheapheards or Pastors
of Christs appointing, or else Christ hath had no
sheep; for if he hath, then Bishops are the sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,
for them they have ever followed. I end
with that golden rule of <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi>
