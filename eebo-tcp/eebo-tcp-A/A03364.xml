         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of himselfe, &amp; sought an easier life) deuised and framed this ground plotte, for the minde, as for pleasure and delight: as may well appeare by that Epicure, of whome <hi>Cicero</hi> maketh mention, in his booke inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>De natura Deorum,</hi> who liuing at ease, and conceyuing a felicitie in the Garden, indeuoured first to place and frame the same within the walles of <hi>Athens,</hi> whiche before (as it should seeme) lay open, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defended in the wyde fielde, and the culture of it not had in so much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation, as to place them nighe to theyr townes or houses: For whiche cause, doth <hi>Plinie</hi> (by good reason) rightly attribute, the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the delectable Garden to him. The Garden plottes, whiche the Auncient Romaynes possessed (as <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth) were onely set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute with trees, hauing a dead inclosure, made onely of busshes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that needed repayring euery yeare: in whiche especially were sowen the red Onyons, Colewortes, great Leekes, Cresses, great Mallowes or holy Okes, Endiue, Rocket, and sundry sallate Herbes: In these they found such a commoditie, as maruelously pleased them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seyng they by enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hearbes, needed no fire about the dressing &amp; preparing of them, and spared a charge of fleshe, besides a dayly profite that they gotte, by the herbes and woodde brought to the Citie to be solde. The meaner sorte of that tyme so litle cared and esteemed the eating of fleshe, (who in generall accompted it a kinde of reproche, to be knowen to haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fleshe) that they refusing this taunt, did (as to a shambles or fleshe market) haunt dayly to the Garden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Columella</hi> reporteth <hi>lib. 10.</hi> that the Auncient husbandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked vnto (or rather forced of) Gardens, that they in furthering the groweth and yeelde of theyr fruytes and hearbes, bestowed a small tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle and diligence. And as they appeared negligent in their labours of the Garden, so were they well pleased with a meane liuing, in somuch that the common sorte fedde and liued willingly on grosse and simple herbes. But after the age and people were refourmed, and brought by the instruction of the Epicure, to a more delight of themselues, in coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to feede on daintie herbes and Sallates, with meates delectable, and taking an earnester care for the pleasing of their mouthes, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured then to become skilfull, and to vse a greater care about the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and apt dressing of Garden plottes, by well fensing and comely furnishyng of their grounde, with sundry needefull and delectable trees,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19394:7"/>
plantes, and herbes: in which trauayles and diligence of the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, so good successe and commoditie ensuing, procured not onely the willing carriage of herbes, fruytes, and other commodities farre off to be exercised vnto Cities and market Townes, by which these through the sale obtayned a dayly gayne and yearely reuenew, for the ayde of theyr housholde charges, but allured them also to place and frame gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, aswell within Citties and Townes as faste by, that a coste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, might after possesse the recreation and delight of mindes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the proper gayne made by the fruytes, floures, and herbes, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in them. The Garden plottes at length, grew so common among the meaner sorte, that the charge and the chiefest care of the same, was committed vnto the wyfe, in somuch that these accompted not the wife of the house, to be a husewife in deede, if shee bestowed not a payne and diligence as <hi>Cato</hi> reporteth in the weeding, trimming, and dressing of the Garden. But to be briefe, and leauing further to reporte of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, I thinke it high tyme to declare the effects and commoditie of this worke taken in hande, and first to intreate of the care, helpes, and secretes, to be learned and folowed in the Garden grounde: All whiche in a pleasant maner, shall after be vttered in destinct Chapiters, to the furtherance and commoditie of many Gardeners, and all suche hauing pleasure therein.</p>

For which cause, the mynde of the auncient husebande men is, that the Gardener by taking vp a clodde of Earth, should artly trie the goodnesse of it after this maner: in considering whether the earth be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whote and bare, nor leane by sande, lacking a mixture of perfite earth: nor the same founde to be wholly Chalke, nor naughtie sande: nor barrayne grauell, nor of the glittering pouder or duste of a leane stonie grounde, nor the earth continuall moyst, for all these be the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall defaults of a good and perfite earth.

is the same iudged to be, whiche in the Sommer time, is neyther very drie, nor cleyie, nor sandie and roughe, nor endamaged with ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, procured by heate of the Sommer, as the woorthie <hi>Didymus,</hi> in his Greeke instructions of husbandry writeth. Wherefore the earth whiche in the Sommer tyme is wonte to be dry, eyther perisheth or loseth al the seedes sowen, and plantes set in it, or yeeldeth those thinne, and weake prouing on the ground.

An other triall of a battell earth, may thus be purchased, if you digge vp a rotten clodde in a maner blacke, and the same able inough to couer it selfe with the groweth of the owne grasse, and appearing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of a mixte colour, whiche earth, if it be found thinne and loose, may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19394:9"/>
well be fastned and made clammie, through the adioyning and mixing of a fat earth to it. The garden grounde doth also require a sweetnesse to consist in it, whiche the Gardener shall easely finde and knowe, by taste of it: if so be he take vp a clodde of earth in any parte of the ground which most misliketh him, and moystening the clodde with fayre wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in an earthen potsharde, doth after the dipping of the finger in this moyst earth and water, let a droppe softely fall on the tunge, he shall incontinent feele and perceyue (by reason of the taste) of what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the same is. Further, euery fatte earth beyng reasonably loose, is euermore commended and chosen, whiche of it selfe requireth smal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and yeeldeth the most increase. But worste of all others is that grounde, whiche shalbe bothe dry and grosse, leane and colde. In the kindes of grounde, the chalkie is to be refused: whiche properly the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients name, the cleyishe, and reddish earth. The worthy <hi>Varro</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the same grounde, whiche of it selfe beyng gentle and pliable, yeeldeth properly walwurtes. The same earth doth <hi>Columella</hi> greatly allowe, which of the owne accorde yeeldeth or bringeth foorth wilding or Crabbe trees, yong Springs, the Slowe or Bullesse trees, Elme trees, and such like. So that a battell ground, is on suche wise founde and knowen: the rather of the crescent things, seene in it of the owne accorde: yet of necessitie may euery grounde well agree, to be mixed and turned in with dunge. <hi>Florentinus</hi> vttereth an other triall of a fruitefull grounde: if so be the Gardener diggeth vp a furrow, of a foote and a halfe deepe, and filleth the same againe with the owne earth, which in short time after gapeth or choppeth, this no doubt, is a weake and leane earth: But if the earth thus ordred, swelleth or retcheth out, then is it a sure note, that the same is a battell and fatte grounde. And this is noted to be a meane earth, whiche after the digging and raking euen, gapeth but a little. This I thought not good to be couered, nor willingly ouer passed: that a garden plotte situated or standing neare to a mote, or compassed by a mote, is not alwayes lawdable, in that the seedes bestowed in the same, and diuerse plantes set in it, do lightly and soone through the water vaporating foorth waxe olde: yea the fruytes (whether those shalbe of the hearbes or trees) are for the more parte caused vnpleasant, and ouermoyst. Further conceyue, that a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den grounde, ought to be of a moderate increase, and easie dressing:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19394:9"/>
whiche neyther is very moyst, nor ouer dry of it selfe. To these suche a earth is greatly commended as beyng new digged, byrdes couet to it: and that Crowes especially folow the new casting of the digger. If the earth shalbe founde naughtie or vnfruitfull, as the Cleyie, Sandie, and Chalkie, then ought the same to be amended, after the minde of the skilfull, with mearle and dunge layed three foote deepe, and well turned in with the earth, if this be perceyued ouer thinne and leane, then to be mixed and holpen by a fat earth: or to a barreyne and ouer dry grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, may be mixed a moyst and very fatte earth. A waterie ground is made the better, if the same be mixed with a sandie or small grauelie earth, and deepe Alleys made, for the conueighyng and shifting of the water falling in the night.

               <p>IT is right necessary (sayth <hi>Varro</hi>) to place gardens neare to the Citie, aswell for the benefite of pothearbes and rootes, as all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sweete smelling floures, that the Citie greatly needeth. Where these placed in a soyle farre off that they can not so conueniently and in due time be brought to the market to be solde, in such places are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither disalowed, and thought friuolous for the turne. <hi>Cato</hi> doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much commende the garden plot placed neare to the Citie, in which both young trees to beare vp Uines, and Willow or Osier trees be planted nigh to water sides and in places waterie: and that through the garden grounde, water or springs be seene running. To these, the seedes of most hearbes committed into a very well dunged, dressed, and fayre or large open plot, in whiche besides all kindes of fruytes, for the vse of man, workemanly planted and set in apte times of the yeare. This skilfull <hi>Cato</hi> also willeth, that all kindes of garden groundes be placed and framed neare to the Citie, aswell for the Garlande or Posie

floures, as all maner rounde and delectable rootes, with the sweete and pleasant smelling trees: as all the kindes of the Roses, the sweete Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemine, the Eglantine bryar, the Myrtill tree, and all others of lyke sorte, sowed and planted in due seasons of the yeare. But a Garden plot, onely seruing for the vse of potherbes and the kitchin, ought espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be a battell ground, sufficient moyst of it selfe, and well turned in or workemanly laboured with dung. Garden plottes ought to be placed, farre from Barnes, Hay loftes, and Stables, if the same possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may be refused, or otherwise chosen for the turne: in that the chaffe or duste of strawes (as enimie to them) the plantes hardly brooke and suffer: in somuch that the very strawes blowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abroade with the winde, and falling on hearbes, do greatly annoy and harme them: as the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Florentinus</hi> in his Greeke instructions of Husbandry skilfully vttereth. For these, sayth he, by cleauing to the plantes, in the fallyng, pearse the leaues, which once pearced, are incontinent burned by them. All Gardens aswell prosper by the dunging with rootes, as with the proper dunge allowable: yet dungyng the Garden earth, with the branches and leaues of trees, is of the skilfull Gardeners very much disalowed, as vnprofitable and noyouse to hearbes.</p>
               <p>As to the well standing of a Garden behoueth: the aptest and moste laudable placing of a Garden plot shalbe, if the playne grounde lying somewhat a slope, shal haue a course of spring water running through by seueral partes. But this course of water, running through the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den plot, may in no wise be bigge. And the smalnesse of the labouring and dressing of a Garden grounde, is more of yeelde, than the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, not labored in a maner at all.</p>
               <p>It behoueth to haue a well in a Garden, onlesse some running water as eyther ditche or small ryuer be neere adioyning: for that a sweete water sprinckled on yong Plantes, and Hearbes, giueth a speciall nourishment. If a well bee lacking in the Garden, then digge a deepe pitte, in some conuenient place of the Garden: although it may be a painefull labour for the Gardener, to drawe water out of the same. For a Garden grounde needeth often to be watered, through whiche all Seedes committed to the earth, as <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth, both sooner breake foorth, and speedier spread abroade. That a pit with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of long continuance, may be purchased, the same at that time <hi>Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella</hi>

Here further learne, that what Garden plot the nature of the moysture helpeth not, the same may you aptly deuide into partes, in conuerting the spaces, digged and dressed for the winter time to lie open to the South, and those prepared for the Summer time like, vnto the North quarter.</p>

Here is doth not much disagree from the matter, to write in generall, general of the qualities of the windes: and of these, in the briefest maner. First, the Easterly and Westerly windes, be in a maner temperate of qualitie, as betwene a hotenesse and coldnesse: yet of the two, the Easterly windes be knowen dryer. Further the Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly windes, are for the more parte hoter, than the Westerly, &amp; the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly by reporte of the Auncient somewhat more moyst, than the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly. Of all the windes, for the benefite of the Garden, is the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west winde especially commended: as the worthy <hi>Florentinus</hi> in his Greeke rules, and others of experience affirme.</p>
               <p>Besides these, as vnto the clemencie or temperatenesse of ayre, and healthfulnesse of the place belongeth, a Garden plot in colde countries, ought in a contrary maner to be placed, as either to the East or South quarter: if the same be such a plot of ground, whiche bothe contayneth trees, &amp; Plants or Herbes comming vp in it, least the Garden plot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from these two partes, by the obiect or standing against of some most great and high hill, be so nipped, frosen, and withered, with the extreame colde long continuyng, or the Garden plotte otherwise farre distant form the comforte of the Sunne on the North parte, or els the Sunne only shining low and weake, at the West quarter of the same.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19394:11"/>
The singular <hi>Cato</hi> willeth, that the Garden, if a man can, be placed at the foote of an Hill: and the same beholding or lying open to the South, especially in a healthfull place. For a Garden plotte thus defended by an highe hill, on the North parte, and all the day comforted, by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen face of the South quarter: is procured to yeelde the sweeter and tymelier Fruytes, in the seasons of the yeare. But in hote Regions or Countries, let the open place of a Garden grounde, be rather situated towardes the North quarter: whiche may through the like standing auayle, aswell to health of bodie and quicknyng of the Spyrites, as to profite and pleasure.</p>
               <p>This besides conceyue, that the placing of a Garden grounde neare to a Fenne or Marrishe, is euery where to be misliked and refused: if the same lie open towardes the South or Weste, and yearely in the Summer time is accustomed to be drie: for on such wise hapning, the ayre thereabout gathered vp, doth in the falling againe, ingender ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pestilence, or wicked vermine, much harming the Garden plot lying nigh to it. There is also a great regarde to be had to the water, mote or ditche, standing nighe or rounde aboute the Garden grounde: whether this for the more parte be wonte to vaporate or breath foorth any noysome ayre, that may both to men and the Plantes be harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For peculiar or proper is the same (or rather such is the propertie) of very many still waters and Motes. So that it is the counsell of the skilfull (if any lyke be knowen) to refrayne from placing any Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den plotte or Orcharde, if the owner may choose, neare to the same.</p>

               <p>For a playner conceyuing of the abouesayde, learne these folowing: that the Auncient husbandmen did caste vp and made a deepe ditche, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theyr Garden ground (standing in the open fielde) whiche might receyue al the rayne water falling: and this they so digged with a slope passage, whereby the water might runne the easier and freelier from the bottome. The earth and Clay cast vp on the inside (faste by the brincke) they so wrought vp togither, that hardly any person (after the drying of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>termure) could clyme ouer the same. Some also made high banckes or countermures, without a ditche digged about, and the same so serued in the open fieldes in steade of a wall.</p>
               <p>To be brief, the inclosure whiche longest indured, surest, and of the least cost, was the same that the <hi>Romaynes</hi> in auncient time made with Brambles, and the white Thorne layed orderly in bankes, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter growing vp.

Yea they learned by practise, that the Bramble swinged or scorched with straw flaming, recouered &amp; grew euery yeare after, both stiffer, rougher and thicker togither.</p>

               <p>The worthie <hi>Columella</hi> (in his husbandry) &amp; the Neapolitane <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius Rutilius,</hi> wryting the like instruction, in a maner, will that the ground plotte, in which a Hedge shalbe erected, be compassed with two narrow furrowes, digged three foote distant one from the other, and a mans foote and a halfe deepe: but these to be made in the Equinoctial Haruest, at what time the ground shalbe well moystned with shoures. The Furrowes thus prepared, they appoynted to lie open all the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thorough: after in the moneth of Februarie, the roapes with the seedes, layed into eache furrowes, to be couered not thicke ouer with light earth, for hindering the growth of the seedes, especially of the white Thorne: and that this action be rather wrought, when as the winde bloweth from the South or Southwest: the seedes thus coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with diligence, shall appeare within a moneth eyther more or lesse, and the tender young Thornes sprung vp to some height, must be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and stayed with Willow twigges, or other small proppes, set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the emptie spaces, vntil the Thornes, by their further growth,

                  </hi> besides willeth, that a Willow or Osier hedge, be set on eyther side, and in the middle roome or space, betweene the two furrowes, couered and euen raked: that these might so stay the tender Thornes, springing vp in eyther furrowe, vnto the tyme they ioyned, &amp; were growen aboue this Willow hedge, or at the least vnto such strength, that they wel stayed one of the other. Others there are, as the famouse <hi>Diophanes</hi> (among the Greeke wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Husbandry) and with him many the like, whiche will a quicke set Hedge to be erected, and made after this maner. The bigger armes or roddes of the Bramble, they willed to be cut into shorte portions or partes, and these layed aslope, into open Furrowes of a span deepe, to be diligently couered with earth: after to vse aboute the Plantes, a dayly digging or rearyng vp of the earth, and watering of them if neede so requyreth vntill the Plantes budde foorth, and the leaues of the stemmes open, whiche by this maner of comforting and cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, shall grow in fewe yeares to a strong, sure, and continuall hedge.</p>
               <p>The Neapolitane <hi>Palladius Rutilius</hi> instructeth, the way and maner of erecting an other quicke set Hedge, on this wyse: Plante, sayeth he, young Elder trees, neare three foote asunder, then the seedes of the Brambles, lapped diligently in long lumpes of softned &amp; moyst Cley or tough earth, lay the same orderly in a shallow furrow, betweene the Elder trees, whiche artly couered with light Earth, and watering the places if neede so requireth, will within three yeares following, growe to suche a strength and surenesse, that the same will be able i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to defende the iniuries bothe of the theefe, and beast. <hi>Palladius Rutilius</hi> reporteth, that this hedge of the Brambles after three yeares growth, ought to be swinged with flaming strawe: for on suche wise handled, it prospereth afterwardes the better. In that the Bramble, as he sayth, through the euery yeres swinging or burning with straw, ioyeth and increaseth the better: yea through the yearely burning, as the skilfull Husband men affirme, they shoote out harder and rougher of prickles.</p>
               <p>And this maner, to be briefe, is a generall way of enclosing Garden groundes, with small coste, and easily performed. Although the

comlier inclosure or Hedge for a Garden be the same, whiche is made of the white Thorne artly layed: that in fewe yeares with diligence cut, waxeth so thicke and strong, that hardly any person can enter into the ground, sauing by the Garden dore.

And in this matter the worthy writers of Husbandrie commended highly the Greeke Poete <hi>Hesiodus,</hi> which writing very cunningly of husbandry, omitted the dunging of the fieldes, &amp; Garden plottes: contented rather to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell vnto healthfulnesse, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same to fertilitie.

Whiche wise men haue well founde out, in that the sowen Plantes sprung vp in such an earth, yeelde for the more parte a harmefull qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to the dayly feeders on them, hardly to be amended.</p>
               <p>Yet for that neyther the Auncient, nor later husband men seeme to follow the instruction of this precept, nor approue or allow any proper dunging, in prescribing and commending the same in generall: for that cause, I here purpose to intreate in a briefe maner, of the nature
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19394:14"/>
and vse of the same. But first of all to warne you, that a good and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grounde needeth small dunging, where a drie and thinne or leane earth, in contrarie maner requyreth plentie of dung. A earth onely drie (as <hi>Maro</hi> reporteth) well ioyeth to be often fed, and diligently laboured with fat dung: But the grounde that hath a meane substance in it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in like maner a meane dunging to be vsed. Further conceyue, that good dung doth (for the more part) procure, a good and battle earth the better, yea this helpeth and amendeth the euill and naughtie earth: But the euil dung in a contrarie maner, doth euermore cause al earthes the worser: And this behoueth the Gardiner and husbande man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o knowe, that as the earth not dunged, is both colde and stiffe, euen so the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the ouermuch dunging, may be burned altogither. For which cause (<hi>Columella</hi> reporteth) that more auaylable and better it is, often to dung the earth, than ouermuch at one time, to bestow in the ground. The earth digged vp to serue for the spring, ought to be dunged in the waine or decrease of the Moone about S. Martyns day: that the same lying all the Winter through, may so be desolued, agaynst the time of committing seedes to the earth: and in the Moneth of Marche to bee dunged againe, that the earth well moystned with showres (in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Aprill) may be procured the apter, for the bestowing of your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and daintier seedes in the same. Herein consider the leanenesse or fatnesse of your earth, in the often dunging of it, and the worthinesse of your seedes, which may require a lyke paynes to be bestowed on the ground. The plot of earth prepared for the Winter seedes, ought to be wel turned in with dung about the end of September, and the seedes committed to the earth, after the grounde bee well moystned with showers. The dung in a Garden plot, for the planting of yong settes ought not to be cowched or layde next to the rootes of the plantes: but in such order the dung vsed, that a thinne bed of earth be first made, for the setting of the yong hearbes: next layed to this, a handsome bed of dung, as neyther to thicke nor thinne spred on that earth, aboue that let an other course of earth bee raked ouer, of a reasonable thicknesse: which workemanly handled and done, see that your plantes bee sette (in handsome maner) into the ground, and in a chosen tyme.

               <p>AS touching the worthinesse &amp; excellencie of dung, the Greeke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of husbandrie (to whom many of the latin Authours consent) affyrme that the Doues dung is the best, bycause the same possesseth a mightie hotenesse, for which they willed this dung to bee strawed the thinner, and in a maner (as thinne to be scattered abroade) as seedes on the earth, wherby the same may so season the earth measurably, and not on a heape or thicke bestowed (as <hi>M.

The dung also of the hen and other foules greatly commended for the fournesse, except the dung of geese, ducks, and other waterfoules, for their much and thin dunging. And although this dung last, bee weaker than the others, yet may the same be profitable, as the selfesame <hi>Varro</hi> witnesseth out of the Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A commendation next is attributed to the Asses dung, in that the same beast for his leysurely eating, digesteth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, and causeth the bitter dung, which bestowed in the earth, for that the same is most fertill by nature, bringeth or yeeldeth forth least store of weedes, and profiteth verie much all plantes and hearbes: yea this causeth the most sweete and pleasantest herbes and rootes. The third in place is the Goates dung, bing most sowre, which ensueth the sheepes dung yet fatter. After this, both the Oxe and Cow dung: next the swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes dung, worthier than the Oxen or Kien, but greatly disallowed of <hi>Columella,</hi> for the mightie hotenesse, in that the same burneth the seedes immediately, bestowed in the earth. The vilest and worst of all dungs after the opinion of the Greeke writers of husbandrie, is the horses and moiles: if either of these be bestowed alone in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, yet with the sower dungs mixed, either wil profitably be abated or qualified. But the same especially is to be lerned and obserued of euery Gardener and husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that they fatten not the earth, if it be possible, with dung of one yeares, for the same, besides y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is of no vtilitie, it ingendreth also many noisome wormes, and kindes of vermin.

weedes, and possesseth as yet a sufficient strength for the turne. But how elder the same be, so much the lesse profitable, in that it lesser auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: yet the newest dung (sayth he) will well agree for Medowes or the fields, in that the same procureth the more yeelde of grasse, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in the Moneth of Februarie, or Marche, in colder countreys, and the Moone increasing of light. The mud also of a running water, as the ditch or riuer, may be employed in the stead of dung. The dung besides of three yeares is esteemed very good, for that in the longer time lying, whatsoeuer this shall haue of the euill qualitie, and stinking sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, the same by that time vapored forth: &amp; if any hard matter consisted in the same, the age throughly resolued it. Howsoeuer it shall happen, that the earth be, the worthiest dung of all, for floures &amp; Kitchin herbes is the verie thinne Ashes reported to be, which in nature is hote. For this kinde of dung eyther killeth or driueth away the Garden Fleas, the wormes, the canker wormes, founde commonly on Colewortes, Snailes and all other creeping things wasting the stemmes of plants, and herbes. The dung which men make (if the same be not mixed with the rubbish or dust swept out of the house) is greatly mislyked, for that by nature it is hoter, and burneth the seedes sowne in that earth: so that this is not to bee vsed, vnlesse the ground be a barren, grauelly or verie louse sand, lacking strength in it, which being on suche wise, requyreth the more helpe of nourishment and fatning, through this kinde of dung: yet for lacke of the foresayde dungs, the others may bee put in vse: so that these with the Spade be often chaunged and dispersed in the ground. Here you may not forget, that a watrie Garden plot requyreth the more plentie of dung, but a drie earth needeth the lesser dunging: the one for the dayly moysture running in it, being ouercolde and stiffe, is through the often applying of the hote dung, resolued and made temperate: And the other drie of it selfe through the heate consisting in it, by much applying of this hote dung, is of the same burned: for that cause the moysture grounde ought to haue store of dung, but the dryer small dunging.

               <p>BEfore I intreate of the sowing of Gardens, it behoueth to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you, that it much auayleth in a Garden, to frame seemelye walkes and Alleis, for the delight of the owner, by which hee maye the freelier walke hither and thither in them, and consider throughly all the matters wrought and done in the Garden, if the disquietnesse of minde hinder not the benefite of the same. The walkes and Alleys shall to that ende be disposed, that they may serue in the steade of a dunging in those places, as the worthie interpreter <hi>M. Cato</hi> (that cunningly wrote of the auncient husbandrie) witnesseth. These before considered, let vs come vnto the matter: Certaine skilfull practicioners admonish, that a Garden plot or field, bee not sowne ouer all, vntill the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall be well moystned with showers. That if these fall in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and tyme (then the skilfull Gardiners agree) to be well liked. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be otherwise occasioned to sow, as often it so happeneth, then the seedes slowly breake forth, how workmanly soeuer the seedes may bee bestowed in a drie Garden ground, or plow lande, as that worthie <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumella</hi> witnesseth: which like matter in certaine countreys is woont to be exercised, where the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of the ayre is on such wise. For what the same is which shall be bestowed in a drie earth, is euen the like, as If the same were layde in a house, whiche corrupteth not. But when showers fall on the seedes (committed to the earth certaine dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) they after shoote vp in one daye: yet are these seedes in daunger (sowne in the meane time) of Byrdes, and Antes or Pismires, except the seedes be (before the sowing) preserued and defended wyth those
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19394:16"/>
helpes which shall after be vttered, in the proper place following. How soeuer the occasion and weather serue, the Gardiner shall employ his diligence, that the Garden ground or field, which ought to be leuelled, and sowne in the spring time (that the same may yeeld the proper fruits in the Sommer time) bee digged and dunged (if need so requyre to the earth) about the ende of Haruest, when as yet the cold season and frosts bee not approched, nor bitter weather begun. And the same garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plot or quarters of the Garden, which the Gardiner woulde in the Haruest time, haue couered with the Sallet, Pot hearbes, and rootes, ought to be turned vp in the beginning of Sommer, or in the Moneth of May, that the Cloddes of earth may (through all the colde Winter, and hote Sommer weather) speaking or rather (here meaning of the greater Gardens) bee so dissolued, as the worthie <hi>Maro</hi> skilfullye instructeth.</p>
               <p>And to these that the rootes of the vnprofitable Herbes or Weedes may likewise be killed: After the Winter or Sommer time ended, dung then must bee orderly turned in with the earth: as in the Moneth of Marche (the Moone decreasing) for the Spring time, and in the end of Haruest, for the Winter tyme. And when the sowing time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth or draweth neare, then shall the Garden grounde (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per order and maner of euerie Countrie is) bee diligently raked, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and purged, both of the stones and vnprofitable rootes, after the same, let the earth bee dunged, and orderlye digged, as in the maner afore taught, which through the diligent digging so often repeated, that the dung with the earth by the twise labouring ouer bee well dissolued and mixed togither. After this digging and dunging againe the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde time (if the ground needeth such fatning) and the earth leuelled, may the Garden (about the middes of Februarie, but I rather suppose in the Moneth of March to be more agreeable, and the Moone especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in hir first quarter) be beautified in apt places of the same, with seemly Herbers, before the quarters and beddes be workmanly troden out by the Gardiner: the instruction of which Herbers, shal fully be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in this next Chapter.</p>

               <p>THe Herber in a Garden may bee framed with Juniper poles, or the Willowe, eyther to stretch, or be bound togither with Osyers, after a square forme, or in arche manner winded, that the braunches of the Uine, Melone, or Cucumbre, ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning and spreading all ouer, might so shadowe and keepe both the heate and Sunne from the walkers and sitters there vnder. The Herbers erected and framed in most Gardens, are to their much refreshing, comfort, and delight. These two, as the vpright, directed by quarters set in the Earthe, and leaning to the wall, neere to which faire Rosemarie, or the redde Rose set, to runne straight vp, and the winding in arch manner, framed (as I vttered afore) with the Juniper, or Withie poles, to shadowe the walkers there vnder.

The erection and garnishing of the winding Herber, maye best bee wroughte with Juniper poles, in that these may well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure withoute repairing for tenne yeares: but those framed with the Willowe poles, require euery three yeares to be repayred.</p>
               <p>The owner or Gardener that woulde sette Rosetrees to runne vp by the poles of thys Herber, ought workemanlike to beginne and doe the same aboute the myddes of February, and in the fyrste quarter of the Moone, the beddes before well reared wyth a stonie and drye Earth, and not wyth Dung. The Rosetrees with theyr rootes, are also to be planted in short and narrowe beddes, diligentlye raysed with a drye Earthe, but if the Gardener or owner will, slyppes may be broken off from the rootes, cutte in a slope manner at the heads, about a mans foote and a halfe long, writhed at the endes, and so sette in a slope man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a foote deepe into beddes, well reared with a drie Earthe, and in the encrease of the Moone.

The Seedes of the Rose commytted to the Earthe, doe slowlye come vppe, yet so often as you mynde to sowe the Seedes, bestowe them a foote deepe in lyghte and drie Earthe, aboute the myddes of Marche wyth vs, and in February, in hotter places, the Moone then increasing.

stones purged forth, shall bee artely troden out, into three foote of breadth, and into what length the owner or Gardener will: but to such a breadth especially troden forth, that the weeders handes may well reach vnto the middest of the same, least they thus going by the beddes, and weeding forth the vnprofitable hearbes and grasse, maye in the meane time treade downe both the seedes shooting vp, and plants aboue the earth. To the helpe of which, let the pathes betwene the beddes be of such a reasonable breadth (as a mans foote) that they passing along by, may freely weede the one halfe first, and nexte the other halfe left to weede.</p>
               <p>The beddes also ought (after the minde of the worthie Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane <hi>Palladius Rutilius</hi>) to be troden out narrow, and of a length, as twelue foote long, if the plot be large, and sixe foote broade, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes to these of a seemely breadth, for the easier retching into the middle of the beddes, or at the least freelier, to the furtherance and speede of the weeders. In a moyst and watrie Garden plot, this skilfull Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane willeth, that the beddes in the same grounde bee reared two foote high, for the better prospering of the seedes committed to that earth, and the plantes come vp. But in a drie grounde, the edges of the beddes raysed a foote highe, shall well suffice. The pathes troden out betweene the beddes, ought to be of a good depth and euen, whereby the water sprinckled gently forth by a water pot, on the vpper face of the beddes, and falling into the pathes, may the easier enter into the beddes, to the better moystning and feeding of the rootes of the plantes, and the rest superfluous to runne the easier into other Alleys or pathes needing this moysture, whiche by this easie running along in the pathes, shall proceede a speedier moystning, and farre better watring of all the beddes, yea the superfluous water in the ende, lying still in the pathes, may through a slope gutter made in the middes of them, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected forth into a conuenient place made for the purpose, of some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the beddes. And this instruction much auayleth to beddes in the night time, when as mightie showers happen to fall, whiche might ouercloy the beddes, were it not for the Gutters speedily conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the water away.</p>
               <p>All these instructions conceyued, the Gardener or Owner maye then prepare himselfe to the committing of Seedes to the

earth: in which he ought to be carefull, that after the bestowing of the seedes in the earth, a clearnesse or mildnesse of the ayre may for certaine dayes succeed: for through the ayre and weather fauouring, and the seedes sowne in warme places, where the sunne long shineth, doe they most speedily break, and shoote aboue the earth, so that the seedes be new and good, the age of which in this doing, much auayleth to be examined and knowne. Therefore euery Gardener and owner ought to be careful and diligently to foresee, that the seedes committed to the earth (as <hi>M.

The bestowing of Seedes in a moist earth, the beddes afore short cast, ought to be done in the warme season of the Spring, as in May,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19394:23"/>
and the Mone increasing, for seedes on suche wise handled, prosper the better, through the warme and drie time following. But if occasion moueth you to commit Seedes into a drie ground, and that water bee farre distant, then digge the alleis of the beddes deepe, and in a slope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for the better leading of the water from beddes sufficiently moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to others lacking moisture: and to these such a drie Earth better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to be sowen in the Haruest time, the ground before well moyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with shoures, heerein not forgetting the choise of seedes, nearest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to the natures of these two Earthes, with the furtherance of the Moone at time of the sowing. If the Gardener mindeth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit seedes to the Earth in the Sommer time, lette the same be done in the increase of the Mone, in the monethes of July and August.

               <p>The Seedes which ought especially to be sowen in the Earth, about the ende of Haruest as about the middle of September, and in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Mone at those times increasing, that these may all the Winter endure, and be strengthned in the ground, are the Endiue, Onions, Garlike, Scalions, the great Garlike, yong Leekeheads, Colewortes, Mustard seede, and such like.</p>

In such places I say, the bestowing of many seedes better agree to be done about the middle of the Spring, or in the moneth of May, in warme and caulme dayes, the Mone then increasing of light.</p>
               <p>But the seedes to be committed to the earth in those Countries and places in the Haruest time, ought rather to be done sooner or before the time with vs, where the Seedes otherwise to bee bestowed in hote Countries and places in the Spring time, require farre timelyer to be done, as in the beginning of the moneth of Marche, and the Seedes to bee sowen in those places in the Haruest time, to bee bestowed muche later.</p>

               <p>The seedes in like maner of the Coucumber, steeped in milke or luke warme water for a night, and committed to the Earth, vnder a warme ayre, do farre speedier breake, and appeare aboue ground.

               <p>The third monthes sowing, or rather in May, to such dwelling far North, and where snow lyeth long, there (this bestowing of seedes) better agreeth, especially, where the qualitie of Sommer is knowen to be moyst.</p>

               <p>AFter the Seedes beeyng workemanly bestowed in the Beddes, the Gardeners next care must bee, that he diligently pull vppe, and weede away all hurtfull and vnprofitable Herbes, annoying the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den plantes comming vp.</p>
               <p>But about this exercise in weeding of the beddes, there is a disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the Writers of Husbandrie. For certaine denie that the raking doth profit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plantes any thing at all, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rake the rootes of the Garden plantes are so vncouered, and the plantes with the same felled, and caused to lye flatte on the ground, which, if cold weather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, are vtterly killed wyth the nipping ayre, for which cause, they bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thought of that weeding and clensing exercise, by pulling vp wyth the hande, so that the same were done in due order and time.</p>
               <p>Yet it pleased manye Husbandmen in tyme past to rake vppe the weedes in beddes, yet not after one maner, nor at al times alike, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the vsage of the Countrie, the good skill and condition of the weather: for whych cause, in what manner soeuer this exercise shall bee taken in hand, that weedyng shall neede or be required in these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Gardener shall not attempte or beginne the weeding of beddes with the hande, before the plantes well spring vp, shall seeme to couer theyr proper Beddes, and that in this high growth, the plantes shall be mixed and ioyned one to the other, according to the nature and forme in their growth.</p>
               <p>In thys pluckyng vp, and purging of the Garden beddes of weedes and stones, the same about the plants ought rather to be exercised wyth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19394:29"/>
the hand, than with any Iron instrument, for feare of feebling the yong plantes, yet small and tender of growth.</p>
               <p>And in the weeding with the hande, the Gardener must diligentlye take heede that he doe not too boysterously loose the Earthe, nor handle muche the plantes in the plucking away of the weedes, but the same purge so tenderly, that the rootes of the yong plantes be not loosed and feebled in the soft earth: For occasion will moue the carefull Gardener to weede daintie Herbes, beeing yet yong and tender, least grosse weedes in the growing vp with them, may annoy and hinder their increasing, Therefore the yong plantes in some readinesse to bee taken in hande, ought not to be stayed vntil their strong and biggge growth, but weeded in the meane time, for doubt of the inconueniences aboue vttered. But the common Herbes for the Kitchin the Gardener shall not begin to weede, before they be growen strong in roote, and bigge shot vppe. And this learne, that if the Earth be lose and soft at the time of weeding the dayntie plantes, you may not then lose and pull vppe weedes, but in a soft and tender manner: and yet fine Herbes require at all times to bee weeded, so that shoures of raine haue well softned the earthe a daye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The walking or treding often about the beddes of the little and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der plantes shooting vp, looseth much the soft Earth about them, yea this so settleth downe the ground by the help of shoures of raine falling, that the weedes growing vp in those beddes, are caused the harder to be plucked vp. And sometimes the rootes of the weedes in the plucking vp with the hande are lefte behinde, through thys fastnesse caused of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Heere remember, that you neuer take in hande or beginne the wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of youre beddes, before the Earthe be made soft, through the store of Rayne falling a day or two before.</p>
               <p>Heere conceiue, that the clipping, plucking away, and pressing downe of sundrye Herbes with Tyles or other waightie things, after they bee growen to some greatnesse, is to greate purpose, for somuch as this causeth them to keepe the longer greene, and to yeelde the thicker, fairer, and bigger Touffes, besides the letting of the Herbes, that they growe not vppe into Seede, and to giue with these a plesanter sauour, than the same that afore they possessed in theyr growth simplye,</p>

or Gardener closeth or diligently stoppeth the mouthes of the Mole holes with the Garlike, Onyon, or Leeke, shall eyther driue the Moles away, or kill them, through the strong sauour, striking or breathing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

To the simple Husbandmen may thys ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie practise of no cost suffise, in setting downe into the Earthe a stiffe rodde or greene braunch of the Elder tree. The worthy <hi>Plinie</hi> whyche hath left to memorie skilful practises. reporteth, that the mother of the Oyle Oliue alone, sprinckled on the heape of Pismires or Antes, killeth them. This Authoure also writeth, that the Pismires are wicked an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyers to trees, which the Gardener or Husbandman sayeth hee, maye force to forsake and leaue, if he bestrike the neather partes of the Trees round aboute with the powder of the Ruddell, and Liquide pitche or Tarre, mixed togither, and hang also by the place the fyshe named of the worthy <hi>Rutilius</hi> after the Greeke Writers Husbandrie <hi>Coracinum,</hi> and of <hi>Ruellius Graculum,</hi> for on suche wise handled, they will resorte and gather all into one place, whereby the Husbandly Gardener maye the speedelyer destroy them.

Many kill them as I afore vttered, with the only mother of the Oyle Oliue. The skilfull Neapolitane <hi>Rutilius</hi> reporteth, that if the greate company of Pismires or Antes haue deepe holes in the Garden grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, those may the owner chase away, or kill in the ground, by stopping the

If they creepe abrode, then sift all the Alleys where these runne with bright Ashes or else score the grounde thicke togither with the redde Okare or white Chalke, or make long strikes with Oyle on the Earthe. Further hee writeth, that the Husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly Gardener may driue away Pismires, if on the mouthes of their holes hee sprinckle the powder of Organy and Brimston bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten togither, or burne the emptie shelles of Snayles, and with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of the same, stoppe abundantly the mouthes of their dennes and holes. In which deuise, this <hi>Rutilius</hi> omitted the Storax that of <hi>Pax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anius</hi> the Greeke, out of whome hee borrowed this conclusion added. The words of <hi>Paxanius</hi> be on this wise: If the owner sayeth he, shall burne certaine Antes or Emots in the middle of the Garden, the othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>FLorentius</hi> (a singular and diligent interpreter of the matters of the fielde) wrote, that serpentes in the Garden grounde or elsewhere, wil not lodge or abide, if the owner sow or plant in bordures about, or in apt corners of the Garden, eyther the wormwoode, Mugworte, or Southernwood, which if these shall some where happen to haunte, then may the Gardener (as he writeth) driue them incontinent furth of the ground, if he make a smoake either with the Lyllie rootes, Harts horne, or Goates houes.</p>
               <p>The skilful <hi>Rutilius</hi> vttereth, that all Serpents bee forced out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, by euery sowre sauour, and stinking smoake, flying abroade w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the winde.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Democritus</hi> affirmeth, that the serpentes assuredlye do dye, if the Gardener straw or throw Oken leaues on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or if any spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth fasting into their mouth gaping or wide open.</p>
               <p>The well practised <hi>Apuleius</hi> writeth, that these stricken but once
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19394:41"/>
with a tough reede or willowe rodde, are mightily astonied, but giuing them many strokes, do recouer &amp; wax strong again. <hi>Tarentinus</hi> (a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful writer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Greke Husbandrie) denyeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any can be harmed of a serpent, if the person afore be annoynted with the iuyce of the Radish, or that hee hath eaten of the Radish, which matter (<hi>Athenaeus</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> with many other worthy Authours) ascribe to the Orenge or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and they confirme the same, with a pleasant Historie.</p>
               <p>The former <hi>Florentinus</hi> vttereth, an other singular practise against serpents of the Garden, to be wrought after thys maner: Lay (saith he) the fatte of the Harte in the Garden Earth, or else burie the Centorie roote, or the Geate stone, or else the Eagle, or Kytes dung, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes wil refuse the grounde (or at least) not come neare the place, and euery venemous worme wilbe driuen away, if the Gardener by taking (<hi>Nigella, Pelitorie, Galbanum,</hi> of the Hartes horne, Hysope, Brimstone, <hi>Peucedanum,</hi> and the Goates houfes, shall diligently bring these to ponder, and infuing the whole for a time in the strongest vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, shall after make little balles of the myxture, with which through dried cause a sauoure and a smoke. For through the sauour of these matters sparsed in the Ayre, all creeping vermine wil eyther hastely (for the great feare) forsake the ground, or dye there incontinent. The same Authoure <hi>Florentinus,</hi> reporteth, that the serpents may like be gathered on an heape, into an olde deepe poudering Tubbe, as fish into a wele or bownette, if the same bee deepe set about that place of the Garden or field, where these most lurke and haunte: for after the speedie resorting of these to the brincke of it, they fall willingly in, not able after to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themselues out, <hi>Plinie</hi> writing of the withye named <hi>Siler,</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this, that the serpents refuse, both the tree and fruite, for whiche cause, the husband men made them staues of the woode to carrie about with them. But this by a most certaine experience or trial, proued and confirmed, that by making a smoke with old shoes burned, the serpents incontinent speed away, nor these only flye out of the Garden ground, fielde, or house, but suche as are enterd into men, by dead sleape in the sommer, in sleeping open mouthed, or with open mouth, in the fielde, do like come forth with the sayd smoke. Which matter (<hi>Marcus Gatinaria</hi> a famouse Phisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) confirmeth, who reporteth that the like hapned to a certayne man in his time, to whom after infinite medicynes and most
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19394:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
effectuous remedies were ministered, and none of them preuailed, at the last this imployed, fel out most luckylie and wonderful of all the others, in burning the leather of olde shoes, and receiuing bothe smoke and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor by a Tunnel into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body. For assoone as this hidious beast (which was a mighty Adder) felt the sauour of this smoke, he was seene (to the standers about) to come forth by the fundament, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mighty astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; wonder of al the beholders. And this worthy secrete, easie to bee prepared, I thought here good to place, that the same, a like case happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, might be profitable, to euerie person. But in this place is not to be omitted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> serpents greatly hate the fyre, not for the same cause, that this dulleth their sight, but bycause the natrue of fire is to resist poison. These also hate the strong sauoure far flying, which the Garlik &amp; redde Onyons procure. They loue the Sauine tree, the Juie, and Fennel, as Todes do the Sauge, and Snakes the Herbe Rocket. But they are mightily displeased, and sorest hate the Ashe tree, insomuche that the serpents, neither to the morning nor longest euening shadows of it, wil draw neere, but rather shun the same, &amp; flye far off. As a like matter <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> reporteth, was on a time proued, by inclosing a serpent, within the large cyrcle made of greene Ashetree leaues, in the middle of which a quicke fire made, to the terroure of the serpent, for that ende to proue, whether she had rather runne ouer the Cyrcle, than drawe neare to the fire, which neuerthelesse (the fire kindling more dna more) at the laste, rather crepte to the fire, where hee peryshed, tnha by any meanes woulde drawe neare to the Cyrcle of the Ashetree leaues. Yet here learne, the maruelous benignitie of nature, which permitteth not the serpents to come forth of the Earth, before the Ashe tree buddeth forth, nor to hide them agayne, before the leaues fal off. The singular Poete <hi>Virgil</hi> sayth, that the smoke made of Rosen or <hi>Galbanum,</hi> doeth hastilye chaste and driue the serpents away.</p>
               <p>These hytherto vttered, for the driuing awaye and killing of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes. But here was almost forgotten, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaues of Ferne, do chase away the serpent: for which cause, many skilful thinke it profitable, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to sowe, or strawe the Ferne, in suche places where the serpentes haunte. The Neapolitane <hi>Rutilius</hi> addeth, that if the leaues of the same bee burned, they (wyth the sauoure onely) wyll flee or creepe hastylye awaye, yea and force them to chaunge theyr lodgings,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19394:42"/>
farre from the Garden grounde or fielde.</p>
               <p>Here a doubt may be made, whether the same be to purpose here to recite, that the worthy <hi>Albertus</hi> reporteth of the rounde <hi>Aristolochia</hi> wyth the field Frog, and a certaine proportion of writing Incke dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently laboured, and mixed with these, to make the Serpentes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to quayle as deade, if any of the myxture bee written wythall, and throwen before them.</p>
               <p>But I thinke it highe time to come vnto the remedies, whiche are both readie and easy to be prepared.</p>
               <p>If that any shal be bitten of a serpent, vnlesse hee haue a Feuer, and dryncketh a certaine quantitie of the iuyce of the Ashe leaues, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt white wine, and applyeth also of the freshe leaues on the place bitten, shall in short time see a worthy secret, greatly to be maruelled at, and by happy successe, proued of many.</p>
               <p>Here briefly to conclude, if the Gardener bestoweth the fresh elder floures where the Serpents dayly haunte, they will hastily departe the place, yea these by reporte (artely bestowed in the Garden ground) do in short time destroy the Mothes, the Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kerwormes, and Palmers brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in trees.</p>

               <p>TO most men it is manyfest, that there are two kindes of celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all iniuries, the one, that men name tempestes, in which the hayle, storme, and such like as are ment.</p>

                  </gap>e, and at one worde a destruction, so that al is caused by Heauen, and wont especially to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the Spring time. The blasting and burning of the blossomes of Aple trees, the floures of Uines and Corne, are caused through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie of the Frostes hapning in the nighte, and not as many reporte, to be wrought by the Sunnes sharp heate, burning hastily vp the deawe, or the moisture entring in, and corrupting the heads of Corne. The same also wasting the tender buddes, plantes, and branches, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly named burning, for that it burneth and consumeth in places so blacke as any Cole. The blasting besides of the tender blossoms of Trees and Uines, is named sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that this especially is caused through the blast and stricking of some Constellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To these we adde the rust, as a mighty enimie to fruites. The worthy <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth, that the rust and burning, bee caused only of colde, whiche happeneth in the nighte time, and before the Sunne rising, so that the Sunne is not worker of these. And the time when the like succeedeth, is knowen to be after the minde of sundry skilful Writers of Husbandrie, at the change or full Moone, some Starres then of the fist bignesse ayding, in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or setting. The suspected times and days of the rust for iudgyng of the good or euill successe of fruites, is knowen in Aprill, accordyng to the falling out of George and Saint Markes daye, and the ninth day of May, for the caulmenesse and cleerenesse of the aire. This celestiall sterilitie, dothe neither happen, nor cannot euerye yeare, for the proper courses of the Starres, both in the descending and ascending in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, with the radiations or aspectes one to another.

First, the constellation <hi>Virgiliae</hi> for the fruites, the constellation <hi>Aquila</hi> for the Corne, and the constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Canicula</hi> for the gathering of fruites, so that these for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same cause were named the Judiciall Starres, to foreknowe the seasons by. In whose dayes of the firste appearance, if the aire cleere and caulme sente

downe a kindly and feeding iuice to the Earth, then was it a sure note to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that such things sowen, would grow and encrease prosperously. Contrariwise, if the Moone at those times sprinckled a dewie colde on the plantes and crescent things, then as a bitternesse mixed contrarie to the sweete and nourishing iuice, the same so slewe or killed the tender things, shot forth appearing aboue the earth. But to come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: there is neither frost, hayle, storme, nor tempest, so harmefull to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fieldes or Garden groundes, through whiche they at anye tyme cause the sterilitie and penurie of victuals, as the rust and burning heate doe, for these falling and working in open Countreys, procure for the more part through their harmes a publique calamitie &amp; present dearthe, to the auoyding of which, shall heere be vttered those skilfull remedies, inuented of the auntient Writers of Husbandrie. If the carefull Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener would withstand the force of Frost and rust approching, then let him burne store of Chaffe, if such plentie be there, or neere hande, but for lacke of the same, may he vse the drie weedes plucked vp of the Garden or field, and the bigge Thistles, or other wast fruites, in many places of the same, especially towarde that way whiche the winde then bloweth, for on such wise handled, <hi>Diophanes</hi> in his precepts of Husbandrie wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the euill nighe or at hande is auerted. The selfe same pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise may be vsed against thicke and darke mistes. <hi>Beritius</hi> in his Greke preceptes of Husbandrie giueth warning, that the Husbandman or Gardener diligently marke, whether the same bee gathered in the ayre, whiche readie to fall, let hym then burne incontinente the left horne of an Oxe, with eyther Cowe or Oxe dung, making with these a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie smoke round about the Garden ground or fielde, but the smoke espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially directed by the winde, in fleeing against it. The worthy <hi>Apuleius</hi> wrote, that the smoke of three riuer Creauisses, burned with Oxe or Gotes dung, or with Chaffe, to bee a most sure healpe and remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the like, that if the same be already fallen, I meane the rust, the Gardener may recouer the harme after this manner, as the skilfull <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi> reporteth, in taking the rootes or leaues of the wilde Cucumber or <hi>Colocynthis,</hi> which after the brusing and infusing in water for a night, sprinckle and wet the places well taken with rust before the Sunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. The like may the Gardener worke and do, with the Figge or Oke tree ashes, sprinckled in the places endamaged with rust.</p>

               <p>If the Gardener or Husbandman as <hi>Apuleius</hi> witnesseth, shal sticke and plante rounde aboute the Garden ground or fielde, many slippes, stockes, and branches of the Bay tree, these will after auayle againste the rust, for into them all the harme of the rust passeth and entreth, as the like many times hath bin obserued of the skilfull, whych very often is wont to happen in the dewie Countrey, valleys, and in places where bigge winde of a suddayne doth many times blowe.

               <p>THe worthy <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> in his husbandrie preferred the Colewort before all other Pot Hearbes, and the learned <hi>Plinie</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ascribed a principalitie to the same of all Garden Hearbes, for whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che cause, I purpose heere to intreate first of this Hearbe, that manye of the Latines also for the mightie stemme and armes like branches na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Colewort. Suche is the nature of this plant, that the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth no condition of ayre, for whiche cause it may bee committed to the Earth in any time of the yeare. This plant desireth a fat Earthe, and wel turned in with dung, but the Cleyie, grauellie, or Sandie thys refuseth, except a floud of raine water shall now and then healpe.</p>
               <p>The Coleworte prospereth the better, beeing placed towarde the South, but this standing open to the North, not so well encreaseth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both in tast and strength it ouercommeth in the same place, for through the colde aire and frostes, the Herbe is caused the tenderer and pleasanter.</p>
               <p>The Colewort ioyeth on a hill syde, or the ground stieping downe, it delighteth in dung, and encreaseth by the often weeding, as the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Rutilius</hi> hath noted: when sixe leaues shal be sprung vp, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The most auntient of the Greekes deuided the Colewort into three kindes only, as the crisped, which they named <hi>Selinoidea,</hi> for the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaues of Parselie, the same of them <hi>Lean,</hi> for the brode leaues issuing or growing forthe of the stemme, for whyche cause, some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it <hi>Cauloden.</hi> And the same whych properly is named <hi>Crabe,</hi> gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng vppe with thinner leaues, both single, and very thicke.

If the iuyce with the simple Sirupe of Borage and Senee equallie myxed, shall bee drunke morning and euening, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increase memorie, but remoue Melancholie. The floures raw eaten with distilled vineger and Sugar, do not onlye procure good bloud, but stay the tremblyng of the hearte, whiche like they in wine, and drunke, preuaile. The floures dryed and preserued for a yeare, doe like profite in all the abouesayd griefes, as the Hearbe doeth.

after the wringing forth of this tenderly applyed to the stomacke, and region of the heart, doe maruellously comfort the weake patient. The Syrupes both of the Borage and Buglosse, are applyed in Phisicke, for the only purpose of comforting.</p>
                  <p>To such hauing weake Lungs, and a drie cough, the Buglosse stie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Wine and drunke, greately preuayleth: for the roughnesse of the throte and cough only applye or drinke (as <hi>Galen</hi> instructeth) the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glosse boyled in Mulse, or water and Hony. The Buglosse stieped in Wyne, and tempered with Mellicrate, procureth after the drinking gladsomnes to the creature. It purgeth the redde Choller, proceeding of ouermuch heate, being often drunke with sweete Wine. This drunke in the like manner, recouereth the Cardiacke passion, yea it expelleth the noysome humors of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>The iuice of the Buglosse, remoueth the swelling of the feete, beyng drunke with warme water.</p>
                  <p>The Wyne for a time drunke, in which the Buglosse shall be stie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, doth preserue a good memorie.</p>
                  <p>The same wine of the floures stieped and drunke for a time, not only comforteth greatly the heart, but engendreth good bloud in the creature.</p>

                  <p>The water destilled in this Fornace, drunke vnto the quantitie of two or three ounces at a time, both morning and euening, dothe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellously remoue and asswage, both the gripings and swellings of the bellie, yea this cureth <hi>Dissenteria,</hi> and the hardnes of fetching breath.</p>

This with the redde Sarcenet layde on the eyes, dothe not only aswage the payne of them, but procureth a cleerenes of sighte, yea the water applyed on the eares and necke, dothe remoue the ringing and paine of the eares.

This also amendeth euery manner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation of the head, by drinking two ounces euery euening, before the going to bed. This drinke profiteth againste burning Feuers, and the Jaundise, and drunke or applyed with linnen clothes wette in it, doth speedely coole and amend the heate of the Lyuer.

                  <p>The water of the Hearbe drunke, amendeth the Jandise, clenseth the Leprie and Scabbes, and stayeth the stilling of the head.

that the same needeth small fatning, whereby it maye well agree to be sowen in shadowie places, neere to the Hedge or Herber in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and this especially requireth muche watering, for the speedier shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp. The olde Seedes, if we may credite <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> doe sooner come vp, yea and the elder Seedes are better for the turne: the plantes shot vp, do endure a long time without sowing any more, in such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that the owner or Gardener shall not neede to sowe or set of the plantes agayne, for fiue yeares after. The Parsely when it hath growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a yeare, it sendeth vp or beareth stalkes and Seedes, and a yealowishe floure. The new Seedes of the Parsely committed to the Earthe, doe most slowly come vp in beddes, in that these not before the fortith, yea fiftith and sixtith day after the sowing, do for the more part appeare, as the learned <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth, yet this ease and commoditie ensueth, that once sowen and come vp (as aboue vttered) it yearely encreaseth of the owne accorde, without renuing for many yeares. The Seedes as the worthy Neopolitane <hi>Rutilius</hi> witnesseth; ioy in any earth, and as well in the colde, as warme places, sauing the Seedes in the first commyng vp require much moisture, through which watering, they come so spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely strong, that after no ayre nor grounde hindereth them. Bothe the Seedes and plantes (as <hi>Columella</hi> instructeth maye prosperously be bestowed, to increase the speedier, neere to Springs, and little running waters.

were spoyled, committe them (as <hi>Columella</hi> willeth) to the Earth.</p>
               <p>Or the Gardener otherwise with lesser paine may procure them to growe crisped, in what manner soeuer they be sowen, if he turne on the bedde and plantes a round stone, or bigge roller, as soone as the plantes bee somewhat growen vppe aboue the Earth: and the like may the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doe with the plants come vp, if he treade them often downe.</p>
               <p>The best commended time, for committing of the Seedes to the Earth, is from the middes of May, vnto the Sommer solstice in June, in beddes thicke togither, and to be often watered, for that these speedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er encrease and come forward, through the heate in the same season. If the owner or Gardener woulde haue the Seedes sooner breake and shote vp, let him infuse the Seedes for a certaine time in Uinegre, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che bestowing in a well laboured Earth, fill halfe the beddes with ashes of the Beane coddes.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Endyue, otherwise named the Sycorie or soure Lettuce, serueth rather for the vse of Medicine, than for other purposes, so that by a trauel caused to grow acceptable in the Garden, for as muche as this of it selfe, by nature, is euermore soure, although it bee a kinde of the Lettuce, which ought often to be remoued and changed into sundry places, that the nature of it may on such wise be altered, with lesser trauaile to the Gardener.</p>
               <p>The Endyue thus bestowed in Beddes, may wel abyde the colde season of wynter, wherefore in colde Countries, this better agreeth to be sowen neare the ende of Haruest, and well growen vp, to be remoued and layde againe in the earth, that these, in the lying, may on such wise become whyte, if so be (before the couering) the Herbes be strewed ouer with riuer sande, and often watered (if not holpen by shoures of rayne) which then couer with light earth, letting these so rest, vntill by a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the watering, they become sufficientlye white for Salettes or other purposes. The yong plants of the Endiue are not to be remoued, before that soure leaues be sufficiently sprong vp, and these cutte at the endes of the rootes, aswel as the toppes of the leaues, with softe Cowe dung annoynted about the rootes, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bestowing in the earth, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che lightly couered, water so long, vntil the plants, be sufficient strong in the Earth.</p>
               <p>The Sycorie is of the nature of the Endyue, which in like maner retayneth the proper bitternesse, being not like remoued and ordered as the Endyue. This desireth a moyst grounde and the Earth to bee well laboured, when soure leaues be come vp: the plants after the remouing, ought againe to bee set in a wel dunged earth, and that these may yelde faire, large and long leaues, let the owner, after the leaues be somewhat more shot vp, or on the myddle of them lay a peece of a Tylestone, for by the waight of the same, wyll the leaues spreade out, and inioye more Touffrs or grow thicker. By this workmanly ordering, wil the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of the leaues be remoued, &amp; they aptly serue in the winter tyme,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19394:73"/>
for the vse of the Sallets, if so be the plants be set againe, in the ende of August, or rather in the beginning of September, when the leaues are shotte vp big, and in the pulling vp, the Earth not knocked of the rootes, but with soft Cow dung the rootes gentlye annoynted aboute, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed after in beds wel turned in with dung.</p>
               <p>The leaues layde along in wel dunged Beddes (to be white) couer so ouer with lose Earth, that the rootes maye lye vpwarde, and ouer them lying a long in the Earth, make some couerture in the forme of a her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring place, or rather strewe vpon them the chaffe or corne, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defence of the colde, and bitter windes.</p>
               <p>Certayne report, that the like may be purchased, if the owner, after certaine leaues of the Sycorie shotte vppe, byndeth altogither, with a browne threede, and couereth them after with a potte of Earth, to the ende that those may dayly drawe by the rootes, a nourishment from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, which by the same meanes, shall purchase both a whitenesse and tendernesse, and loose a greate part of the proper sourenesse.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Leeke for that it is a roote of the Garden to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and often vsed in the potte, therefore I will firste entreate of the same, whiche (as the moste skilfull reporte) desireth to bee sowen in a fruitfull and battle place, and lying especiallye open, whether the same be in a lowe place, as the worthye <hi>Rutilius</hi> writeth, and to these, that the beddes be leuelled, deepe digged, diligently turned, and very wel dunged. The husbandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in time past, noted twoo kinds of this herb, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one which grew into a head, like the Onion, and the other into many deuided blades, both long and straight, whose bush sprung vp, is wont to be cut neare to the grounde, and this with vs named the vnset Leeke. The owner or Gardner which would possesse vnset Leekes, oughte to cutte the greene blades come vp in the beddes, after twoo monethes of the sowing. For these (after the mind of the learned <hi>Columella</hi>) wil endure the longer, and encrease farre bigger, if after this cutting they be remoued and set againe, and how often the greene blades shalbe cut, so often the herbe is holpen wyth water &amp; new Cowe dung. And vse instructeth euery carefull owner as the saide Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoure reporteth, that in the remouing, suche skill muste be vsed for the newe setting, as when they be growen into a bignesse in the heade, to be remoued certaine distances asunder, as foure fingers breadth betweene eyther set, and when they shalbe growen to a farther strength and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to be agayne cutte. The Leekes oughte so often to be watered, dunged, and weeded, as neede requireth the same, and the place is to bee often raked ouer, wherby the plantes may encrease the better, through the helpe of the often killing &amp; casting forth of the vnprofitable herbs or weedes. As touching the Ciues and vnset Leekes, they may like be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in the earth, as the Leeke bearing the heade: And the seedes of these maye bee committed to the earth at any tyme, if so be the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner forceth not for the yelde of the seedes, but they otherwyse oughte to bee sowen in the Monethes of December, Januarie and Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arye, for the gathering and occupying after the Moneth of Marche, vnto the middes of Auguste. And the plantes after the sowing, when the blades bee well shotte vp, oughte lyghtely to bee troden downe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19394:88"/>
with the foote, and not to bee watered for foure dayes after. When the yong and tender blades bee shot oute of the seedes, and that the owner mindeth to haue the heades growe big, he ought not after the pulling vp to set them agayne, before all the small rootes bee cutte awaye, and the greene blades nighe halfe cut off, which done, that small pote shardes, or oyster shelles, be layde (as it were) right vnder eche heade, and then diligently couered with earthe, whereby the heades may so encrease the bigger, in the which dooing, the worthy Greeke <hi>Sotion</hi> forbyddeth the watering of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> til foure dayes after (if a drouth ensew) otherwise wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not at all. The skilfull Neapolitane <hi>Rutilius</hi> instructeth, that when the Leekes be growen to a finger bignesse, by cutting the blades halfe awaye, and the hearie rootes quite (leaste these seede and drawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the substance) then in the setting in earth mixed with sand and annointed fresh with Cow dung, let the plants be distante in beds well foure or fiue fingers one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, &amp; when these haue se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forth rootes sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t long, let the owner (gently putting vnder his Dible) raise soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the heades, that these remaining (as hanging in the Earthe) maye on suche wise fyll the roomes or emptye spaces by the greatenesse of the heades growing. And that in fewer wordes I vtter thys instruction, if so be the owner woulde enioy vnsette leekes, hee maye bestowe the seedes in beddes the thicker togyther. If these to growe into a heade, then the thinner in the earthe, and shall cause them to prosper the better throughe a dayly weeding, and feeding with freshe Cow dung.</p>
               <p>The seedes oughte to be committed to the Earth, in the moneths of Aprill, May, and June throughout, to possesse the herbes in the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, in the Harueste, September, and October, for to enioy the plantes in the Winter tyme, but these especiallye requyre, to bee often weeded and dunged, which growe into heades. The Leeke shall yeelde a far bigger heade and stemme, as after <hi>Columella Rutilius</hi> wrote, yea before them both the worthy Greeke <hi>Sotion,</hi> if in thinne linnen cloutes, or clothes muche worne, the owner shall bestowe and tye vp manye Seedes togyther, whyche so handled, to couer diligentlye wyth softe dung and earthe, and immediatly to water them so lying in the earthe, for these thus knitte vp (throughe the runnyng of the Seedes into one) will send forth leekes of a wonderfull bignesse, which practise also may the husbandly Gardner trye in the other seedes of plantes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:19394:88"/>I like experience wil come to passe, if the owner bestowe a Rape seede into the heade of a Leeke, with out making a hole, with anye Iron instrument, whiche so handled, sette into the Earth, for on suche will it grow verye bigge, as both <hi>Rutilius</hi> and diuerse Greeke instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Husbandrie report. There bee some, whyche makyng holes in the heade with a woodden pricke, or piece of Elder Cane, or else reede sharpened, bestowe (in place of the Rape) the Gourde seedes. Others there are, whiche taking vppe so many seedes as they can handsomely retayne with three of the fingers, and poured into a thinne Reede, doe commit those to the Earth, wyth softe dung couered and layed about, whiche practise doth euen like agree, to the former vttered.</p>
               <p>The sayde Greeke <hi>Sotion</hi> commendeth and affirmeth, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the seedes shall be sowen, the softe earth of the Beddes, bee troden wyth the feete into small and shallow furrowes, and the Beddes for three dayes (as if they were neglected) not watered at all, but in the fourth daye, to bee holpen through the sprincklyng of water on the Beddes, for suche wise handled, to the Blades commyng vppe, wyll growe (as hee reporteth) the more bushie and fayrer to the eye, yet if the owner, betweene the sowing and planting, shal mixe Sande with the Earth, the Blades wil shoote vp the fuller and bigger.</p>
               <p>The sayd worthy Greke <hi>Sotion</hi> addeth and affirmeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if the owner shal eate a little Cummyne seed before, he shal breath forth no stinking sauoure at all of the Leeke, although hee shall eate a great handfull at a tyme of the Leekes, for by eating of the Cummyne seed is the strong sauoure extinguished or put away.</p>
               <p>Here out of <hi>Petrus Crescentius</hi> I haue added, as a matter worthye of the noting, that the Leeke seede throwen into a vessel of wine, causeth that the wine soureth not, but rather that veneger returneth into wyne, that is, putteth away al the egernesse.</p>
               <p>This to conclude conceyue, that the Leeke in the eightenth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sowing, to shoote appeare (for the more part) aboue the Earth, and to indure for tenne yeares, after whyche tyme to yeelde seedes, and dye.</p>

                  <head>The Phisicke helpes of the Garden Leeke.</head>
                  <p>THe Leeke, after the minde of the auntient, heateth in the thirde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and dryeth in the second, especially, the Garden Leeke whose Seedes may wel indure to purpose, for two yeares.</p>
                  <p>The worthy Greke <hi>Sotio</hi> (of whom we haue afore mentioned) vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, in his singular precepts and instructions of Husbandrie, that the Leeke, brused and applyed, to cure the bitte of a venemous Beast, sooner than any other Medicine, and the seede of it drunke with the Licour of Reasons, to recouer and helpe the difficulties of makyng waters.</p>
                  <p>To these, to helpe and stay the long and olde spitting vp of bloude, if at conuenient tymes, in two drammes of the iuyce, with a like waight of the pouder of Myrtyl beries or Gaules, and the meale of Franken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence the same be drunke.</p>
                  <p>But the singular <hi>Hippocrates</hi> willeth the iuyce to b ministred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any myxture at al, &amp; forbiddeth the daylye, or too much eating of Leekes, in that this not only harmeth and dulleth the sight of the eyes, but offendeth the stomacke whych shall be procured the lesser harmeful, if so bee the Leeke shall so long be boyled, vntill it become (as softe in a maner) as pap, for on suche wise handeled, the same is supposed no lesse to norish than fleshe.</p>
                  <p>The iuyce of the raw Leeke (is recyted and accompted with <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>) among the venemous matters: for the report is, that <hi>Mela</hi> (a man of worthy Byrth) accused and sharplie blamed of <hi>Tiberius</hi> for mysu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the office giuen to hym of the prince, who after falling into mighty desperation, and drinking vnto the waight of three siluer pence of the iuyce of the Leeke, dyed immediately without griefe of body. But such like are rather with silence to bee ouerpassed, than opened for instruction sake.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phisicke helpes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Leeke twice sodden before the eatyng, draweth downe the Termes, procureth vryne, and obtayneth a superfluous heate. The iuyce of the Leeke my red wyth vyneger, applyed on the foreheade, stayeth the bleeding at the nose. The Leeke eaten raw causeth vomitting and is venemous, this also putteth away drunkennesse, being eaten raw.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:19394:89"/>The iuyce of the Leeke taken with womans mylke, amendeth an olde cough, and the vlcers of the Lungs. The Leeke brused and myxed with Salt, applyed on euil pushes healeth them. The Leeke brought into pouder, and tempered with the oyle of Roses and vineger, &amp; drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the eares, remoueth the griefes of them. The same also profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, in like maner applyed agaynst the toothe ache.</p>
                  <p>The Leek brused with Hony and applyed, purgeth vlcers, a plaister made of the same, &amp; applied on bruised members, doth not only aswage the swelling, but remoueth the bloud clotted.</p>
                  <p>The iuice of it drunk with womans milke, staieth the fluxe of bloud after byrth, the same also applyed with vineger, ceasseth the bleeding of the nose, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fine pouder of Frankinsence be added to it, and drawen by by the Nosethrels.</p>
                  <p>The iuyce of the Leeke drunke with Honye, profiteth agaynste paynes or aches of the Hyppes, the iuyce of the Leeke taken wyth Honye, recouereth all defaultes of the breaste and stomacke, the same ceasseth an olde coughe, and griefes of the breaste and Lungs: and it helpeth the dropsie, through the sundrye tymes takyng fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>Here I will not omit the practise out of <hi>Galen,</hi> that the Leekes tartnesse maye bee abated, and to engender the lesse wynde, if the same boyled in two waters, the colde Licoure in the ende be poured forth, and the Hearbe eaten, by whyche meanes it is sayde, that thys stayeth the flixe of the belly, and to amende a hoarse voyce, yea through the softnes of it, to make smooth the roughnesse of the iawes and mouth.</p>
                  <p>For to purchase a cleare and sounding voyce, <hi>Nero</hi> accustomed to eate the Leeke with Oyle, in certayne dayes of euery moneth, when hee contended for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> segniorytie of loude pronouncing and vttering of wordes. It whiche tymes, he only toke or eate nothing, sauing bread, as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth of him, which reporteth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this to be ment of the vnset Leeke, to which the prince <hi>Nero</hi> attributed a singular commendation.</p>
                  <p>If two partes of the iuyce, wyth a thyrde parte of Honye bee myred, and applyed into the Nosethrels or eares, doeth maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously helpe the greeuous paynes of the heade, the iuyce applyed vp, doth maruellously preuayle against the exulcerations of womens pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie places.</p>

                  <p>The Juice of the Leeke, powdred on suche woundes, whyche are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come colde and putrified, doth both clense away the rotten flesh, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the woundes if the Juice be mixed with the rootes of white Lillies and annointed warme on the hips, it doth speedelye remoue the ache of them.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Onyons haue a bodie compassed and compact with many cartilagies, there is none (I beleeue) whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che knoweth not.</p>
               <p>The auntient husbandmen (as witnesseth <hi>Columel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>) named these Onyons, bycause they grewe in one rounde heade togither, yet not ioyned togither with so manye heades round about, as the Garlike, which vnto this day is familiarly named the Onyon of the Husbandmen with vs.</p>
               <p>The Onions for the more parte oughte to be sowen in the moneths of Januarye, February, and Marche, in a fatte Earthe, well dunged, moiste, and diligently trimmed, whiche shot vp to some heigth, ought to be remoued in the moneth of Aprill, a good distance the one from the other, and these further growen, oughte carefully to bee weeded aboute, and often laboured to cause them growe the bigger, and to defende the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (in time of a blustering winde) by helps set against. The worthy Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane <hi>Rutilius</hi> writeth that the seedes desire to be bestowed in a fatte earthe, often tourned and raked, moiste and dunged, and red also, as the Greke <hi>Sotion</hi> in his husbandry willeth: which afore ought to be cast vp, that it maye putrifye throughe the colde and frostes in the Winter tyme, (as the skilfull <hi>Columella</hi> vttereth) after these the Earthe to bee dunged, and wythin twoo dayes after, the grounde leuelled forthe, and caste or trodden into beddes, all the rootes and vnprofitable hearbes afore clensed out. These workmanly handled in the moneth of March, being a calme and pleasante daye, the South or Easte winde (at that tyme blowing) the seedes shall workmanly be committed to the earth, wyth Sauerie intermedeled betweene them (as <hi>Plinie</hi> wylleth) for so
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19394:91"/>
the plantes prosper the better. The woorthie Greeke <hi>Sotion</hi> admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the Gardener which would set Onyons, to cut away all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye rootes and toppes of the greene blades (before the bestowing) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may growe to big heades. Others there are, whiche only pluck away the blades nigh to the root, for on suche wyse they sende the iuyce to the neither partes, to cause the head grow bigge: But these (after the mynd of <hi>Rutilius</hi>) ought in this maner to be placed or set thinne in bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and both raked and weeded (if these not often) yet foure tymes at the least, as <hi>Plinie</hi> willeth: who also taught, that t the ground be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged &amp; cast vp three tymes before the bestowing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seedes in the earth.</p>
               <p>If the Gardener commit seeds to the earth in the wane or decrease of the Moone, he shal possesse smal and soure ones, if the seeds in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Moone, then strong or bigge, and of a moyster taste, wyth the sourenesse maystred. But the same not to be vnreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred nor ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, that in al the kindes of Onyons, the same somewhat long and sharpe, is wonte to bee sourer than the rounde, and the redde one more than the white, to these the drye one, more than the greene, and the raw more than the boyled, the freshe also, more than that seasoned or poude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with salte, or the sodden one.</p>
               <p>The Gardener or owner shall possesse farre greater Onyons, if whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is a place or roome for the setting againe, they bee layed in Earth well laboured for twentie dayes space, and so long left drying agaynst the sunne, vntill all the moysture be gone or drawen forth by heate of the sunne, after the instruction of the worthy Greke <hi>Sotion,</hi> which <hi>Ruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> (out of <hi>Palladius</hi>) semeth greatly to mistake, in that he ascribeth the same to be done to the Dill, and not the Onyons, whose heades maye also be bared, by plucking off the vpper skinne, before the setting againe in the Earth, to prosper the better, and yeelde the bigger seedes, if they be set in the Earth well a hande bredth asunder.</p>
               <p>The heades to be eaten before the ful rypenesse, that these maye bee the sweeter, ought rather to bee sowen in a moyste grounde, among the young Plantes of the Cucumbers, Gourdes and Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p>If the owner wil rightly possesse, and gather the seeds in due season: when the greene stemmes are shotte vp highe, and yeelde bigge heads, they are then to bee guyded wyth two smal forkes of wooded, fixed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19394:91"/>
on eyther side (as <hi>Columella</hi> willeth) that the stems, though the stayes shoaring them vpright, maye not in anye bygge wynde, knocke the heades togither, to the spilling and losse of the Seedes on the Earthe, which are not asore to be gathered, that they inioye a blacke colour, as after the Greekes <hi>Columella,</hi> and <hi>Rutillius</hi> like vttered.</p>
               <p>The stemmes and knops, in which the Seedes are contayned, ought to be gathered in the decrease of the wane of the Moone, in a fayre and warme time, when the leaues or blades begin of themselues to wyther and drie, and that the seedes beginne to appeare blacke of themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, for then ought the stemmes to be plucked vp by the rootes, which knit togither in forme of garlands, or otherwyse bounde vp, to be layd in the Sunne to drie and rypen. The Onyons will continue long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted (as the sayd <hi>Sotion</hi> hath noted) if so the Onyons be put into hot water, or (as <hi>Plinie</hi> willeth) into saltie and warme water, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter layed in the hotte sunne, vntill they be through dry, which lette bee hidden or couered with Barly straw, and in such manner bestowed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nether touch other by any part. In many places, the Onyons be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the smoke and in Chimnies nere the heate of the fire, and on such wise preserue them a long time.</p>
               <p>The auntiente, and skilfull writers of Husbandrie vtter, that if the Gardener would possesse Onyons of a wonderful bignesse in the heade, the seedes of the Onyons put within the seedes of Gourdes, whyche so handeled, bestowe in moyste beddes, well turned in with dung, into a like bignesse, wil the heades of the Onyons increase, if the Earth digged rounde about, the small heades of the Onyons, in the heauing or lifting of the earth, shal be lifted vp, yet in such maner done, that the heades not quyte raysed out of the erth or plucked vp quite by the rootes, as I afore vttered to be wrought with the Lecke. The like also shall the owner obtayne, if boaring the heade of an Onyon, with a woodden pricke, in sundrye places, and putting into the holes Gourde seedes, he bestow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> togither in a wel laboured Earth.</p>
               <p>But in this place I thought not to omit, that if the Gardener shall commit the seedes of the Onyons in due tyme to the Earth, they wyll after growe into a head, but they shal yelde lesse stoare of Seede. But if the Gardener shal bestow little heades in the ground, the heades wil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whyther and ware drye, and be shotte vp into a round stemme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:19394:92"/>To these I adde, that the Onions plucked out of the ground and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the Earth, or hanged vp in ropes, do continue longer sounde in the ayre, but if we may creedit <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer Solstice, these, as the Penny royal, &amp; many other Herbes, do at the same time flourish, which may be as if they were of a doubtful life, that one whyle takyng nourishment out of the Earth, and an other whyles from the ayre. But the Onyons lightly budde and shoote out, not being in the earth, and sende forth fayre greene blades by occasion of the moysture in the hrades, but after the stemme shall bee full shotte out, the heades wyther.</p>
               <p>To whiche <hi>Plinie</hi> wrote, that the Nuttes bee contrarie, in that these do abate the strong sauour of the Onyon. I read that many skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Gardeners vsed to sowe the Onyons and Garlike neare to Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande floures (but especially the Rose) to procure them to yeelde a swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sauoure, and the same done by the counsel of the Auntient and the worthy <hi>Plinie,</hi> which (in my opinion) deserueth to be followed.</p>
               <p>Truely, this one thing is gretly to be maruelled at, that the Onyon alone of all other Hearbes, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth, receyueth no damage of the Moone, and hath contrary vertues of encreasing and diminishing to hir: for the Onio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becommeth grene and buddeth forthe in the wane or laste quarter of the Moone contrariwise she encreasing of Light, the Onion then withereth and rotteth.</p>
               <p>For which cause, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Egiptian <hi>Priestes</hi> in time past, refused the Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Religious meates, where otherwyse fruites, Hearbes, Trees, and Beastes, receyue a domage or diminishing and increasing through the occasion of thys starre, so that the Onyon onlye obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the contrarie turnes of the Moone, whose preseruing vnto wynter tyme, <hi>Columella</hi> prepared after thys manner, hee chose the Onyon or Sealiones (that are all alyke) whyche be not budded forth, or that greene blades appeared, and these dryed afore in the hotte sunne after which cooled agayne in the shadowe, by strewing vpon Tyme or Sauorie, he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by courses, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either of these strawed betwene in an Earthen potte, and by pouring the Licoure vpon, which was iii. parts of vineger, and one of Bryne: he strewed then a good handfull of Sauery (in such maner) that the Onions were couched or pressed vnder the Licoure, which when they had drunke vppe the Licour, and seemed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19394:92"/>
to lye drye, hee poured vppon and fylled the vessell wyth the like mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in an apte place set the pot to preserue them to vse.</p>
               <p>This one thing I will not omitte, althoughe the same maye seeme childish, in that it is noted by the learned man <hi>Cato,</hi> who writeth, that the letters drawen and written with the Iuice of the Onion, are inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, whyche then shewe and appeare euidentlye, when the paper shall be heated at the fire. To conclude, the Onions set in the middle of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guste in a red earth, doe yeelde the yeare following their high stemmes and seede, but the worser will those be, which are bestowed in the earth, to serue greene in the Lent time.</p>

                  <head>The phisicke commodities of the Onion.</head>
                  <p>ALthoughe the worthye Greeke <hi>Hippocrates</hi> more commended the sighte, than the eating of the Onion, saying that the same in sighte to be good and in body euill, forasmuche as it is hotte and burning: yet I purpose here to entreate somwhat of the phisicke benefits of the Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of these, parte faithfully gathered out of the Greeke, and parte out of the Latin writers, aswell phisitions, as cunning and moste dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent searchers of husbandly secrets.</p>
                  <p>The onion hath the propertie of heating in the fourth degree, and of a grosser substance, as <hi>Galen</hi> witnesseth.</p>
                  <p>The Greeke <hi>Sotion</hi> (both husbandman and phisition) is Authoure, that if any shal daily eat the tender Onion fasting with Hony, it shal maintaine the continuaunce of health. The saide authoure reporteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the same recouereth and cureth vlcers: to these, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueth the foule spots on the body, beeing diligently rubbed with it in the Sunne, and to profit the eares running, by dropping the Juice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. The same annointed, helpeth the swellings in the throat, and these rosted vnder hot embers, &amp; eaten with Oyle, doe healpe the cough.</p>
                  <p>The Onion after the rosting eaten wyth honye, dothe remoue the griefe of an euill stomacke: the Onyon eaten rawe harmeth the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in that it too muche drieth the moisture of the bodye: the Onion also eaten rawe, procureth a rough throate, and swelleth the stomacke: the Onion notwithstanding applyed with vineger on Piles, dothe in shorte time open them: the Juice of the Onion is profitably annointed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19394:93"/>
with hony for the clearing of the eyes, and bothe remoueth the Pinne and Webbes, and amendeth the bloude shotten eyes, the Juice annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a balde place, recouereth the heates shed away.</p>
                  <p>There be which affirme, that the greene Onion applyed with Uine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, doth helpe the bitte of a madde dog within three days, but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suppose that the Juice added with Rue, Salte, and Honye, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beating togither workemanly applyed, to performe the same. The often eating of the Onion, harmeth the Cholericke, by procuring them hotter and dryer in stomacke: but thys is to great purpose vnto the flewmaticke, in that it cutteth asunder, and consumeth the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humoures in them.</p>
                  <p>The Onion rosted in embers, &amp; applied with barly meale doth stay the dropping of the eyes, and helpe the vlcers of the Priuities: the Juice besides dropped with womans milke into the eares, is saide to amende the pain &amp; noise of the eares. Whiche also many haue giuen to persons sodainly swollen, by the drinking of water: and they haue prosperously gyuen the Onion, to suche as are molested wyth the perillous fluxe <hi>Dysenteria</hi>: and these applied, haue maruellouslye profited the griefes of the Loynes, and the Juice of them with the Juice of Fennell, expelleth and helpeth the water beginning betweene the fleshe and skinne, which togither with the Rue and Hony, recouereth the downe righte slumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and sleeping, and with reasyns or figs, applied on impostums, both ripeneth and speedely openeth them.</p>
                  <p>The Onions after the rosting vnder hotte embers eaten both mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening, not only helpe the paines of the breaste, but cause an easy spitting vp of grosse humoures, and purge the stomacke: the Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the mixing with hony and salte, applied on wartes, doth make them speedely fall off, euen by the rootes.</p>
                  <p>If the Onions be often vsed through theyr sharpenesse, they ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the stomacke euill humoures, procure thyrste, swellyngs and windinesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea cause headache, and to become foolishe, throughe the fumositie of them, ascending to the heade, and harme the Braine: for whyche cause, the daily and too often vsing hinder reason, and procure terrible dreames, if so be a weake person, newly crepte out of sickenesse, shall much eate of them, but especially rawe, in that these giue no nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishement to the body.</p>

               <p>The worthy <hi>Rutilius</hi> willeth, that when the stemme begynneth to appeare, to couer the same with Earthe after the treading downe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in suche maner to foresee, that it encrease not into a bushe or many blades, this so handled in the hard treading downe, to be dayly applied that the Juice may run to the roote, and cause the head to waxe the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The like of which <hi>Plinie</hi> in his time firste experienced. The worthy <hi>Sotion</hi> in his greke obseruations of husbandry: &amp; also <hi>Rutilius</hi> with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine others reporte, that if the cloues of Garlike heades be committed to the Earthe, and the like pulled out of the grounde, when the Moone shall bee discending and vnder the Horizone (as hidde to vs) that the stinking sauoure will in a manner bee extinguished so that the breath of the eaters, shall very little be felte: which <hi>Plinie</hi> seemeth somwhat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse to vtter, instructing that the heades (vnto the same purpose) oughte to be bestowed when the Moone shal bee vnder the Earthe, and to bee gathered when the Moone shall bee in coniunction, or wyth the Sunne.</p>
               <p>The saide Greeke <hi>Sotion</hi> seemeth to affirme, that the Garlike heads maye bee caused to growe sweete of fauoure, if in the setting the kernels of Olyues (after the ioynyng wyth them) be bestowed togyther in the Earthe, or the sharper endes blunted on some stone, and then commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the earth, or else in the setting, that lies of the Oliues be bestowed with the cloues. The singuler <hi>Didymus</hi> (<hi>Ruellius</hi> noting the same) vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, or rather <hi>Sotion</hi> (as the Greeke copy sheweth) that the lothsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or stinking sauoure by the eating of Garlicke heades is abolished or put away, if the greene and rawe beane bee soone after eaten. Others there are, which will the roote of the Bete to be eaten, after the rostyng vnder hotte embers, affirming the same to be sufficiente to remoue the strong sauour: Also with the like remedy <hi>Menander</hi> one of the Greeke writers witnesseth, as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth of him, the sauour to be dissebled
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19394:95"/>
and bidde. Oure later writers of husbandrye and Phisicke reporte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the rancke sauour of Garlike may be extinguished, with the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eating of greene Parsely blades.</p>
               <p>The commodiouser &amp; apter time for gathering of the Garlike heads is in the decrease or wane of the Moone, the daye beyng drye and faire, when the blades be withered, that they leaue or hang downe.</p>
               <p>Many of the aunciente writers of husbandry vtter, that the Garlike heades will endure a long time, and be to better purpose afterw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But the heads handled after either manner, doe for the more part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine barraine, or prosper not after the bestowyng in the earth. To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it was sufficient to haue dried them ouer the heate of the fyre, that they mighte after growe. The learned <hi>Plinie</hi> vttereth, that those heades of Garlike bee of a sowrer tast, whiche possesse the more cloues round aboute, and he addeth that no more loathsomnesse or strongnesse of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour doth consist in them after the seething, than in the Onion like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Nor hee omitteth not, that the Garlike heades afore eaten, to be in steed of the white Neeswort for the Pioners, if they minde to auoide &amp; escape the hazard of deathe. There is another wild Garlike, which the Greekes name <hi>Ophioscoridon,</hi> in english <hi>Ramsies,</hi> growing of the own accorde in the fallowe fieldes, through whiche the Kines milke by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the greene blades, is caused to sauoure of the Garlike, yea the chese made of the same milke, doeth sender in the eating the like ranck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sauour: The husbandmen name this both the wild and serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Garlyke.</p>
               <p>This Garlike on suche wise boyled, that it may not growe againe, and bestowed on beddes, doth greatly auaile against the harme of birds to Seedes, as afore is uttered in my first part, there writing, that the same of <hi>Plinie</hi> is named <hi>Alum.</hi> But here commeth to minde a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous matter, not to be ouerpassed, whiche is, that neither the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell nor Squirrell will after the tastyng Garlike presume to bite anye fowles, by whiche practise. Pullets and other soules in the night bryng sprinkled ouer wyth the lycoure of the Garlike maye bee defended from

harme of eyther of these.</p>
               <p>There is yet a matter more worthy the remembrance, and the same farre maruelouser, which <hi>Volateranus</hi> vttereth, that in his tyme hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a husbandeman to sleepe open mouthed in the field by a hey cocke, caste vp in the Haruest tyme, which when he had unwittily suffered an Adder to creepe into his body, wyth the eating incontinente of Garlike heads, was (as by a certain preparation against poison) deliuered, yet the venome &amp; death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adder, consisting or remaining within the body di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled &amp; shed forth in the coeating a matter to be marueled at of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise.</p>
               <p>But this also is maruellous in the Garlike, that if it be boiled wyth a salte lycoure, the same dothe effectuouslye destroye the mites or little wormes in either peason or beanes, so that the walles and floores of the barnes be wet with this mixture. Here also I thought not to ouerpasse the maruellous discorde of the Adamant stone and Garlike, whiche the Greekes name to bee an <hi>Antipathia</hi> or naturall contrarietie betweene them, for suche is the hatred or contrarietie betweene these twoo bodies, (lacking bothe hearyng and feeling) that the Adamante rather putteth awaye than draweth to it Iron, if the same afore be rubbed with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as <hi>Plutarchus</hi> hathe noted, and after hym <hi>Claudius Ptolemaeus.</hi> Whiche matter examined by dyuerse learned, and founde the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, caused them to iudge, that those skilfull men (especially <hi>Pt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the same as last, shal here be placed, that diuerse Garlike heades hanged on the braunches of trees, do driue far off birdes from the spoyling of fruites, as the like <hi>Democritus</hi> noted in the Greeke instructions of husbandry.</p>
               <p>That bigge Garlike named of certaine skilful Authours the Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Garlike, is of far bigger increase, than the Garden Garlike with vs. Whiche the worthye Greeke <hi>Sotion, Columella</hi> and <hi>Rutilius</hi> instructe, that the cloues to bee broken from the heade, and bestowed in a white ground, well laboured and dressed without any dung, and set in high ridges of beds, to the ende y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> natural moisture of the earth, nor shoures

               <p>The tyme commended for setting of the cloues, is in the moneths of January, Februarye, and Marche, but some will to bestowe them in the Earthe, from the beginnyng of October, vnto the ende of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, well a hande breadth asunder, and vnto the middle ioyntes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a finger deepe in the Earth, whyche growen vppe to some heigth, to be often weeded aboute, and the Earth diligently raked, wherby the plantes may the better prosper.</p>

But they are to bee plucked vp to vse, before that the March vyolettes be in their full pride and flourish, for if these be longer suffered, as vnto the time of the perfit flourishing of the violettes, they are then founde feeble and wythered. And for to knowe when the Scallions are rype, it behoueth the Gardener to marke whether the blades beneath be wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, for on such wise seene, denoteth the ful rypenesse of them.

Besides these, the heades are muche endomaged throughe the resorte of Mice and Moles, whiche greatlye couet to feede on the rootes or Onions of the Saffron.</p>
               <p>The remedies against these twoo noyouse Beastes, are fully taught in my firste parte, whiche the reader maye resorte vnto.</p>
               <p>The heades are rather to be bestowed in the Earth, than the Seedes, in that the Seedes (after the committing to the Earthe) prosper not.</p>
               <p>The heades are to be sette on ridges, in the month of Aprill or May, and the heades layd on a heape, to lye and wither in the shadowe from the Sun beames, for the space of eight days before, whiche done, to set them with the hearie rootes in the Earth well laboured and dressed, and a lengthe one by another, well halfe a hande breadth asunder, and three fingers deepe. Certain there are which will them to be set for the better yeelde, after the middes of Auguste, vnto the middle of September, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these so to remaine for twoo or three yeares, and that euerye yeare in the month of Aprill and May the leaues or blades then dry, to break off orderly, the other prospering to weede aboute, and to raise the earth after, twoo fingers deepe, but in suche manner, that the heades bee not touched.</p>
               <p>After that the hearbes be sufficiently clensed, when as the flowers be withered and deade, especiallye in Auguste and towards Haruest, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, flourishe not aboue a moneth, then these are to bee gathered in the morning after Sunne rising, and after the drying by a gentle fire to be kepte togyther in bagges of leather, in a close and drye place.</p>
               <p>And this one thing as maruellous, is worthy to be noted, that the roote or Onion standyng quite oute of the Earthe, yeeldeth notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

the proper floure of continuance but a daye or twoo after the full openyng, at the season of the yeare: but the heade afterwardes (as depriued of nourishement) withereth and rotteth.</p>
               <p>The blades be freshe and greene all the winter throughe, in that the heades be full of iuice, and sufficient strong to endure the colde season. When the Saffron is set, and in the thirde yeare digged vp, there are founde aboute eche heade fiue or sixe heades growing, and ioyned togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wythin the Earthe.</p>
               <p>The beste Saffron is the same, which is freshe and newe, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the goodnesse of coloure, in such maner, that the toppes in whiche the Seedes are contained be white, and mixed with a rednesse: the chiue also is not lightly broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and rubbed in the hand, coloureth the skin, and is in sauour comfortable, wyth a gentle sharpnesse.

The Saffron (as <hi>Vitalis</hi> writeth) doth greatly amend the feebling of the hart, and weaknesse of stomacke. The saffron comforteth palsey members, and softneth the hardnesse of partes: for the which cause, the same named Oxicrocie, is right profitable. The Saffron remoueth the griefe of the eyes, eyther of bloude or other blemishe, if with rose leaues broughte to powder, and mixed with the yolke of an egge, the same be applyed in playster forme on a linnen clothe to the eye. The Saffron remoueth all swellings and griefes of the eyes, if the same be especially mixed wyth wine, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in plaister forme.</p>
                  <p>The Saffron is profitable mixed with womans milke and annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the distilling of the eyes. The Saffron remoueth drunkennesse, drunke with Cuite.

               <p>The skilfull Neapolitane <hi>Rutilius</hi> reporteth that the Rape or Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nup (as the Nauew) prospereth vnder euery aire, and desireth to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in a fat and loose earthe, and the same so loose, that it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner falleth to pouder, whereby the Seedes may prosper, and come the speedier forward.</p>
               <p>The seedes also are to be bestowed with fine poudred Earthe, to the ende the plantes may not come vp too thicke togyther, about the ende of July, vnto the middes of September: and if raine happen not the daye before, then the day folowing, moisten the grounde with water gently sprinkled vpon.</p>

Yet thys manner of trauaile, to possesse them in the sharpe winter, is little in vse with vs, bycause the Radishe can ill abyde the bytter ayre, which once bytten and taynted with the frostes either wythereth, or soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dieth, yet the learned <hi>Plinie</hi> wryting of the Radish vttereth the same to ioye so much in the colde ayre, that in Germanye hath sometymes bin seene a Radish, which grew in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe so big as an infants middle.</p>

               <p>The rootes are caused to growe the sweeter in eatyng, and more delectable in taste, if the leaues be broken off (as <hi>Plinie</hi> hath noted) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Radishes shoote vp into a stemme.</p>

For thys no doubte hath often bene proued, and profited many by vnderstanding of the secrete.</p>
               <p>This no doubte is a secrete very maruellous, that the Radyshe in no wise agreeth to be placed or growe nigh to the vine, for the deadlye hatred between them, in somuch that the Uyne nere growing, turneth or windeth backe with the Braunches, as mightilye disdayning and hating the Radishe growing fast by: If we may credite the learned <hi>Plinie, Galen,</hi> and the Neapolitane <hi>Rutilius,</hi> whiche seeme to haue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently noted the same.</p>
               <p>And the reason they reporte to be like as afore vttered of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Coleworte with the vyne, whych is, through the hyd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of natures consisting in them, so that if the places were changed, yet for all the remouing, will they in no manner ioy togither.</p>
               <p>Of whiche <hi>Androcides</hi> affirmed the Radishe and Colewort, to be a sigular remedie against drunkennesse, so that the auntient in Greece, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ioined and matched the drinking of wine, with the Radish, as I afore vttered in the Chapter of the Coleworte, so that no maruel it is, if these bee vsed so common.</p>
               <p>The Radysh in time past hath bene of suche accompte, and so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily esteemed, that <hi>Moschion</hi> the Greeke wrote a large pamphlet of the worthy prayses of the same: yea the Radishe before other meates, was so preferred in Greece, that at <hi>Delphos</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Appollo,</hi> the Radishe was esteemed as Golde, the Beete as Siluer, and the Rape
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19394:107"/>
or Turnup as Leade.</p>
               <p>The Radish also is sayde to polishe very fayre the yudr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a heape of salte, doth alter and reduce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same into a watery pickle.</p>
               <p>The Radish to conclude, in the remouing and settyng again, looseth the sharpnesse resting in it, and this hath a singular delight in the rinde, so that the same bee newe gathered and not too olde of growth, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the example of many seldome eaten, do vnaduisedly refuse and omyt the vsing of it.</p>
               <p>And drawing to an ende, I thinke it righte profitable to vtter the makyng of vineger with the Radishe, as the learned <hi>Petrus Crescentius</hi> (in his work of Husbandry) hath noted the same. The rootes of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish (sayth he) being dryed and brought to fyne pouder, and bestowed into a vessel which hath wyne in it, let stande to settle (after the well laboring and mixing togither) for certayne dayes: which done, the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner shal enioy a Radish vineger, very laudable and much commended for the dissoluing and wastyng of the stone in the kidneys, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paynful griefes.</p>

                  <head>The Phisicke benefites and helpes of the Radish.</head>
                  <p>THe Garden Radish (after the mynde of the learned, heateth in the thirde degree, and dryeth in the seconde, but the wilde Radishe in phisicke causes, is more effectuous.</p>
                  <p>This one incommoditie (among the physicke helpes) doth the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish possesse, which is, that it procureth many tymes belching, after the eating at Supper: for a remedye of this annoyaunce or incommoditie, may bee or shee incontinent rate, certaine braunches of Isope, Tyme, or Organy, or rate the roote with pure Oyle.</p>
                  <p>And for thys one incommoditie ioyned wyth it, the roote yeeldeth a maruellous number of benefites, for the health and case of persons.</p>
                  <p>Here further learne, the other incommodities written by the wise, whiche are, that the Radishe eaten, eyther before or after meales, doth cause wynde, the resting of the stomacke, dulleth the brayne, eyes, and reason.</p>
                  <p>The singular Greeke <hi>Florentinus</hi> (in his instructions of Husbandry)
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19394:107"/>
writeth, that the Radish doth profit very muche the Fleumaticke, and maruellously helpeth the stone in the kidneys, and stopping of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine by Grauell: If any especially boyle the rinde with white wine and water, and drinketh the same morning and euening, or the rynde of the Radish brused and strayned, and drunke fasting in the morning, and that the patient shall perseuer or continue wyth the same for certayne dayes.</p>
                  <p>The freshe rynde after the steeping in whyte wine for eight houres drunk with a fourth part of the pouder of Medler kernels, like auaileth.</p>
                  <p>The Radish taken fasting in the morning, with warme water pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, procureth vomytyng, for whiche matter, the Phisitions rather appointe the seedes boyled, than the roote. If the roote be eaten wyth oyle Oliue, it stayeth the belchings of the stomacke, whiche are woonte to bee caused by the same, in that the oyle suffereth not such winde to rise.</p>
                  <p>The iuice drunke with Cuite, cureth the kings euil, and drunk with water and Hony, amendeth the cough, whiche on such wise ministred, doth helpe those fetching the winde short and painefullye.</p>
                  <p>The whole substaunce of the roote, so muche auayleth agaynste poyson, that takyng the same fastyng, it shall nothyng harme the creature.</p>
                  <p>And the handes annoynted with the iuyce of the Radishe, as afore vttered in my first part, may handle Serpents without feare.</p>
                  <p>The iuyce of the Radishe dropped into the eares, doth speedily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage the winde and noyse in them, the same drunke with water and Hony, recouereth the Jaundise. The leaues boyled in porredge in steed of Colewortes, and eaten sundry times, amendteh the stoppings of the Liuer and Mylte.</p>
                  <p>The seedes brused and giuen wyth white wine, is right profitable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all sorts of poysons, and other dangerous diseases.</p>
                  <p>And if any by a punishemente, receyue grieuous strokes and spottes by whypping, by brusing, and applying the Radish on the places, shall speedily cure them.</p>
                  <p>The same also cleareth scarres and reduceth wanne spottes vnto the persit colours, and remoueth the pimples in the face: this besides de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth the quartayne Ague, if the same be dayly giuen by the way of a vomite, at the comming of the fit.</p>

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:19394:108"/>The iuyce of Radish boyled wyth Hony, and after the adding of a lyttle vineger, the same strayned and drunk, profiteth against the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ague, and stopping of the Mylte.</p>
                  <p>The Radish applyed in plaister forme, deliuereth the water betwene the skinne, and helpeth a hard and swollen Splene, as <hi>Dioscorides</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth.</p>
                  <p>The Radish well digesteth, being eaten wyth meate at Supper, for it heateth the stomacke, yet the same causeth a strong breath, by sleeping soone after meate.</p>
                  <p>The Seedes after the brusyng drunke wyth whyte wyne, doe cause vryne, and drunke wyth vyneger, aswageth the swellyng of the Mylt.</p>
                  <p>The iuyce annoynted on olde vlcers, both cleareth, and eateth awaye the Canker in them, the lyke perfourmeth the pouder of the roote.</p>
                  <p>The Radish boyled with Mulce water or Hony and water, and drunke warme, amendeth an olde coughe: it remoueth the clammy Fleume of the breaste, by spitting vp, in the dayly drynkyng for certain dayes.</p>
                  <p>The freshe ryndes of the Radish well brused and taken with vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Hony procureth the patient to vomite, the like perfourmeth the Seedes, drunke warme with water.</p>

                  <p>If a round flyee of the Radish be applyed on the nauyl, it doth spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely ceasse the grypings in women, as the skilfull <hi>Hippocrates</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
                  <p>The often eating of the Radish, procureth plentye of Mylke to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gyuing sucke and Nurses.</p>
                  <p>The iuyce of the roote drunke with Hony, sendeth down y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Termes, and expelleth the wormes in the bellie: the iuyce gargelled wyth Hony and vineger, aswageth the swelling in the throte.</p>

                  <p>The Sirrupe of Poppy helpeth the reume, cough, and lacke of sleepe, by preparing it after this maner: Take of the newe heades both of the white &amp; black Poppy one pounde, of raine water foure pints, boyle these so long togither, vntil a pinte and a halfe remaine, to whiche after the straining adde of Suger, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pennites, of eche six ounces: these boile

The Cucumber besides (after the sentence of <hi>Varro</hi>) is so named, for the crooking of it, and the Greke phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions named it both <hi>Sicyon</hi> and <hi>Sicys,</hi> for that it staieth and represseth (as <hi>Demetrius</hi> writeth) the veneriall acte, throughe the coldnesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in it.</p>
               <p>But leauyng further to vtter of the kindes, let vs come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in teaching what diligence is required, about the well handling of the Cucumber.</p>
               <p>The Seedes after the minde of the Neapolitane <hi>Rutilius,</hi> desire to be bestowed in furrows not thicke togyther, and these raised well a foote and a half high, but in breadth three foote, and between the furrowes muste the owner leaue spaces of eyghte foote broade, whereby the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers (in the growyng) maye freelye wander and spreade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade.</p>
               <p>These after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vp, need neither to be raked nor weded about,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19394:112"/>
for that in theyr fyrst comming vp, they ioye and prosper the better, by growing among other herbes, of whiche these are greatly strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ayded.</p>
               <p>The plants creepe a long, on the Earth, and spredde into braunches muche like to the Uine, whiche for the weakenesse of the stalke, are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on suche wise to spreade abroade on the grounde, except these be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise shored vp in their growing, with proppes workmanly sette in the Earth, for the better staying vp of the weake armes and braunches, that the fruites corrupte not by lying on the Earth.</p>
               <p>The Seedes for the more parte, appeare by the sixte or seauenth day after the sowing: being sufficientlye moistned with store of water for that space and time, by a pot or pottes of water dropping continually downe with a liste or wollen clothe hanging foorth of the mouth of the potte, which manner of watering is named filtring.</p>
               <p>Thys kinde of wateryng, is one of the chiefest matters required, in that the plantes prosper and come speediest forward through the muche moisture, in which they mightilye ioye: Yet these are muche hindered, and greatly feare the frostes, and colde ayre. For which cause the plants oughte at suche colde times to be workmanly fenced wyth mattresses of strawe diligently spred ouer them. The skilfull <hi>Rutilius</hi> writyng of the workmanly orderyng of the Cucumber, willeth the Seedes to bee committed to the Earthe in the moneth of Marche, and for daunger of the colde or frosts, to couer the beddes with mattresses of straw, vnto the middle of Maye, at whiche time the plantes oughte to be remoued, and sette againe into beds wel dunged and thicke layde for to run foorth and creepe abroade on the grounde, but the plantes yeelde the more: if they be bestowed in beds wel filled with earth &amp; dung, and these raised aboue afoote highe.</p>
               <p>In the bestowing of the Seedes in the earthe, the owner oughte to haue a care, that hee sette the Seedes in beddes a lengthe, and these well twoo foote asunder one from the other, herein considering whether the Seedes be broken by the eighte or tenthe daye followyng, whyche founde ryther harde or broken, doeth denote a perfectnesse or goodnesse of the Seedes: But these in a contrary manner descerned softe, are vnprofitable, and to bee caste awaye, in whose places o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers requyre to be set, prouing by the sixte or eighte day, if the Seedes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19394:112"/>
bee broken or otherwise soft, which in a contrary manner seene, bestowe others in the places, as aboue taught.</p>
               <p>The plantes, after the comming vp, neede not to bee weeded in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner, for as muche as the plantes better prosper and growe the fairer, by comming vp among other Herbes, of whiche these take a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</p>
               <p>If the seeds before the sowyng, be stieped for two days in sheeps milk as <hi>Rutilius</hi> willeth, or in water and Hony, as <hi>Plinie</hi> instructeth, or in Sugered water, which cause the Plantes, after their perfite growth, to yeelde Cucumbers, (both swete, tender, white, and most pleasant, aswel in tast, as in sight, as the singular <hi>Columella</hi> hath uoted, and before him the Greke <hi>Florentinus,</hi> also after both, <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Palladius,</hi> to al which experience confirmeth.</p>
               <p>The Gardener which woulde possesse Cucumbers timely and verye soone, yea and all the yere through, ought (after the mynde of the Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane) in the beginning of the Spring, to fill vp old worne Baskets and Earthen pannes without bothomes, with fine sifted Earth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered afore with fat dung, and to moysten somewhat the Earth wyth water, after the seedes bestowed in these, which done, when warme and Sunny dayes succeede, or a gentle rayne falling, the Baskets or Pans with the plantes, are then to bee set abroade, to be strengthned and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by the sunne and smal shoures: but the euening approching these in all the colde season, oughte to bee sette vnder some warme couer or house in the grounde, to bee defended from the frostes and colde ayre, which thus standing vnder a couer, or in the warme house, moysten gently with water sundry tymes, and these on such wise handle, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyl al the Frostes, Tempestes, and colde ayre bee past, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the same ceasseth not wyth vs, let aboute myddes of Maye.</p>
               <p>After these, when oportunitie or an apte daye serueth, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener shall bestow the Baskets or Pannes vnto the brymme, or deeper in the Earth well laboured and trymmed before, with the rest of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to be exercised, as afore vttered: which done, the Gardener shall enioye verye forwarde and tymelyer Cucumbers than anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Thys matter may bee compassed, both easier, in shorter tyme,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19394:113"/>
and with lesser trauel, if the owner (after the cutting of the waste bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, doth set them in wel laboured Beds, for these in far shorter time and speedier, do yelde fayre Cucumbers.</p>
               <p>This one thing I thinke necessarie to be learned, for the auoyding of the dayly labour and paynes, in the setting abroade and carrying into the house, either halfe Tubbes, Baskettes, or Earthen Pannes, whiche on this wise, by greater facilytie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> may be done, if so be the Gardener be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe the vessels with the plantes, in Wheelebarrowes, or suche lyke with wheeles, for these, to mens reason, causes maruellous easines, both in the bestowing abroade, and carrying again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The yong plants may be defended from cold and boistrous windes yea frostes, the colde ayre, and hotte Sunne, if Glasses made, for the only purpose, be sette ouer them, whiche on suche wise bestowed on the Beddes, yeelded in a manner to <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> Cucumbers all the yeare, in which he toke a greate delight, as after the worthy <hi>Columella,</hi> the learned <hi>Plinie</hi> hath committed the same to memorie, which euerye day obtayned the like, as he writeth.</p>
               <p>But wyth a lesser care and laboure, may the same be perfoumed, as <hi>Columella</hi> writeth, if in a Sunny and well dunged place (sayth he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sundry roddes set a rowe, aswel of the Osior as Bremble, and these so planted in the Earth, after the Equinoctiall of Haruest, to cut a little wythin the Earth, whose heads after the wider enlargyng with a stiffe wooden pricke, to bestowe softe dung eyther within the pithes of the Osiers and Brembles consisting in the middes: these done, to fixe or putte Seeds of the Cucumber into the places, which after the growing to some bignesse, ioyne with Oslers and brembles.</p>
               <p>For the plants on such wyse growyng, are after not fed with their owne, but as it were by an other mother roote feeding, whyche by the same meanes yeelde Cucumbers, that wyl indure the colde season and frostes.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Plinie</hi> vttereth the same matter, admonyshyng here the reader, of the wrong instructions of <hi>Columella,</hi> although he seemeth to alledge an Authoure, for whych cause it shal bee to great purpose to heare the sentence of <hi>Plinie</hi> in this, who remouing the erroure of <hi>Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella</hi>

vttered, that Cucumbers may be enioyed all the yeare greene, instructeth and willeth, that the greatest roddes of the Bremble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bee set agayne into a Sunny place, where these be cutte, well two fyngers long, aboute the Equinoctiall Spring or myddle March, and into the heades of these, after large holes made, the Seedes to bee bestowed lying especiallye within the Pythes of the Brembles, and fylled wyth softe dung, whiche done, that fatte dung and fyne Earth, after the well myxyng togyther, ought to bee thycke layed, and dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye heaped aboute the rootes, which maye the better resyste the colde.</p>
               <p>But howe so euer these ought to bee handeled, it well appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that <hi>Plinie</hi> doth dysagree wyth <hi>Columella,</hi> in thys instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Plinie</hi> wylleth these to be set, about the Equinoctiall Spring, but <hi>Columella,</hi> aboute the Equinoctiall Haruest, as the Neapolitane <hi>Rutilius</hi> interpreted and noted the same, to whom, as it shoulde seeme, he bare a fauoure.</p>
               <p>The plantes muche feare the Thunder and Lyghtning, for whych cause, the Gardener may not set nor remoue them at those tymes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides if the tender fruites bee not couered ouer wyth sheetes or thynne Couerlets, when such Tempests or stormes happen, they commonlye after perish and wyther.</p>
               <p>The Gardener myndyng to possesse long and tender Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, oughte to sette vnder the young, fruites growyng, an Earthen Panne, Bole, or halfe Tubbe fylled wyth fayre water, wel fiue or sixe fyngers, yea halfe a foote distaunce from them, for these by the nexte daye, wyll bee stretched vnto the water, so that settyng the Pannes lower into the Earth, or raysyng the fruites higher, ye shall daylye see them stretched forth towardes the water, vnto the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the owner, for the length of them, which depriued of their vessels of water, shall in a contrarie manner see them wynded and crooking, so muche these ioye in the moysture, and hate the drouth. The fruites likewise wil grow of a maruellous length, if the floures be put to grow wythin hollowe Canes or Pypes of the Elder. But the same, is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19394:114"/>

               <p>But there muste be a special care, as <hi>Columella</hi> (after the Greke <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentinus</hi>) admonisheth, that no woman, at that instant, hauing the reds or monthly course, approcheth nighe to the fruites, especially handeleth them, for through the handling, at the same tyme, they feeble and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If she in the place be like affected, shal she after kyl the yong fruites, with hir onlye looke fixed on them, or cause them to grow after vnsaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or else corrupted.</p>
               <p>The Cucumber will yelde fruites without seedes, if three dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sowing, the seedes be stieped in oyle <hi>Sesaminium</hi> or Sauine oyle (as the Neapolitane <hi>Rutilius</hi> hath) noted, or that the seedes afore be ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the iuyce of the Herbe named of <hi>Plinie Culix,</hi> or as the same in Greeke may be coniectured <hi>Coniza,</hi> in English Fleabane.</p>

               <p>The weake and tender braunches, shot vp to some heigth, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueting by a certaine propertie in nature vpward, require to be diuersly aided with poles to run vp in sundry manners, as either ouer a rounde and vaulted Harboure, to giue a more delighte, throughe the shadowe caused by it, and the seemely fruites hanging downe, or else by poles directed quite vprighte, in whiche the Gourde (of all other fruites) most earnestly desireth, rather than to run braunching and creeping on the

               <p>The plants loue a fat, moyst, and dunged loose ground, as the Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan <hi>Rutilius</hi> in his instructions of husbandry hath noted: If a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be bestowed in the ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> watring of them, the plants require a lesser care and trauaile, in that they are very muche furthered, by the store of moisture, although there may be found of those, which resonably prosper with small store of moysture, or being seldome watered, and that they of the same yeelde fruite of a delectabler taste.</p>
               <p>If the owner or Gardner happen to commit Seedes to the Earthe in a drye grounde, and that the tender plants appear aboue the Earth, hys care shall then bee, to water them plentifullye for the speedier shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp after this manner: by taking certayn pottes filled with water, into whiche tongues of clothe afore layde to the bottoms of the pottes, that these may the workmanlier distill and droppe often on the plants, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stouping forward of them: which no doubt, profiteth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the plantes in drowth and hot seasons.</p>
               <p>The longer and smaller haue fewe Seedes in them, and for the same more delectable in the eating, yea these better accompted of, and solde in the Market.</p>
               <p>The Gardner minding to committe of the Seedes to the Earthe, oughte afore to stiepe them in a boll or panne of water for a nighte, whereby the Seedes apte to be sowen, may the surer be knowen, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hee shall well perceiue by those resting in the bottome, of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninger sorte preferred and vsed, but the others, swimmyng aboue (as vnprofytable) and seruing to no vse, are willed to be throwen away.</p>
               <p>The chosen Seedes are to be set in beds two togither with three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers vnto the middle Jointes, and the sharper endes fixed vpward, but the beds afore oughte to be digged two foote deepe, and so many broad, and the Seedes bestowed well three or foure foote asunder, one from the other (in these filled vp with olde dung,) well turned in with the earth, or rather to procure them speedier to grow and yeelde the fruite the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, lette the beddes be filled with hotte horse dung, new taken oute of the stable.</p>
               <p>If the Gardner woulde possesse Gourdes of diuers formes, as long, rounde, and shorte, it behoueth hym to choose and sette the seedes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinglye. For those Seedes taken oute of the necke of the Gourde,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19394:117"/>
shall the owner after the councell of the singular <hi>Columella,</hi> learned <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> and <hi>Rutilius,</hi> set in well dunged ground, with the sharpe endes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. Which after the well watering (as aboue taught) yeelde fruits, long in fourme, tenderer, and better esteemed. The Seedes taken oute of the myddes of the bellye, and sette into the Earthe with the bigge endes vpwarde, doe yeelde (after the husbandely handeling) and watering, greate fruites, rounde, and large, of whiche after the through drying, and meate taken oute, bee bottels and other vessells made, to serue for diuers vses, in that these growe farre larger in the belly, than any of the other kindes.</p>
               <p>The Seedes taken oute of the bottome of the Gourde, and set with the grosse or big endes vpwarde, doe also yeelde after the workmanlye ordering, fruits both greate and large, yet these far lesser and shorter. And the Seedes in generall, in what place they bee sette, oughte to be bestowed in earth well dunged, and the rather with hot horse dung, new taken out of the stable, if these bee set in the moneth of March. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seeds in no maner, may be bestowed in low places, lest shours of rain falling, hinder and corrupte the fruites, throughe the ouermuche water cloying and standyng in the Alley or other low place. The plants shot vppe to some heigthe, oughte to bee diligentlye weeded aboute, and the earthe heaped highe vp, and when neede requyreth in the hot seasons, to water them often.</p>
               <p>If the Seedes happen to bee set in a Earthe smally laboured and hollowe, when the plants be somwhat growen aboue the grounde, the owner oughte to digge away of a good depthe from the yong plantes, the Earthe rounde aboute, that the rootes may the freelier runne and spreade abroad: the plants further growen and shot vp, may the owner erecte to runne and spreade like to a Uine, well a mans heigthe.</p>
               <p>If the plantes happen to be annoyed with the Leke or Garden fleas, the owner shal remoue and driue them away, by the only setting of the herbe Organye, in sundry places among them, on whiche (if these happen to lighte) they eyther are incontinente killed, or caused to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease but few after, as the Greeke writers of husbandry, in their skilful practises witnesse. Out of which with diligence we haue also gathered these, that to the owner or gardner, may happily appere profitable: as the Gourde (a matter somwhat strange) to yelde fruits without seeeds,
<pb facs="tcp:19394:118"/>
If the Seedes before the setting be stieped for three dayes at the least, in <hi>Sesaminum,</hi> or Sauine oyle, as the Neapolitane <hi>Rutilius</hi> vttereth, or in the Juice of that hearbe infused, named <hi>Conyza,</hi> in Englishe Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane.</p>
               <p>The like may bee wroughte, if after the condition of the Uine, the principallest and firste stemme shotte vp, be on such wise digged about, that alonely the heade of the same be lefte bare. Whiche as it shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, muste the owner repeate, yea a thyrd time, if neede shall require the same.</p>
               <p>And in this doing, muste the owner haue a care, that as the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches spread foorth (whether vpright or on the ground) to be cutte away, herein preseruing only that stemme, which shot foorth last.</p>
               <p>The Gourdes on such wise handled (as the Cucumbers afore noted, will yeelde fruits without seedes, possessing only Cartilages, and a softe pulpe within. If the owner would possesse fruits timely and very soone, then after the instruction of the Greeke writers of husbandry, bestow in earthen pannes or olde baskets without bottomes, fine sifted earthe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled with dung, aboute the beginning of the Spring, in which the Seedes sette, sprinkle and moisten sundry times with water: after this, in faire and Sunny dayes, or when a gentle shower falleth, set them abroade, but when the Sunne goeth downe, bestowe the baskets with the plants within the house againe, and these like order so often (and water when neede requyreth) vntill all the frostes, tempests, and colde season be gone and paste. After this assoone as oportunity and time wil serue, and that a faire day be presente, bestowe all the baskets and pans of earthe vnto the brimme, in well laboured and dressed beddes, and applie that other diligence requyred, throughe whiche the Gardner shall possesse timely fruite, aswell of the Gourde as Cucumber.</p>

               <p>If the Gardner couereth to enioy diners formes on Gourds, or sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry caracters on Cucumbers, let him bestowe the floure or tender yong fruite of either, as the same shall yet be hanging on the braunche, into a moulde of like bignesse as the fruite. Which to handled, will after cause
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19394:118"/>
whether the same be Gourd or Cucumber, to possesse on the vpper face, the like figure or caracters, as were afore imprinted within the mould.</p>
               <p>For the fruite of either after the minde of <hi>Gargilio</hi> so muche desireth a newe forme, that it like representeth the Image or figure imprinted within the mould. In somuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of what form the mould of the Gourd shal be fashioned, on such maner shal the fruite grow within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mould: And <hi>Plinie</hi> for confirmation of the same reporteth, that he sawe many Gourds fashioned in their ful growth after the forme of a winding dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. If the owner endeuoureth to possesse long and slender Gourdes, he muste bestowe the yong fruites newe growen, and hanging still on the Uine branches, either into a Truncke of wood, or a long Cane boored throughe all the Joyntes, whyche in tyme growing, will stretch and shoote foorth into a maruellous lengthe. For the same substance which shoulde encrease into a breadth, is caused throughe the hollowe pipe to stretch and growe slender, wherby the narrownesse of the hole so hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the bignesse of growth, procureth the fruite to runne into a length, as the like Gourde by the same occasion, <hi>Plinie</hi> sawe to extend wel nine foote of lengthe. The like fruites altogither shall the Gardner purchase, if vnder the vines, he set of some deepenesse in the grounde earthen pans filled with water, and they distante well fine or sixe fingers from the Gourdes hangyng downe. For by the morrowe or nexte daye shall hee see the fruits stretched euen downe to the water, by which leading and handling of the pans with water they may be caused to grow of a wonderfull length.</p>
               <p>But the pannes for a time remoued or taken away, will cause the fruites to crooke and winde vpwarde, so muche of propertie they ioye in moisture, and refuse or hate the drouth: yet of the oyle is otherwise to be learned, for somuch as they deadly hate the same as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, whiche if in the steede of water it be set vnder the fruites, causeth them by the nexte daye to winde an other waye.</p>
               <p>If this likewise they can not do, yet doe they wrythe, and as it were disdainyng the same crooke vpwarde after the manner of a hooke, as a like forme of the fruite may be tried in one night space.</p>
               <p>This one matter oughte especially to be cared for, as <hi>Columella</hi> after the Greeke <hi>Florentinus</hi> warneth, that no woman come or verye sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome approche nighe to the fruites of the Gourdes or Cucumbers,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19394:119"/>
for by hir only handling of them, they feeble and wither, whiche matter if it shall happen in the time of the Termes, doeth then eyther flea the yong tender fruites wyth hir looke, or causeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vnsauery, &amp; spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or corrupted within. The Gourds determined to bee kepte for seede, ought after the minde of <hi>Rutilius</hi> the Neapolitane to hang stil on their Uine, vnto the Winter time, and cutte or broken from the same, to bee dried eyther in the Sunne or in the smoke: for the Seedes otherwise are prone to putrifye, and not after profitable to any vse. The Gourdes and Cucumbers will endure, and be kepte a long tyme freshe and faire to the eye, if they be hyd &amp; couered wyth white wine lyes, not ouer egre or sowre, in the hangyng down in pipes or hogs sheads. They bein like maner defended and preserued by bestowing them in a pickle or brine. But they will a long time continue freshe and faire (as the worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structers of husbandry reporte) if so bee they hang so highe wythin the vessels, that they be nothyng neare to the Uineger. And the vessells appointed for the only purpose, shall diligently be pitched ouer &amp; round about, least the spirites of the Uineger in the meane time breath foorth, whiche by nature otherwise is penetrable, thorough the thinnesse of partes. The Cucumbers maye in like maner bee kepte for a long tyme if they shall bee bestowed in a vessell of distilled Uineger: for on suche wise they putrifye not, as hathe bin tried of the skilfull searchers of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creates.</p>
               <p>Thus by these practises, may the owner enioy faire Cucumbers and Gourdes all the Winter to vse, whyche if the Gardner will, shall hee also preserue a long time, if whyle the fruites be tender, hee cutte them off, and scalde them in hot water, and after laye them abroade all the night to coole, and bestowe them on the morrowe into a sharpe pickle or brine, made for the only purpose, whyche on suche wise handled, wil maruelous well endure, vntill the newe be come.</p>
               <p>In this place commeth to minde, and that very aptly, the same whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <hi>Athenaeus</hi> bosted, as touching his strange feast that he prepared for his friends, and especiallye in that he serued them with greene Gourdes for a dainty dishe, in the moneth of January, which so pleasauntly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured and eate, as if they had bin new gathered, in a manner. Which like, by study and diligence of the gardners that exercised this arte, they supposed them to be preserued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:19394:119"/>As the like <hi>Nicander</hi> long before <hi>Athenaeus</hi> and many others report, who will the Gourds to be firste dried in the ayre, and stitched through the heads with a strong packthreed, to be after hanged vp in the smoke, that the pots filled with them, maye leysurely soke all the Winter, and drinke in of the Brine.</p>
               <p>At this day in Fraunce, throughe all the Winter moneths, are the Gourdes hanged vppe in the roofes of their houses, to bee preserued for daintye dishes greene, when occasion offereth to vse them, especiallye those whiche are named the Citrones, that farre longer endure, and bee not so lightly subiecte to putrifying.</p>
               <p>The fruites of the Gourdes, Melons, Pompons, and Cucumbers, may be caused to loose and purge, like to many others, if the seedes bee stieped for a nighte and a day in the licoure made wyth <hi>Ruberbe, Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, Turbith, Senae, Colocynthis, Scamonie,</hi> or other simple purgyng medicines, and those after the bestowing in the Earth, watered for fiue dayes togither, and fiue times euery day. When the Gourde is felte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasaunte, the fruites by the stieping, may after receyue what sauoure and taste the owner will, if the seedes before they bee committed to the earth, be infused for a time in any pleasaunte licoure, whether the same be damaske or muske water, for the plantes shootyng vp of these, will yeelde fruite of like sauour, aswell being sodden as rawe, after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Cucumber.</p>
               <p>The like altogither may be wroughte or caused without any arte, if whiles the fruite is a seething, you bestowe in the licoure what taste, coloure, or sauoure you desire to haue. For the Gourde and Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are of suche a kinde, that they be voide of any qualitie.</p>
               <p>The rinde of the fruite of the Gourde growen to full ripenesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth so harde as woode.</p>
               <p>The Gourd planted in the ashes of mans bones, and watered wyth oyle, yeeldeth fruite by the ninth day, as the auntient <hi>Hermes</hi> affirmeth.

                  <p>The learned <hi>Galen</hi> writeth, that the Gourde in no manner maye bee eaten rawe, in that the same is vnpleasaunte to eate, but either sodden rosted, or fryed in a panne, is well commended.</p>
                  <p>The Greeke writers of husbandry doe report, that the Gourd doth loose the belly, and that the Juice of the same dropped into the grieued eares, caused of heate, they affirme to profit, vnto whyche vse of it self, and with the oyle of Roses dropped warme into the eares.</p>
                  <p>The outwarde rinde pared away, and the meate with the kernels, not fully ripe, heated or parboyled in water, and after shred small like to the Cabbedge, and boyled with butter, Onions, and a quantitie of Salte. This on suche wise prepared and eaten, profiteth leane men.</p>
                  <p>Others after the cutting of the vnripened fruite into round slices, boyle them with butter in a dishe like Apples.</p>
                  <p>The wine standyng for a night abroade, in the hollowe of the freshe Gourde, and drunke with a fasting stomacke, purgeth gently the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye costiue.</p>
                  <p>The meate of the Gourd, after the seedes taken foorth applied, helpeth the cornes of the toes and feete: the Juice of it boyled, and rubbing the mouth therewyth, fastneth loose teeth, and assuageth the paine of them, proceeding of a hot cause.</p>
                  <p>The seedes of the Gourde cleane picked from their skinne, being sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Barly water, strayned, and druncke, healpe the inflamations of the liuer, kidneys, and bladder, the impostumes of the breaste, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh vrine.</p>
                  <p>If a sicke persone of the Feuer, refuse to drincke of this water, a Sirroppe then with Sugar, may be compounded of the same, whyche mightily profiteth all kindes of Agues.</p>

                  <p>When the winter approcheth, the seeds ought to bee taken foorth of the fruite, and these rubbed wel with Salte, that the clammy humours may on such wise be remoued.</p>
                  <p>The seedes ought after to be layed in a drye place, wherby the proper moysture may not corrupt them, and those seedes like prepared, wil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for three yeares.</p>
                  <p>The pieces of the rynde of the Gourde bruised, and annoynted or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in playster forme one the heades of Infants, doth aswage the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation or burning caused of the braine, the peeces or iuyce of the same applyed, doth like mytigate the burning Goute, and qualifye the inflammation of the eyes.</p>
                  <p>The Gourde after the fine shreddyng, applyed in playster forme, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swageth tumours and swellings, the drye Ashes applyed on burnings, doth maruellouslye auayle, the Ashes also of the ryndes applyed on vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the priuy place, beginning to putrify, both purgeth, and bringeth them to a scarre.</p>
                  <p>The iuyce of the Gourde, after the boylyng wyth a little Honye and Nytre drunke, gentlie looseth the bellye, the same iuyce myxed wyth the Oyle of Roses, and annoynted on the Rydge bone and Loynes, cooleth the burning of the Feuers, this besides annoynted, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the shyngles.</p>
                  <p>Here learne that the Gourde rosted, or boyled in a dish or frying pan is more holesome, than rawe, for that through the rosting, it leaueth a great force of waterie moysture, and therefore yeeldeth a stronger and worthyer nourishment.</p>
                  <p>The Gourde sodden, requireth a tartnesse to bee matched wyth it, for the same otherwyse, is felte vnsauerye and wythout delyghte, so that it better relisheth, being matched with eyther salte, soure, or tarte thyngs, that nerer agree to the benefit of our bodie, and the same ought to be on such wise prepared, that it procure not the creature to vomyt, as the singular <hi>Galen,</hi> hath clearely vttered.</p>

For which cause <hi>Palladius</hi> nameth all thys kynde of forme of apples, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, or as if a man should say he named them aplewise or Quincelike, which are not wonte to hang, as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, but to growe rounde
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19394:121"/>
on the grounde, and they are then growen to a ripnesse, when the stalke is parted from the bodie and a sweete sauour from the belly striketh to the nose. Further those growing after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of a Quince, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly are named Mellons, haue a harder and tougher meat than Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and they not onlye enioy lesser wrinckles on the rynde, but bee dryer, grosser, whyter of flesh, and haue more Seedes than the Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
               <p>The other kynde named Cytrons, bee in fourme and coloure lyke to the Cytron, and the leaues of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> branches deuided into many smal, partes after the forme of feathers or wyngs of Byrdes.</p>
               <p>The other kynde named the wynter Pompons, are nothyng so bygge of growth, as bee the common Pompons of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>But the best kynde of al, are the Mellons, next the Turkysh Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and those made sweete by Arte, when the seedes before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing in the Earthe, are for a night layed in water wel mixed wyth Suger. or in Hony.</p>
               <p>The Mellons and Pompons hardly come vp in any Countrie at due tyme of the yeere, without a labour, cost and diligence of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener in hastning them forward, nor these caused wel to spreade &amp; yelde, before the greate heate of the yeare become, which season, some yeare, hapneth diuerse and intermedled wyth colde, and either ouer drie, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moyst, which much hinder the ripening of them in the haruest time and towards the vyntage. For which cause the Gardener ought to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the fruites forwarde by dung<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and heate of the beds, which alwaies procure a more helth to persons. The seedes of Mellons to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Earth, ought to be suche, whiche haue bin kepte wythin the fruite, vnto the full rypenesse of the same: for these then taken foorth of the Mellon be more worth, &amp; reserue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proper substance within the bodies If the owner would possesse the fruites of the Mellon time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ought afore to infuse the seedes in luke warme water, for sixe or tenne houres, and those after to beestowe in Beddes prepared, aboute the tenthe daye of Marche, well three or foure foote distaunte one from the other, and the Beddes to caste well two foote high, and so manye broade, and to fyll them wyth olde dung fynely broken, and with blacke Earth sufficiently loose wrought togither, for on such
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19394:122"/>
wise handeled, they yeelde a bigger fuller and pleasaunter fruite. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine skilful Gardeners bestow horse dung in Beds, so hot as the same commeth forth of the stable, to cause the plants farre sooner to shoote vp, and they turne vpwarde sixe or tenne of the seedes of the pompone wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sharpe endes downward (as certayne do foure or fiue of them to come vp) and those they lightly couer ouer, wyth much beating or tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Earth downe on them. <hi>Rutilius</hi> in his Husbandry, willeth the seedes, both of the Mellon and Pompon, to bee thinne set in beddes, in suche manner, that the seedes bee placed well two foote asunder, and the places well digged and diligentlye turned in wyth fyne dung, for the plantes ioye in a libertie, that they may spreade at wyl hyther and thyther, and are greately holpen by other Hearbes growyng among them, as the Cucumbers are, so that they shall neede but little ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and pluckyng away of other Herbes.</p>
               <p>After these, for daunger of the colde and frostes, the owner may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the plantes and Beddes, with light mattresses made of strawe, or wyth mattes spreade on roddes, shored vp with forckes sette at eache corner of the Beddes, or hee may for a seemlyer sight, laye abroade boordes or Tables on pillers or other stayes of stone, set at eche cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Beddes, in suche manner, that the bordes may bee lifted off, when the Sunne shyneth hotte, and sette ouer agayne, at the going downe of the Sunne or when the colde ayre is felte.</p>
               <p>And assoone as the Mellon hath yeelded leaues sufficiente greate, the Gardener ought to water the same gentlye and softlye, wyth a lyste sharpened at the ende hangyng foorth, and broade at the other ende (restyng wythin the Potte or Dishe ful of water) whych on suche wyse continually moysteneth (by the droppes falling) the Earthe very drye.</p>
               <p>The Mellons further growen, the owner ought to remove, and sette the plantes agayne, when the fruites are yeelded so bygge as Orenges, and thys especiallye muste bee done after the myddes of Maye, when as the colde of the yeare is well spente, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse myght hynder the growth of them, and sette well sixe foote distante one from the other, in Beds dilygently dunged and labored.</p>
               <p>The Pompons purchase a far greater sweetenesse, and pleasanter in taste, if the seedes afore bee steeped for three dayes in water well mixed

with Suger, or in water and Hony named Mulse, and in like maner y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruites are found sweete in the eating, if the seeds steeped in new Cow milke, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> then set in well dressed Beddes.</p>
               <p>The Pompons in like manner wyll obtayne a sauoure of Roses, if the seedes afore be layed among drye Roseleaues for twentie or thirty dayes togyther, and those after wyth the leaues, sette in well dressed beds, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seeds steeped in Rosewater, or other odoriferous licour, which after the drying in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shadow, then as afore vttered, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mited to the erth.</p>
               <p>As the worthy Authoure <hi>Florentinus</hi> in his Greeke instructions of Husbandrie writeth, and after hym the lyke that worthy <hi>Rutilius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I thynke it a matter not to bee omitted, that Cats by an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire couet the Pompons, for which cause the owners haue a care to loke diligently thereunto.</p>
               <p>To procure Pompons to continue a long tyme without decaying or corrupting, let the owner water the plants for a time, with the iuyce, of Houseleeke.</p>
               <p>The other matters to be learned, are fully taughte in the secretes of the Cucumbers &amp; Gourdes, where many deuises are vttered, that may be vsed common. As if the owner woulde enioye timely fruites, and hauing straunge formes on them, big, laxatiue, and without Seedes, let him diligently reade and consider the former Chapiters, both of the Cucumber and Gourde.</p>
               <p>The Mellons and Pompons ought then to bee gathered, when the stalkes begyn to feeble, and the fruites to yeelde a pleasaunte sauour in the eating, at whiche tyme the owner muste diligentlye take heede of Cattes, that haue an earnest loue and desire to them, as afore is vttered</p>
               <p>Also the Gardener ought to conceiue, that those named the wynter Pompons, do neuer growe to a ful rypenesse on their beds, and for that cause, to procure them speedily to rypen, hee must (after the gathering) hang them vp in the roofe of the house, and eate of those, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare yellowe within.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Diphilus</hi> reporteth that the meate of the Pompon doth make fat, yet very hardly digested, through coldnesse myxed wyth the moysture of the same, besides it rendereth a small nourishmente, and hardly moueth the bellie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phaenias</hi> reporteth, that the Pompon must bee eaten after the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke is emptie, for that this otherwise is lightly conuerted into those humours, which of the same occasion hinder digestion, throughe the preeminence that it then obtaineth in the receptakle of the meate or sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he willeth the Pompons, to be eaten with a fasting sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and to pause from eating anye other meate, vntill this in the stomacke be halfe digested.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diphilus</hi> writeth, that the Pompons eaten, do greatly aswage vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heates of the stomacke, and mytigate wicked Agues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth, that all kindes of Pompons, haue the propertie of cooling, and enioy a large moysture, yet those not without a manyfest qualitie of clensing, in that the seeds maruellously clense the face of sun burning, of pymples, and foule spottes.</p>
                  <p>This Authour further addeth, that the same doth yeelde and cause a wicked iuyce, although it may sometymes be wel digested of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</p>
                  <p>Besides he affirmeth the same to cause Choler, and to yeelde the plentie of moysture out of order.</p>
                  <p>The Pompons ought to bee eaten for the firste meate, but in suche maner that such which are fleumatik to drink olde wine after the same, &amp; the Cholericke, to drinke some soure or tarte thing after it, for on such wise handled, is all manner of harme auoyded.</p>
                  <p>For this kind of meate doth lightly alter into Choller, or floume, for which cause the ouer sweete Pompon doth offende the Chollericke, and the fruite vnrype the fleumaticke.</p>
                  <p>Many worthy men prefer the long Pompons before the rounde, yet do all the kyndes moue or loose the bellye, and cause vrine, so that they shalbe ripe. For which cause they are iudged profitable for the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,

but the seedes more auayle, in so much that stones there prepared they maruellously expel.</p>
                  <p>The outwarde rynde of the Pompon applyed to the foreheade doth effectuously aswage and stay the running of the eyes.</p>
                  <p>Such which haue a hotte stomacke, and encombred wyth Choller, are greatly harmed, if they drinke wine after the eatyng of the same, in that of the owner nature it is lightly caused, and the wine immediatly increaseth it more, and causeth a sharper humoure in suche bodies, and apte to vomyte: yea thys also extenuateth, grosse and clammye humours, yet doeth it well agree, that the fleumaticke eate of the Pompon, for as muche as in the same is a substaunce tender and soluble, that is, the same which is next to the seede, for this doeth not lightly corrupte.</p>
                  <p>The persons whych eate of the Pompons, maye not immediately eate and other meate after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that those both corrupt, and alter the same eaten.</p>

               <p>This hearbe named the Blessed Thistle, requireth to be sowen in a well laboured grounde, and the seedes oughte to bee committed to the Earth in the firste quarter of the Moone, but those not to bee bestowed in beds, aboue three fingers deepe.</p>
               <p>The Hearbe also ioyeth and well prospereth commyng vp among Wheate.</p>

                  <p>THe hearbe of quality is hot and drye, whiche the bitter taste of the same well demonstrateth, besides it drieth and somwhat digesteth.</p>
                  <p>The Hearbe hathe the nature and propertie of opening, the stopping of members, of pearcing and causing vrine.</p>
                  <p>The blessed Thistle eyther eaten or drunke delyuereth the patiente from the mightie paine of the heade whyche vexeth aboute the eyes: thys also putteth awaye giddinesse of the heade, restoreth (by a like reason) memory loste, the hearing, and diseases of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>The leaues broughte to pouder, and drunke in wine, consume and sende foorth the fleume of the stomacke, but the leaues are the better and handsomer taken, if of the pouder pilles be made.</p>
                  <p>This in like manner purgeth the breaste and bloud, and very muche profiteth the consumption of the Lungs. The leaues boyled in Wine, and drunk hotte, doth ceasse gripings, prouoke sweate, breake the stone, and helpe the monethly Termes.</p>
                  <p>The hearbe for a time vsed, comforteth the braine and sight, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the same be eaten, but if the eyes also be annointed therewyth.</p>
                  <p>When the Juice of the hearbe cannot be had, then let the pouder, or the Hearbe it selfe dryed, be stieped for a nighte in water, and the eyes washed with the same. The Juice also dropped into the eyes, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the blonde consisting in them.</p>
                  <p>The blessed Thistle refraineth or stoppeth the bleeding of the nose, or mouthe, if the hearbe be applied to the place, from whence it runneth.</p>
                  <p>The pouder of the same hearbe purgeth the <hi>Vuula,</hi> the Jawes, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19394:125"/>

                  <p>The herbe drunke in wine, amendeth a weake stomacke, procureth an appetite to meate, and abateth the heate, yea this consumeth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill bloude, and engendreth the good.</p>

                  <p>The blessed Thistle boyled in the water of a healthfull male Childe drunke, profiteth the dropsie persons, healpeth the plague, and dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all impostumes, yea this remoueth the Canker and falling sicknes. The pouder of the leaues, vnto the quantitie of halfe a walnutte shell at a time druncke in wine, is a most presente remedy against the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, if the same shal be receyued within foure and twentye houres space of the tyme grieued. If wine be boyled wyth the hearbe, and druncke, profiteth the like: this by a like manner receyued, amendeth the rotten Feuers of the stomacke, and suche encumbred wyth the Feuer Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. The downe proceeding of the flowers of the blessed Thistle, applied on deepe cuttes, and newe woundes, doth in shorte tyme cure them wythout paine.</p>
                  <p>The pouder of the herbe mixed with meale, and a plaister employed of the same with hot Uineger, helpeth the pushes and other swellings of the plague. The hearbe cureth any maner of burning, and the blisters proceeding of the same: if afore dryed, and mixed with the proper Juice it be applied on the places.</p>
                  <p>Thys Hearbe druncke wyth white wine, remoueth the Colliks, and putteth awaye feables the Hearbe chawed in the mouthe, amendeth a stincking breathe: the hearbe also brused, and applied on botches spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely cureth them, yea this recouereth the defaultes of womens places, and causeth the Termes.</p>
                  <p>The bitte of venemous beastes maye bee holpen, eyther wyth the Juice, or decoction of the herbe in water, the pouder of the hearbe eaten or drunck, helpeth stitches in the side, and the pleurisie &amp; this also profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

infantes incombred with the falling sicknesse, and wormes.</p>
                  <p>Manye worthy phisitions affirme, that the pouder or Juice, or the decoction of this herbe doth expell al maner of poysons: The example of whiche matter, <hi>Hieronimus Tragus</hi> (in hys Herball) learnedly vttereth, wher he reporteth, that ther was a certain yong maiden, which vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing thereof, did eate poyson in an apple giuen to hir, whose body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continente swelled, and no medicine coulde assuage the swelling, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that the distilled water of this hearbe was ministred to hir, whiche in short tyme mitigated or abated the swelling, to the wonder of many, so that on this wise the child was deliuered from al peril of the poyson.</p>
                  <p>A like history reported of others, that a Childe happened to sleepe in the fielde open mouthed, into whose mouthe an Adder crepte and wente downe into the bodie, but after twoo ounces of the distilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ministred, the Adder incontinente crepte foorthe agayne (by the fundamente) wythout further harme or hurte vnto the Chylde. Wherfore against all poysons, they affirme the pouder, Juice, decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or distilled water of this hearbe, to be a singular remedy applyed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within or without the body: But after the taking eyther of these, the patient ought to be diligently couered with clothes, that hee maye well sweate for three houres space.</p>
                  <p>The wine made in Haruest of the blessed Thistle, and druncke in the tyme answerable, profiteth and healpeth all the griefes before vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>

                  <p>THe time and order of distilling of the same, is that the hearbe alone, about the ende of May be distilled.</p>
                  <p>The water distilled of the blessed Thistle druncke vnto the quantitie of twoo or three ounces at a time, both morning and euening, putteth away headache, comforteth memorie, helpeth the giddinesse of the head, and recouereth especiallye all the griefes of the eyes, althoughe they bee but washed with the same.</p>
                  <p>The water in like maner taken, profiteth suche being in a consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body. The water in like quantitie drunke both morning and euening, breaketh the stone, and cureth any burning, by often, applying,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19394:126"/>
linnen clothes wette in the same.</p>
                  <p>The patient molested with the Quartayne or anye other Ague, by taking three ounces of the distilled water of the hearbe fastyng, well a quarter of an houre before the fytte of colde beginning, and lying down to sweate, be well couered wyth clothes: shall within certaine fittes so vsing hymselfe, be deliuered either of the one or other Ague, the like doth the decoction of the hearbe or the pouder druncke hot with wine.</p>
                  <p>Against eating Cankers, or any other putride vlcers, there is scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found any other worthier than the leaues, the Juice, decoction, or water of the blessed Thistle. And notable diseases hathe the hearbe recouered, especiallye in women, whose breastes were eaten and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed with the Canker, euen vnto the bare ribbes, by clensing first the places wyth this water, and applying after the pouder of the hearbe, which on such wise handled, healed them in shorte time.</p>
                  <p>And Bathes are profitably made of this hearbe, for the dissoluing of the stone, and prouoking of the Termes.</p>
