            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42437:7"/>
in a perfect Merchant.</p>
               <p>1. He ought to be a good Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a good Arithmetician, and a good Accomptant, by that noble order of <hi>Debtor</hi> and <hi>Creditor,</hi> which is uſed onely amongſt Merchants; alſo to be expert in the order and form of <hi>Charter-parties, Bills of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Invoyces, Contracts, Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> and <hi>Policies oſ Enſurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He ought to know the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Weights, and Monies of all forraign Countries, eſpecially where we have Trade, &amp; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not onely by their ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, but alſo by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſique values in weight &amp; fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, compared with the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of this Kingdome, without which he cannot well direct his affaires.</p>
               <p>3. He ought to know the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Tolls, Taxes, Impoſitions,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42437:7"/>
Conducts and other charges upon all manner of Merchandize ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or imported to and from the ſaid Forraign Countries.</p>
               <p>4. He ought to know in what ſeveral commodities each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try abounds, and what be the wares which they want, and how and from whence they are furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the ſame.</p>
               <p>5. He ought to underſtand, and to be a diligent obſerver of the rates of Exchanges by Bills, from one State to another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may the better direct his affairs, and remit over and receive home his Monies to the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage poſsible.</p>
               <p>6. He ought to know what goods are prohibited to be expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or imported in the ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Countreys, leſt otherwiſe he ſhould incur great danger and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42437:8"/>
loſs in the ordering of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>7. He ought to know upon what rates and conditions to fraight his Ships, and enſure his adventures from one Countrey to another, and to be well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the laws, orders and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Enſurance office both here and beyond the Seas, in the many accidents which may happen upon the damage or loſs of Ships or goods, or both theſe.</p>
               <p>8. He ought to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in the goodneſs and in the prices of all the ſeveral materials which are required for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repairing of Ships, and the divers workmanſhips of the ſame, as alſo for the Maſts, Tackling, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, Ordnance, Victuals, Muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Proviſions of many kinds;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42437:8"/>
together with the ordinary wages of <hi>Commanders, Officers</hi> and <hi>Mariners,</hi> all which concern the Merchant as he is an Owner of Ships.</p>
               <p>9. He ought (by the divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions which happen ſometime in the buying and ſelling of one commodity and ſometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to have indifferent if not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge in all manner of Merchandize or wares, which is to be as it were a man of all occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations and trades.</p>
               <p>10. He ought by his voyaging on the Seas to become skilful in the Art of Navigation.</p>
               <p>11. He ought as he is a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, and ſometimes abiding in forraign Countreys to attain to the ſpeaking of divers Languages, and to be a diligent obſerver of the ordinary Revenues and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of forraign Princes, together
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42437:9"/>
with their ſtrength both by Sea and Land, their laws, cuſtomes, policies, manners, religions, arts, and the like; to be able to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof in all occaſions for the good of his Countrey.</p>
               <p>12. Laſtly, although there be no neceſsity that ſuch a Merchant ſhould be a great Scholar; yet is it (at leaſt) required, that in his youth he learn the Latine tongue, which will the better enable him in all the reſt of his endeavours.</p>
               <p>Thus have I briefly ſhewed thee a pattern for thy diligence, the Merchant in his qualities; which in truth are ſuch and ſo many, that I find no other profeſsion which leadeth into more worldly knowledge. And it cannot be denied but that their ſufficiency doth appear likewiſe in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent government of State at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42437:9"/>
Luca, Genoua, Florence,</hi> the low Countreys, and divers other places of Chriſtendom. And in thoſe States alſo where they are leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, yet is their skill and knowledge often uſed by thoſe who ſit in the higheſt places of Authority: It is therefore an act beyond raſhneſs in ſome, who do diſ-enable their Counſel and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (even in books printed) making them uncapable of thoſe ways and means which do either enrich or empoveriſh a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, when in truth this is only effected by the myſtery of their trade, as I ſhall plainly ſhew in that which followeth. It is true indeed that many Merchants here in <hi>England</hi> finding leſs encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to their profeſsion than in other Countreys, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves not ſo well eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42437:10"/>
as their <hi>Noble Vocation</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and according to the great conſequence of the ſame, doe not therefore labour to attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the excellencie of their profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither is it practiſed by the <hi>Nobility</hi> of this Kingdom as it is in other States from the Father to the Son throughout their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to the great encreaſe of their wealth, and maintenance of their names and families: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<note place="margin">There is more honor and profit in an Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious life, than in a great Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which waſteth for want of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> the memory of our richeſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants is ſuddenly extinguiſhed; the Son being left rich, ſcorneth the profeſsion of his Father, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving more honor to be a Gentleman (although but in name) to conſume his eſtate in dark ignorance and exceſs, than to follow the ſteps of his Father as an Induſtrious Merchant to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and advance his Fortunes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II</hi> The means to enrich this Kingdom, and to encreaſe our Treaſure.</head>
               <p>ALthough a Kingdom may be enriched by gifts recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or by purchaſe taken from ſome other Nations, yet theſe are things uncertain and of ſmall conſideration when they happen. The ordinary means therefore to encreaſe our wealth and treaſure is by <hi>Forraign Trade,</hi> wherein wee<note place="margin">Forraign Trade is the rule of our Treaſure.</note> muſt ever obſerve this rule; to ſell more to ſtrangers yearly than wee conſume of theirs in value. For ſuppoſe that when this Kingdom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42437:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is plentifully ſerved with the Cloth, Lead, Tinn, Iron, Fiſh and other native commodities, we doe yearly export the overplus to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Countries to the value of twenty two hundred thouſand pounds; by which means we are enabled beyond the Seas to buy and bring in forraign wares for our uſe and Conſumptions, to the value of twenty hundred thouſand pounds; By this order duly kept in our trading, we may reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Kingdom ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched yearly two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, which muſt be brought to us in ſo much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; becauſe that part of our ſtock which is not returned to us in wares muſt neceſſarily be brought home in treaſure.</p>
               <p>For in this caſe it cometh to paſs in the ſtock of a Kingdom,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42437:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as in the eſtate of a private man; who is ſuppoſed to have one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds yearly revenue and two thouſand pounds of ready money in his Cheſt: If ſuch a man through exceſs ſhall ſpend one thouſand five hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> all his ready mony will be gone in four years; and in the like time his ſaid money will be doubled if he take a Frugal courſe to ſpend but five hundred pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> which rule never faileth likewiſe in the Commonwealth, but in ſome caſes (of no great moment) which I will hereafter declare, when I ſhall ſhew by whom and in what manner this ballance of the Kingdoms account ought to be drawn up yearly, or ſo often as it ſhall pleaſe the State to diſcover how much we gain or loſe by trade with forraign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42437:12"/>
But firſt I will ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning thoſe ways and means which will encreaſe our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations and diminiſh our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations of wares; which being done, I will then ſet down ſome other arguments both affirmative and negative to ſtrengthen that which is here declared, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſhew that all the other means which are commonly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to enrich the Kingdom with Treaſure are altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and meer fallacies.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The particular ways and means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the exportation of our commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and to decreaſe our Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of forraign wares.</head>
               <p>THe revenue or ſtock of a Kingdom by which it is provided of forraign wares is either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Artificial.</hi> The Natural wealth is ſo much only as can be ſpared from our own uſe and neceſsities to be exported unto ſtrangers. The Artificial conſiſts in our manufactures and induſtrious trading with forraign commodities, concerning which I will ſet down ſuch particulars as may ſerve for the cauſe we have in hand.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, although this Realm be already exceeding rich by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42437:13"/>
yet might it be much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by laying the waſte grounds (which are infinite) into ſuch employments as ſhould no way hinder the preſent revenues of other manured lands, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſupply our ſelves and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the importations of Hemp, Flax, Cordage, Tobacco, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other things which now we fetch from ſtrangers to our great impoveriſhing.</p>
               <p>2. We may likewiſe diminiſh our importations, if we would ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly refrain from exceſsive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of forraign wares in our diet and rayment, with ſuch often change of faſhions as is uſed, ſo much the more to encreaſe the waſte and charge; which vices at this preſent are more notorious amongſt us than in former ages. Yet might they eaſily be amended
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42437:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by enforcing the obſervation of ſuch good laws as are ſtrictly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in other Countries againſt the ſaid exceſſes; where likewiſe by commanding their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures to be uſed, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the coming in of others, without prohibition, or offence to ſtrangers in their mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
               <p>3. In our exportations we muſt not only regard our own ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, but alſo we muſt conſider our neighbours neceſsities, that ſo upon the wares which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want, nor yet be furniſhed thereof elſewhere, we may (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the vent of the Materials) gain ſo much of the manufacture as we can, and alſo endeavour to ſell them dear, ſo far forth as the high price cauſe not a leſs vent in the quantity. But the ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42437:14"/>
of our commodities which ſtrangers uſe, and may alſo have the ſame from other Nations, or may abate their vent by the uſe of ſome ſuch like wares from other places, and with little inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; we muſt in this caſe ſtrive to ſell as cheap as poſsible we can, rather than to loſe the utterance of ſuch wares. For we have found of late years by good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that being able to ſell our Cloth cheap in Turkey, we have greatly encreaſed the vent thereof, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> have loſt as much in the utterance of theirs in thoſe Countreys, becauſe it is dearer. And on the other ſide a few years paſt, when by the exceſsive price of Wools our Cloth was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dear, we loſt at the leaſt half our clothing for forraign parts, which ſince is no otherwiſe (well
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42437:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neer) recovered again than by the<note place="margin">The State in ſome occaſions may gain moſt, when private men by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues get leaſt.</note> great fall of price for Wools and Cloth. We find that twenty five in the hundred leſs in the price of theſe and ſome other Wares, to the loſs of private mens revenues, may raiſe above fifty upon the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the quantity vented to the benefit of the publique. For when Cloth is dear, other Nations doe preſently practiſe clothing, and we know they want neither art nor materials to this perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. But when by cheapneſs we drive them from this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo in time obtain our dear price again, then do they alſo uſe their former remedy. So that by theſe alterations we learn, that it is in vain to expect a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er revenue of our wares than their condition will afford, but rather it concerns us to apply our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42437:15"/>
to the times with care and diligence to help our ſelves the beſt we may, by making our cloth and other manufactures without deceit, which will encreaſe their eſtimation and uſe.</p>
               <p>4. The value of our exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons likewiſe may be much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced when we perform it our ſelves in our own Ships, for then we get only not the price of our wares as they are worth here, but alſo the Merchants gains, the charges of enſurance, and fraight to carry them beyond the ſeas. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants ſhould come hither in their own ſhipping to fetch our Corn, our red Herrings or the like, in this caſe the Kingdom ſhould have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily but 25. <hi>s.</hi> for a quarter of Wheat, and 20. <hi>s.</hi> for a barrel ofred herrings, whereas if we carry theſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42437:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wares our ſelves into <hi>Italy</hi> upon the ſaid rates, it is likely that wee ſhall obtain fifty ſhillings for the firſt, and forty ſhillings for the laſt, which is a great difference in the utterance or vent of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſtock. And although it is true that the commerce ought to be free to ſtrangers to bring in and carry out at their pleaſure, yet nevertheleſs in many places the exportation of victuals and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are either prohibited, or at leaſt limited to be done onely by the people and Shipping of thoſe places where they abound.</p>
               <p>5. The frugal expending like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of our own natural wealth might advance much yearly to be exported unto ſtrangers; and if in our rayment we will be prodigal, yet let this be done with our own materials and manufactures, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42437:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cloth, Lace, Imbroderies, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works and the like, where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the rich may be the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the poor, whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours notwithſtanding of this kind, would be more profitable for the Commonwealth, if they were done to the uſe of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>6. The Fiſhing in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſeas of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> is our natural wealth, and would coſt nothing but labour, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> beſtow willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thereby draw yearly a very great profit to themſelves by ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many places of Chriſtendom with our Fiſh, for which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and ſupply their wants both of forraign Wares and Mony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the multitude of Mariners and Shipping, which hereby are maintain'd, whereof a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42437:16"/>
might be made to ſhew the particular manage of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſs. Our Fiſhing plantation likewiſe in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Virginia, Groenland,</hi> the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Iſlands</hi> and the <hi>New-fourd-land,</hi> are of the like nature, affording much wealth and employments to maintain a great number of poor, and to encreaſe our decaying trade.</p>
               <p>7. A Staple or Magazin for<note place="margin">How ſome States have been made Rich.</note> forraign Corn, Indico, Spices, Raw-ſilks, Cotton wool or any other commodity whatſoever, to be imported will encreaſe Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Trade, Treaſure, and the Kings cuſtomes, by exporting them again where need ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, which courſe of Trading, hath been the chief means to raiſe <hi>Venice, Genoa,</hi> the <hi>low-Countreys,</hi> with ſome others; and for ſuch
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42437:17"/>
a purpoſe <hi>England</hi> ſtands moſt commodiouſly, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this performance but our own diligence and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>8. Alſo wee ought to eſteem and cheriſh thoſe trades which we have in remote or far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, for beſides the encreaſe of Shipping and Mariners thereby, the wares alſo ſent thither and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from thence are far more profitable unto the kingdom than by our trades neer at hand; As for example; ſuppoſe Pepper to be worth here two Shillings the pound conſtantly, if then it be brought from the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> the Merchant may give there twenty pence the pound, and gain well by the bargain; but if he fetch this Pepper from the <hi>Eaſt-indies,</hi> he muſt not give
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42437:17"/>
above three pence the pound at the<note place="margin">The traffick to the Eaſt Indies is our moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trade in its proportion both for King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> moſt, which is a mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, not only in that part which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for our own uſe, but alſo for that great quantity which (from hence) we tranſport yearly unto divers other Nations to be ſold at a higher price: whereby it is plain, that we make a far greater ſtock by gain upon theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,<note place="margin">We get more by the Indian wares than the Indians themſelves.</note> than thoſe Nations doe where they grow, and to whom they properly appertain, being the natural wealth of their Countries. But for the berter underſtanding of this particular, we muſt ever diſtinguiſh between the gain of the Kingdom, and the profit of<note place="margin">A diſtinction between the Kingdoms gain and the Merchants profit.</note> the Merchant; for although the Kingdom payeth no more for this Pepper than is before ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor for any other commodity bought in forraign parts more
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42437:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than the ſtranger receiveth from us for the ſame, yet the Merchant payeth not only that price, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the fraight, enſurance, cuſtomes and other charges which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great in theſe long voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but yet all theſe in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms accompt are but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations among our ſelves, and no Privation of the Kingdoms ſtock, which being duly conſidered, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſupport alſo of our other trades in our beſt Shipping to <hi>Italy, France, Turkey,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys</hi> and other places, by tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and venting the wares which, we bring yearly from the <hi>Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> It may well ſtir up our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to maintain and enlarge this great and noble buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo much importing the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique wealth, Strength, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Neither it there leſs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

and judgment by growing rich (in this manner) upon the ſtock of other Nations, than by an induſtrious encreaſe of our own means, eſpecially when this later is advanced by the benefit of the ſormer, as we have found in the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> by ſale of much of our Tin, Cloth, Lead and other Commodities, the vent whereof doth daily encreaſe in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys which formerly had no uſe of our wares.</p>
               <p>9. It would be very beneficial to export money as well as wares, being done in trade only, it would encreaſe our Treaſure; but of this I write more largely in the next Chapter to prove it plain-</p>
               <p>10. It were policie and profit or the State to ſuffer manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made of forraign Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42437:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be exported cuſtome-free, as Velvets and all other wrought Silks, Fuſtians, thrown Silks and the like, it would employ very many poor people, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the value of our ſtock year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſued into other Countreys, and it would (for this purpoſe) cauſe the more forraign Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to be brought in, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of His Majeſties Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes.

And it is certain, that if the ſaid forraign Commodities might be exported from hence, free of cuſtome, this manufacture would yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe very much, and decreaſe as faſt in <hi>Italy</hi> and in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> But if any man allege the <hi>Dutch</hi> proverb, <hi>Live and let others live;</hi> I anſwer, that the Dutchmen not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their own Proverb, doe not onely in theſe Kingdoms, encroach upon our livings, but alſo in other forraign parts of our trade (where they have power) they do hinder and deſtroy us in our lawful courſe of living, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taking the bread out of our mouth, which we ſhall never prevent by plucking the pot from their noſe, as of late years too many of us do practiſe to the great hurt and diſhonour of this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42437:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
famous Nation; We ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to imitate former times in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſober and worthy courſes more pleaſing to God and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our ancient reputation.</p>
               <p>11. It is needful alſo not to charge the native commodities with too great cuſtomes, leſt by indearing them to the ſtrangers uſe, it hinder their vent. And eſpecially forraign wares brought in to be tranſported again ſhould be favoured, for otherwiſe that manner of trading (ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the good of the Common wealth) cannot proſper nor ſubſiſt. But the Conſumption of ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign wares in the Realm may be the more charged, which will turn to the profit of the kingdom in the <hi>Ballance of the Trade,</hi> and thereby alſo enable the King to lay up the more Treaſure out of his yearly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42437:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
incomes, as of this particular I intend to write more fully in his proper place, where I ſhall ſhew how much money a Prince may conveniently lay up without the hurt of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>12. Laſtly, in all things we muſt endeavour to make the moſt we can of our own, whether it be <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Artificial;</hi> And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the people which live by the Arts are far more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than they who are maſters of the fruits, we ought the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to maintain thoſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the multitude, in whom doth conſiſt the greateſt ſtrength and riches both of King and Kingdom: for where the people are many, and the arts good, there the traffique muſt be great, and the Countrey rich. The <hi>Italians</hi> employ a greater number of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42437:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people, and get more money by their induſtry and manufactures of the raw Silks of the Kingdom of <hi>Cicilia,</hi> than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Subjects have by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of this rich commodity. But what need we fetch the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo far, when we know that our own natural wares doe not yield us ſo much profit as our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry? For Iron oar in the Mines is of no great worth, when it is compared with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and advantage it yields being digged, tried, tranſported, bought, ſold, caſt into Ordnance, Muskets, and many other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of war for offence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, wrought into Anchors, bolts, ſpikes, nayles and the like, for the uſe of Ships, Houſes, Carts, Coaches, Ploughs, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for Tillage. Compare
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42437:21"/>
our Fleece-wools with our Cloth, which requires ſhearing, waſhing, carding, ſpinning, Weaving, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, dying, dreſsing and other trimmings, and we ſhall find theſe Arts more profitable than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wealth, whereof I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance other examples, but I will not be more tedious, for if I would amplify upon this and the other particulars before written, I might find matter ſufficient to make a large volume, but my deſire in all is only to prove what I propound with brevity and plainneſs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Exportation of our Moneys in Trade of Merchandize is a means to encreaſe our Treaſure.</head>
               <p>THis Poſition is ſo contrary to the common opinion, that it will require many and ſtrong arguments to prove it before it can be accepted of the Multitude, who bitterly exclaim when they ſee any monies carried out of the Realm; affirming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that wee have abſolutely loſt ſo much Treaſure, and that this is an act directly againſt the long continued laws made and confirmed by the wiſdom of this Kingdom in the High Court of Parliament, and that many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nay <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf which is the Fountain of Mony, forbids the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42437:22"/>
exportation thereof, ſome caſes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted. To all which I might anſwer, that <hi>Venice, Florence, Genoa,</hi> the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other places permit it, their people applaud it, and find great benefit by it; but all this makes a noiſe and proves nothing, we muſt therefore come to thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which concern the buſineſs in queſtion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will take that for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which no man of judgment will deny, that we have no other means to get Treaſure but by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign trade, for Mines wee have none which do afford it, and how this mony is gotten in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our ſaid Trade I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, that it is done by making our commodities which are exported yearly to over bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in value the forraign wares
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42437:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which we conſume; ſo that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth only to ſhew how our monyes may be added to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and being jointly expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may ſo much the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Treaſure.</p>
               <p>Wee have already ſuppoſed our yearly conſumptions of forraign wares to be for the value of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hundred thouſand pounds, and our exportations to exceed that two hundred thouſand pounds, which ſum wee have thereupon affirmed is brought to us in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ballance the accompt. But now if we add three hundred thouſand pounds more in ready mony unto our former exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in wares, what profit can we have (will ſome men ſay) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by this means we ſhould bring in ſo much ready mony more than wee did before, ſeeing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42437:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that wee have carried out the like value.</p>
               <p>To this the anſwer is, that when wee have prepared our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations of wares, and ſent out as much of every thing as wee can ſpare or vent abroad: It is not<note place="margin">Money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets trade and trade en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> therefore ſaid that then we ſhould add our money thereunto to fetch in the more mony immediately, but rather firſt to enlarge our trade by enabling us to bring in more forraign wares, which being ſent out again will in due time much encreaſe our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>For although in this manner wee do yearly multiply our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations to the maintenance of more Shipping and Mariners, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provment of His Majeſties Cuſtoms and other benefits: yet our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of thoſe forraign wares
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42437:24"/>
is no more than it was before; ſo that all the ſaid encreaſe of commodities brought in by the means of our ready mony ſent out as is afore written, doth in the end become an exportation unto us of a far greater value than our ſaid money's were, which is proved by three ſeveral examples follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>1. For I ſuppoſe that 100000. <hi>l.</hi> being ſent in our Shipping to the Eaſt Countreys, will buy there one hundred thouſand quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of wheat cleer aboard the Ships, which being after brought into <hi>England</hi> and houſed, to export the ſame at the beſt time for vent thereof in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> it cannot yield leſs in thoſe parts than two hundred thouſand pounds to make the Merchant but a ſaver, yet by this reckning wee ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42437:24"/>
hath doubled that Treaſure.</p>
               <p>2. Again this profit will be far greater when wee trade thus in remote Countreys, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if wee ſend one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> to buy Pepper there, and bring it<note place="margin">Remote trades are moſt gainful to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</note> hither, and from hence ſend it for <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> it muſt yield ſeven hundred thouſand pounds at leaſt in thoſe places, in regard of the exceſsive charge which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant disburſeth in thoſe long voyages in Shipping, Wages, Victuals, Inſurance, Intereſt, Cuſtomes, Impoſts, and the like, all which notwithſtanding the King and the Kingdom gets.</p>
               <p>3. But where the voyages are ſhort &amp; the wares rich, which therefore will not employ much Shipping, the profit will be far leſs. As when another hundred thouſand
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42437:25"/>
pounds ſhall be employed in <hi>Turkey</hi> in raw Silks, and brought hither to be after tranſported from hence into <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> the Merchant ſhall have good gain, although he ſell it there but for one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds: and thus take the voyages altogether in their <hi>Medium,</hi> the moneys exported will be returned unto us more than Trebled. But if any man will yet object, that theſe returns come to us in wares, and not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in mony as they were iſſued out,</p>
               <p>The anſwer is (keeping our firſt ground) that if our conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of forraign wares be no more yearly than is already ſuppoſed, and that our exportations be ſo mightliy encreaſed by this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Trading with ready money
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42437:25"/>
as is before declared: It is not then poſsible but that all the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance or difference ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn either in mony or in ſuch wares as we muſt export again, which, as is already plainly ſhewed will be ſtill a greater means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Treaſure.</p>
               <p>For it is in the ſtock of the Kingdom as in the eſtates of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, who having ſtore of wares, doe not therefore ſay that they will not venture out or trade with their mony (for this were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous) but do alſo turn that into wares, whereby they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply their Mony, and ſo by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and orderly change of one into the other grow rich, and when they pleaſe turn all their<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Proverb ſaith,</hi> He that hath ware hath mony by the year.</note> eſtates into Treaſure; for they that have Wares cannot want mony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:42437:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>Neither is it ſaid that Mony is the Life of Trade, as if it could not ſubſiſt without the ſame; for we know that there was great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by way of commutation or barter when there was little mony ſtirring in the world. The <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and ſome other Nations have ſuch remedies againſt this want, that it can neither decay nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their trade, for they transfer bills of debt, and have Banks both publick and private, wherein they do aſsign their credits from one to another daily for very great ſums with eaſe and ſatisfaction by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings only, whilſt in the mean time the Maſs of Treaſure which gave foundation to theſe credits is employed in Forraign Trade as a Merchandize, and by the ſaid means they have little other uſe of money in thoſe countreys more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42437:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than for their ordinary expences. It is not therefore the keeping of our mony in the Kingdom, but the neceſsity and uſe of our wares in forraign Countries, and our want of their commodities that cauſeth the vent and conſumption on all ſides, which makes a quick and ample Trade. If wee were once poor, and now having gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome ſtore of mony by trade with reſolution to keep it ſtill in the Realm; ſhall this cauſe other Nations to ſpend more of our commodities than formerly they have done, whereby we might ſay that our trade is Quickned and Enlarged? no verily, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no ſuch good effect: but rather according to the alteration of times by their true cauſes wee may expect the contrary; for all men do conſent that plenty of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42437:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mony in a Kingdom doth make the native commodities dearer, which as it is to the profit of ſome private men in their revenues, ſo is it directly againſt the benefit of the Publique in the quantity of the trade; for as plenty of mony makes wares dearer, ſo dear wares decline their uſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as hath been already plainly ſhewed in the laſt Chapter upon that particular of our cloth; And although this is a very hard leſſon for ſome great landed men to learn, yet I am ſure it is a true leſſon for all the land to obſerve, leſt when wee have gained ſome ſtore of mony by trade, wee loſe it again by not trading with our mony. I knew a Prince in <hi>Italy</hi> (of famous memory) <hi>Ferdinando the firſt,</hi> great Duke of <hi>Tuſcanie,</hi> who being very rich in Treaſure,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42437:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
endevoured therewith to enlarge his trade by iſſuing out to his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants great ſums of money for very ſmall profit; I my ſelf had forty thouſand crowns of him <hi>gratis</hi> for a whole year, although he knew that I would preſently ſend it away in <hi>Specie</hi> for the parts of <hi>Turkey</hi> to be employed in wares for his Countries, he being well aſſured that in this courſe of trade it would return again (according to the old ſaying) with a Duck in the mouth. This noble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Prince by his care and diligence to countenance and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Merchants in their affairs, did ſo encreaſe the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that there is ſcarce a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Gentleman in all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions that doth not Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize either by himſelf or in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip with others, whereby
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42437:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
within theſe thirty years the trade to his port of <hi>Leghorn</hi> is ſo much encreaſed, that of a poor little town (as I my ſelf knew it) it is now become a fair and ſtrong City, being one of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous places for trade in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. And yet it is worthy our obſervation, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Ships and wares which come thither from <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> and other places, have little or no means to make their returns from thence but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ready mony, which they may and do carry away freely at all times, to the incredible advantage of the ſaid great Duke of <hi>Tuscanie</hi> and his ſubjects, who are much enriched by the continual great concourſe of Merchants from all the States of the neighbour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, bringing them plenty of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42437:28"/>
mony daily to ſupply their wants of the ſaid wares. And thus we ſee that the current of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize which carries away their Treaſure, becomes a flowing ſtream to fill them again in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure with mony.</p>
               <p>There is yet an objection or two as weak as all the reſt: that is, if wee trade with our Mony wee ſhall iſſue out the leſs wares; as if a man ſhould ſay, thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys which heretofore had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to conſume our Cloth, Lead, Tin, Iron, Fiſh, and the like, ſhall now make uſe of our monies in the place of thoſe neceſſaries, which were moſt abſurd to affirm, or that the Merchant had not rather carry out wares by which there is ever ſome gains expected, than to export mony which is ſtill but the ſame without any encreaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42437:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>But on the contrary there are many Countreys which may yield us very profitable trade for our mony, which otherwiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us no trade at all, becauſe they have no uſe of our wares, as namely the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> for one in the firſt beginning thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſince by induſtry in our commerce with thoſe Nations we have brought them into the uſe of much of our Lead, Cloth, Tin, and other things, which is a good addition to the former vent of our commodities.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome men have alleged that thoſe Countries which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit mony to be carried out, do it becauſe they have few or no wares to trade withall: but wee have great ſtore of commodities, and therefore their action ought not to be our example.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42437:29"/>To this the anſwer is briefly, that if we have ſuch a quantity of wares as doth fully provide us of all things needful from beyond the ſeas: why ſhould we then doubt that our monys ſent out in trade, muſt not neceſſarily come back again in treaſure; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the great gains which it may procure in ſuch manner as is before ſet down? And on the other ſide, if thoſe Nations which ſend out their monies do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have but few wares of their own, how come they then to have ſo much Treaſure as we ever ſee in thoſe places which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it freely to be exported at all times and by whomſoever? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Even by trading with their Moneys;</hi> for by what other means can they get it, having no Mines of Gold or Silver?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:42437:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thus may we plainly ſee, that when this weighty buſineſs is duly conſidered in his end, as all our humane actions ought well to be weighed, it is found much contrary to that which moſt men eſteem thereof, becauſe they ſearch no further than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the work, which miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms their judgments, and leads<note place="margin">Our humane actions ought especially to be conſtdered in their ends.</note> them into error: For if we only behold the actions of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman in the ſeed-time when he caſteth away much good corn into the ground, we will rather accompt him a mad man than a husbandman: but when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his labours in the harveſt which is the end of his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, we find the worth and plentiful encreaſe of his actions.</p>

               <p>IIt is a common ſaying, that plenty or ſcarcity of mony makes all things dear or good or cheap; and this mony is either gotten or loſt in forraign trade by the over or under ballancing of the ſame, as I have already ſhewed. It reſteth now that I diſtinguiſh the ſeeming plenties of mony from that which is only ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and able to perform the work: For there are divers ways and means whereby to procure plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mony into a Kingdom, which do not enrich but rather empoveriſh the ſame by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inconveniences which ever accompany ſuch alterations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:42437:31"/>As firſt, if we melt down our plate into Coyn (which ſuits not with the Majeſty of ſo great a Kingdom, except in caſes of great extremity) it would cauſe Plenty of mony for a time, yet ſhould we be nothing the richer, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this treaſure being thus alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is made the more apt to be carried out of the Kingdom, if we exceed our means by exceſs in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign wares, or maintain a war by Sea or Land, where we do not feed and cloath the Souldier and ſupply the armies with our own native proviſions, by which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders our treaſure will ſoon be exhauſted.</p>
               <p>Again, if we think to bring in ſtore of money by ſuffering for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Coins to paſs current at higher rates than their intrinſick value compared with our Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42437:31"/>
or by debaſing or by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancing our own moneys, all theſe have their ſeveral inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies and difficulties, (which hereafter I will declare) but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that by this means plenty of money might be brought into the Realm, yet ſhould we be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the richer, neither can ſuch treaſure ſo gotten long remain with us. For if the ſtranger or the Engliſh Merchants bring in this money, it muſt be done upon a valuable conſideration, either for wares carried out already, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be exported, which helps us nothing except the evil occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of exceſs or war aforenamed be removed which do exhauſt our treaſure: for otherwiſe, what one man bringeth for gain, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man ſhall be forced to carry out for neceſsity; becauſe there
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42437:32"/>
ſhall ever be a neceſsity to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance our Accounts with ſtrangers, although it ſhould be done with loſs upon the rate of the money, and Confiſcation alſo if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted by the Law.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of this buſineſs<note place="margin">How we muſt get Treaſure to make it our own.</note> is briefly thus. That as the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is brought into the Realm by the ballance of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign trade is that money which onely doth abide with us, and by which we are enriched: ſo by this plenty of money thus gotten (and no otherwiſe) do our Lands improve. For when the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant hath a good diſpatch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas for his Cloth and other wares, he doth preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to buy up the greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, which raiſeth the price of our Woolls and other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conſequently doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42437:32"/>
the Landlords Rents as the Leaſes expire daily: And alſo by this means money being gained, and brought more abundantly into the Kingdom, it doth enable many men to buy Lands, which will make them the dearer. But if our forraign trade come to a ſtop or declination by neglect at home or injuries abroad, whereby the Merchants are impoveriſhed, and thereby the wares of the Realm leſs iſſued, then do all the ſaid benefits ceaſe, and our Lands fall of price daily.</p>

the <hi>Weſt:</hi> for the laſt of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employed in the firſt, they ſtored themſelves infinitely with rich wares to barter with all the parts of Chriſtendom for their Commodities, and ſo furniſhing their own neceſsities, prevented others for carrying away their moneys: which in point of ſtate they hold leſs dangerous to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the remote Indians, than to their neighbour Princes, leſt it ſhould too much enable them to reſiſt (if not offend) their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And this Spaniſh policy againſt others is the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, being done likewiſe ſo much to their own advantage; for every Ryal of Eight which they ſent to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> brought home ſo much wares as ſaved them the disburſing of five Ryals of Eight here in <hi>Europe</hi> (at the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42437:34"/>
leaſt) to their Neighbours, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe times when that trade was only in their hands: but now this great profit is failed, and the miſchief removed by the Engliſh, Dutch, and others which partake in thoſe <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> trades as ample as the Spaniſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>It is further to be conſidered, that beſides the diſability of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by their native commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to provide forraign wares for their neceſsities, (whereby they are forced to ſupply the want with mony) they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that canker of war, which doth infinitely exhauſt their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and diſperſe it into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom even to their enemies, part by repriſal, but eſpecially through a neceſſary maintenance of thoſe armies which are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42437:35"/>
of ſtrangers, and lie ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, that they cannot feed, clothe, or otherwiſe provide them out of their own native means and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, but muſt receive this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from other Nations: which<note place="margin">The effects of different wars concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treaſure.</note> kind of war is far different to that which a Prince maketh upon his own confines, or in his Navies by Sea, where the Souldier receiving money for his wages, muſt every day deliver it out again for his neceſsities, whereby the treaſure remains ſtill in the Kingdom, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be exhauſted from the King: But we ſee that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> (truſting in the power of his Treaſure) undertakes wars in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in other remote pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which would ſoon begger the richeſt Kingdom in Chriſtendom of all their mony; the want whereof would preſently diſorder
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42437:35"/>
and bring the armies to confufi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it falleth out ſometimes with <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, who have the Fountain of mony, when either it is ſtopt in the paſſage by the force of their enemies, or drawn out faſter than it flows by their own occaſions; whereby alſo we often ſee that Gold and ſilver is ſo ſcant in <hi>Spain,</hi> that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to uſe baſe copper money, to the great confuſion of their Trade, and not without the undoing alſo of many of their own people.</p>
               <p>But now that we have ſeen the occaſions by which the Spaniſh treaſure is diſperſed into ſo many places of the world, let us likewiſe diſcover how and in what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion each Countrey doth enjoy theſe Moneys, for we find that <hi>Turkey</hi> and divers other Nations have great plenty thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42437:36"/>
they drive no trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> which ſeems to contradict the former reaſon, where we ſay that this treaſure is obtained by a Neceſsity of Commerce. But to clear this point, we muſt know that all Nations (who have no Mines of their own) are enriched with Gold and Silver by one and the ſame means, which is already ſhewed to be the ballance of their forraign Trade: And this is not ſtrictly tyed to be done in thoſe Countries where the fountain of treaſure is, but rather with ſuch order and obſervations as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. For ſuppoſe <hi>England</hi> by trade with <hi>Spain</hi> may gain and bring home five hundred thou-Ryals of 8. yearly, if we loſe as much by our trade in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and therefore carry the mony thither, it is not then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> but the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42437:36"/>
                  <hi>Turks</hi> which have got this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, although they have no trade with <hi>Spain</hi> from whence it was firſt brought. Again, if <hi>England</hi> having thus loſt with <hi>Turkey,</hi> do notwithſtanding gain twice as much by <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and other members of her general trade, then will there remain five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Ryals of eight cleer gains by the ballance of this trade: and this compariſon holds between all other Nations, both for the manner of getting, and the proportion that is yearly gotten.</p>
               <p>But if yet a queſtion ſhould be made, whether all Nations get treaſure and <hi>Spain</hi> only loſe it? I anſwer no; for ſome Countreys by war or by exceſs do loſe that which they had gotten, as well as <hi>Spain</hi> by war and want of wares
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42437:37"/>
doth loſe that which was its own.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The diverſity of gain by Forraign Trade.</head>
               <p>IN the courſe of forraign trade there are three ſorts of gain, the firſt is that of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which may be done when the Merchant (who is the principal Agent therein) ſhall loſe. The ſecond is the gain of the Merchant, which he doth ſometimes juſtly and worthily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, although the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be a loſer. The third is the gain of the King, whereof he is ever certain, even when the Commonwealth and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſhall be both loſers.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe, we have already ſufficiently ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42437:37"/>
the ways and means whereby a Commonwealth may be enriched in the courſe of trade, whereof it is needleſs here to make any repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, only I do in this place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that ſuch happineſs may be in the Commonwealth, when the Merchant in his particular ſhall have no occaſion to rejoyce. As for example, ſuppoſe the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company ſend out one hundred thouſand pounds into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and receive home for the ſame the full value of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds; Hereby it is evident that this part of the Commonwealth is trebled, and yet I may boldly ſay that which I can well prove, that the ſaid Company of Merchants ſhall loſe at leaſt fifty thouſand pounds by ſuch an adventure if the returns be made in <hi>Spice, Indico, Callicoes,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42437:38"/>
Benjamin, refined Saltpeter,</hi> and ſuch other bulkey wares in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proportions according to their vent and uſe in theſe parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> For the fraight of Shipping, the enſurance of the adventure, the charges of Factors abroad and Officers at home, the forbearance of the Stock, His Majeſties Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Impoſts, with other pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty charges incident, cannot be leſs then two hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, which being added to the principal produceth the ſaid loſs. And thus we ſee, that not only the Kingdom but alſo the King by his Cuſtoms and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts may get notoriouſly, even when the Merchant notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall loſe grievouſly; which giveth us good occaſion here to conſider, how much more the Realm is enriched by this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42437:38"/>
noble Trade, when all things paſs ſo happily that the Merchant is a gainer alſo with the King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In the next place I affirm, that a Merchant by his laudable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours may both carry out and bring in wares to his advantage by ſelling them and buying them to good profit, which is the end of his labours; when nevertheleſs the Commonwealth ſhall decline and grow poor by a diſorder in the people, when through Pride and other Exceſſes they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume more forraign wares in value then the wealth of the Kingdom can ſatisfie and pay by the exportation of our own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which is the very qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an unthrift who ſpends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his means.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the King is ever ſure to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42437:39"/>
get by trade, when both the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth and Merchant ſhall loſe ſeverally as afore-written, or joyntly, as it may and doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen, when at one and the ſame time our Commodities are over-ballanced by forraign wares conſumed, and that the Merchants ſucceſs prove no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than is before declared.</p>
               <p>But here we muſt not take the Kings gain in this large ſenſe, for ſo we might ſay that His Majeſty ſhould get, although half the trade of the Kingdom were loſt; we will rather ſuppoſe that whereas the whole trade of the Realm for Exportations and Importations is now found for to be about the yearly value of four millions and a half of pounds; it may be yet increaſed two hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> more by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42437:39"/>
and conſumption of forraign wares. By this means we know that the King ſhall be a gainer near twenty thouſand pounds, but the Commonwealth ſhall loſe the whole two hundred thouſand pounds thus ſpent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. And the Merchant may be a loſer alſo when the trade ſhall in this manner be increaſed to the profit of the King; who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall be ſure in the end to have the greateſt loſs, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not ſuch unthrifty courſes as do impoveriſh his Subjects.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The enhanſing or debaſing our Moneys cannot enrich the Kingdom with treaſure, nor hinder the exportation thereof.</head>
               <p>THere are three ways by which the Moneys of a Kingdom are commonly altered. The firſt is when the Coins in their ſeveral Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are made currant at more or leſs pounds, ſhillings or pence than formerly. The ſecond is when the ſaid Coins are altered in their weight, and yet continue currant at the former rates. The third is when the Standard is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debaſed or enriched in the fineneſs of the Gold and Silver, yet the Moneys continue in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer values.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:42437:40"/>In all occaſions of want or plenty of Money in the Kingdom we do ever find divers men, who uſing their wits for a remedy to ſupply the firſt and preſerve the laſt, they fall preſently upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the moneys; for, ſay they, the raiſing of the Coins in value will cauſe it to be brought into the Realm from divers places in hope of the gain: and the debaſing of the monies in the fineneſs or weight will keep it here for fear of the loſs. But theſe men plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning onely of this weighty buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, conſider not the progreſs and end thereof, whereunto we ought eſpecially to direct our thoughts and endeavoues.</p>
               <p>For we muſt know, that mony<note place="margin">Mony is the meaſure of our other means.</note> is not only the true meaſure of all our other means in the Kingdom,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42437:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but alſo of our forraign commerce with ſtrangers, which therefore ought to be kept juſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to avoid thoſe confuſions which ever accompany ſuch alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. For firſt at home, if the common meaſure be changed, our Lands, Leaſes, wares, both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and domeſtique muſt alter in proportion: and although this is not done without much trouble and damage alſo to ſome men, yet in ſhort time this muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to paſs; for that is not the denomination of our pounds ſhillings and pence, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, but the intrinſique value of our Coins; unto which we have little reaſon to add any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtimation or worth, if it lay in our power to do it, for this would be a ſpecial ſervice to <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A notable ſervice for <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> and an act againſt our ſelves to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42437:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
indear the commodity of another Prince. Neither can theſe courſes which ſo much hurt the Subjects, any way help the King as ſome men have imagined: for although the debaſing or lightning of all our mony ſhould bring a preſent benefit (for once only) to the Mint, yet all this and more would ſoon be loſt again in the future great In-comes of His Majeſty, when by this means they muſt be paid year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with mony of leſs intrinſique value then formerly; Nor can it be ſaid that the whole loſs of the Kingdom would be the profit of the King, they differ infinitely: for all mens eſtates (be it leaſes, lands, debts, wares or mony) muſt ſuffer in their proportions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as His Majeſty ſhould have the gain only upon ſo much ready mony as might be new Coined,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42437:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which in compariſon, would prove a very ſmall matter: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they who have other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in mony are ſaid to be a great number, and to be worth<note place="margin">All the ready mony in this Kingdom is eſteemed at little more then one mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of pounds</note> five or ten thouſand <hi>l. per</hi> man, more or leſs, which amounts to many millions in all, yet are they not poſſeſſed thereof all together or at once, for it were vanity and againſt their profit to keep conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in their hands above forty or fifty pounds in a family to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray neceſſary charges, the reſt muſt ever run from man to man in traffique for their benefit, whereby we may conceive that a little mony (being made the meaſure of all our other means) doth rule and diſtribute great matters daily to all men in their juſt proportions: And we muſt know likewiſe that much of our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42437:42"/>
old mony is worn light, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would yield little or no profit at the Mint, and the gain upon the heavy, would cauſe our vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant neighbours to carry over a great part thereof, and return it preſently in pieces of the new ſtamp; nor do we doubt that ſome of our own Countrymen would turn Coiners and venter a hanging for this profit, ſo that His Majeſty in the end ſhould get little by ſuch alterations.</p>
               <p>Yea but ſay ſome men, If His Majeſty raiſe the mony, great ſtore of treaſure would alſo be brought into the Mint from forraign parts, for we have ſeen by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that the late raiſing of our Gold ten in the hundred, did bring in great ſtore thereof, more than we were accuſtomed to have in the Kingdom, the which as I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42437:43"/>
cannot deny, ſo do I likewiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that this Gold carried away all or the moſt part of our Silver, (which was not over-worn or too light) as we may eaſily perceive by the preſent uſe of our Moneys in their reſpective qualities: and the reaſon of this change is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Silver was not raiſed in proportion with our Gold, which ſtill giveth advantage to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to bring in the Kingdoms yearly gain by trade in Gold rather than in Silver.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we be inconſtant in our Coins, and thereby violate the Laws of forraign Commerce; other Princes are vigilant in theſe caſes to alter preſently in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with us, and then where is our hope? of if they do not alter, what can we hope for? For if the ſtranger-merchant bring in his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42437:43"/>
wares, and find that our moneys are raiſed, ſhall not he likewiſe keep his Commodities untill he may ſell them dearer? and ſhall not the price of the Merchants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with forraign Countries riſe in proportion with our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys? All which being undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly true, why may not our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys be carried out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as well and to as much profit after the raiſing thereof, as before the alteration?</p>
               <p>But peradventure ſome men will yet ſay, that if our Moneys be raiſed and other Countries raiſe not, it will cauſe more Bullion and forraign Coines to be brought in than heretofore. If this be done, it muſt be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either by the Merchant who hath exported wares, or by the Merchant who intends to buy off
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42437:44"/>
our Commodities: and it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that neither of theſe can have more advantage or benefit by this Art now, than they might have had before the alteration of the Money. For if their ſaid Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and forraign Coins be more worth than formerly in our pounds, ſhillings and pence, yet what ſhall they get by that when theſe moneys are baſer or lighter, and that therefore they are riſen in proportion? So we may plainly ſee that theſe Innovations are no good means to bring treaſure into the Kingdom, nor yet to keep it here when we have it.</p>

And I make no doubt but that we trade to divers places where we vent off our native commodities yearly, to a great value, and yet find few
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42437:45"/>
or no wares there fitting our uſe, whereby we are enforced to make our returns in ready mony, which by us is either carried into ſome other Countries to be converted into wares which we want, or elſe it is brought into the Realm <hi>in Specie;</hi> which being tolerated to paſs current here in payment at higher rates then they are worth to be Coined into ſterling mony; that ſeemeth very probable that the greater quantity will be brought in: but when all the circumſtances are duly conſidered, this courſe likewiſe will be found as weak as the reſt to encreaſe our Treaſure.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the toleration it ſelf doth break the laws of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and would ſoon move other Princes to perform the ſame acts or worſe againſt us, and ſo fruſtrate our hopes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:42437:45"/>Secondly, if mony be the true meaſure of all our other means, and forraign Coins tollerated to paſs current amongſt us, at high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rates than they are worth (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared with our Standard) it followeth that the common wealth ſhall not be juſtly diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, when it paſſeth by a falſe meaſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the advantage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ours and forraign Coins be but ſmall, it will bring in little or no Treaſure, becauſe the Merchant will rather bring in wares upon which there is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a competent gaine.

               <p>TO keep our mony in the Kingdom is a work of no leſs skill and difficulty than to augment our Treaſure: for the cauſes of their preſervation and production are the ſame in nature. The ſtatute for employment of ſtrangers wares into our commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities ſeemeth at the firſt to be a good and a lawful way leading to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42437:46"/>
thoſe ends; but upon th' exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the particulars, we ſhall find that it cannot produce ſuch good effects.</p>
               <p>For as the uſe of forraign trade<note place="margin">The uſe of Forraign Trade is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all Nations.</note> is alike unto all Nations, ſo may we eaſily perceive what will be done therein by ſtrangers, when we do but obſerve our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in this waighty buſineſs, by which we do not only ſeek with the vent of our own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to ſupply our wants of forraign wares, but alſo to enrich our ſelves with treaſure: all which is done by a different manner of trading according to our own oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and the nature of the places whereunto we do trade; as namely in ſome Countrys we ſell our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and bring away their wares, or part in mony; in other Countreys we ſell our goods and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42437:47"/>
take their mony, becauſe they have little or no wares that fits our turns: again in ſome places we have need of their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but they have little uſe of ours; ſo they take our mony which we get in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys: And thus by a courſe of traffick (which changeth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the accurrents of time) the particular members do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate each other, and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the whole body of the<note place="margin">How for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Trade a deſtroyed.</note> trade, which will ever languiſh if the harmony of her health be diſtempered by the diſeaſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at home, violence abroad, charges and reſtrictions at home or abroad: but in this place I have occaſion to ſpeak only of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, which I will perform briefly.</p>
               <p>There are three ways by which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42437:47"/>
a Merchant may make the returns of his wares from beyond the Seas, that is to ſay in mony, in commodities, or by Exchange. But the Statute of employment doth not only reſtrain mony (in which there is a ſeeming provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Juſtice) but alſo the uſe of the Exchange by bills, which doth violate the Law of Commerce, and is indeed an Act without example in any place of the world where we have trade, and therefore to be conſidered, that whatſoever (in this kind) we ſhall impoſe upon ſtrangers here, will preſently be made a Law for us in their Countreys, eſpecially where we have our greateſt trade with our vigilant neighbours, who omit no care nor occaſion to ſupport their traffique in equal privileges with other Nations.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42437:48"/>
And thus in the firſt place we ſhould be deprived of that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and means which now we have to bring Treaſure into the Kingdom, and therewith likewiſe we ſhould loſe the vent of much wares which we carry to divers places, whereby our trade and our Treaſure would decay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if by the ſaid Statute we thruſt the exportation of our wares (more than ordinary) upon the ſtranger, we muſt then take it from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which were injurious to our Merchants, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners and Shipping, beſides the hurt to the Commonwealth in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venting the Kingdoms ſtock to the ſtranger at far lower rates here than we muſt do if we ſold it to them in their own Countrys, as is proved in the third Chapter.</p>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:42437:48"/>Thirdly, whereas we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſufficiently ſhewed, that if our commodities be over ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in value by forraign wares, our mony muſt be carried out. How is it poſsible to prevent this by tying the Strangers hands, and leaving the Engliſh looſe? ſhall not the ſame reaſons and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage cauſe that to be done by them now, that was done by the other before? or if we will make a ſtatute (without example) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent both alike, ſhall we not then overthrow all at once? the King in his cuſtomes and the Kingdom in her profits; for ſuch a reſtriction muſt of neceſsity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy much trade, becauſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of occaſions and places which make an ample trade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that ſome men ſhould both export and import wares; ſome
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42437:49"/>
export only, others import, ſome deliver out their monies by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, others take it up; ſome carry out mony, others bring it in, and this in a greater or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer quantity according to the good husbandry or exceſs in the Kingdom, over which only if we keep a ſtrict law, it will rule all the reſt, and without this all other Statutes are no rules ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keep or procure us Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to leave no Objection unanſwered, if it ſhould be ſaid that a Statute comprehending the Engliſh as well as the ſtranger muſt needs keep our money in the Kingdom. What ſhall we get by this, if it hinder the coming in of money by the decay of that ample Trade which we enjoyed in the freedom thereof? is not the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42437:49"/>
Remedy far worſe than the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe? ſhall we not live more like Iriſhmen than Engliſhmen, when the Kings revenues, our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Mariners, Shipping, Arts, Lands, Riches, and all decay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our Trade?</p>
               <p>Yea but, ſay ſome men, we have better hopes than ſo; for th' intent of the Statute is, that as all the forraign wares which are brought in ſhall be imployed in our commodities, thereby to keep our money in the Kingdom: So we doubt not but to ſend out a ſufficient quantity of our own wares over and above to bring in the value thereof in ready money.</p>
               <p>Although this is abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the reaſons afore written, yet now we will grant it, becauſe we deſire to end the diſpute: For
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42437:50"/>
if this be true, that other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will vent more of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities than we conſume of theirs in value, then I affirm that the overplus muſt neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto us in treaſure without the uſe of the Statute, which is therefore not onely fruitleſs but hurtful, as ſome other like reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are found to be when they are fully diſcovered.</p>

               <p>VIctuals and Munition for war are ſo pretious in a Commonwealth, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſeemeth neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the exportation altogether,

or (if the plenty permits it) to require the return thereof in ſo much treaſure; which appeareth to be reaſonable and without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, becauſe <hi>Spain</hi> and other Countries do willingly part with their money for ſuch wares, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in other occaſions of trade they ſtraightly prohibit the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof: all which I grant to be true, yet notwithſtanding we muſt conſider that all the ways and means which (in courſe of trade) force treaſure into the Kingdom, do not therefore make it ours: for this can be done one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a lawful gain, and this gain is no way to be accompliſhed but by the overballance of our trade, and this overballance is made leſs by reſtrictions: therefore ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions do hinder the increaſe<note place="margin">Some reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions hinder Trade.</note> of our treaſure. The Argument
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42437:51"/>
is plain, and needs no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſtrengthen it, except any man be ſo vain to think that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions would not cauſe the leſs wares to be exported. But if this likewiſe ſhould be granted, yet to enjoyn the Merchant to bring in money for Victuals and Munition carried out, will not cauſe us to have one peny the more in the Kingdom at the years end; for whatſoever is forced in one way muſt out again another way: becauſe onely ſo much will remain and abide with us as is gained and incorporated into the eſtate of the Kingdom by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance of the trade.</p>
               <p>This may be made plain by an example taken from an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had occaſion to buy and conſume the wares of divers ſtrangers for the value of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

pounds, and having wares of his own for the value of one thouſand pounds, he ſold them to the ſaid ſtrangers, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced all the mony from them into his own power; yet upon cleering of the reckoning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them there remained onely four hundred pounds to the ſaid Engliſhman for overballance of the wares bought and ſold; ſo the reſt which he had received was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back from whence he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it. And this ſhall ſuffice to ſhew that whatſoever courſes we take to force money into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet ſo much onely will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with us as we ſhall gain by the ballance of our trade.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The undervaluing of our Money which is delivered or receceived by Bills of Exchange here or beyond the Seas, cannot decreaſe our treaſure.</head>
               <p>THe Merchants Exchange by Bills is a means and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice whereby they that have money in one Countrey may deliver the ſame to receive it again in another Countrey at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times and rates agreed upon, whereby the lender and the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower are accommodated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tranſporting of treaſure from State to State.</p>
               <p>Theſe Exchanges thus made between man and man, are not contracted at the equal value of the moneys, according to their reſpective weights and fineneſs:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42437:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt, becauſe he that delivereth his money doth reſpect the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the debt, and the time of forbearance; but that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an under or overvaluing of moneys by Exchange, is the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſcarcity thereof in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Exchanges are made. For example, when here is plenty of money to be delivered for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> then ſhall our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney be undervalued in Exchange, becauſe they who take up the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſeeing it ſo plentifully thruſt upon them, do thereby make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to themſelves in taking the ſame at an undervalue.</p>
               <p>And contrariwiſe, when here is ſcarcity of mony to be delivered for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the deliverer will make the ſame advantage by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing our money which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth. And thus we ſee that as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42437:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
plenty or ſcarcity of mony in a<note place="margin">Plenty of Mony makes the Exchange cheap, and all other things dear.</note> Common-wealth doth make all things dear or good cheap: ſo in the courſe of exchange it hath ever a contrary working; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the next place it is fit to ſet down the true cauſes of this effect.</p>
               <p>As plenty or ſcarcity of mony do make the price of the exchange high or low, ſo the over or under ballance of our trade doth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cauſe the plenty or ſcarcity of mony: And here we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the ballance of our trade is either General or Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The General is, when all our yearly traffique is jointly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, as I have formerly ſhewed; the particular is when our trade to <hi>Italy, France, Turkey, Spain,</hi> and other Countreys are ſeverally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: and by this latter courſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42437:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we ſhall perfectly find out the places where our mony is under or overvalued in Exchange: For although our general exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wares may be yearly more in value than that which is imported, whereby the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is made good to us in ſo much treaſure; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the particlar trades do work diverſly: For peradventure the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> may bring us more in value than we ſell them, which if it be ſo, then do the <hi>Low</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What kinds of plenty or ſcarſity of mony make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change high or low.</note> 
                  <hi>Countrey</hi> Merchants not only carry away our treaſure to ballance the accompt between us, but alſo by this means mony being plentiful here to be delivered by exchange, it is therefore undervalued by the takers, as I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; And contrariwiſe if we carry more wares to <hi>Spain,</hi> and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42437:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other places than we conſume of theirs, then do we bring away their treaſure, and likewiſe in the Merchants exchange we overva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue our own money.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill there are ſome who will ſeem to make this plain by Demonſtration, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of our money by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change doth carry it out of the Kingdom: for, ſay they, we ſee daily great ſtore of our Engliſh Coins carried over, which paſs current in the Low-Countries, and there is great advantage to carry them thither, to ſave the loſs which the Low-Countrymen have in the Exchange; for if one hundred pounds ſterling deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, is ſo much undervalued, that ninty pounds of the ſame ſterling money carried over <hi>in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> ſhall be ſufficient to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42437:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and full ſatisfaction of the ſaid hundred pounds at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> Is it not then (ſay they) the undervaluing of our Mony which cauſeth it to be carried out of the Realm?</p>
               <p>To this Objection I will make a full and plain Anſwer, ſhewing that it is not the undervaluing of our money in exchange, but the overballancing of our trade that carrieth away our treaſure. For ſuppoſe that our whole trade with the Low-Countries for wares brought into this Realm be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed onely by the Dutch for the value of five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds yearly; and that all our commodities tranſported into the ſaid Low-Countries be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed onely by the Engliſh for four hundred thouſand pounds yearly: Is it not then manifeſt,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42437:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the Dutch can exchange on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly four hundred thouſand pounds with the Engliſh upon the <hi>Par pro Pari</hi> or equal value of the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Standards? So the other hundred thouſand pounds which is the overballance of the trade, they muſt of neceſsity carry that away in mony. And the ſelf ſame loſs of treaſure muſt happen if there were no exchange at all permitted: for the <hi>Dutch</hi> carrying away our mony for their wares, and we bringing in their forraign Coins for their commodities, there will be ſtill one hundred thouſand pounds loſs.</p>
               <p>Now let us add another exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grounded upon the aforeſaid proportion of trade between us and the <hi>Low Countreys.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> (as aforewritten) may exchange with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for four hundred
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42437:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thouſand pounds and no more upon the equal value of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have no further means to ſatisfie. But now ſuppoſe that in reſpect of the plenty of mony, which in this caſe will be here in the hands of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to deliver by exchange,<note place="margin">The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of our mony in Exchange is the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, loſs and our gain.</note> our mony (according to that which hath been already ſaid) be undervalued ten <hi>per cent.</hi> then is it manifeſt that the <hi>Dutch</hi> muſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver four hundred and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds to have the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans four hundred thouſand pounds in the <hi>Low Countreys:</hi> ſo that there will then remain but 60000. pounds for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to carry out of the Realm to ballance the accompt between them and us. Whereby we may plainly perceive that the undervaluing of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in exchange, will not carry
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42437:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it out of the Kingdom, as ſome men have ſuppoſed, but rather is a means to make a leſs quantity thereof to be exported, than would be done at the <hi>Par pro pari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further let us ſuppoſe that the Engliſh Merchant carrieth out as much wares in value as the Dutch Merchant bringeth in, whereby the means is equal between them to make their returns by exchange without carrying away of any mony to the prejudice of either State. And yet notwithſtanding the Dutch Merchant for his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions or advantage will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake this courſe of exchange, and will venture to ſend part of his returns in ready mony.</p>
               <p>To this the anſwer is, that hereupon it muſt follow of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that the Dutch ſhall want
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42437:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
juſt ſo much means in exchange with the Engliſh, who therefore ſhall be forced to bring in the like ſum of mony from beyond the Seas, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> carried out of this Realm; ſo that we may plainly perceive that the monies which are carried from us within the ballance of our trade are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, for they do return to us again: and we loſe thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies only which are made of the over ballance of our general trade, that is to ſay, That which we ſpend more in value in forraign wares, than we utter of our own commodities. And the contrary of this is the only means by which<note place="margin">1 The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. 2 Free trade. <hi>3 Lex Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoria.</hi> 4 The Centre of trade.</note> we get our treaſure. In vain therefore hath <hi>Gerard Malines</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured ſo long, and in ſo many printed books to make the world beleeve that the undervaluing of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42437:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our money in exchange doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt our treaſure, which is a mere fallacy of the cauſe, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that to a Secondary means, whoſe effects are wrought by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principal Efficient, and would alſo come to paſs although the ſaid Secondary means were not at all. As vainly alſo hath he propounded a remedy by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the price of Exchange by Bills at the <hi>par pro pari</hi> by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which were a new-found Office without example in any part of the world, being not only fruitleſs but alſo hurtful, as hath been ſufficiently proved in this Chapter, and therefore I will proceed to the next.</p>

               <p>THere are certain Merchants which deal onely upon all advantages in th'Exchange, and neither export nor import wares into the Kingdom, which hath cauſed ſome men to affirm, that the money which ſuch mere Exchangers bring in or carry out of the Realm is not comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ballance of our forraign trade; for (ſay they) ſometimes when our ſterling mony hath been undervalued and delivered here for <hi>Amſterdam</hi> at 10. <hi>per cent.</hi> leſs than the equal value of the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Standards, the ſaid mere Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changer may take here one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling, &amp; carry over
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42437:58"/>
onely nine hundred thereof <hi>in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> which will be ſufficient to pay his Bill of Exchange. And ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a greater or a leſſer ſumme the like gain is made in three months time.</p>
               <p>But here we muſt know, that although this mere Exchanger deal not in wares, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the money which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth away in manner afore-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten muſt neceſſarily proceed of ſuch wares as are brought into the Kingdom by Merchants. So that ſtill it falleth into the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of our forraign trade, and worketh the ſame effect, as if the Merchant himſelf had carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that money, which he muſt do if our wares be overballanced, as ever they are when our money is undervalued, which is expreſſed more at large in the 12. Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:42437:58"/>And on the contrary, when the mere Exchanger (by the ſaid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages) ſhall bring money into the Kingdom, he doth no more than neceſſarily muſt be done by the Merchant himſelf when our commodities overballance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign wares.

               <p>If I had a deſire to amplifie in the explanation of theſe wonders, they would afford me matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42437:63"/>
to make a large volume, but my intent is to do it as briefly as poſsibly I may without obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And before I begin, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but laugh to think how a worthy Lawyer might be deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in his laudable ſtudies, when he ſhould ſee more cunning in <hi>Lex Mercatoria</hi> by a little part of the Merchants profeſsion, then in all the Law-caſes of his learned Authors: for this Exchange goes beyond <hi>Conjuring;</hi> I think verily that neither Doctor <hi>Fauſtus</hi> nor <hi>Banks</hi> his Horſe could ever do ſuch admirable feats, although it is ſure they had a Devil to help them; but wee Merchants deal not with ſuch Spirits, we delight not to be thought the workers of lying wonders, and therefore I endeavour here to ſhew the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our dealing (in theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42437:63"/>
feats) to be agreeable to the laudable courſe of Trade.</p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>To lay our Money with gaine to any place of the World where Exchange lieth.</hi> How can this be done (will ſome men ſay) for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> when the loſſe by Exchange is ſometimes eight or ten <hi>per cent.</hi> more or leſſe for one moneths uſance? The anſwer is, That here I muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, firſt, that the principal effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<note place="margin">The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal efficient cauſe of loſs by Exchange.</note> cauſe of this loſſe, is a greater value in Wares brought from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> then we carry thither, which make more Deliverers then Takers here by Exchange, whereby the Mony is undervalued to the benefit of the taker: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Deliverer, rather then he will loſe by his Money, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe Countreys, unto which we carry more Wares in value
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42437:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than we receive from them; as namely, <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and others; to which places he is ſure (for the reaſons aforeſaid) that he ſhall ever deliver his money with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. But now you will ſay, that the money is further from <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> than before; How ſhall it be got together? yes, well enough; and the farther about will prove the neareſt way home, if it come at laſt with good profit; the firſt part whereof being made (as we have ſuppoſed) in <hi>Spain,</hi> from thence I conſider where to make my ſecond gain, and finding that the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſend out a greater value in cloth of Gold and Silver, wrought Silks, and Raſhes to <hi>Spain,</hi> than they receive in Fleece Woolls, Weſt-India Hides, Sugar and Cochineal, I know I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſs of my purpoſe by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42437:64"/>
my money for <hi>Florence;</hi> where (ſtill upon the ſame ground) I direct my courſe from thence to <hi>Venice,</hi> and there finde that my next benefit muſt be at <hi>Frankfort</hi> or <hi>Antwerp,</hi> untill at laſt I come to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> by a ſhorter or longer courſe, according to ſuch occaſions of advantage as the times and places ſhall afford me. And thus we ſee ſtill, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and loſs upon the Exchange is guided and ruled by the over or under ballance of the ſeveral Trades which are Predominant and Active, making the price of Exchange high or low, which is therefore Paſsive, the contrary whereof is ſo often repeated by the ſaid <hi>Malynes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſecond, fourth, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and twenty third, I ſay, that all theſe are the proper works
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42437:65"/>
of the meer Exchanger, and that his actions cannot work to the good or hurt of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, I have already ſufficiently ſhewed in the laſt Chap. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here I may ſpare that labour.</p>
               <p>To the third. It is true, I can deliver one thouſand pounds here by exchange to receive the value in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where with this Spaniſh money I can buy and bring away ſo much Spaniſh wares. But all this doth not prove, but that in the end the Engliſh money or commodities muſt pay for the ſaid wares: for if I deliver my thouſand pounds here to an Engliſh man, he muſt pay me in <hi>Spain,</hi> either by goods already ſent, or to be ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or if I deliver it here to a Spaniard, he takes it of me, with intent to employ it in our
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42437:65"/>
wares; ſo that every way we muſt pay the Stranger for what we have from him: Is there any feats in all this worthy your admiration?</p>
               <p>To the fifth, thirtenth, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, and twenty firſt. I muſt anſwer theſe Wonders by heaps, where I finde them to be all one matter in divers formes, and ſuch froth alſo, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Idiot knowes them, and can ſay, that he who hath credit can contract, buy, ſell, and take up much money by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, which he may do as well alſo at Intereſt: yet in theſe courſes they are not alwayes gainers, for ſometimes they live by the loſſe, as well as they who have leſs credit.</p>
               <p>To the ſixth and ſeventh. Here is more poor ſtuff; for when I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42437:66"/>
know the current price of my Wares, both here and beyond the Seas, I may eaſily conjecture whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the profit of the Exchange or the gain which I expect upon my Wareswil be greater. And again, as every Merchant knows well what he gains upon the Wares he buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſelleth, ſo may any other man do the like that can tell how the ſaid Merchant hath proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But what is all this to make us admire the Exchange?</p>
               <p>To the eighth and twelfth. As Bankers and Exchangers do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh men with money for their occaſions, ſo do they likewiſe who let out their money at intereſt with the ſame hopes and like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which many times not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding fails them, as well as the Borrowers often labour onely for the Lenders profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:42437:66"/>To the ninth and eighteenth. Here my Author hath ſome ſecret meaning, or being conſcious of his own errours, doth mark theſe two Wonders with a ☞ in the Margin. For why ſhould this great work of enriching or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhing of Kingdomes be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Exchange, which is done onely by thoſe means that doe over or under-ballance our Forraign Trade, as I have already ſo often ſhewed, and as the very words of <hi>Malynes</hi> himſelf in theſe two place may intimate to a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader?</p>
               <p>To the fifteenth and ſixteenth, I confeſs that the Exchange may be uſed in turning baſe money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gold or Silver, as when a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may coin and bring over a great quantity of Farthings, which in ſhort time he may diſperſe or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42437:67"/>
convert into good money, and then deliver the ſame here by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to receive the value in his own Countrey; or he may do this feat by carrying away the ſaid good mony <hi>in ſpecie</hi> without uſing the exchange at all, if he dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the penalty of the Law. The Spaniards know well who are the common Coiners of Chriſtendome, that dare venture to bring them ſtore of Copper money of the Spaniſh ſtamp, and carry away the value in good Ryals of Eight, wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their cunning devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are ſometimes taken tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
               <p>To the 17. The Bankers are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to receive ſuch ſums of mony as are put into their hands by men of all degrees, who have no skill or good means
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42437:67"/>
themſelves to manage the ſame upon the exchange to profit. It is likewiſe true that the Bankers do repay all men with their own, and yet reſerve good gain to themſelves, which they do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well deſerve for their ordinary proviſion or allowance as thoſe Factors do which buy or ſell for Merchants by Commiſsion: And is not this likewiſe both juſt and very common?</p>
               <p>To the 11. I muſt confeſs that<note place="margin">

The Exchange by<note place="margin">Exchange hinders not Princes of their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.</note> bills between Merchant and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in the courſe of trade can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder Princes of their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Impoſts: for the mony which one man delivereth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not, or hath not occaſion to employ it in wares, another man taketh, becauſe he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42437:68"/>
either will or hath already laid it out in Merchandize. But it is true, that when the wealth of a Kingdom conſiſteth much in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mony, and that there is alſo good means and conveniencie in ſuch a Kingdom to trade with the ſame into forraign parts, either by Sea or Land, or by both theſe ways; if then this trade be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, the King ſhall be defeated of thoſe profits: and if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change be the cauſe thereof, then muſt we learn in what manner this is done; for we may exchange either amongſt our ſelves, or with ſtrangers; if amongſt our ſelves, the Commonwealth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enriched thereby; for the gain of one ſubject is the loſs of another. And if we exchange with ſtrangers, then our profit is the gain of the Commonwealth.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42437:69"/>
Yet by none of theſe ways can the King receive any benefit in his cuſtomes. Let us therefore ſeek out the places where ſuch exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging is uſed, and ſet down the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why this practice is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; in ſearch whereof we ſhall only find one place of note in all Chriſtendome, which is <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> whereof I intend to ſay ſomething as briefly as I can.</p>
               <p>The State of <hi>Genoua</hi> is ſmall,<note place="margin">The preſent eſtate of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Genoua.</hi>
                  </note> and not very fertile, having little natural wealth or materials to employ the people, nor yet victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ſufficient to feed them; but nevertheleſs by their induſtry in former times by forraign trade into <hi>Aegypt, Soria, Conſtantinople,</hi> and all thoſe Levant parts for Spices, Drugs, raw Silks and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other rich wares, with which they ſerved the moſt places of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:42437:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they grew to an incredible wealth, which gave life unto the ſtrength of their Cities, the pomp of their buildings, and other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular beauties. But after the foundation and encreaſe of that famous City of <hi>Venice,</hi> the ſaid trades turned that way. And ſince likewiſe the greateſt part thereof doth come into <hi>England, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation directly from the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> which alterations in the traffique, hath forced them of <hi>Genoua</hi> to change their courſe of trading with wares, into exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their mony; which for gain they ſpread not only into divers Countreys where the trade is performed with Merchandize, but more eſpecially they do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſerve the want of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> and other places
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42437:70"/>
for their wars, whereby the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Merchants are much enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the publique treaſure by this courſe is not encreaſed, and the reaſons why the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Genoua</hi> doth ſuffer this inconvenience, are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt and principally, they are forced to leave thoſe trades which they cannot keep from other Nations, who have better means by ſituation, wares, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Munition and the like, to perform theſe affairs with more advantage than they are able to doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they proceed like a wiſe State, who ſtill retain as much trade as they can, although they are not able to procure the twentieth part of that which they had. For having few or no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of their own to employ
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42437:70"/>
their people, yet they ſupply this want by the Fleece-wools of <hi>Spain,</hi> and raw Silks of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> working them into Velvets, Damasks, Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, Woollen-drapery, and other manufactures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas they find no means in their own Countrey to employ and trade their great wealth to profit, they content themſelves to do it in <hi>Spain</hi> and other places, either in Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, or by exchanging their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for gain to thoſe Merchants who trade therewith in wares. And thus whereſoever they live abroad for a time circuiting the world for gain; yet in the end the Center of this profit is in their own Native Countrey.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the government of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi> being <hi>Ariſtocracie,</hi> they are aſſured that although the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42437:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
get little, yet if their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Merchants gain much from ſtrangers, they ſhall doe well enough, becauſe the <hi>richeſt</hi> and <hi>ſecureſt Treaſure of a Free State, are the riches of the Nobility</hi> (who in <hi>Genoua</hi> are Merchants) which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not out ſo in a Monarchy, where between the comings in of a Prince, and the means of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men, there is this diſtinction of <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> but in the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and dangers of a Republick or Commonwealth, where Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Government might be changed into Servitude, there the <hi>Proper ſubſtance of private men is the publique Treaſure,</hi> ready to be ſpent with their lives in defence of their own Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>To the 24. If a Merchant ſhould buy wares here with intentions to ſend them for <hi>Venice,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:42437:71"/>
and then value them as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change comes from thence to <hi>London,</hi> he may find himſelf far wide of his reckoning: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his goods arrive at <hi>Venice;</hi> both the price of his Wares and the rate of the Exchange may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very much. But if the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Author be, that this valuation may be made after the goods arrive, and are ſold at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and the money remitted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Exchange, or elſe the money which bought the ſaid wares here may be valued as the Exchange paſſed at that time from hence to <hi>Venice;</hi> Is not all this very common and eaſie buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unworthy to be put into the number of <hi>Admirable feats?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the tenth. Although a rich Prince hath great power, yet is there not power in every rich
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42437:72"/>
Prince to make the ſtaple of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney run where he pleaſeth: for the Staple of any thing is not where it may be had, but where the thing doth moſt of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. Whereupon we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, that the Spaniard, in regard of his great treaſure in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> hath the Fountain or Staple of money, which he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and cauſeth to run into <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places where his occaſions doe require it, either for Peace or War. Neither is this effected by any ſingular Power of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, but by divers wayes and means fitting thoſe places where the money is to be employed. For if the uſe thereof be upon the confines of <hi>France</hi> to maintain a War there, then may it be ſafely ſent <hi>in ſpecie</hi> on Carriages by Land;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42437:72"/>
if in <hi>Italy,</hi> on Gallies by Sea; if in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> on Shipping by Sea alſo, but yet with more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in regard of his potent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in that paſſage. Wherefore in this occaſion, although the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is not abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet is it very uſeful. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spaniards want of Commodities from <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> is greater in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than the Spaniſh Wares which are carried into thoſe parts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King of <hi>Spain</hi> cannot be furniſhed there from his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with money by exchange, but is and hath been a long time enforc'd to carry a great part of his treaſure in Gallies for <hi>Italy,</hi> where<note place="margin">How the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to furniſh <hi>Spain</hi> with money in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </note> the Italians, and amongſt them the Merchants of <hi>Genoua</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do take the ſame, and repay the value thereof in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:42437:73"/>
whereunto they are enabled by their great trade with many rich commodities which they ſend continually out of <hi>Italy</hi> into thoſe Countreys and the places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, from whence the Italians return no great value in wares, but deliver their money for the ſervice of <hi>Spain,</hi> and receive the value by Exchange in <hi>Italy</hi> out of the Spaniſh Treaſure, which is brought thither in Gallies, as is afore-written.</p>
               <p>So that by this we plainly ſee, that it is not the <hi>power of Exchange</hi> that doth enforce treaſure where the rich Prince will have it, but it is the money proceeding of wares in Forraigne trade that doth enforce the exchange, and rules the price thereof high or low, according to the plenty or ſcarcity of the ſaid money, which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42437:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in this diſcourſe, upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I think I have repeated neer as often as <hi>Malynes</hi> in his Books doth make the Exchange to be an eſſential part of trade, to be <hi>active, predominant, over-ruling the price of Wares and Moneys, life, ſpirit, and the worker of admirable feats.</hi> All which we have now briefly expounded; and let no man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire why he himſelf did not take this pains, for then he ſhould not onely have taken away the great opinion which he laboured to maintain of the Exchange, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by a true diſcovery of the right operation therof, he ſhould utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have overthrown his <hi>par pro pari;</hi> which project (if it had prevailed) would have been a good buſineſſ for the Dutch, and to the great hurt of this Common-wealth, as hath been ſufficiently proved in the 12. chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:42437:74"/>Now therefore let the learned Lawyer fall cheerfully to his books again, for the Merchant cannot put him down, if he have no more skill than is in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. Are theſe ſuch <hi>admirable feats,</hi> when they may be ſo eaſily known and done in the courſe of trade? Well then, if by this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very we have eaſed the Lawyers minde, and taken off the edge of his admiration, let him now play his part, and take out a <hi>Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> againſt the <hi>Par pro Pari;</hi> for this project hath miſinformed many, and put us to trouble to expound theſe Riddles.</p>
               <p>Nay, but ſtay awhile, can all this paſs for current, to ſlight a buſineſs thus, which (the Author ſaith) hath been ſo ſeriouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by that famous Council, and thoſe worthy Merchants of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42437:74"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and alſo condemned by thoſe French Kings, <hi>Lewis</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Philip the fair,</hi> and <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> with confiſcation of the Bankers goods? I muſt confeſs that all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an anſwer, which in part is already done by the Author himſelf. For he ſaith, that the wiſdome of our State found out the evil, but they miſſed of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; and yet what remedy this ſhould be no man can tell; for there was none applyed, but all practiſe and uſe in Exchange ſtand ſtill to this day in ſuch manner and form as they did at the time when theſe Feats were diſcovered, for the State knew well that there needed no remedy where there was no diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Well then, how ſhall we be able to anſwer the proceedings of

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of ſome Exceſſes and evils in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which notwithſtanding decay not our Trade nor Treaſure.</head>
               <p>IT is not my intent to excuſe or extenuate any the leaſt exceſs or evil in the Commonwealth, but rather highly to approve and commend that which by others hath been ſpoken and written againſt ſuch abuſes. Yet in this diſcourſe of Treaſure, as I have already ſet down affirmatively,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42437:76"/>
which are the true cauſes that may either augment or decreaſe the ſame: ſo is it not impertinent to continue my negative declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe enormities and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which cannot work theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as ſome men have ſuppoſed. For in redreſs of this important buſineſs, if we miſtake the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Malady, we ſhall ever apply ſuch cures as will at leaſt delay, if not confound the Remedy.</p>
               <p>Let us then begin with uſury, which if it might be turned into Charity, and that they who are Rich would lend to the poor free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; it were a work pleaſing to Almighty God, and profitable to the Commonwealth. But ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in the degree it now ſtands; How can we well ſay, That as <hi>uſury encreaſeth,</hi> ſo <hi>Trade decreaſeth?</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:42437:77"/>
For although it is true that ſome men give over trading, and buy Lands, or put out their Money to uſe when they are grown rich, or old, or for ſome other the like occaſions; yet for all this it doth not follow, that the quantity of the trade muſt leſſen; for this courſe in the rich giveth opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity preſently to the <hi>younger</hi> &amp; <hi>poorer</hi> Merchants to riſe in the world, and to enlarge their dealings; to the performance whereof, if they want means of their own, they may, and do, take it up at intereſt: ſo that our money lies not dead, it is ſtill traded. How many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and Shop-keepers have begun with little or nothing of their own, and yet are grown ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich by trading with other mens money? do we not know, that when trading is quick and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42437:77"/>
good, many men, by means of their experience, and having cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to take up money at intereſt, do trade for much more than they are worth of their own ſtock? by which diligence of the induſtrious, the affairs of the Common-wealth are increaſed, the moneys of Widows, Orphans, Lawyers, Gentlemen and others, are employed in the courſe of Forraign Trade, which themſelves have no skill to perform. We find at this preſent, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Poverty we are fallen into by the Exceſſes and Loſſes of late times, yet that many men have much money in their cheſts, and know not how to diſpoſe thereof, becauſe the Merchant will not take the ſame at intereſt (although at low rates) in regard there is a ſtop of trade in <hi>Spain</hi> and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42437:78"/>
in <hi>France,</hi> whereby he cannot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his own meanes, much leſſe other mens moneys. So that for theſe, and ſome other reaſons which might be alledged, we might conclude, contrary to thoſe who affirm, that Trade decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as uſury encreaſeth, for they <hi>riſe and fall together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, we hear our Lawyers much condemned; the vexation and charges by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Sutes do exceed all the other Kingdomes of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> but whether this proceed from the Lawyers Covetouſneſs, or the Peoples Perverſeneſs, it is a great queſtion. And let this be as it may, I will enquire no farther therein than our preſent diſcourſe doth require, concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of our Trade, and impoveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the Kingdom: Sure I am,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42437:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Sutes in Law make many a man poor and pennileſs, but how it ſhould make us trade for leſs by one ſingle penny, I cannot well conceive. For although amongſt the great number of them who are vexed and undone by contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, there be ever ſome Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; yet we know, that one mans neceſsity becomes another mans opportunity. I never knew as yet, a decay in our Trade and Treaſure for want of Merchants, or Means to employ us, but rather by exceſsive Conſumption of Forraign Wares at home, or by a declination in the vent of our Commodities abroad, cauſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ruinous effects of Wars, or ſome alterations in the times of Peace, whereof I have ſpoken more fully in the third Chapter. But, to conclude with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42437:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lawyers, I ſay, that their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Profeſsion is neceſſary for all, and their Caſes, Quillets, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes and Charges, are miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to many; theſe things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are Cankers in the Eſtates of particular men, but not of the Common-wealth, as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for one mans loſs becomes another mans gain, it is ſtill in the Kingdome, I wiſh it might as ſurely remain in the right pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, all kind of Bounty and Pomp is not to be avoided, for if we ſhould become ſo frugal, that we would uſe few or no Forraign wares, how ſhall we then vent our own commodities? what will become of our Ships, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Munitions, our poor Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and many others? doe we hope that other Countreys will
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42437:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
afford us money for All our wares, without buying or barter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Some of theirs? this would prove a vain expectation; it is more ſafe and ſure to run a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle courſe by ſpending moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which will purchaſe treaſure plentifully.</p>
               <p>Again, the pomp of Buildings, Apparel, and the like, in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry, and other able perſons, cannot impoveriſh the Kingdome; if it be done with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and coſtly works upon our Materials, and by our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it will maintain the poor with the purſe of the rich, which is the beſt diſtribution of the Common-wealth. But if any man ſay, that when the people want work, then the Fiſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade would be a better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and far more profitable; I
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42437:80"/>
ſubſcribe willingly. For in that great buſineſs there is means enough to employ both rich and poor, whereof there hath been much ſaid and written; It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth only that ſomething might be as well effected for the honor and wealth, both of the King and his Kingdoms.</p>

               <p>NOw that we have ſet down the true courſe by which a Kingdom may be enriched with treaſure; In the next place we will endeavour to ſhew the ways and means by which a King may juſtly ſhare therein without the hurt or oppreſsion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The Revenues of Princes
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42437:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as they differ much in quantity, according to the greatneſs, riches and trade of their reſpective dominions; ſo likewiſe is there great diverſity uſed in procuring the ſame, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Countreys, the government, laws and cuſtoms of the people, which no Prince can alter but with much difficulty and danger. Some Kings have their Crown Lands, the firſt fruits upon Eccleſiaſtical Livings, Cuſtoms, Tolls and Impoſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all trade to and from forraign Countries; Lones, Donations and Subſidies upon all neceſſary occaſions. Other Princes and States leaving the three laſt, do add unto the reſt, a cuſtom upon all new wares tranſported from one City, to be uſed in any other City or place of their own dominions,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42437:81"/>
cuſtoms upon every alienation or ſale of live Cattel, Lands, Houſes, and the portions or marriage mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of women, licence mony upon all Victualling houſes and Inkeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, head mony, Cuſtom upon all the Corn, Wine, Oyl, Salt and the like, which grow and are conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their own dominions, &amp;c. All which ſeem to be a rabble of oppreſsions, ſerving to enrich thoſe Princes which exact them, and to make the people poor and miſerable which endure them; eſpecially in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys where theſe burdens are laid at heavy rates, at 4, 5, 6, and 7. <hi>per cent.</hi> But when all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and diſtinction of places are duly conſidered, they will be found not only neceſſary and therefore lawful to be uſed in ſome States, but alſo in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42437:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very profitable to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p>Firſt there are ſome States, as namely <hi>Venice, Florence, Genoua,</hi> the united Provinces of the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,</hi> and others, which are ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for beauty, and excellent both for natural and artificial ſtrength, having likewiſe rich Subjects: yet being of no very great extent, nor enjoying ſuch wealth by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary revenues as might ſupport them againſt the ſuddain and powerful invaſions of thoſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Princes which do inviron them; they are therefore enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtrengthen themſelves not only with confederates and Leagues (which may often fail them in their greateſt need) but alſo by maſsing up ſtore of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Munition by thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary courſes before writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42437:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which cannot deceive them, but will ever be ready to make a good defence, and to offend or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their enemies.</p>
               <p>Neither are theſe heavy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions ſo hurtfull to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of the people, as they are commonly eſteemed: for as the food and rayment of the poor is made dear by Exciſe, ſo doth the price of their labour riſe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; whereby the burden (if any be) is ſtill upon the rich, who are either idle, or at leaſt work not in this kind, yet have they the uſe and are the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers of the poors labour: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the rich neglect in their ſeveral places and callings to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their endeavours according to thoſe times which do exhauſt their means and revenues; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if they ſhould peradventure
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42437:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fail, and therefore be forced to abate their ſinful exceſs and idle retainers; what is all this but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in a Commonwealth, when vertue, plenty and arts ſhall thus be advanced all together? Nor can it be truly ſaid that a Kingdom is impoveriſhed where the loſs of the people is the gain of the King, from whom alſo ſuch yearly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes have their annual iſſue to the benefit of his Subjects; except only that part of the treaſure which is laid up for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good; wherein likewiſe they who ſuffer have their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore ſuch contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are both juſt and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Yet here we muſt confeſs, that as the beſt things may be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo theſe taxes may be abuſed and the Commonwealth notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42437:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wronged when they are vainly waſted and conſumed by a Prince, either upon his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsive pleaſures, or upon unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons, ſuch as deſerve nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rewards nor countenance from the Majeſty of a Prince: but theſe dangerous diſorders are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen, eſpecially in ſuch States as are aforenamed, becauſe the diſpoſing of the publique trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is in the power and under the diſcretion of many; Neither is it unknown to all other Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Governments that the end of ſuch Exceſſes is ever ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for they cauſe great want and poverty, which often drives them from all order to exorbitance, and therefore it is common poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy amongſt Princes to prevent ſuch miſchiefs with great care and providence, by doing nothing that

may cauſe the Nobility to deſpair of their ſafety, nor leaving any thing undone which may gain the good will of the Commonalty to keep all in due obedience.</p>
               <p>But now before we end this<note place="margin">Some States cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but by the means of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy taxes.</note> point in hand, we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber likewiſe that all bodies are not of one and the ſame conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that which is Phyſick to one man, is little better than poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to another; The States afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, and divers others like to them cannot ſubſiſt but by the help of thoſe extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, whereof we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, becauſe they are not able otherwiſe in ſhort time to raiſe ſufficient treaſure to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt a potent enemy, who hath power to invade them on the ſuddain, as is already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. But a mighty Prince
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42437:84"/>
whoſe dominions are great and united, his Subjects many and Loyal, his Countries rich both by nature and traffique, his Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and warlike proviſions plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ready, his ſituation eaſy to offend others, and difficult to be invaded, his harbors good, his Navy ſtrong, his alliance pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,<note place="margin">Princes, who have no juſt cauſe to lay extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heavy taxes upon their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> and his ordinary revenues ſufficient, royally to ſupport the <hi>Majeſty of his State,</hi> beſides a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum which may be advanc'd to lay up yearly in treaſure for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture occaſions: ſhall not all theſe bleſsings (being well ordered) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Prince againſt the ſuddain invaſion of any mighty enemy, without impoſing thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and heavy taxes? ſhall not the wealthy and loyal ſubjects of ſuch a great and juſt Prince main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Honour and their own

Liberties with life and goods, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſupplying the Treaſure of their Soveraign, untill by a well ordered War he may inforce a happy Peace? Yes verily, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be expected. And thus ſhall a mighty Prince be more powerful in preſerving the wealth and love of his Subjects, than by treaſuring up their riches with unneceſſary taxes, which cannot but alter and provoke them.</p>
               <p>Yea, but ſay ſome men, we may eaſily contradict all this by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple taken from ſome of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Monarchs of Chriſtendome, who, beſides thoſe Incomes which here are termed ordinary, they adde likewiſe all, or the moſt of the other heavy-Contributions.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42437:86"/>
accounting the honour and ſafety of great Princes to conſiſt more in their Bounty, than in their Money, which they labour to confirm by the examples of <hi>Caeſar, Alexander,</hi> and others, who hating covetouſneſs, atchieved may acts and victories by laviſh gifts and liberal expences.

of this kind in other Princes? <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> left ten millions of pounds to them that ſlew him. <hi>Darius</hi> left twenty millions of pounds to <hi>Alexander</hi> that took him; <hi>Nero</hi> being left rich, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting much from his beſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, gave away above twelve millions of pounds to his baſe flatterers and ſuch unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which cauſed <hi>Galba</hi> after him to revoke thoſe gifts.

maſsing up of Treaſure by wiſe and provident Princes, if they be rightly underſtood.</p>

Treaſure, which made him over-burthen his Subjects in ſuch a manner, that (for this cauſe) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them rebelled againſt his Son <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who thereby loſt a great part of his dominions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo groſly miſ-led by his young Counſellors.

This buſineſs doth ſeem at the firſt to be very plain and eaſy, for if a Prince have two millions yearly revenue, and ſpend but one, why ſhould he not lay up the other? Indeed I muſt confeſs that this courſe is ordinary in the means
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42437:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and gettings of private men, but in the affairs of Princes it is far different, there are other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to be conſidered; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the revenue of a King ſhould be very great, yet if the gain<note place="margin">Forraign Trade muſt give propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Princes trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is laid up yearly.</note> of the Kingdom be but ſmall, this latter muſt ever give rule and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to that Treaſure, which may conveniently be laid up year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for if he ſhould maſs up more mony than is gained by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance of his forraign trade, he ſhall not <hi>Fleece,</hi> bu <hi>Flea</hi> his Subjects, and ſo with their ruin overthrow himſelf for want of future ſheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. To make this plain, ſuppoſe a Kingdom to be ſo rich by nature and art, that it may ſupply it ſelf of forraign wares by trade, and yet advance yearly 200000 <hi>l.</hi> in ready mony: Next ſuppoſe all the Kings revenues to be 900000 <hi>l.</hi> and his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42437:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
expences but 400000 <hi>l.</hi> whereby he may lay up 300000 <hi>l.</hi> more in his Coffers yearly than the whole Kingdom gains from ſtrangers by forraign trade; who ſees not then that all the mony in ſuch a State, would ſuddenly be drawn into the Princes treaſure, whereby the life of lands and arts muſt fail and fall to the ruin both of the publick and private wealth? So that a King who deſires to lay up much mony muſt endeavour by all good means to maintain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <note place="margin">A Prince whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have but little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Trade cannot lay up much mony.</note> his forraign trade, becauſe it is the ſole way not only to lead him to his own ends, but alſo to enrich his Subjects to his farther benefit: for a Prince is eſteemed no leſs powerful by having many rich and well affected. Subjects, than by poſſeſsing much treaſure in his Coffers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:42437:90"/>But here we muſt meet with an Objection, which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be made concerning ſuch States (whereof I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpoken) which are of no great extent, and yet bordering upon mighty Princes, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſtrained to lay extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary taxes upon their ſubjects, whereby they procure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very great incomes yearly, and are richly provided againſt any Forraign Invaſions; yet have they no ſuch great trade with Strangers, as that the over-balance or gain of the ſame may ſuffice to lay up the one half of that which they advance yearly, beſides their own expences.</p>
               <p>To this the anſwer is, that ſtil the gain of their Forraign Trade muſt be the rule of laying up their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the which although it ſhould
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42437:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not not be much yearly, yet in the time of a long continued peace, and being well managed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, it will become a great ſumme of money, able to make a long defence, which may end or divert the war. Neither are all the advances of Princes ſtrictly tied to be maſſed up in treaſure, for they have other no leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and profitable wayes to make them rich and powerfull, by iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out continually a great part of the mony of their yearly Incomes to their ſubjects from whom it was firſt taken; as namely, by employing them to make Ships of War, with all the proviſions thereunto belonging, to build and repair Forts, to buy and ſtore up Corn in the Granaries of each Province for a years uſe (at leaſt) aforehand, to ſerve in occaſion of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42437:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Dearth, which cannot be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a State but with great danger, to erect Banks with their money for the encreaſe of their ſubjects trade, to maintain in their pay, Collonels, Captains, Souldiers, Commanders, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and others, both by Sea and Land, with good diſcipline, to fill their Store-houſes (in ſundry<note place="margin">Munition for war ought to be kept in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of the State, to prevent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the loſs of all by treachery in one place.</note> ſtrong places) and to abound in Gunpowder, Brimſtone, Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, Shot, Ordnance, Muſquets, Swords, Pikes, Armours, Horſes, and in many other ſuch like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions fitting War; all which will make them to be feared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and loved at home, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if care be taken that all (as neer as poſsible) be made out of the Matter and Manufacture of their own ſubjects, which bear the burden of the yearly Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42437:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for a Prince (in this caſe) is like the ſtomach in the body, which if it ceaſe to digeſt and diſtribute to the other members, it doth no ſooner corrupt them, but it deſtroyes it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeen that a ſmall State may lay up a great wealth in neceſſary proviſions, which are Princes Jewels, no leſs precious than their Treaſure, for in time of need they are ready, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be had (in ſome places) on the ſuddain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a State may be loſt, whileſt Munition is in providing: ſo that we may account that Prince as poor who can have no wares to buy at his need, as he that hath no money to buy wares; for although <hi>Treaſure is ſaid to be the ſinews of the War,</hi> yet this is ſo becauſe it doth
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42437:92"/>
provide, unite &amp; move the power of men, victuals, and munition where and when the cauſe doth require; but if theſe things be wanting in due time, what ſhall we then do with our mony? the conſideration of this, doth cauſe divers well-governed States to be exceeding provident and well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of ſuch proviſions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe Granaries and Storehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with that famous <hi>Arſenal</hi> of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> are to be admired for the magnificence of the buildings, the quantity of the Munitions and Stores both for Sea and Land, the multitude of the workmen, the diverſity and excellency of the Arts, with the order of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of ſome different effects, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Naturall and Artificiall Wealth.</head>
               <p>IN the latter end of the third Chapter of this Book, I have already written <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſomething concerning Natural and Artificial Wealth, and therein ſhewed how much Art doth add to Nature; but it is yet needful to handle theſe particulars apart, that ſo we may the better diſcern their ſeverall operations in a Common-wealth. For the effecting whereof, I might draw ſome compariſons from <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> or from ſome other remote Countreys, but I will not range ſo far, having mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42437:93"/>
ſufficient here in <hi>Great Britain</hi> and the <hi>united Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> to make this buſineſs plain: wherefore, in the firſt place, we will begin with <hi>England</hi> briefly, and onely in general terms, to ſhew the natural riches of this famous Nation, with ſome principal effects which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the diſpoſition of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtrength of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>If we duly conſider <hi>Englands</hi> Largeneſs, Beauty, Fertility, Strength, both by Sea and Land, in multitude of warlike People, Horſes, Ships, Ammunition, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious ſituation for Defence and Trade, number of Sea-ports and Harbours, which are of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult acceſs to Enemies, and of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie out-let to the Inhabitants wealth by excellent Fleece-wools,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42437:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Iron, Lead, Tynn, Saffron, Corn, Victuals, Hides, Wax, and other natural Endowments; we ſhall find this Kingdome capable to ſit as maſter of a Monarchy. For what greater glory and advantage can any powerful Nation have, than to be thus richly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally poſſeſſed of all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Food, Rayment, War, and Peace, not onely for its own plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful uſe, but alſo to ſupply the wants of other Nations, in ſuch a meaſure, that much money may be thereby gotten yearly, to make the happineſs compleat. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience telleth us, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that exceſsive Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of this Kingdome alone, to ſay nothing of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>communibus annis</hi> of our own native commodities for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of twenty two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42437:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> or ſomewhat more; ſo that if we were not too much affected to Pride, monſtrous Faſhions, and Riot, above all other Nations, one million and an half of pounds might plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupply our unneceſſary wants (as I may term them) of Silks, Sugars, Spices, Fruits, and all others; ſo that ſeven hundred thouſand pounds might be yearly treaſur'd up in money to make the Kingdome exceeding rich and powerful in ſhort time. But this great plenty which we enjoy, makes us a people not only <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>exceſsive,</hi> waſtful of the means we have, but alſo improvident &amp; careleſs of much other wealth that ſhamefully we loſe, which is, the Fiſhing in his Majeſty's Seas of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> being of no leſs conſequence than all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42437:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our other riches which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and vent to Strangers, whileſt<note place="margin">The fruits of Idleneſs, which are <hi>Englands</hi> common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> in the mean time (through lewd idleneſs) great multitudes of our people cheat, roar, rob, hang, beg, cant, pine and periſh, which by this means and maintenance might be much encreaſed, to the further wealth and ſtrength of theſe Kingdomes, eſpecially by Sea, for our own ſafety, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of our enemies. The endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the induſtrious Dutch do give ſufficient teſtimony of this truth, to <hi>our great ſhame, and no leſs perill,</hi> if it have not a timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention: for, whileſt we leave our wonted honourable exerciſes and ſtudies, following our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and of late years beſotting our ſelves with pipe and pot, in a beaſtly manner, ſucking ſmoak, and drinking healths, until death
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42437:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtares many in the face; the ſaid Dutch have well-neer left this ſwiniſh vice, and taken up our wonted valour, which we have often ſo well performed both by Sea and Land, and particularly in their defence, although they are not now ſo thankful as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge<note place="margin">The Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</note> the ſame. The ſumm of all is this, that the general le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie of our Piping, Potting, Feaſting, Faſhions, and mis-ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our time in Idleneſs and Pleaſure (contrary to the Law of God, and the uſe of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) hath made us effeminate in our bodies, weak in our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, poor in our Treaſure, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our Valour, unfortunate in our Enterpriſes, and contemned by our Enemies. I write the more of theſe exceſſes, becauſe they do ſo greatly waſt our wealth, which is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42437:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the main ſubject of this whole Books diſcourſe: and indeed our wealth might be a rare diſcourſe for all <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> to admire and fear, if we would but add <hi>Art</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> our <hi>labour</hi> to our <hi>natural means;</hi> the neglect whereof hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a notable advantage to other <hi>nations,</hi> &amp; eſpecially to the <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> whereof I will briefly ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the next place.</p>
               <p>But firſt, I will deliver my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning our <hi>Clothing,</hi> which although it is the greateſt Wealth and beſt Employment of the Poor of this Kingdome, yet nevertheleſſe we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure employ our ſelves with better Safety, Plenty, and Profit in uſing more Tillage and Fiſhing, than to truſt ſo wholly to the making of Cloth; for in times of War, or by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42437:96"/>
others occaſions, if ſome forraign Princes ſhould prohibit the uſe thereof in their dominions, it might ſuddenly cauſe much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and dangerous uproars, eſpecially by our poor people, when they ſhould be deprived of their ordinary maintenance, which cannot ſo eaſily fail them when their labours ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into the ſaid diverſity of employment, whereby alſo many thouſands would be the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to do the Kingdom good ſervice in occaſion of war, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by Sea: And ſo leaving <hi>England,</hi> wee will paſs over into the <hi>United Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As plenty and power doe make a nation vicious and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, ſo penury and want doe make a people wiſe and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42437:96"/>
concerning the laſt of theſe I might inſtance divers Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths of Chriſtendom, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little or nothing in their own Territories, do notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding purchaſe great wealth and ſtrength by their induſtrious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with ſtrangers, amongſt<note place="margin">The <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</note> which the united Provinces of the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> are now of greateſt note and fame: For ſince they have caſt off the yoke of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſlavery, how wonderfully are they improved in all humane po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy? What great means have they obtained to defend their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty againſt the power of ſo great an Enemy? and is not all this performed by their continual induſtry in the trade of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize? are not their Provinces the <hi>Magazines</hi> and <hi>Store-houſes of wares</hi> for moſt places of Chriſtendom,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42437:97"/>
whereby their Wealth, Shipping, Mariners, Arts, People, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the publique Revenues and Excizes are grown to a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful height? If we compare the times of their ſubjection, to their preſent eſtate, they ſeem not the<note place="margin">Thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which do willingly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Dutch,</hi> would as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely reſiſt the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                  </note> ſame people; for who knows not that the condition of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces was mean and turbulent under the <hi>Spaniards</hi> government, which brought rather a greater charge than a further ſtrength to their ambition; neither would it prove over difficult for the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes in ſhort time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe Countreys to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate again, if their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did require the ſame, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it would if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> were ſole Lord of thoſe <hi>Netherlands;</hi> but our diſcourſe tends not to ſhew the means of thoſe mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42437:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
otherwiſe than to find out the chief foundation of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> wealth and greatneſs: for it ſeems a wonder to the world, that ſuch a ſmall Countrey, not fully ſo big as two of our beſt Shires, having little natural Wealth, Victuals, Timber, or other neceſſary amunitions, either for war or peace, ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding poſſeſs them all in ſuch extraordinary plenty, that beſides their own wants (which are very great) they can and do likewiſe ſerve and ſell to other Princes, Ships, Ordnance, Cordage, Corn, Powder, Shot, and what not, which by their induſtrious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they gather from all the quarters of the world: In which<note place="margin">Much Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but little Honeſty.</note> courſes they are not leſs injurious to ſupplant others (eſpecially the Engliſh) than they are careful
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42437:98"/>
to ſtrengthen themſelves. And to effect this and more than hath been ſaid (which is their war with <hi>Spain</hi>) they have little foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation beſides the Fiſhing, <hi>which is permitted them in His Majeſties Seas,</hi> being indeed the means of an incredible wealth and ſtrength, both by Sea and Land, as <hi>Robert Hichcock, Tobias Gentleman,</hi> and others have publiſhed at large in print to them that liſt to read. And the <hi>States General</hi> themſelves in their proclamation have inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly ſet out the worth thereof in theſe words following, <hi>The</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Part of the States Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, dated in the <hi>Hague, 19. July 1624.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>great Fiſhing and catching of Herrings is the cheifeſt trade and principal Gold Mine of the United Provinces, whereby many thouſands of Houſholds, Families, Handicrafts, Trades and Occupations are ſet on work, well maintained and proſper, eſpecially the ſailing and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42437:98"/>
as well within as without theſe Countreys is kept in great eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Moreover many returns of mony, with the encreaſe of the means, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys, Cuſtoms and revenues of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys are augmented thereby and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> with other words following, as is at large expreſſed in the ſaid Proclamations, ſet forth by the States General for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſaid trade of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; without which it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that they cannot long ſubſiſt in Soveraignty; for if this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation periſh, the whole building of their wealth and ſtrength both by Sea and Land muſt fall; for the multitude of their Shipping would ſuddainly decay, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and cuſtoms would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſmall, their Countreys would be depopulated for want of maintenance, whereby the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42437:99"/>
muſt fail, and all their other trades to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where muſt faint. So that the glory and power of theſe <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> conſiſteth in this <hi>fiſhing of Herrings, Ling and Cod in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Seas.</hi> It reſteth therefore to know what right or title they have thereunto, and how they are able to poſſeſs and keep the ſame againſt all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The anſwers to theſe two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions are not difficult: for firſt, it is not the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> that can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to Fiſh in His Majeſties Seas. For beſides the Juſtice of the cauſe, and examples of other Countreys, which might be alleged, I will only ſay, that ſuch titles would be ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by ſwords, than with words;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42437:99"/>
I do beleeve indeed that it is free for the Fiſh to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at their pleaſure, but for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to catch and carry them away from thence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out His Majeſties licence, I harbour no ſuch thought. <hi>There may be good policy to connive ſtill, and ſo long to permit them this fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are in perfect league with</hi> England, <hi>and in war with</hi> Spain. But if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Maſters of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> as heretofore, it would neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern theſe Kingdoms to claim their own right, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to make as good uſe thereof for increaſe of their wealth and ſtrength, to oppoſe that potent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as now the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> do, and are thereby well enabled for the ſame purpoſe: by which particular alone they are ever
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42437:100"/>
bound to acknowledge their ſtrong alliance with <hi>England,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Nations, for there is none that hath the like good means to lend them ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful maintenance. Nor were it<note place="margin">Money and Fiſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note> poſsible for the Spaniard (if he had thoſe Countreys again) to make a new Foundation with the power of his money, to encreaſe his ſtrength, either by Sea or Land, to offend theſe Kingdoms, more than he is now able to perform with the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of thoſe Provinces which he hath already in his poſſeſsion; for it is not the Place, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, not the barren Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, but the rich Fiſhing, which gives Foundation, Trade, and Subſiſtence to thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Ships, Arts and People, whereby alſo the Exciſes and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42437:100"/>
other publick Revenues are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and without which Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment all the ſaid great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences muſt neceſſarily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon and fail in very ſhort time. For although I confeſs, that ſtore of money may bring them materials (which they altogether want) and Artſmen to build them Shipping, yet where are the wares to fraight and maintain them? if money then ſhall be the onely means to ſend them out in Trade, what a poor number of Ships will this employ? or if the uncertain occaſions of War muſt ſupport them, will not this require ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indies, and all too little to maintain the tenth part of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ships and Men as the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders do now ſet on work by the Fiſhing and other Trades thereon depending? But if it be yet ſaid,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42437:101"/>
that the Spaniard being Lord of all thoſe Netherlands, his expence of the preſent War there will ceaſe, and ſo this power may be turned upon us. The anſwer is, that when Princes ſend great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abroad to invade others, they muſt likewiſe encreaſe their charge and ſtrength at home, to defend themſelves; and alſo we muſt conſider, that if the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard will attempt any thing upon theſe Kingdomes, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a great part of his Treaſure in Shipping, whereby the means of his invading power of Money and Men to land will be much leſs than now it is in the <hi>Low Countreys:</hi> Nor ſhould we regard them, but be ever ready to beard them, when our Wealth and Strength by Sea and Land might be ſo much encreaſed by the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42437:101"/>
and practiſe of our Fiſhing, of which particular I will yet ſay ſomething more where occaſion ſhall be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that which followeth. And here in this place I will onely add, that if the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> were ſole Lord of all the Netherlands, he muſt then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily drive a great trade by Sea, to ſupply the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wants of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, whereby in occaſion of war, we ſhould have means daily to take much wealth from him; whereas now the <hi>Spaniard</hi> uſing little or no trade in theſe Seas, but imploying his Ships of warre to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of his power, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes, and we loſe great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters continually.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:42437:102"/>Now concerning the ſecond queſtion, <hi>Whether the Hollanders be able to poſſeſs and keep this fiſhing againſt all other Nations.</hi> It is very probable, that although they claim now no other right than their own freedome in this Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeming to leave the like to all others; yet if the practiſe of any Nation ſhould ſeek either to Fiſh with them or to ſupplant them, they would be both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and able to maintain this Golden Mine, againſt the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt oppoſition except <hi>England,</hi> whoſe harbours and In-lands with other daily reliefs are very needful, if not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for this employment, and whoſe Power alſo by Sea, is able (in ſhort-time) to give this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſturbance, and utter ruin, if the occaſion ſhould be ſo ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42437:102"/>
as is afore ſuppoſed: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it enough for any man to contradict all this by ſaying the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are very ſtrong by Sea, when both Sea and Land en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them with a greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: we muſt obſerve from whence their ſtrength doth grow, and if the root may once be ſpoiled, the branches ſoon will wither; and therefore it were an error to eſteem, or value them according to the preſent power and wealth, which they have obtained by trade or purchaſe; for although this were far greater then indeed it is, yet would it ſoon be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a chargeable war againſt a potent enemy, when the current of thoſe Accidents may be ſtopt and turned by preventing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſelf (which is the Fiſhing in His Majeſties Seas) that gives
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42437:103"/>
Foundation, and is the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their ſtrength and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The <hi>United Provinces</hi> (we know) are like a fair bird ſuited with goodly borrowed plumes; but if every Fowl ſhould take his feather, this bird would reſt neer naked: Nor have we ever ſeen theſe Netherlanders as yet in their greateſt occaſions to ſet forth neer ſo many ſhips of war at once as the Engliſh have often done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hinderance of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary traffique; It is true indeed, they have an infinite number of weak Ships to fiſh with, and fetch Corn, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their own victualling and trading, the like to fetch Timber, Plank, Boords, Pitch, Hemp, Tar, Flax, Maſts, Cordage, and other Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make thoſe multitudes of Ships, which unto them are as our

Ploughs to us, the which except<note place="margin">The Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers Ploughs.</note> they ſtir, the people ſtarve; their Shipping therefore cannot be ſpared from their traffique (as ours may if occaſion require) no not for a very ſhort time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out utter ruin, becauſe it is the daily maintenance of their great multitudes which gain their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but from hand to mouths upon which alſo depends the great exciſes, and other publique revenues, which ſupport the State it ſelf: Neither indeed are thoſe Veſſels ſtrong or fit for war; and in their proper uſe of Fiſhing and trade they would become the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or the purchaſe of a potent Enemy by Sea, as they partly find by one poor town of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> notwithſtanding their great charge of Men of war, ſtrong Convoys, and other

defended the aforeſaid Fiſhing againſt his Majeſties greateſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and alſo to ſend out and return home their Shipping proſperouſly that way, to and from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies, Spain,</hi> the <hi>Straights,</hi> and other places, without paſsing through his Majeſty's narrow Seas, where in all occaſions this Kingdome now hath ſo great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to take their Ships, and prevent their beſt Trades, which would ſoon bring them to ruine, whereby (as they well know) we have a greater tie and power over them than any other Nation.

to a Monarchy; &amp; what know we but that the Dutch may aim at ſome ſuch Soveraignty, when they ſhall find their Indian at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and other ſubtil plots ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo proſperouſly? Do we not ſee their Lands are now become too little to contain this ſwelling people, whereby their Ships and Seas are made the Habitations of great multitudes? and yet, to give them further breed, are they not ſpared from their own wars to enrich the State and themſelves by Trade and Arts? whileſt by this policy many thouſands of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are alſo drawn thither for performance of their martial em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, whereby the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of their Exciſes is ſo much the more encreaſed, and all things ſo ſubtilly contrived, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>forraign Souldier</hi> be well
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42437:107"/>
paid, yet all muſt be there again expended; and thus the Wealth remains ſtill in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; nor are the ſtrangers enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched which do them this great ſervice.</p>
               <p>I have heard ſome Italians wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and worthily diſcourſe of the natural Strength and Wealth of <hi>England,</hi> which they make to be matchleſs, if we ſhould (but in part) apply our ſelves to ſuch policies and endeavours as are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commonly uſed in ſome other Countreys of <hi>Europe;</hi> and much they have admired, that our thoughts and jealouſies attend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Spaniſh and French greatneſs, never once ſuſpecting, but conſtantly embracing the Netherlanders as our beſt Friends and Allies; when in truth (as they well obſerve) there are no
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42437:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people in Chriſtendome who do more undermine, hurt, and eclipſe us daily in our Navigation and Trades, both abroad and at home; and this not only in the rich Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Majeſty's Seas (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have already written) but alſo in our Inland trades between City and City, in the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of Silk, Woolls, and the like, made here in this Kingdom, wherein they never give employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or education in their Arts to the Engliſh, but ever (according to the cuſtome of the Jewes, where they abide in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and divers places of Chriſtendome) they live wholly to themſelves in their own Tribes. So that we may truly ſay of the Dutch, that although they are amongſt us, yet certainly they are not of us, no not they who are born and bred
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42437:108"/>
here in our own Countrey, for ſtil they will be Dutch, not having ſo much as one drop of Engliſh bloud in their hearts.</p>
               <p>More might be written of theſe Netherlanders pride and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavours, whereby they hope in time to grow mighty, if they be not prevented, and much more may be ſaid of their cruel and unjuſt violence uſed (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to their beſt friends, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh) in matters of bloud, trade, and other profits, where they have had advantage and power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it: but theſe things are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy publiſhed in print to the view and admiration of the world; wherefore I will conclude, and the ſumm of all is this, that the United Provinces, which now are ſo great a trouble, if not a terrour to the Spaniard, were heretofore
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42437:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
little better than a charge to them in their poſſeſsion, and would be ſo again in the like occaſion, the reaſons whereof I might yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlarge; but they are not pertinent to this diſcourſe, more than is already declared, to ſhew the different effects between <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Artificial Wealth:</hi> The firſt of which, as it is moſt noble and advantagious, being alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and certain, ſo doth it make the people careleſs, proud, and given to all exceſſes; whereas the ſecond enforceth Vigilancy, Literature, Arts and Policy. My wiſhes therefore are, that as <hi>England</hi> doth plentifully enjoy the one, and is fully capable of the other, that our endeavours might as worthily conjoyn them both together, to the reformation of our vicious idleneſs, and greater glory of theſe famous Kingdomes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> The order and means whereby we may draw up the ballance of our Forraign Trade.</head>
               <p>NOw, that we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved the Ballance of our Forraign Trade to be the true rule of our Treaſure; It reſteth that we ſhew by whom and in what manner the ſaid ballance may bedrawn up at all times, when it ſhall pleaſe the State to diſcover how we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper or decline in this great and weighty buſineſs, wherein the Officers of his Majeſties Cuſtomes are the onely Agents to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, becauſe they have the accounts of all the wares which are iſſued out or brought into the Kingdome; and although (it is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42437:109"/>
true) they cannot exactly ſet down the coſt and charges of other mens goods bought here or beyond the ſeas; yet nevertheleſs, if they ground themſelves upon the book of Rates, they ſhall be able to make ſuch an eſtimate as may well ſatisfie this enquiry: for it is not expected that ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can poſsibly be drawn up to a juſt ballance, it will ſuffice onely that the difference be not over great.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, concerning our<note place="margin">How we muſt value our Exportatione and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> Exportations, when we have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued their firſt coſt, we muſt add twenty five <hi>per cent.</hi> thereunto for the charges here, for fraight of Ships, enſurance of the <hi>Adventure,</hi> and the <hi>Merchants</hi> Gains; and for our Fiſhing Trades, which pay no Cuſtome to his Majeſty, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ſuch Exportations may be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42437:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eaſily eſteem'd by good obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have been made, and may continually be made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the increaſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of thoſe affairs, the preſent eſtate of this commodity being valued at one hundred and forty thouſand pounds iſſued yearly. Alſo we muſt add to our Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations all the moneys which are carried out in Trade by licenſe from his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for our Importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Forraign Wares, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome-books ſerve onely to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us concerning the quantity, for we muſt not value them as they are rated here, but as they coſt us with all charges laden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Ships beyond the Seas, in the reſpective places where they are bought: for the Merchants gain, the charges of Inſurance,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42437:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fraight of Ships, Cuſtomes, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, and other Duties here, which doe greatly indear them unto our uſe and conſumption, are notwithſtanding but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations amongſt our ſelves, for the Stranger hath no part thereof: wherefore our ſaid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations ought to be valued at twenty five <hi>per cent.</hi> leſs than they are rated to be worth here. And although this may ſeem to be too great allowance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many rich Commodities, which come but from the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> and other places neer hand, yet will it be found rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, when we conſider it in groſs Commodities, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wares laden in remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, as our Pepper, which coſt us, with charges, but four pence the pound in the <hi>Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:42437:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and it is here rated at twenty pence the pound: ſo that when all is brought into a <hi>medium,</hi> the valuation ought to be made as afore-written. And therefore, the order which hath been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to multiply the full rates upon wares inwards by twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would produce a very great errour in the Ballance, for in this manner the ten thouſand bags of Pepper, which this year we have brought hither from the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> ſhould be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at very near two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<note place="margin">The Trade to the Eaſt Indies is not onely great in it ſelf, but it doth alſo make our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trades much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they were.</note> all this Pepper in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes accompt, coſt not above fifty thouſand pounds, becauſe the Indians have had no more of us, although we paid them extraordinary dear prices for the ſame. All the other charges
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42437:111"/>
(as I have ſaid before) is but a change of effects amongſt our ſelves, and from the Subject to the King, which cannot impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh the Common-wealth. But it is true, that whereas nine thouſand bags of the ſaid Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are already ſhipped out for divers forraign parts; Theſe and all other Wares, forraign or domeſtick, which are thus tranſported Outwards, ought to be caſt up by the rates of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Cuſtome-money, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by twenty, or rather by twenty five (as I conceive) which will come neerer the reckoning, when we conſider all our Trades to bring them into a <hi>medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt remember, that all Wares exported or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Strangers (in their ſhipping) be eſteemed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42437:112"/>
for what they carry out, the Kingdom hath only the firſt coſt and the cuſtom: And what they bring in, we muſt rate itas it is worth here, the Cuſtom, Impoſt, and pety charges only deducted.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there muſt be good no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of all the great loſſes which we receive at Sea in our Shipping either outward or home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bound: for the value of the one is to be deducted from our Exportations, and the value of the other is to be added to our Importations: for to loſe and to conſume doth produce one and the ſame reckoning. Likewiſe if it happen that His Majeſty doth make over any great ſums of mony by Exchange to maintain a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign war, where we do not feed and clothe the Souldiers, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the armies, we muſt deduct all
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42437:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this charge out of our Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or add it to our Importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for this expence doth either carry out or hinder the coming in of ſo much Treaſure. And here we muſt remember the great col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of mony which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be made throughout the Realm yearly from our Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants by Prieſts and Jeſuits, who ſecretly convey the ſame unto their Colleges, Cloyſters and Nunneries beyond the Seas, from whence it never returns to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in any kind; therefore if this<note place="margin">Two Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which are both pr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.</note> miſchief cannot be prevented, yet it muſt be eſteemed and ſet down as a cleer loſs to the Kingdome, except (to ballance this) we will imagine that as great a value may perhaps come in from forraign Princes to their Penſioners here for Favours or Intelligence, which
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42437:113"/>
ſome States account good Policy, to purchaſe with great Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the receipt whereof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is plain Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>There are yet ſome other petty things which ſeem to have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this Ballance, of which the ſaid Officers of His Majeſties Cuſtoms can take no notice, to bring them into the accompt. As namely, the expences of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailers, the gifts to Ambaſſadors and Strangers, the fraud of ſome rich goods not entred into the Cuſtom-houſe, the gain which is made here by Strangers by change and re-change, Intereſt of mony, enſurance upon Engliſh mens goods and their lives: which can be little when the charges of their living here is deducted; beſides that the very like advantages are
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42437:113"/>
as amply miniſtred unto the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in forraign Countreys, which doth counterpoize all theſe things, and therefore they are not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the drawing up of the ſaid Ballance.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> The concluſion upon all that hath been ſaid, concerning the Exportation or Importation of Treaſure.</head>
               <p>THe ſum of all that hath been ſpoken, concerning the enriching of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and th' encreaſe of our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by commerce with ſtrangers, is briefly thus. That it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rule in our forraign trade, in thoſe places where our commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities exported are overballanced in value by forraign wares brought into this Realm, there
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42437:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our mony is undervalued in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; and where the contrary of this is performed, there our mony is overvalued. But let the Merchants exchange be at a high rate, or at a low rate, or at the <hi>Par propari,</hi> or put down altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Let Forraign Princes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance their Coins, or debaſe their Standards, and let His Majeſty do the like, or keep them conſtant as they now ſtand; Let forraign Coins paſs current here in all payments at higher rates than they are worth at the Mint; Let the Statute for employments by Strangers ſtand in force or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; Let the meer Exchanger do his worſt; Let Princes oppreſs, Lawyers extort, Uſurers bite, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals waſt, and laſtly let Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants carry out what mony they ſhall have occaſion to uſe in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42437:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
traffique. Yet all theſe actions can work no other effects in the courſe of trade than is declared in this diſcourſe. For ſo much Treaſure only will be brought in or carried out of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as the Forraign Trade doth over or under ballance in value. And this muſt come to paſs by a Neceſsity beyond all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. So that all other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (which tend not to this end) howſoever they may ſeem to force mony into a Kingdom for a time, yet are they (in the end) not only fruitleſs but alſo hurtful: they are like to violent flouds which bear down their banks, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly remain dry again for want of waters.</p>
               <p>Behold then the true form and worth of forraign Trade, which is, <hi>The great Revenue of the King
<pb facs="tcp:42437:115"/>
The honour of the Kingdom, The Noble profeſsion of the Merchant, The School of our Arts, The ſupply of our wants, The employment of our poor, The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Lands, The Nurcery of our Mariners, The walls of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, The means of our Treaſure, The Sinnews of our wars, The terror of our Enemies.</hi> For all which great and weighty reaſons, do ſo many well governed States highly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the profeſsion, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cheriſh the action, not only with Policy to encreaſe it, but alſo with power to protect it from all forraign injuries: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know it is a Principal in Reaſon of State to maintain and defend that which doth Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them and their eſtates.</p>
